that's it Wow a to count from Youngjae me Gregory how are you fella Joe Rogan's always a pleasure to be back in but I love is that you kept this studio the same as the old one because the vibe was perfect I tried to recreate it yeah as long as we had the desk we have the heart yeah we have the heart of the studio the rest of it is just stuff and Jamie the heart Jamie yeah there's some about I really think that when you use a desk for a long time there's something about desks like if you found out like a hunter at Thompson's desks was for sale yeah you'd be like holy shit I want to get my hands on that yeah like that's got some ooze right you know he'd rode on this holy shit yeah nice old one of those old like railway station roll topdesk's all those the best yeah I got to protect my shit while I'm out so nobody reads my church one of my all-time favorite photos of him was him typing in Big Sur like sitting on like this this outside table typing I think he's on the edge of a cliff or something like that in the background you see the water yeah you know that photo Jamie yeah that's it right there yeah look at that and with the pipe yeah that is one of the most iconic writing photos of all time Hunter s Thompson with hair yeah with a typewriter in front of the water at Big Sur in probably like 1960 something and you know his schedule you read his schedule his daily schedule not only did I read it he lived I read it on air and I might have read it on air with you yeah I think he did a self-portrait hello so he took the picture himself oh so this is what it's listed as this is him big sir that was when he was in the early stages of his chen√© that was like right around when he was writing Hells Angels probably yeah 61 yeah that motherfucker was unique yeah did you ever see his documentary now there's a couple of really good ones but um the the one that was the mainstream one what was that so yeah gonzo yeah it was called gonzo and then there was uh there was another one that was made by BBC that's really good too but yeah if you get hold us fucking Hemingway's desk Wow yeah anyway maybe like it's worth too much like you wouldn't want to write on it yeah that's true you know it's Hemingway's desk yeah whose hunters desk I'd totally write on it well first you scrape the excess coke off the table just lick it look at our wipe the jism from the underside of the table get the bad sauce off the sides yeah what about its typewriter how much you think it's typewriter yeah Hemingway's house and hangouts preserved in Havana Wow so they preserved where he lived and I wonder if that's where he killed himself I think he was in Cuba when he killed himself Wow yeah man his um his style of writing and like that whole bravado that went with him he was a different cat it was like a you thought of him as like an aggressive male writer like that's an odd thing like Hemingway right you know he was aggressive yeah it wasn't I mean even Stephen King for all his most horrific depictions of violence and gore and and terror in his books he's not thought of as like this imposing physical thing well Hemingway was in the war yeah you know yeah he had elderly age he was uh he used to go skiing in the winter in I think it was Switzerland and they would all there was no chair less back then so you would fucking gray your 50-pound skis and walk up the side of the Alps Jesus cry like a half a day to take one fucking around and he would do that every day that must be amazing for you yeah god damn the kind of exercise like carrying skis uphill in the snow yeah that's an incredible exercise like I bet they were jacked I bet those skiers from the olden days yeah there had to be like crazy athletes yeah and the skis were long back down they were like twice as long as they are now when did anybody figure out a ski lift I don't know but I mean Hemingway would have been skiing in what the 1930s 1827 goddamn dude yeah the walk uphill and ski down you got to be dedicated how good are you ever gonna get I mean normally you do in a day maybe you do a dozen runs going up a couple miles and this one you do one run that's it yeah you got to be dedicated try getting a like a lazy person to do that lazy people will ski you know I mean because you just kind of get into it and you can glide you died you died yeah you don't have to like get crazy you're right you can just ski like I'm not good so I ski like a lazy person yeah I just like don't fall don't fall don't fall don't fall that's literally me skiing because I've had knee surgery at three months is crazy it's crazy how quickly you can fuck up your body skiing I am so I've skied my whole life I've never had an injury and I ski hard I hit every fucking jump I can find you might be the only one that I know that like my friend Matt he broke his ankle or he broke his ankle and happened in the course of like just a year yeah two friends at school parents at school blew out their ACLs Wow yeah I don't want to do that when you're 43 you don't right that's the thing as you get to a certain age you the risk reward because injuries take so much longer to heal yeah and you have so much less time to live you just the math doesn't work anymore you know to ski you've got to protect your knees if you can yeah your knees are so goddamn important whenever people have like hurt knees and they keep working out I always cringe yeah like yeah I'm not gonna get it fixed I'm just gonna rehab it what do you we were you talking about rehabbing you know rehabbing you just gonna ignore the fact you don't have an ACL yeah like rehabbing yeah who's he gonna fix it's not gonna be you don't have the stability in your knee so there's a lot of guys who blow it out and they keep exercising they just chew the inside of their knee apart yeah yeah I got something going on in my the inside of my left knee for two fucking months if I try to squat down it kills there's like a tendon on the inside of the knee and so I'm gonna start some physical therapy this week to try to figure it out because I can't I haven't exercised in fucking two months just because of this one thing what am I gonna do no I do more cardio I don't really lift that much have you um ever thought about getting like PRP or regeni keen or anything into it oh now what's that well PRP is platelet-rich plasma and what they do is they take your blood and there's some sort of a process they do and they separate it and then they take this platelet-rich plasma and they inject it into the wounded area and accelerates healing yeah a lot of people have really good results with that yeah and then there's this stuff called Regina Keene that's like platelet-rich plasma but it's apparently the next step up and what they do is they heat your blood and by heating it it produces something I'm for sure if you're a doctor I'm so sorry they don't butcher in this if you're a scientist but I think it produces some sort of anti-inflammatory serum because your blood is reacting to the heat right here's the explains I've had this done and it was really effective really yeah see removed from the lair and cultured with glass beads so that a white blood white blood cells produce IRAP which is a natural anti-inflammatory glass beads going into your knee I don't understand what that saying it says serum is removed from this layer and cultured with glass beads so it's removed after the platelet-rich plasma so they make you rich plasma they get to zero and then they and then they culture it so that the white blood cells produced this natural anti-inflammatory tricked the white blood cells I guess maybe for lack of a better word anyway so this shit it's really good for accelerating your recovery process for an injury like a lot of people like to do it like while the if they get surgery they get surgery then they have some of this done to it accelerates the healing right especially as you get older just provides you with any it's actually natural to you'd have to worry about it but it provides you with this just an extra boost of healing yeah for weird neck injuries and back injuries people like it for its right really good for lower back injuries I'll have it is inflammation you know and so then they do they is it local they shoot the blood into the area yeah Sarah yeah it's freaky they put this little needle in you and then they screw the blood cap in there it's a it's like now it's yellow it's like this yellow serum they squirted it into your back damn it's weird yeah that's weird I think they would do my cock for you but I want your blood in my cock dude I don't know if that's legal you can sell all kinds of things right but you can't sell somebody your own blood is that right I don't think so do you think you could sell your own blood I mean if you don't like a blood bank right sure there's a website you could probably do yeah if you think so Oh like a dark web yeah like you know and that whole myth about selling peoples yeah sure William Shatner would be doing it if he could no no think you could just like if someone was selling blood like some you know there's a lot of those young enterprising young gals on the internet that sell like dirty socks oh yeah they sell toenail clips and shit I'm not kidding yeah nothing nothing goes to waste no nothing goes for blood for sale India's illegal red market what is this Jim oh this is like this is uh they're doing it like medically though in an alleyway yeah but that's how they do it there and that's crazy art is there still a ban on Haitian people and gay people giving blood that's a very good question because they've they've gotten so close to stopping HIV and they can get it like not it correct me if I'm wrong they can get it like to you to the point where you're you can't even detect it oh yeah which is incredible yeah and then now in the third world cuz my my friend Peter current he lives in Zimbabwe and no Mozambique and he used to work for the health department in LA County he was the guy that was in charge of AIDS prevention and so he got a job working over in Africa and he said that you can now cure not cure but stabilize somebody with HIV with a pill that's like $60 a month or something like that Wow yeah they've got the price way down in Africa now that's incredible why is there's so many cases of HIV in Africa well I think when nutrition is poor and there's more cutting and bleeding because I had heard that a lot of what you see in terms of like if they're talking about AIDS in Africa that you think it's very easy to put aids I put like that category aids that sometimes it's people with damaged immune systems from a host of different diseases huh that it's sometimes the people aren't getting tested I was wondered like how many those people are tested for HIV right right what is but the the fact that a guy like Magic Johnson has had it since remembered when you heard Magic Johnson and I was in a panic yeah I felt like it was a zombie movie like it's happened it started and then people are just gonna get it we're all gonna die of AIDS everybody went our generation when you and I were like 21 that's what everybody thought it was gonna die from AIDS right now Magic Johnson's looks great yes still alive yep I think how many people have died who didn't have HIV and we're worried about this one thing I remember he wanted to play any all-star game and all the players were like now I'm good it's gonna be a slam dunk contest with this dude Jesus Christ but what did what did fucking damon wayans used to have a bit about Dennis Rodman did this about Dennis Rodman spitting in Magic Johnson's mouth to accelerate his symptoms he's like if if he wanted to try to get hardcore with them I hope he did Damon's I'm a huge Damon Wayans fan so I hope I'm not butchering his bit yeah but I think that was one of I know that was his line I'll spit your mouth accelerate your symptoms dude I'm Damon Wayans my opinion is like one of the most ignored greats I agree 100% I used to open for him sometimes and twice I remember him coming in on a Thursday night it was Thursday to Sunday Fanueil Hall comedy connection Thursday night he comes in fucking yellow pads he goes up and just regurgitates a new hour and gets okay laughs for a new hour Friday night he comes back tighter tighter Sunday night it's like he would fucking destroy with a new hour it was crazy he's really good man yeah he would go out he would just go up at the Comedy Store and literally let whatever thought came into his head and he would take long sets and he would take that stuff and he would turn that stuff into killer clothes and bits yeah but for whatever reason I think he just got into doing sitcoms more right I was like yeah fuck it yeah you know yeah he's uh he's that's interesting family man they you know they grew up in the projects in Manhattan dude talented in that family yeah Keenan Damon Marlon Shawn like Jesus Christ yeah that's a lot of cams and it isn't Damon's son doing stand-up tuna yeah dude Damon jr. right what a crazy family I know that's a crate you better be in show business in that fair we are you doomed yeah we think about that it's like right like if you want to compete with your brothers Keenen Ivory Wayans Damon Wayans Kim wins Shawn Wayans Marlin wins Damian Dante wins Damon Wayans Jr that's all of them yeah all of them in show business it's amazing yeah good luck until Keenan had a fucking great talk show hell yeah yeah great writers he was really good as a talk show yes yeah he was it's a talented fucking family man yeah but for whatever reason man Damon did this one HBO special and I think he called it his last stand and it was really good man it was really good and the end of it he just throws the microphone down and says like this is the last time I'm doing stand-up oh no shit yeah Wow just like a decide he was gonna do movies that's it last stand with a question mark you know he got um you know he just got into other stuff but I'm telling you man when he was like go up and above go that photo though the one like that was the stage the beret-wearing stage yeah dude I'm telling you people forgot he's one of the best Kent one of the best ever dude he would murder that one particular special it's just murderous he had a lot of great sets yeah on television but just like real original to like one of those guys where you'd watch I mean you'd go god damn why didn't I think of that well and his voices were so fucking good you know a lot of times people do their girlfriend voice and it's just it just sucks it just sounds like the guy raising his voice there's no like right female intonation to it or anything and his kids voices and his wife will a girlfriend were just fucking amazing yeah yeah there and then of course it's like put your prize collection prior said yeah I mean you had so many characters in living color how about handyman you could never do that yeah that's right you could never do that yeah a homeless guy dude that's another show in living color is another show that people forget they forget how good it was yeah yeah there is this handyman they don't even show reruns of that show do that you know reruns a handyman yeah I remember what it was on TV man no one could stop saying homey don't play that yeah everybody would say that everybody was like homey don't play that like every kid would say that yeah cuz homey the clown homey don't play that people forgot people fucking forgot about homey the clown they should come back Netflix please throw some money at gettin back on the air they just tried to do it and it all fell apart what happened I know they had big money and I don't know if who's gonna be the original cast I might have been part of the original cast I bet what happened was Jennifer Lopez didn't want to be a Fly Girl Yeah right she's like no she should jump on that shit that well she jumped back in was a Fly Girl again I mean how much time would it take not that much time yeah she's there she's there he should probably could dance in her sleep yeah all right yep damn I would love that to be a fire oh yeah wonder who else was a flagrant any other famous ones dude that show was so good I remember watching it I was playing pool in Yonkers New York and I looked up at this this TV set and it was Jim Carrey doing the the the fire marshal fire marshal I was like what the fuck is going on yeah this guy's got a burnt-up face that's Rosie Perez who's the choreographer for the first four seasons you know Rosie president boxing fan oh yeah huge giant boxing huh yeah like people like she's like a boxing expert not like an expert like she could train fighters but like people asked her questions yeah about boxing she's a real enthusiast that's a better term instead of an expert I mean maybe she is an expert I don't know huh but she is always around boxing I think it's so cuz you always think of her as heaven that the cute voice and you know in all those comedies and to see her it like boxing matches really right into it so yeah yeah it's cool and Jim Carrey I mean Jesus Christ he he would do the the convenience store security guy and he was just so big and so big so different than like I mean you have to go back to Jerry Lewis to think about somebody doing physical comedy that well yeah he was he was a 10 like his energy and everything was yeah like the fucking Ace Ventura movie yeah like that movie was just all performance yeah what is this one veera de Milo do that fucking show was so good yeah people forgot yeah yeah there's fire marshal bill so I was in I was in this pool hall and I looked up I'm like what the fuck is that and they're like that's fire marshal bill that's that's what it is he came in like that I was like that is the creepy shit I've ever seen I can't believe they have a character like this it was so over the top do you think Jim Carrey or maybe that one of the Wayans brothers has bought up the rights for reruns because they don't want that blow back ya know it's a different era and you have to accept is a different era you just people were different look people are changing and it's a really interesting obvious sign that things that were super acceptable and when was this in living color I want to say it was like 92 92 94 92 94 yeah so that the way you could do certain bits and what you get away with and put on television was just different so I think that's one of the like probably one of the least understood things that's happening with us with social media is is rapid evolution of what's acceptable not acceptable in our and there's changing very quickly in terms of subjects in terms of the way you approach things in terms of like obvious bigotry or obvious bias it's like it's all getting very highlighted well I think the big question is whether or not you see an artist as somebody who's taking their inner vision and putting it out and you go for the ride or you don't or is it are we supposed to be representing society in our stand-up or is it all supposed to be fair balance representations of different ethnic groups and genders you know and it's like when did it all have to become a morality tale when did every depiction of every race have to be fair no can't you have an asshole who's black can't you have a killer who's gay without it becoming a depiction of that entire you know subgroup yeah it's like if what our real problem is that prejudice does exist so when it does exist you kind of look for it in things and you say hey this has the characteristics of prejudice I see this here I see what you're doing here that I think this is prejudice we say no no this is making fun of Puerto Rican men this is not prejudice yeah this is a an account of real occurrences that I've turned into humor yeah the the flamboyant masculinity of Puerto Rican men I mean like in New York like that's if you if you thought of a type of Latino sort of the bravado you know the music the food everything spicy yeah like if you can't make fun of that yeah come on I know Colin Quinn does the whole thing racist right Porto Ricans you never inside or outside they're always both like there's always a window open to people on the inside now start talking the car door is always open they're half in the car they're half right this isn't racist this is observation I take an observation can I tell you that yesterday about twice a week I go to this Japanese market in marvista and they've got all different kinds of you know you can get sushi Chandpur or whatever the parking lot for this place because 80% of the people there are Asian film it and put it on a fucking television channel it is it is just people why don't you produce it I could announce it like I was AJ Foyt you're an Emmy award-winning writer that could actually do something like that you're like a legit writer you could totally produce that give you a badge and announce it like Nascar it's just people like not getting how to get out of a parking spot without taking like 8 K turns and people on the wrong side of the street and backing up without looking over the shoulders and they're all Asian and it's fucking hilarious I didn't I didn't tell them to do it I didn't say it was wrong but it's happening yeah Dave explained it why it's a stereotype but why also why Asian people would be more likely to walk straight and you know like if you if you go to China or if you go to any of those Asian company Asian countries when people walk straight at each other they all kind of have this way of touching and they just there's so many people there just grinding past each other right so yeah yeah so when you're in China in particular people are like indifferent to bumping into you it doesn't bother them at all they just bump into you yeah like if you're in the aisle of a plane and they just bump into you yeah like they'll do it to little kids walk right through you all right it's just that's how they did it's not rude there's like house really different yes it's more crowded why can't you comment on that what couldn't you comment on that if that's a real thing cuz that is a real thing they do do that yeah they also do a lot of great stuff I mean it's not like you're not it's a negative judgement on the entire race because they have this one characteristic but to ignore that one characteristic seems crazy yeah it's like why can't I talk about something yeah I'm not it's not mean I'm not a bad person to talk about a real thing that you see and I see yeah like what is that I get I get booed on stage sometimes now that never used to happen for what what do you say I did a joke we don't have to say the joke but just like I'll say it I don't care because I don't think it's offensive but this but this person did and it was a you know I go oh it's girl it's Girl Scout cookie season those little whores are out there popping up the tables wherever you are selling those stale shitty overpriced cookie but you buy them because it makes you feel good like you're a good person you know and then you walk through the parking lot and some black kid comes up with a box of Snickers going hey will you support my basketball team when you're like that's a fucking scam okay goes boom they're not all skip and like that's not what we're saying stupid yeah you're doing a character I'm commenting on a very real thing my entire life I have bought Girl Scout cookies and I have not always bought that fucking Snickers bar in the subway or that sometimes I do yeah the Girl Scout cookies it's universally accepted yeah right but they only have like the ones that I like are the ones it's like a coconut one that's oh and I like chocolate on ya you know that one this one caramel and it's pronounced and watch it but that one called come off but then there's also like there's steps away from Girl Scout cookies well you don't have to participate like when kids come over with chocolate or candy yeah yeah thanks yeah good I don't eat that stuff but you kinda have to buy Girl Scout cookies you want to support the girls game yeah but you know it's such a scam all that money goes to the manufacturer apparently the Girl Scouts make like 20% of the cookie money really yeah they get fucked Girl Scouts again of course someone came in some ruthless man probably exactly what it is those are the shit yeah with milk with a cold glass of milk yeah don't come yeah fuck yeah it almost tastes look man look at it with its chocolaty coconutty goodness to be so bad for you when I was when I was working on a TV show one of the producers had a daughter who was in the Girl Scouts and I guess you win contests if you sell over if you sell the most cookies so when the audience would stream out after the show is a daily show and the audience would stream out and the girl had a table set up to sell their cookies and she was selling a hundred boxes a day and for every day she was there fucking won that contest and they would have the audience warm up guy like plug it during the show like after the shit like a comedian selling his CDs after the show you could buy some Girl Scout cookies on the way out and all these these fat people from the Midwest they're like cookies how like Marie Callender's they just have pie just pie just pie yeah not even good pie it's good but it's not great considering it's all they do I should have eaten there oh I don't think I've ever eaten there maybe I hate it one mm-hmm I don't think I had their pie that seems a weird thing like I'm selling pies yeah I'd like good luck but they're everywhere we know you know into those you know you have flour yeah branch out a little bit like who the fuck gets famous as selling pies like how genius is that company admins member enmons Entenmann's but then they they they broke out they started doing cakes and cookies too but they only they did just pies for a long time dude they used to have this this goddammit this pastry I'm trying to think of what the hell it was but it had like like hard sugar on the outside of it yeah and then it had some sort of creamy sweet stuff on the inside yeah holy shit was it good yeah god damn we lived off that shit we had Emmons every night they had like they had one that had like a chocolate filling in it and powdered outsize fill they went out of business and then they say oh that was the cheese one that was a good one too I remember that cheese filled crumb those they had some ridiculously delicious shit yeah what are the other big ones you know I decided to fight in the tournament once because I had a crazy sugar high from Dunkin Donuts I'd hurt myself I'd hurt something in my crotch I couldn't work out for like a week yeah I pulled some sort of a muscle there was a big tournament that was coming up and my all the guys that I competed with we're going on this tournament was like I had just fought like a week before I was like I don't think I can I'm like this doesn't feel right I'm just gonna take the whole week off so I decided I'm just gonna take off let this thing heal and so delivering my newspapers and I go to Dunkin Donuts and I got this powdered lemon filled donut I got one of those and I got a Boston cream don't ya got one of those and I got a I ate like three donuts cuz I'd be exhausted tired drinking coffee delivering fucking newspapers for three hours and I was so jacked on sugar and coffee that I said fuck it I want a fight and so I drove into town like right before everybody was leaving they're like why are you here I said I'm gonna fight anyway man like beavis and butt-head i won i won the tournament it's a giant tournament for me it was big was the American Open was like a big it's a big deal Wow yeah it wasn't gonna do it I got jacked up on sugar and made a rash decision I can see you winning the first match but then I let them then you crash no I'm gonna keep fighting no it didn't it worked out somehow or another I guess I ate when I got there too but also the week off I'd never done that like taking a week off sometimes when you do something like that where you if you you exercise too much you're really always in a state of recovery yeah and your body doesn't get a chance to like fully charge back up again so at the time I was probably 19 and I was going hard like every day every day that I could so I'd never really taken that week off so taking a week off and just feeling like wow this is great did take a week off when I started getting laid yeah that is one thing that happened the first time you got laid yeah when I first started getting laid hmm I took a long time off yeah yelled at yeah I wasn't doing any training I came back all tan and shit [Music] all you did was fuck that's a workout at that age that's a workout I'm you know those weren't 20-minute sessions it's weird how your your body changes from no no urge to fuck to like fucking is your whole life yeah like when you're 18 years old it's your whole life like you found the craziest drug ever yeah and like two years ago it wasn't in your life yeah then also that's in your life it all said you're having sex yeah I can't believe this yeah and you can't believe that with that women are letting you do it because for years they were stopping you and now they're initiating yes can believe they want it you actually want me to fuck you yeah this is what you like yeah okay yeah feels wrong but if you insist it feels wrong that you like it is that weird mentality that we think it's wrong that they like it is that a Christian they so crazy I think it has to do with initially if you read sex at dawn he's got a really interesting series of thoughts on the origins of sexual behavior and why why we all sort of adopted this one thing now it's what do you think let me ask you I think it's Christian I know it is for me you know I got a lot of hate I got a lot shame about all that stuff I think it has to do with people getting pregnant too yeah I think it had to do with it was too easy for a girl to get pregnant and if a girl got pregnant back when people were fucking just barely making that out of the caves right it was either really good cuz you had food or it was a real burden because you had to take care of this baby now you're not gonna be gathering food for us right I think there was a lot of that going on so if you were gonna be with a person and you've decided to make babies you got to be sure that this person is gonna be there and take care of everything and you're all set up yeah so you can't just be banging a bunch of guys on the side and having kids with everybody then who's gonna raise your kids right this guy is going to come over and talk to his kid and he's gonna come over talk to his kid yeah that becomes a problem right I think that's and the amazing thing is that having kids back then for guys the reason why guys stuck around was you know we have 401 K is an IRA accounts back then it's like when you when you couldn't gather anymore you were at the mercy of charity and so if you had a lot of kids you had a chance of being able to actually live into your old age yeah yeah they would take care of you yeah it's also interesting too because there was so much infant mortality back then that there was a lot of places where there's real good evidence that they had fertility cults like they were trying to figure out ways to get pregnant more and easier they're trying to have a bunch of kids yeah because kids were you know kids died a lot yeah then yeah that died from injury and sickness and a lot of people died from sickness you know no vaccines right and you just hit the mercy and then also it's the beginning of Agriculture so all these diseases are emerging that we don't have immune systems for because they're being they're being jumped from like they're jumping from pigs to people they're jumping from chickens and birds to people that's where the source of most of these pandemic diseases come from it comes from large-scale agriculture yeah those funky pigs all tucked together in these little cages that doesn't come for free yeah like there's a some demons are being brewed in that mix oh yeah yeah like this this what was this what was the source of the Spanish flu which I think was the most deadly epidemic in the US history oh is that right it was international - revenue was international for sure I think for sure was the most deadly epidemic in the u.s. yeah but I think he came I don't think it came from Spain I think I want to say it came from somewhere around Virginia is that bullshit this is gonna take time probably New Jersey I feel like he came from some sort of farm situation yeah I don't know why I'm I feel like I'm guessing that I'm surprised it's not more of that now because you see some of these like pig farms and they have links there are lakes of waste have you seen the drone footage is that what we're talking about now oh my god some guy flew it you know because they have these ag-gag laws which apparently one of them just got shot down somebody sent me an email that someone maybe was Idaho or Iowa one of those places one of those AI states that uh the ag-gag laws got shut down the ag-gag laws are say if you were working in a slaughterhouse and you saw horrific conditions you got your cell phone out you filmed it you could get prosecuted you would go to jail you could be sued because of foodie can all those documentaries that came out well it's the I think those AG gag laws existed as soon as they figured out that people could film things yeah you know because a few people released videos of her and it looked those AG gag laws kept you know kept people from talking about a lot of creepy shit like this video yeah have you see this video this guy decided since no one's gonna give him access to film the place openly he's gonna fly over it so he flew over with a drone Spanish flu thing okay for many years medical historians and epidemiologists hypothesize that the outbreak could have started in a British army base in Etta place France or at Fort Riley in Kansas where the first American cases of the new strain of flu were recorded in March of 1918 more recently experts have experts have proposed a third hypothesis the Spanish flu originated somewhere in northern China in late 1917 and swiftly moved to Eastern Europe within a hundred and forty thousand Chinese laborers and the French and British governments recruited to perform manual labor to free up the troops for wartime duty Wow yeah I think more people died of that than they dead then died in World War one v 750 million people were killed because of this damn whoa just think about course is low here of 50 million people reclaiming look at this it says claiming more lives in a single year than either the First World War or the four year long black death bubonic plague outbreak that swept Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages and this is one that for whatever reason people talk about the plague they talk about the bubonic plague everyone's here but no one talks about the Spanish flu like that's a rare it's not it doesn't get brought up that often if you see this number this number of people die 50 million people in a year in a year man people talk about how bad it is right now but it's not they're saying they're saying it killed more lives in a single year than either the first world war or the four-year long black death any bugs may have killed it may have one third of the population was sick with it they did not die god damned i mean you people think that the world is in such bad shape we don't have plagues you know there's a the the poverty rate for the the average poverty rate in the world has gone up for like the last ten years there's less poverty those less starvation there's more education you know there's a lot of there's a lot of good shit going on too but just think about that we haven't had a world war in what seventy years yeah yeah it's been it's been quite a while not to say not to diminish the wars that are happening now but something that really affected you know the entire population always feel like even since high school though it's always been like around the corner yeah like it was when we were in high school was the big fears that we're gonna go to war with the Russians do you remember going into the coat room and putting your head between your knees did you have to do that I don't think we did that we used to do this we did that get under the desk drill yeah hilarious get out of the desk like which is a nuclear war do these to tell you you're gonna hit on your desk okay as if they had some way to alleviate our stress yeah an attending all right get under the desk I want to give you an answer yeah yeah nobody knew what the fuck to do so they just made up some nonsense let's get under your desk everyone Duck and Cover nuclear war that linoleum is gonna save your life yeah look at this this is the drill all these little kids underneath their tables what a fucked up thing to put in the kid's head man yeah just stop and think about how close we were to doing something so stupid that this could have become a reality and how now think about how this is a reality in certain parts of the world like in in our place it's not but in other places it is yeah and that's that's their life I mean especially when it comes to things like drone warfare that freaks me out I know it's very effective at shooting terrorists I know it is I know it's excellent it's also super effective at killing civilians mmm super effective yeah and there's something about when you think about how we're being perceived in the rest of the world is something about not even being present for the accidental killing that makes it just you know twice as bad it just seems weird and apparently it gives them pretty severe PTSD yeah you know I'm laughing because I'm like thinking like that's so crazy like they don't even have to be there and they're getting PTSD like just the fact that they're doing it from yeah I heard that right islets are freaking out there some of them yeah I'm by the way this is just what I'm reading might not even be true now I read that sensationalized but I would imagine that would kind of fuck with your head yeah the first couple times would be fun you'd be like a video game and then you and then would start to sink in when you heard when you heard the reports later yeah you'd have to so detach yourself from it that it would be like this growing thing in the back of your mind yeah you just launching missiles into apartment buildings and they're telling you it's okay everybody says it's okay yeah it's what you're supposed to do when I talked to this gentleman that I know that was in the CIA he said that all those decisions are done by lawyers how really yeah whether or not they do it or not do it because at the end of the day lawyers are deciding whether or not it's like likely to be successful with the legal ramifications he goes when you're talking about that kind of stuff he's like seriously a lot of it's decided by lawyers because they want to not have if you should elaborate AddThis deciding and yeah yeah and they want to make sure that all the Ducks are in order yeah which I mean is that better was at worse I mean is it better just leave it to the generals to design you know you get this cartoonish impression of what that would be like some general like the fucking guy from Avatar yeah that's what everybody's worried about right look at the character the the cartoonish out of control murderous soldier yeah it was the Kubrick movie Oh Full Metal Jacket no the one with the Peter Sellers was in it and it was about how I how I something the nuclear bomb oh yes dr. strange yeah like the general and that yes yeah they're always like cartoonish yeah man you better hope guys like that are on your side dr. Strangelove that was a great movie man it was so weird to watch it today yeah I watched it a few years back did you really yeah like maybe four or five years back wash it I was like wow it's so wild to watch these little captured moments in time where you can see like people were different then yeah like old movies when you watch old movies you know it's the biggest indication that something's different is women didn't work out that yeah they weren't like fit like you were used to seeing a lot of actresses that are on TV and the movies they all do like CrossFit yeah or something they're all working out they're all taking gymnastics or something or they're doing spin classes and they have trainers and doing these box jumps and shit like girls are built now it's a different thing yeah if you go look at like the King Kong look like Fay Wray and King Kong just soft they just yes they're not even picking up their groceries like this they built different yeah and they don't last if they didn't do manual labor some of them do when they do it's a shock like Raquel Welch like deep indoor cities like yeah they're still hot so Fela ran right to the end yeah it's a few of them that were so potent yeah their spell lasted there their entire existence has just started this Jane Fonda workout though yeah Vonda back in the day with the doggie thing what was that like 1970s that was so fucking big it was the first time women were marketed to for exercise I think so I think so I think before that women maybe competed in athletic events like fantasticks and shit like that when they were young but then when they probably got families or moved on to jobs they probably stopped was this one general aerobic championship oh my God look at this is a choreographed dance this is so strange Wow that's right do you remember aerobics everything I'm gonna take an aerobics class yeah remember that kind of people just dance around and you would do stuff feel the pop the pop and two and three and go they turn everybody gay for about five years all these guys look at these guys these guys are straight as fuck and they don't even know they're doing gay stuff you know it's like it's like when before everybody knew that Rob Halford from Judas Priest is gay he used to make everybody dress up like him because everybody like kids that were straight kids there were huge fans at Judas Priest they would wear the cap and the check wearing gay aesthetic like gay biker-looking tough-guy stuff everybody got into it because they loved him cuz judas ids are so badass and he's such a fucking awesome frontman that like he had straight guys dressing up like a gay bike that's fucking hilarious and then he comes out and they're all like what this so confused he pitted at a concert there's a hundred yeah no I'm just saying what he did and they look down in there fuck what you're wearing is what I like in my men I had him on a show I did once I was uh like this thing for vh1 called the list oh yeah I did that you did it too yeah here he is look at that I mean look at the outfit bro seriously Wow did the leather paper boy hat on yep it's more a soldier's hat and he's got leather vest on with no shirt underneath leather gloves at spikes all S&M shit yeah tight tight tight leather pants it's hilarious take Freddie Mercury yeah man what was my point well we're talking about something right before we're talking about that oh the aerobics oh yeah the aerobics guys like come on man they had dudes wearing singles look at this look at this outfit this that's like a singlet from wrestling but with long pants yeah this is bananas that they got man a dress like this look what they're wearing if you see their nipples like their nipples are popped out they're all super gay doubtlessly this three-quarter length Reebok high-tops exactly with the velcro you how to get the velcro that's the newest technology yeah so look every girl is dressed like you know I guess they look more like wow they have two different outfits the girls have some of them exposed the mid-drift yeah like the dirty girls that they are and the other ones they were a one-piece Oh Alan Thicke was hosting this motherfucker oh shit course he was oh shit look at him look at that hair it's wonderful look at this jacket solve Miami Vice doubt yeah he's got shoulder pads yeah get rid of shoulder pads back then you could have shoulder pads hey I remember having shoulder pads in my first jacket it's nice makes you look better yeah like a stuffed bra for a girl is yeah it's the same thing yeah yeah but how weird the people so do you remember people actually dressing like that in a class situation did they go to classes dress like that we had uniforms and stuff so now I'd see if I never took an aerobics class but see if you could find video footage of an aerobics classes if all the guys a dress like that those dudes got Punk'd yeah somebody talked him into dressing like a dancer yeah yeah and they're not showing their kids this video why not stupid so what if you're stupid once you're stupid forever what's not real come on and your kids love seeing you looking stupid too and you should tell him I had a mullet they laugh one thing that I always do when I told my kids they did something wrong they've done something wrong I say I did worse way worse I did exactly what you did and I lied about it I always lied my parents asked me if I did anything wrong I always lied and I'm like I know if you did something you didn't do it I'm not mad at you I'm just trying to make you not do it in the future because I want you to learn why it's bad yeah that's good that's good a number one thing I always do right and I get mad sometimes I mean it's just there's we can't they sometimes especially as they get older they get upset about things and you got to calm down you're gonna figure out how to calm down stop screaming at each other yeah sisters scream at each other you took my thing that's fine yeah it's not you gave it to me no but I can take it back it's amazing the pitch they can get because usually when people get that hostile to each other you you you're worried there's gonna be a physical fight but but sisters can take it to three times that level it makes you so uncomfortable but then they'll look cuddle with each other yeah it's funny that's sweet serious difference two years yes interesting watching them evolve like watching them learn new facts and learn new things and watch their little brain fill with information their vocabulary starts growing yeah like wow yeah and you realize like I mean I've said this before but it bears repeating we look at people in a static state we're always looking at people like oh I see a guy and he's 40 years old he's an asshole oh that's that 40 year old asshole that fucking guy I know that guy that guy's so annoying but you don't think oh that was a baby yeah that was a baby with a bunch of shitty data thrown at him a bunch of shitty interactions bad genes bad environment maybe some alcoholism yeah maybe some throw it in all of it right al ADHD bad nutrition and throw it all in there throw it on there a bunch of bad breaks and life throw it all in there you know and that happens to so many people so you look at him instead of I I always like look at what they are now this guy but what they are all of them including you and me is a baby that became an older thing you know and a great deal of people whose lives are chaotic Lee fucked up it's through no fault of their own it's a great deal of them it's a large number right you know and as I've gotten older and tried to be more compassionate and more our more understanding more patient those are things that have worked on a lot you know I still struggle with it but it's I don't think it's anything you ever really totally get over but you get better you get I've seen it in you a lot over the years you're a lot more patient yeah I think a lot of that has to do with just getting better at being a person and then when you work on it but I think I'll also a lot of it has to do with my the change of my attitude about people and that I started to think of them as a product of a lot of different interactions and that we like you hear the term white privilege it's a fucked up term right it's weird but you have to admit if you're a person and nothing completely catastrophic has happened to you and you became this 50 year old successful comedian it's an Emmy award-winning writer and like yeah bad things happen to you right but they could have been fucking way worse it could have been way worse and for some people it is fucking way worse they just got a shit roll of the dice from the jump and it's been bad experience after bad experience and fucking abuse and violence and jail and you can't get out there's no way out you can't even read she's like you're for autumn around at sea trying to keep your head above water yeah and you run into them when they're 32 at a gas station and it's as much it's I mean it's not saying it's not their fault because whenever someone does anything to you it's their fault like if someone commits violence on you they shouldn't have done that it's their fault we that's agreed but what were the underlying factors that led this to happen and for all this talk that we do in this country about about violence and crime and the problem of violence and crime nobody ever looks at it in terms of like how do you stop children from being raised fucked-up and violent stop them from being abused how you step in you that because that's the root of all of it right and I think early childhood education can make a big difference because if you have a kid growing up and you know the dad took off there's no money he's living on the streets if you can create an environment for that four year old to come in and have two decent meals a naptime some structured play it makes all the difference in the world because that can become like the family to them now let me ask you this because this is the we're in the the biggest crisis in terms of immigration in terms of national discussion the biggest discussion of it than I can ever remember right now with this wall shit where the government is completely shut down and no one's budging on either side and all these government workers are not getting paid and some because Trump wants five billion dollars for this wall I'm not let's just in an ideal world it would be ideal if the way the world worked was the way America works well you could just go ever you want that be the ideal world if the whole world was America in the sense of you can go to New Mexico you don't have to get paperwork signed you don't have to no one has to tell you whether or not you're allowed to go visit or not go visit yeah you just drive there that's that's a nice thing about America it's almost like Europe but you don't need a passport not in it's like Europe I know you guys have been around longer and all that good stuff that's not what I mean I mean in terms of there's a bunch of different feels yeah it's all speaking one language but there's a big difference between visiting Montana and visiting Miami you know if you go to Billings Montana and hang out with the local folk at a coffee shop and then you go to some fucking crazy after artis After Hours party in Miami on Miami Beach at 4:00 in the morning and P Diddy shows up yeah fuckin you know and there's all these celebrities and people are doing coke on the floor and like what the fuck is this this is a different world yeah there's a different world and there's a bunch of these different world New York cities is it four world you know la is a different world you're allowed to go there it wouldn't it be great if the whole world was like that you could just kind of go wherever you wanted to go and they would all sort itself out the idea is you can't because it would fuck up our quality of life it would make us less safe and I get the argument certainly you don't want to bring in criminals and murderers you don't want drug dealers making their way into this country and starting gang violence and all that stuff yes you're absolutely right and to deny that I think it's pretty fucking foolish yeah I think it's a matter of like there's a lot to it it's a fluid the border is always gonna be fluid and it needs to be fluid you know we need em the immigrant spirit of coming in and a lot of them do start small businesses went you know and again when they're brought in legally and so how do you how do you create a flow of people that is good for us because they say most of the immigrants that come here are the smartest sharpest people most driven and wherever they're from so we're actually drawing a really good you know they talk so much about the criminals but the truth is most of them that are coming over here are the ones that probably have the most to offer to this country well exactly like our parents generation like our grandparents like my grandparents like when did your your grandparents come over here was it your grandparents in 1810 my grandparents yeah mine as well your grandfather was one of 13 and 12 of them came over here and they lived in a two-room fucking mud hut somehow they kept finding the money to send one kid over at a time like usually when they're about 15 crazy shit yeah see that kind of shit is what I'm talking about like those kind of people shouldn't they be allowed to come here that's that's how this thing got started the real problem is that there's spots that suck that's the real problem it's like we were talking about like white privilege the white privilege is not the problem the problem is racism racism doesn't exist and everyone's exactly the same and then we're okay and then you don't need to worry about white privilege what the real problem you're not getting you're not getting racist things thrown at you the way black people are yeah for sure but that's not the problem the problem is racist things being thrown at black people something I don't get it right say you get it right and it's like to highlight the fact that it's not happening to me I get what you're saying but the real problem it's a distraction that the real problem is the racism itself the real problem is the when you see actual Nazis mm-hmm in 2018-2019 actual ones real ones like not not just dressing up because they think it's a hoot you know I'm rebel I'm a fucking hero I got a piece of tape under my nose this is fucking people that aren't really Nazis but they're dumb yeah right but then you see a real Nazi in 2019 you're like okay that's real racism yeah now when they go into like I was in Portland and they said there's regular clashes like once a month there's a demonstration and it's either the alt-right having a demonstration and then the what do they call them something far and Tifa and t4 show up and they have regular fights and it's fucking Nazis goddamn Oregon's a fucked up state because it was originally there were no black people allowed in Oregon yeah that's the that's the you know cuz now Portland is this very progressive super super for Esav but there's no black people there so we'll see you there RAC feels little Hollow that went here they're runnin shit I just did New Year's Eve shows there and they were they were it was all white it was all white it was weird that is weird they're done if I was black I would go to Portland a second you'd have so many friends instantly for dinner it's um yeah the real problem for sure is any kind of discrimination because that also fucks with us too because if if people are discriminating against people we can't even make fun of them now we have to leave em alone punching down like but it's right there when you think about as a stand of what your topics are race racism sexuality politics don't do politics I know I would say that the the average comic is talking about two topics racism and sexuality I think you did a great job of covering politics without actually being political you do a great job with that you're Hillary Clinton bet yeah i yeah I did this thing during the election about her and I didn't mean it to knock her but it really wasn't about not anybody it was about her having a dry pussy and you know that's the kind of political economy you can expect for me it was also about countdown till Trump calls her a cunt yeah it was my favorite line about the election dude I did that I did the dry Khan jokes about her and then Drew Carey was in the audience and he came up to me after the show he gave me an entire piece of paper with more jokes on that premise he had tears in his eyes like that's the funniest thing I've ever seen here take these he loves filth drew carey's winning nicest guys yeah ever yeah he's great I met him at the improv and dude he talks to everybody he was given young comics advice telling them write a joke a day just one joke a day yeah you get one joke a day so you get advice once a week you got seven jokes yeah make yourself ready joke yeah it's right you're right his joke yesterday no I wrote some shit that wasn't funny that's right some shit yeah we didn't you and I did a store together last night yeah and the last night I came home wrote yeah yeah I'm just in this stage of a couple of these bits that I'm working on right now where them they're just like they're on Bambi legs yeah they'll go south on me yeah just lose the script yeah it's um it's interesting because when you go from doing a special and then chucking everything out and starting from scratch it's the most fun time yeah cuz you're like look you're a beginner again you thinking about it all the time yeah I'd like after dinner I've got a half hour I'm like I want to get back to that bit yeah yeah you think you're thinking about it all the time yeah like you're thinking about bits all the time whereas once you have an act together and you do you do an hour 20 minutes easy then you're not thinking about it that much thinking about when you do it are you thinking about it when you're right but you're not thinking about it all day no you're tweaking it in in motion like when you're on stage and you've got the hour down that's when we you and I were talking about comedian you just told to take a little extra time before they do this special yeah and it really isn't that extra few months that you find emphasizing this syllable mm-hmm makes the joke get an applause break instead of just laughs it's also one of the most interactive or forms ever whereas you need other people to do it you need other people to watch there's no way I can do that without you without people listening watching whatever it is I can't you can't do it man you need them because they help you make it their reactions to what you're saying tightens up what you're saying maybe their reactions to make you throw away certain parts just aren't working right yeah you think it's funny they don't think it's funny like how many times do they not think it's funny before you decide that part might not to be that good holy construe this part this part seems to have fruit to it this is part this is the part that kills I didn't even expect this part to work but this part become a bigger part of the bit than the first part and then weird stuff starts branching off but I don't think branches off in front of people yeah it's weird no it really is interesting if if you could track a comedian writing a bit a good comic who really takes on a premise like you do like take on a thought or a philosophy and step it out as far as it can possibly go and walk track that person doing that set for six months it can morph to where this almost nothing left from the original premise all the time yeah yeah sometimes I'll take an old joke and I'll use it as a scaffolding like when I'm writing again and I've got no like I'm trapped and I'm like a kind of no way to get from this bit to it but I got an old joke I'm gonna shove a old joke in now mm-hmm and then from that like the little burst that you get out of that will carry you on and make this the next premise better it's got a little bit more momentum to it and now you can explore it a little light-headed a little light-hearted a little little easier less tense yeah because the new stuff I think about it that fucks me up the most is that I'm not exactly sure what's the best way to do it so I'm thinking about while I'm saying it instead of just being in the moment right until I until you can just get it to the point where you can be in the moment it's just clunky yeah because it's clunky you're nervous and because you're nervous you're thinking about it all the time yeah so it becomes like this obsession so if I feel like more premises start popping up that way it's weird it's like you have this hyper focus that's way less comfortable than being like having an hour and 20 down yeah ready to film yeah it's a way less comfortable but it's probably more productive in terms of like creatively course but I was I always think of like it's like learning a new language every time I have a new bit it's like how do I translate this thought in my head into like you said what's my approach what's my strategy to get that idea across yeah and so you're thinking about that and it slows down you yeah you're not in the moment as much I think I'm gonna start doing some real late night sets too yeah that's a good idea I think you gonna do tired people like 13 people in the room you gotta try those those little spots out too you can get a little too used to doing crowds and if you're little to use do and crowds what happens is people would want to laugh yeah they want to laugh their dare to have a good time when you get it one o'clock in the morning they've already laughed they've laughed and laughed and laughed and they've laughed for hours some of them some of them get there at 9:00 and they stayed till 2:00 yeah they just get up to pee order another drink have another seat and you're watching a crazy lineup of comedians you get on at one o'clock in the morning man like the Don Barris hour that fucking the your you're getting in front of people that have seen everything yeah so if you make them laugh like that that's a legit bit yeah if you can get through to these people when they've probably heard everything well then it gets you in your voice more because when there's only 15 people out there versus 300 a couple hours earlier at 300 you're performing something out to the back of the room yeah they talk about playing to the back of the room in bigger rooms you have to be more physical you have to slow down and and then when you have 15 people all of a sudden you're in your human being talking to human beings voice yeah and sometimes that's where you can find really the flow with the joke a lot better because you're not you're not pumping it up you're just saying mmm yeah I agree but I think you have to do those larger places to just to know how to do them like they're a different thing yeah do a big theater a big theater you need to be comfortable with the fact that there's you know X and a thousands people in that room and unless you do a bunch of those like you and I have done a few of them together yeah they're fun yeah you have a time there's a timing thing that's difference you have to like wait a little longer you can't you can't beat your punchlines like one after the other like you can in a club right the club you could just keep you could keep hammering because there's only so many people in the room it won't overpower the sound system and that's why for so long Comedy Central the mandate was always they want the special shot in a nice theater like a you know 1500 mm seat or where they can get that big the crane camera shooting down and the truth is for most including myself I'm not a theater comic I'm a club comic so well sudden I shoot my special in a room that holds 1600 people and it wasn't I don't look back at it and go that's exactly how I wanted to be same yeah I was slower I was pretty I was bigger it's like I would have rather done it in a like a nice little 400 seat club also you weren't doing a lot of those places so you weren't comfortable with it like when I do those really big places once you get comfortable with it you start treating it like a club yeah like one of my most comfortable sets was one of the biggest places I ever did the Scotiabank arena in in Toronto at the end of my tour yeah but is at the end of the tour the very last spot before the Netflix special came out so I had I've been doing stand-up like real regular in these big giant ass places for months so when I got there it felt like the store felt like doing the main room yeah it's just a bigger main room all right you know you just it was just fun just have a good time yeah it's just doing a lot of those you got to do them but you really do have to do the little tiny shitty ones you got to do those 1 a.m. spots you got to do those belly room spots yeah that's a big one the belly room is a big one that's right there it is if you are not connected to them they do not laugh and if you are connected it's the greatest crowd the price there's only what 60 people in there huh something like that I also like doing alternative rooms sometimes I go to Largo I'll do up there in front of the cool kids and you know have to be a little more PC and you should have a fake act that you do only for Largo like put together actually I did Largo with Whitney a lot like Lara Lara has this question and Hardwick was on that show too and someone else maybe Adam ray now Adam Devine and um and it was a fun time and it's really fun Largo is a really interesting old place too but all those those are alt seen things like I would love if somebody did they put an act together that's only for like that crowd but it's like just onion ask enough that sneaks through you know just a really like a guy who plays like the strongest ally possible for everything for trans rights gay rights black rights women's rights yeah it's like the ultimate ally yeah yeah everything Birkenstock whatever we can do yeah whatever you do to make them a character write really good jokes write write really good jokes like that would be an interesting project almost like a Borah type project like create an alt comic yeah who's like who's really calculated who's really probably just trying to get pussy right but but puts together the right words you know if you don't support intersectionality then get the fuck out of my face yeah ya know like some and then he should try to get laid after every show as part of the care course yeah be just super sleazy with coke and needles he's got shaky bottles of bills take the pussy hat off his head and starts fucking it backstage yeah he's gonna flush like for a pussy out oh my god it'll be a hilarious character but yeah the thing about people is who are you really and when you're like when you're talking to people do you know who you are do you sure you know who you are like are you a hundred percent certain and cool and calm I don't think most of us are I think most of us are like constantly evolving the way we behave and think constantly thinking about it maybe things went wrong last night I got stopped drinking there's always like something yeah I gotta get my ass to the gym there's always something there's always something you're trying to improve and move around so if you are a person who is you know if you don't know exactly where are you coming from but you want to sell that you know where you're coming from you want people to believe you know where you're coming from then you then you get all this momentum behind you and you almost can't get away from it right you know like you're you're like you're like you see this a lot with people that are trying to be spiritual or they're always trying to sell you on the idea that they're spiritual always pushing there's this is me man this is me are you sure hmm I sure like I think who we are all of us is a lot of it is like who we've encountered and how we've interacted with those people yeah and then the uniform comes along with it and the diet there's like a whole follow this manual that you know they talk about hipsters which you know it's a pretty wide umbrella about what kind of hipsters there are but just the idea of wearing a uniform always kind of puts me off on people like you've stopped you stopped growing if you're gonna put on what all the other people that you want to be like are wearing yeah this is the thing it's like the opinions aren't necessarily wrong because they're your opinions but the thing of the the thing of any kind of ideology whether it's a hipster alt ideology or if it's a fucking conservative right-wing farmworker ideology like when people adopt those it's very little deviation yeah and a lot of times they're not even really thinking entirely about what they're saying because they just know what is gonna get the right positive reaction from their clan yeah I feel bad my mom who's you know we grew up pretty liberal family in New York my dad was in radio and he talked politics on the air and it was pretty far left reading that you know my mom worked at the New York Times he can't get any more liberal than that and so then she moved down to Florida where everybody watches Fox News in her building and they all sit around the pool and they fucking berate her because they don't agree with them and I just say good for you mom you haven't because a lot of people go down there and they're J changed their views because they are so you know intimidated by not fitting in with the it's your social group it's a different country Florida's different ya know saying American Europe yes what this is right and now you go to Florida that's a different country it is and it's it's two different countries because if not three because you've got the locals which I'd put them against Mississippi and Alabama for being deep south yes and then you've got the retirement people which is old Jews from New York and then you've got the Latino element Florida it's it's three different kinds a lot of old Italians from New York - oh yeah that's right all those people just does it fuck this winter yeah we're getting out of here yeah what do we do fucking get in the boat as hard as your fucking aunt's cunt you get some good Italian food and in Florida oh yeah Lord has got some good food but yeah you're right the upper part of it especially that's like oh that mean it might as well be any other southern state here right okay and then at the bottom it's of Cubans ya know runnin shit Miami yeah Miami's just international Miami's like an international city it's like an international city that's in America that means that is so different than Seattle like in terms of feel and like the way you're walking around everybody's like Fanning and tight clothes and partying and fucking dancing and musics coming out of cars like whoa okay space is alive yeah that's alive and it's gonna be underwater soon yeah when they get a suit when the moon is in certain positions in Florida it doesn't even matter what tide is the fucking if it if there's a high tide and no storm they still street still flood in Miami it's getting bad is that real yeah well here's what they got to do they got to dig under the city and then lift it up yeah it's right just go all the way under Elon Musk use that tunnel machine thing and I'm gonna put some giant metal bars and just jack it out Jackie you got the Italians down there they do construction but what if they do in New Orleans deal where they put up a levee yeah that's what I'm gonna need to do Jesus Christ I think the problem with that though what I read was that there's something about the porous nature of the soil in Miami that the waters gonna come through the ground yeah the ground under the cities of South Florida's large cedar is largely porous live Jamie's on the ball largely porous limestone which means water will rise up through it so they're fucked they're fucked no matter what even with a levy they're fucked that water's just gonna get through the ground right up you know how like you're on the beach and you could dig a hole in the sand and eventually you hit water yeah that always freaked me out yeah I know I know whatever there's water under here how much water I remember my kid was sitting in one of those holes and I'm like you're gonna get fucking sucked underground yeah I didn't like it I didn't like it yeah I was listening to a radio lab podcast on quicksand there's really cool podcasts because it made me think I want oh yeah nobody worries about quicksand anymore is that a real thing well exam kids dude yeah yeah quicksand is a real thing yeah yeah it's a real thing you can fall into this soupy watery sandy shit and if you don't try to swim out of it you try to walk out of it you could drown yeah you could die in there people have definitely died and you might not even get out if you try to swim out but that's how you handle it you handle it the same way you handle water and if you try walking through it yeah like people just get sucked into the murk I mean if you think about it there's like a certain amount of density to what you need to stand on right that's why mud it's not hard use a point you just go in there and you can get really stuck right well if it's more watery than that then what happens well then you can't even stand yeah then you people just panic Wow yeah you got to swim yeah if you can because there's all this weight on you too you have to realize that that stuff's dense so it's watery but it's also heavy and then your clothes are covered in it yeah so your clothes become really heavy and so nobody can save you because if they get close they're gonna fall in yes yeah if they you know if you're gonna drag them down man it's hard to swim with somebody you know that as well as anybody you save somebody yeah I was in Costa Rica and we were down at this this water it was the biggest waterfall I've ever seen it was like hundreds of feet high and it landed in this lagoon this round lagoon and the water they told you don't go near the water and so there's these Japanese girls sitting on the edge they got their feet in and then one of them like jumps in and the water fucking sucks her down immediately and I'd ovalle I have a lifeguarding degrade from when I was stoned in 16 and so I dove into the water and I grabbed her and luckily I was checking them out because they were these beautiful Japanese girls so I had my eyes on them and so I dive in and I grabbed I grabbed her and I pulled it to the surface I do the cross arm carry and I pull our I pull her out and you know what she did what just turned turn to her friends they all like consoled her nobody said thank you I fucking saved your life so anyway Wow so there was these kids and every you are Japanese lady how rude how about a little Japanese Japanese I think she was Japanese no no they were Japanese Japanese yeah she probably thought you were a lifeguard yeah I thought that's what happened yeah and then I and then I left and I'm with my family and they didn't see it happen so I was so fucking bum then we get to the parking lot and there's this busload of kids from some school and they had seen the whole thing and they started chanting hero to me oh my kids do you fucking see what's happening right now [Laughter] that's that's gotta be a great feeling even if they didn't say thank you yeah you saved them like it's what I do it's my job superhero you ever save anybody's life no I don't think so not not directly mmm-hmm maybe you did this podcast probably directly I bet these people that have been suicidal that heard this in a cheer in the mob I bet it ruined a few people too because people say I changed their life okay if I accept it on the positive then I have to accept it on the negative - that's right no no you did it you did the whole thing yeah you might her I said some shit that you you enjoyed I'm very happy for that and I talked to some people that brought you some great information I'm very happy for that - we're all in this together I'm not saving anybody yeah you save yourself okay don't listen to me yeah call a hotline yeah don't listen to me don't take yoga don't even do it don't take go don't I don't fuck I'm talking about don't pick up archery what the fuck do you want to do when I shoot arrows at things game eat carbs eat some fucking carbs don't do jiu-jitsu you're gonna get hurt yeah won't get hurt your 40 year old man we trying to choke people for stop it don't listen to me yeah don't eat elk go get a burger we're gonna an actual American hamburger don't eat mushrooms get out he's gonna close your mind off break your head they're gonna break your head what if you go crazy like that guy from Pink Floyd huh what if you go crazy what if you never come back what if you get anti-semitic is it judo but the thing is what if you do like for sure some people have smoke too much pot and blowing a fucking gasket yeah let's be honest right it has to happen they say that actually they're finding my wife just told me this yesterday she read this article about people with schizophrenia are getting older and they're smoking pot more because it's legal and they're finding people are coming in with schizophrenic episodes from smoking too much pot that were schizophrenic already or became schizophrenic from the pot not sure I think when you especially when you get too high it feels exactly like being crazy yeah and I think when there's been moments for sure that I smoke too much pot and I freak the fuck out and when that happens it almost always feels like wow if I had a live life like this and it's one of the things that I tried to take any consideration when I think about people having something wrong with the way their brain processes information or the way they talk is like think about how you feel when you're on like a 200 milligram edible and you're like oh my god I just can't do this this is just too much everything is anxiety and the freakout and life and death and all of your memories pouring back in your head like a waterfall and you can't call it in some circles they're spinning like plates and all you want is for attend please just gonna lie down here I hear when you take a shower it helps you get in the shower you're still freaked out if that was your whole life so you got to think what is what's your state of consciousness versus another person's you have to guess I don't I've never been in your mind I don't know your mind works have to guess that your mind is some reasonable it's got something like the way my mind works the way you look at life and we talk about so many things we agree on so many things I got to think you're processing is very similar to mine but there's got to be people out there where it's chaos where it's just like you with the 200 milligram edible you're just like fuck all day is just like what who's who's doing that yeah you know people do just people watching me man from there's a building near us and these people watch me like and they can't escape can't escape the can't escape they're trapped in this this fucking constant snowball effect of anxiety and chaos and and you got to wonder like what how much of that is brain chemistry how much of those brain chemistry that's been adjusted by nature and by life experience as an abuse and all these different factors that happen to people that make them you know lose their grip all right yeah I mean you see them on the street and you just you know there's a woman that is near my house she's at a bus stop and she's been at this bus stop for three years and I have never and I pass her two or three times a day and I check I'm kind of obsessed with checking on her every time I Drive by and she's never not been in that bus stop sitting down she's either reading or just under a blanket she's chained smokes I don't know where she gets the cigarettes she's got a cell phone don't know how she charges it but I guess she goes to the bathroom at the gas station maybe maybe people give her money and she doesn't beg doesn't engage just sits at this and it's up because she's in front of a gas station and a busy road it's it's a worse spot to say pouring rain she's out there cold winters she's out there it's crazy Wow does the bus stop have a cover yeah but not not like a decides they're not there oh so one driving rain it's you know so she's just she's soaked yeah and you see her talking to herself a little bit and you just think Jesus Christ and so I looked her up online I researched her and it turns out she's from Venice she went to Venice high and she's got she's got parents in the and they know she's there they can't get her to leave social workers come by and they just realized she's happy there you know we're not happy but she's safe there something about that spot maybe because it's like the busiest spot around it makes her feel safe yeah imagine that you could I know yeah as your kid blows a gasket and you got to let go at a certain point fuck you can't make them take their medication after the age of 18 and for some reason a lot of schizophrenics don't like taking their medication because the way it makes them feel goddammit yeah what are the other options well I think lithium is the main drug and then there's a couple other ones that work is there any behavioral therapy or physical therapies oh yeah definitely yeah I think it's about replacing thoughts it's cognitive behavioral therapy they have to when they start thinking something they have to replace it with another thought and they have to train in that until they can stop the voices but but I think it's mostly medication yeah it's I think we have an aversion to treating the brain to say when we treat other things that get broken yeah like you know if you you have something wrong with your liver they go oh you've got liver disease well we're gonna give you medication for the liver there's something wrong with your brain like you sure you sure the son has a brain no what's wrong right like your brains really not producing enough chemicals is that it or is it just the way you look at things no they look at it as a weakness yeah this is a weakness yeah that's a weird thing it's a weird thing because sometimes it is sometimes people are weak mm-hmm but sometimes that's not it sometimes there's something wrong yeah and so if you're a person who's got something wrong and people are telling you just weak no no this is fucked up like this is this this is a terrible feeling and this is every day for me all day yeah there's just something wrong going on in there like it has to be that there's variables to the way your brain works just why like there's variables to the way your eyes function or any other part of your body there's very just it's not equal everybody doesn't get the same dose right I mean depression is something that it's funny because I think I've asked you and you don't have depression and my my my buddy Mike Gibbons he's my best friend and we connect like you and me on everything but I have so much fucking depression that I I deal with it every day you know you know and I can't I have to meditate I gotta exercise i i'm you know medicate everything do you um what well while you're injured right now you can't work out right right indy does that affect you when you think I'll help you yeah I've been in a rut not exercising when you do exercise a lot does it alleviate your symptoms and you feel very much really yeah yeah I'm doing this thing now I think you Neal Brennan recommended it and the magnet thing yeah DMS dren transcranial magnetic stimulation yeah so it was amazing I've done it for ten weeks every single day really yeah I just did it this morning do you do it to yourself no you go in first you get an MRI and they map out your brain right and the whole theory behind it is that they can use magnetic stimulation to sort of like waken up one of the lobes in your brain that's associated with depression mm-hmm and so you go in and first they map out your brain and then you go in and for like a half hour they just pulse this magnetic thing onto your head it's like a very low-grade MRI almost and I've had amazing results and it lasts forever you know you go through this cycle of it and then he's Neil said the same experience that's crazy yeah highly right that's it forever yeah well they say some people have to come in and you know get a get a tune-up but generally it's at one time um there's a woman named cat Zingano she's one of the UFC's top bantamweight and she fought UFC champion Amanda Nunez back in the day and actually beat her before she won the title but in that fight she got hurt real bad and she talked about it on the podcast that she developed a bunch of brain issues after that fight because like her cortisol levels were all fucked up they're all fucked up she developed thyroid problem she got hit in the head so hard she yeah she couldn't keep weight off trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with her and one of the things that helped her the best she talked about it really openly and in depth on the podcast but one things that helped her the best was they have this I think it's a different kind of magnetic therapy than this one because I think this is only don't the center only exists around San Diego mm-hm and a lot of military guys come back and use it football players people with head injuries and someone recommended it to her and it helped her tremendous yeah really brought it back yeah there's some real breakthroughs going on because you know people are and they you know they still use like electric shock therapy yeah and it you know with pretty good results but a lot of side effects did you get hit in the head a lot when you were kid sometimes but was there any like moments which get knocked no I don't think I ever got knocked out did you ever get hit with a bat I played hockey so I used to check people a lot down to get really hurt doing that no I'd never that my neck my neck is still fucked up to this day from a from a check a head check that I made but no I don't think I ever had any concussions my friend mark no mine right sorry my mine runs in the family my mom is got it it's it's it's very genetic depression oh I'm sure it is but I think it's accentuated by trauma yeah and that's why I was asking you cuz even though you probably I mean I know you played a lot of hockey you know you probably don't think about it like every time you collide and even falling down slamming into the that's right yeah there's a lot of that all that stuff rattles your brain yeah believe it or not people get concussions from getting hit in the chest sometimes really yeah here's cat Zingano it says EEG and vitals for my RMDs treats fda-approved to treat migraines depression improves anxiety PTSD TBI sleep ADHD except etc now accepting insurance and TRICARE mindset Rancho Bernardo check them out and this is you could find this on cat Zingano Twitter page she's got a picture of her with this apparatus on her head but I know it helped her yeah I've heard of EEG it's it's really effective it helped her a lot yeah it uh you know she could talk about what sparring was like before and afterwards she her coordination was off she was that's one of the things that happens to people when they get brain damage if they get knocked out or you know bad concussions is your your systems not firing correctly so you'll see their bodies not moving right so it almost resets resets to hard you're damaged yes damaged right you know the signals aren't getting to the muscles correctly like you see one of the things that you see in older boxers when they've taken too many horrible fights and they're really starting to lose it is their steps look shorter their legs they look closer together they have a heart they're having a harder time moving they don't have the confidence to have the balance I move around and they're there their systems short-circuiting yeah you know and you're seeing it in their coordination it's a weird thing to see to I've seen it in fighters where I remember them in their prime and then I see them now I'm like whoa there's two possibilities it could be an injury they could be dealing with an injury but if you find out there's no injury you're like oh this is not good no just look at Ben Roethlisberger out there and the pocket when he tries to run it's like little steps you know movement of the shoulders and that guy used to be fast back there but he's gotten hit a lot there's no getting away from it man yeah yeah have you had you ever been knocked out yeah yeah not unconscious I got stopped in a kickboxing match I got hit with a big left hook boom my legs went out from under me was crazy what didn't even hurt it was like it like because you're full of adrenaline so you don't feel it in terms of like ouchie it's not like out she hurt right it's like it wasn't like a painful thing it was like Bing and then my legs just stopped working like whoa what the fuck that was the hardest I ever been hit because was just on the button it was it perfect Isaac doing I should as I was exhausted already this is my third fight of the day in a kickboxing tournament and just cranked and my legs just went whoopsies I'm pretty lucky with all the fighting you did that you never got knocked out super lucky but I definitely got hit in the head a bunch you know I didn't get knocked out there's a lot of sparring there's a lot of getting punched in the face there was a lot of getting kicked in the head less kicked in the head believe it or not cuz I was terrified I was always moving fast you wear helmets no we wear these things the first tournaments we used to wear these things on the back of the head and that was so when you get knocked out your fucking head doesn't bounce too hard off the ground I'm not bullshit I pick one spot there's a video of me fighting with one of those long it's a video of me on YouTube that's I've got this spot in the back of my head it looks like like a bald spot like I would have if I had hair now but it's like a yarmulke yeah like a it's a red plastic thing it's hard to tell because it's a shitty video but that red plastic thing was basically like a spongy thing that these to use in Taekwondo terms because we it was first it was no padding and then eventually they made people start wearing these helmets and they basically these cushiony helmets that go over the top of the head and you got to strap them out underneath see how that guy's wearing it the white guy to see the guys in the background or the right side that's wearing the white thing that's a standard one what I'm wearing just a pat on the back of my head right do that there's like a red thing in the back of my head that's in case I got Kayode because I'm we're fighting on a fucking this is a basketball court this is a wood floor that we need protection that was me knocking that guy out that was me this is me when I'm 19 so these this was where we fought all the time we always fought on hardwood floors one time I fuck crazy way crazier from this ready for this the Bay State Games I find the Bay State games we fought on a tarp that was laid out over a cement floor yeah and I knocked a guy out in his head bounced off the cement oh my god I kicked this dude in the head and his head bounced off something I'll never forget that sound yeah so I was 19 I didn't know what the fuck to do this is where the tournament was is okay is okay we're gonna do this yeah we're gonna fight here like that was today I was like are you guys out of your fucking mind I would I would be screaming if I went with my kid and he was supposed to fight in a tournament and I got there and there was a thin plastic tarp stretched out over a smooth concrete floor like what the fuck are you talking about are you crazy yeah but you need pads you need people to make sure they don't go out of Bounce just tarp lay down over concrete Wow it was so so dangerous so I definitely got my noggin rattled yeah a gang at times yeah I don't know how many times I used to do gymnastics for like six years certain when I was like six backflip oh yeah I could do I used to double backs no well I did I I trained for like six years our way how do I know this yeah so I used to do yeah I could do roundoff back handspring into a double back you still do that I can I haven't tried a single back in a while but I could do so I could do standing backflips until a few years ago Wow yeah yeah no shit right do that so I so I always wanted to learn how to do that I did I over-rotated a flip one time and I fucking slam my head in the mats back then when you see floor exercise today it's not even the same sport it's all springboard right with like two inches of padding when we did it it was those fucking rubber you know half inch thick mats that you roll out and the corners come popping up that's what we used to do it yeah yeah so you were fucking twisting your ankle all the time landing on that shit how bad you fuck your head up when you landed it was bad my injuries were my ankles that I used to fuck up my and then you know you can't then you can't do anything for a little while so the reason why I keep asking about head trauma is because my friend Mark Gordon he's an expert in traumatic brain injury he's an endocrinologist and he studies a lot of soldiers and he's written a bunch of papers on soldiers former football players fighters he's worked with a bunch of people that have had brain injuries and his conclusion like and a lot of them that were suicidal a lot of them they were severely depressed and his conclusion is that for a lot of them what happened was damage to the pituitary gland that stopped them from producing hormones correctly huh and it leads to severe lack of energy depression and it's almost always correlated with head trauma and oftentimes head trauma that people forgot about they didn't think it's that big of a deal yeah but it could be literally wiping out on a jet ski hmm slamming into the water yeah and then you're fucked up for years right and you don't know why skiing for sure falling down hitting your head snowboarding is really common yeah I've never snowboarded but apparently when the the board kicks up you feet go up in there and the fucking head comes down yeah that's how people get got well and you got to wear a helmet yeah and a lot of kids don't yeah I've heard of kids getting fucked up oh yeah but so all those things contribute to the foot that your brain is super delicate you know it's really complicated machinery it's like when you drop your iphone maybe you drop it once mm-hmm how many times you drop your iPhone dropped it three times today hey hey hey put a fucking case on that thing yeah these drop tests right they do drop tests where they drop it over concrete and see how good it is your head is similar yeah in that you you can get away with getting whacked in the head but I was in Hawaii recently and I dropped my phone the last time too you know that you drop your phone you know it's getting a little wonky and then you drop it the last time and it's just gone yeah it's gone ville it was just calling people I would I was really yeah I was showing so when I was had the phone open and I was like watch watch it's on the context look it's just gonna start calling people I just started calling people and that hang up and they would just call somebody else hang up and who'd just call spiels it was just falling apart it wouldn't let me log in anymore like it wasn't it wasn't sensing my fingers hitting the screen to put in the key code where's your shit all backed up yeah yeah yeah it was all backed up but it was like goddamn yeah yep yeah I just matched my screen I didn't I didn't give a fuck your heads like that that's my point yeah their heads like that look if I didn't get that one last drop maybe the phone would be all right yeah they would have kept that phone today yeah you know maybe able to look through the new phones we don't need that it's basically with the same phone all right no rock smack I'm reading this book now about speaking of changing your brain it's called how to change your mind so guys Michael Pollan yeah yeah he's been on the podcast talking about oh no shit yeah it's great did he talk about his new book about the it's it's basically about psychedelics and LSD and mushrooms in particular trace of the whole fucking history of it yeah I had no idea how much research was done back in the 50s and 60s oh yeah I mean they had conclusive studies that were showing with alcoholism people were 70% of people that underwent these treatments with psychedelics got sober you know depression cigarettes cigarettes no I mean it's amazing and all that shit just got fucking thrown away yeah corrupt people kept that information away from folks the studies that Nixon funded like Nixon funded a bunch of studies that showed positive benefits of marijuana how is that right and they you know the Nixon administration just fucking can I get out of here with this shit yeah well the other thing he mentions is that it got squashed by by shrinks because they had a vested interest in people not going into the woods for a weekend and coming back without their depression so yes the thing so they disqualified all the studies oh fuck yeah the psychiatrists were like horrified that there was these kind of results were coming back do you was it that for sure or was it people who have never taken psychedelics horrified that people are out there experimenting with their consciousness because I think a lot of these psychiatrists are probably really straight-laced guys and so in their mind especially in the you know shadows of reefer madness and all the propaganda they had heard in the 30s and 40s and when you look at those people and they're out there in the fucking desert or wherever they're going dancing around taking mushrooms under the moonlight like they're blowing their brains out here you got to stop this right there straight laced people have never done psychedelics they might not be in cahoots it might more likely be a bunch of people to think it's a fucking terrible idea to let people run around take an acid well there was just some of the medical journals came out with with pieces saying that none of these studies are valid because there wasn't I forget what it is about studies that have to be consistent but the other thing is it was political and you had Timothy Leary who was you know the worst thing to happen to this kind of testing because he was saying was it drop drop out and turn on drop drop out and that whole idea they said you know with people taking LSD you're not gonna fight your wars and so that became a threat to the status quo Wow and that's when the laws started to come out huh it's interesting because he also got a lot of people to get excited about it right yeah but he got he took it away from it being a medical process and he made it about you know enlightenment but in a kind of fluffy spiritual way well he made it a big movement right I think he thought that he was probably going to change the world with that movement yeah and kind of did definitely had a big impact you know all those people that took acid like think about if you really stop and think about Apple and you really look at the fact that Apple Steve Jobs said that taking acid was like one of the greatest things that's ever happened yeah that was his famously talked about it and who knows what it wouldn't impact that had on him deciding to start Apple and what would an impact Apple has had in the technology world oh no Pollan talks about it in the book he draws a straight line from people starting to take all this stuff because it was happening in Silicon Valley yeah this whole psychedelic movement was like right in that area yeah and he says that it you know Bill Bill Gates apparently took it once but then all those guys were coming in and they were you know there were these people that would lead there was a guy named no Hubbard well Ram Dass is mentioned also yeah but there was guy named Hubbard who was really like you know a corporate version of LSD he was going to companies and he was taking the CEOs of companies and taking them in for these three-day drop acid experiences Wow corporate acid well they're kind of doing that at Burning Man oh is that right some corporations go to me not a lot but there's some cool companies he'd go to Burning Man yeah you know what's this Alfred Mathieu Hubbard he's an early proponent of the drug LSD during the 1950's he is reputed to be the Johnny Appleseed of LSD and the first person to emphasize led LSD 'he's potential as a visionary or transcendental drug but this guy had a fucking life somebody's got to do a movie about his life he was like working for the government he was a double agent he would while he was dropping acid he was he he started with nothing no I think before before during and after he had like eight different careers and he was like a spy and he bought it he started with nothing and ended up with like a bunch of airplanes that he was leasing out became a millionaire and then spent it all trying to educate people on LSD he was worth like tens of millions of dollars and he ended up broke at the end Wow yeah Wow offered the LSD he believed in it so strongly that said it was gonna change the world and it would have it may still now there's now it's coming back well there was a little hiccup or several generations how to pass before people started understanding that there's there's there's a risk to everything there's a risk to sports there's a risk to every fucking thing you do driving your cars at risk there's a risk with psychedelics but there's also a reward and I think if you're going to be honest you have to look at both of them you have to look at the potential risk you have to look at the reward and they're not looking at the reward to try there's too many people out there that are trying to deny the reward and you got to find out why and in this day and age it might be a conspiracy it might be some pharmaceutical industry that doesn't want it to be legal because it would undermine their profits it might be it might be some law-enforcement unions that think it's a bad idea to make less things illegal it'll take you know prisons yeah it'll take people away you know in terms of the amount of people that they need for the job it'll you know which I think is that's another story but when you you know what people look at that kind of stuff and you look at like the the underlying sort of patterns that we follow in this country you know the patterns that we like are you happy or not happy with the way things go the way things are run in what sense just in any sense in all of it I trust that we do have the best system out there and we challenge it every day and I they'll think that we live in a place where the tenants of our society are in place for sure they switch one way or the other but I still believe in democracy and I think the Internet has an overall thing has been positive for people getting their voices out and for for information period yeah being distributed but the I the idea that we're faced with that in this day and age there's grown adults telling other grown adults what they can and can't put in their body yeah and they're not being honest about the benefits right that's where it gets really that's where the whole thing falls apart like you're just a guy like if you and I are the only two people on the planet and you like a man I'm not gonna let you take that acid like why well because it's illegal look I wrote it down can take the acid right that would be preposterous yeah but somehow or another it works when there's a million people then a person can tell you know you're if you're a fucking grown adult you can't tell me what I can take that's stupid yeah if you can't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what I'm gonna take is gonna fuck with you if you can't prove that then stop yeah look if someone does something if takes something and does some they take PCP and they've run face-first through a fucking 7-eleven window that's on them it's on their actions it doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to try PCP and I don't think you should try PCP I think one enough enough people smash through windows and go crazy go hey maybe that's a drug I should fucking avoid but that's how you find out about that yeah you let grown adults make their own decisions and if you're the one who's making the decisions for all the grown adults you better have some real fucking logic to what you're saying they don't and this is the same society that allows the pharmaceuticals to peddle opiates to people for the last 30 years saying that it was the greatest thing you could do exactly I think it's good that they make money because they make medicine that helps a lot of people they're not all bad I think in general pharmaceuticals have helped people in tremendous ways but you can't deny that if there's some way shape or form that people are influencing other people having access to beneficial things because it would impact their profit long that's that's evil yeah that's evil you have a lot of fucking money if you're really going out of your way to hire lobbyists to make sure that mushrooms don't get on the table come on man yeah you're you are you're a fucking real problem that's a real problem you look at yin and yang this is this is the opposing forces they were battling to try to get total complete freedom of your consciousness mmm these are the opposing forces their ignorance like these psychiatrists I guarantee these psychiatrists were worried about correlations between psychotic episodes and psychedelic drug use and they're worried about people falling apart and they're right they're right this other ones that wanted to get it illegal they're right it's like working on back flips when there's a fucking thin pad under you yeah you could fall on your head yeah you're right we say don't do gymnastics people follow in their head one out of ten falls on their head you're not doing Djimon you're not falling on your fucking head all right right it's the same thing it's the same thing yeah so people worried about it that don't really have experience in it I guarantee you most of those psychiatrists just didn't have experience in it or were super cautious folks you know if they did have experienced with it maybe they'd try a little mushroom dose and they'd be like wow this is amazing it's right and also controlling you know a set and setting they keep talking about you know and realizing that the the you know occurrence of a psychotic episode is so much lower when it's you know when you're when it's being dispensed the right way yeah so much lower you ever been led through it by somebody when you did ayahuasca was there like in Moscow just DMT um Aubry my friend Aubrey acted as a like he kinda like set the setting in a way where it was you know I would I would say like spiritual like not not redic not over-the-top but just announcing your intentions mm-hmm that we're going into this we're going in this we're gonna let go I'm gonna you know give thanks to all all the spirits around us and all the energy around us just go into this with a good intention give be grateful be go into it with gratitude and then the way it hits you it hits you like like a infinite cyclone of geometric patterns in impossible colors just blasting in your brain instantaneously in your like like going into it with the intention of letting go it's probably one of the best pieces of advice you could give people to avoid a freakout right go with it let it go just let yourself go and it's what's trying to do is your ego is trying to wrestle with this grizzly bear this enormous short-faced bear on steroids it's trying to your ego is trying to wrestle with is impossible to resist force mm-hmm and that's what leads to a lot of people freaking out so ego losing your ego is the ultimate goal of it I don't think anybody ever really loses there you go I think you you keep it in check you lose some of it you keep some of it because that's it's part of your survival mechanism the real problem is like having a healthy ego you know like like if your wife looks good she's looking at herself in the mirror she's like I look you know you look fucking great I do look good like she feels good feels get ready that's ego right you want to know you look good but it's not a bad ego it's fun you know I'm saying yeah the real problem is when it gets out of control and toxic then it okay yeah other people see you they're like ooh you know you see gross just gross behavior gross selfishness you see that and you go oh that's the bad part of the ego that's what I'm saying yeah but the key is to know which is which and that's hard it's hard to know which is which which one is the overwhelming force inside your mind which one is the one that's controlling your consciousness and your behavior and which is is it the good one the bad one is it the fun healthy one or is it the one that is you know completely obsessed with yourself and only yourself yeah you don't know until you have these experiences and then the the the nature of them gets exposed it like takes him down to the roots and you start thinking about well where did all this come from like where's where's all what's the source of all this like oh there's a validation issue there's a this issue there's a trust issue there's a you know whatever the fuck it is it's swirling out of that in this unnatural form to create the negative behavior that you are manifesting in your life mm-hmm like it all of it comes from something and one of the things about psychedelic experiences is it shut it like it shuts the ego off for a second and lets you stand outside of and go look what the things doing yeah mm-hmm look at this things things crops not only that it doesn't work you know here's here's a perfect example ego that doesn't work name-dropping like if you're hanging out with some weddings again you know Sean Penn was over my house last night man very fucking like now you know what Jeremy Piven was just telling me about that last week name-dropping but like it doesn't really work yeah everybody knows your name drop in yeah yeah when I'm Steven Spielberg and I are pretty tight you like yeah but it's one thing like if you told me you went over Sean Penn's house I'd be like oh what's he like like then it wouldn't be name-dropping mm-hmm like if you did it wouldn't be name-dropping like if you told me like I was hanging out with Sean with Sean Penn I don't know weird well cuz it's the beginning of a story yeah I'm not just gonna let that let that hang there's a follow-up yeah that's not your whole thing yeah right so like comedy is like name-dropping with stories yeah good stories that go with it but you know there are comedians that are really like guileless about just bringing a name in or bringing up a project they worked on and you look back at the joke and you go could have told that joke without telling me that Frank Sinatra was in the audience that night yes exactly yeah and I remember Anthony Clark used to do that when he was coming up in Boston he was the guy he was the guy the young hot guy in Boston dude and I mean that dude you put his name on a marquee and he was fucking one year out of college and he was this cute guy with a southern accent and the Mesa bond and he was silly and he would fill up a fucking room and he would just and then he started to get some success and it always found his way in his act he would talk about yeah you know I was talking to this actor when I was doing Chicago on Broadway and no not Chicago what would he do Oklahoma he did Oklahoma on Broadway when he was like 24 years old and you know and then he just started and he got in with that with River Phoenix and he did like three River Phoenix movies and he was fuckin good and then somehow he got into the TV route and didn't follow the film rip but he's he's a good actor yeah I remember he had Boston Common remember that in common and that didn't go it went for a little while but I got cancelled and there was a show that was all his right and then he went to do yes dear he did yes dear for a long time no then he did one with Dan Aykroyd oh he did where dan Aykroyd was a priest and maybe they were both priests really yeah really that might have been f.cuz because uh yes dear was on good seven eight years easily forever yeah yeah soul man soul man soul man huh so that dude and his his quote per episode was very high from the get-go and he just kept buying real estate well that's that's what he doesn't know right I haven't you haven't talked to him in a while I think I heard he sells real estate now yeah I was like Anthony he was a murderer in Boston I used to see him at Faneuil Hall he would fill that fucking place yeah you know the comedy connection when they move when bloom and ride took over and they moved to the big room yeah and they moved out of that little tiny room and put it in Fanueil Hall I remember walking through there one day and Anthony Clark was murdering and I was like this is 90% women this is so weird yeah oh is that right I saw women yeah today I'll come and see him guys loved him too don't get me wrong but women really loved him he thought he was so cute you know well they say that's the secret to being a draw is appeal to women because they're the ones that decide what to do at night yes yeah right like there's not a whole lot of chicks begging to go to Slayer right and if they are take them that's it that's a good one yeah they want to go see someone cute I bet there's like probably a disproportionate number of chicks gonna see Aquaman how about if you know yeah if you looked if you looked at the number of women that want to go see a superhero movie and the number of women that want to go see Aquaman yeah it's up off the charger and Aquaman's favorite someone should just study that's a handsome man well he's his name Jason Momoa he was badass at Game of Thrones he's a beast - yeah super nice guy - I met a guy in the whole foods he needs sweetheart sort of telling yo sweetheart he is like you're so handsome it's confusing so tall and beautiful I'm feeling weird feelings right yeah we did that guy yeah yeah my wife said it best she said he's everybody's type she's like you know some girls Brad Pitt's their type you know some girls it's a you know fill in the blank yeah look at that yeah he's everybody's type and he's a giant and he's got awesome tattoos he's a fucking nice guy fucking fuck are those his real tattoos I don't believe so I think that's just for Aquaman that's his tattoos for Aquaman what are his real tattoos he's got a gang of real tattoos the forearm ones I think is his real tattoos yeah boy that takes some time and makeup because if he's doing a role where they don't want that that's a lot of time covering that shit up every day I don't think they have to cover up shit with him yeah let that beautiful face get on-screen all those damn panties do the talkin see you again tomorrow man whoa yeah girls are going to that movie it's like a horse it's like a porn theater in Times Square in the 70s for women's probably flipping their hands moisture in the air adding yourself off all these little heaters you're walking across heaters your feet are stuck on the floor you think it's the popcorn butter nope nope nope yeah how do we get on subject to him Aquaman grows any Clark oh yeah girls deciding what the right yeah girls would be they'd be like yeah let's go see Aquaman wait a minute oh you hate superhero movies whatever you want to go yeah shit so what's the stare at Jason Momoa right he is pretty beautiful you watch them on screen damn it yeah shit can't hate her you think some women watch MMA for that reason I think so does it cute yeah fuck yeah not only cute but savages right I mean the number of women with sketchy childhoods that are attracted to MMA fighters came off the charts yeah I want to say that in a very polite way as polite as I could say I think even regular women I think like lawyers like button-down women yeah see uh cuz they're around neutered men all day yeah you around a guy like you know Luke Rockhold is now might be better looking the Jays mama and he's a it was UFC uh he was middleweight champion beautiful yeah six foot three six foot four somewhere in that range features looks like a model huh handsome as fuck god I want to see them oh yeah ass kicker that's not the best picture and the bro that's kind of gets that's after a fight yeah see him before it's a beast but point is there's guarantee go that one above with the blue shorts on what you see is that handsome bastard look at him yeah he's got a good build that's the kind of build my wife likes she doesn't like it to big bikes like me and him slow down you and him are the same fuck I sure girls are watching that guy though like okay here's another one George st. Pierre hundred percent look at that beautiful body oh yeah George st. Pierre is beautiful George st. Pierre literally has to beat women away from ya get away from me I'm busy I am busy go to there were he's thrown a punch the one right there look at that I mean you know girls would be begging to have that inside of them beyond I was a woman if I was a heterosexual woman and I saw that guy and he was like would you like a drink I'd be like fuck yes I'd like a drink yeah god damn you Savage let's do this yeah I want a drink can we have it after you fuck me yeah I don't wanna get too drunk I want to feel it still whoa yeah and it goes right there are some of the players some of the fighters oh I don't want to talk about that dare you kiss and tell but it's one other thing is interesting is female fighters right that I was reading a story about a husband who's white who's a trainer I think and his wife was a boxer and I was reading the story about him like his experience like bringing her to the ring like getting her his wife is in there she's gonna knuckle up with some other chicken shit and maybe get really fucking hurt yeah and to be there while this is all happening that's a wild that's a wild life female fighter is a wild creature you gotta think a male fighter it's like almost all boys somewhere in the back of their head have this ridiculous fantasy of being able to fuck everybody up yeah come on bitch you know fight a bunch of people like a goddamn Chuck Norris movie and rowdy cake people that would be cool it's just the reality of learning how to do that's like I don't want to do that is too much it's too dangerous to scare fuck this and most people don't do it but for women to have that it's probably way more rare to have this desire to see really fuck people up probably way more rare maybe like let's be generous and say 20 percent of the the number that men would want to fuck people maybe 20 percent of that is like the number that would be women so then how many of them go through with it yeah how many of them go through with it and get to be like a cat Zingano or get to be like an Amanda Nunez like Jesus Christ that numbers so small yeah so small in terms of like general population mm-hmm those are some wild humans yeah if they get to that stage where they're fighting in a fucking cage for a living whoa yeah someone like Holly home like that is a crazy way to make a living yeah yeah now you got to think if they make it that far they're even more vicious than men because they've they've you know there's such a social taboo for them yeah for men it's like oh that's badass you're an MMA fighter but for women everybody just thinks it's weird and they think there's something wrong with you well it's become more acceptable but it's still terrifying especially for men that don't train like to it for a man who doesn't train and he's like around miesha tate she's really hot and she'd also fuck people they get weirded out like imagine that girl could fuck you up like she's hot and she could fuck you up mm-hmm that's not nice huh some guys probably love that people like that bondage with her tied up and right overpowered but one of the odds that a girl who knows how to fuck people up is looking for that kind of guy all right almost zero yeah that's true those girls Luke Rockhold looking to get stuffed by another alpha that would be a good porn movie right there we should do is bank it like Luke Rockhold shoe a lot of porn and bank it and then have it release after he's retired from his career yeah you know cuz right now is just gonna get in the way yeah it's gonna be a distraction right but he knows that's this 401k my porn you know yeah it's a the numbers of women that become elite fighters I wonder what it is in terms of like the amount that try it and then the amount that become fully successful I bet it's a tiny tiny percentage yeah I like to get all the way through like how many like how many men when you when you were growing up how many guys either wanted to learn how to box or wrestle or do some kind of marks a lot of wrestlers yeah yeah it was a school sport there was Taekwondo and there was wrestling those were pretty much the only forms that I that I saw we didn't have boxing in my town but a lot of kids you knew we're into it right oh yeah yeah how many girls I can't think of any super-rare but the martial arts classes did have a lot of girls it's kind of interesting it's a good number it wasn't half but it might have been 20% yeah it might be 20% women that were in those classes because they wanted to learn self-defense you know I put my daughter in Taekwondo just she wasn't that into it but I go just do a year just to give you some sense of facing somebody if the fight happens yeah in some sense of what it's like to struggle with someone physically then you gotta move with them you know and the older you are we start learning that the more difficult it is to incorporate it into your the way you think about things right like when you're young if you have some experience with martial arts you'll be more calm and confident if something happens when you get older right you're already your body's you develop knowing how to move that way yeah when you're already like kind of set in your ways and you're injured and you're old then someone wants to teach you a wheel kick like oh Christ yeah like there's no way my body's gonna do that right my body doesn't move like that yeah it's like you being able to do back flips look you could still do a back loop your body learned how to do that when you were young yep it gets in there that programs in there and there's a there's a moment of faith when you do a back flip where when you go up you have to go up before you go back and that's the first mistake and the constant mistake is people people go to do a back flip and they lunge backwards and they land in their head but you really have to trust that you have to shoot your hands up not back and then you pull it in no over damn scary and that's like that with I'm sure with martial arts is this moves that are there's a moment of faith when I don't train for a long time then I try to do a turning sidekick on the heavy bag there's a good moment like okay I'm gonna hit this thing right this big-ass knife shit that's not good to have around right there what am i 12 keep this big giant knife on the table yeah when I when I do it today to this day I have to do it slow a couple times and get the feel of it yeah I haven't trained in a while and then then then it become a normal thing all right man it's hell on your fucking knees I got a new knee thing going on like there's the third time of how to get stem cells inject it into this meniscus tear so really there's this little tiny meniscus tear and it develops in to assist the the tear we've hit it with stem cells a few times and it doesn't give me any pain anymore but a cyst keeps developing in that area and the cyst has to get punctured and drained and it's getting smaller and smaller it happened three different times where I had to get it drained and the last time was a few days ago and it was the smallest it's ever been but still fucking annoying but you're still running yep doesn't hurt when you run I'm taking time off right now I'm taking a little bit of time off right now I'm gonna take a couple of weeks off and I'm gonna run at a slower pace just get the dog some exercise and I'm gonna be more just more cautious about it not gonna push myself I'm trying to figure out what it is I'm doing that's causing this cyst to recur I think it's just overall pounding the the hill running kicking the bag and all that shit yeah I need to let it fully set in before I go back to doing that shit so I'm just doing a bunch of other different stuff now a lot of yoga the cryogenics help um it'll help someone you know what would cryogenics is really good for is first of all it's really good for your mood if you've never done it before the best kind of the Conway you're you get your whole body in there not just your neck down the neck down is okay it's definitely better than nothing but the real feeling is when your head's under and your whole body is like immersed in this air that's cooled by liquid nitrogen it's fucking freezing dude yeah you've done it no I wanna do it let's do it today yeah I'll do it we'll do it today okay we're gonna do it - you're gonna love it it's a freak out man it's a freak out how long do you stay in 40 minutes and then I stay out for ten minutes and I do another three minutes yeah you feel amazing afterwards it'll fix my knee well it won't fix it it'll reduce inflammation no but norepinephrine that's what it's called right is that the word sure that stuff gets radically boosted in your brain it helps a lot of people with arthritis a lot of people who have a lot of inflammation it helps them said I say it I said it right it ramps that shit up you feel so good when you get out of a leg whew it lasts a while - yeah we're just freezing to death you were freezing to death you were on your way to death and you step out of any like wow it's just everything just feels whoa really yeah it feels good man it feels good yeah I saw I fucking loved swimming in cold water it's amazing for you yeah the way you feel when you get out - but here's the thing it's not the best thing to do if you're trying to gain muscle weight you have to wait a while after the exercise like there's apparently there's there's a bunch of different studies and I know Andy Calvin's been involved in a bunch of these studies and Rhonda Patrick has discussed some of this research as well but what happens is there's a window of time after you lift weights we should just leave your body alone and not ice anything and that this is more beneficial to gaining strength and and explosiveness and mass and stuff like that but that after a window of time then it's beneficial to get into the fruit the ice bath or to do cryo or something like that you want to give yourself your body a period of time to physiologically adjust to the work like your body knows what's happened but Oh Greg did deadlifts today okay okay okay we got all get everything in place get it but if you freeze it right there then it has an effect on the over and I might be butchering this but I think it has effect and the overall amount of gains that you can make okay your body's not sending the chemicals to the muscle the way it would right see if you could find out that's true that's a figure out how to Google that one how do you do with that one yeah post-workout cryotherapy and hypertrophy because that's what their that's what they're trying to they're trying to figure out whether or not it's beneficial or not in that case so they think that it's really good for the mood and it's really good for people with joint issues a lot of folks that that go there they have like back surgery or back issues and it gives them a lot of relief and you can do it every day too because it's only three minutes the thing about something like that is it's not it's not like any other kind of therapy like you can't do it any longer it's not like you're being a pussy because you're only doing it for three minutes mhm bitch you can't even do three minutes yeah I bet the first time you go in there are two minutes like fuck this yeah yeah at two minutes you probably ready to bail but then your body will get used to it then you can do three minutes but it's it's very controversial spread especially because a woman died there was really I guess yeah a woman in Vegas was operating it herself and apparently she was not in the right height and the liquid nitrogen was getting into her lungs she was breathing it in and she passed out and she passed out and froze to death Wow yeah terrifying she had again I think the story was that she had worked there and you know she was after hours just doing therapy on herself and she fucking fell asleep in there they should never do that by herself if you do it at a reputable place to always be someone standing by watching while you're in they stand outside the door while you're inside of it mm-hmm it's scary though I realized when you're in there you like this is this is something you can't survive for that long you can survive it for a few minutes but you you're literally exposing yourself to something that is 100% fatal if you stay in it yeah now it's like cold water mm-hmm you don't have to be in freezing cold water they say the amount of hours you can survive in water is like surprisingly warm yeah it's like in the 40s you can die mm-hm after a couple hours yep I'm throwing numbers out but no surprising yeah that getting wet is one of the most dangerous things that can ever happen to you if you're in the winter in the mountains yeah it's one of the most dangerous things you fall into water they actually have rewarming drills that they teach people particularly soldiers and outdoorsmen that are interested in this shit my friend John Barlow he works for Sitka that's a premier Outdoor company they make like hunting clothes and stuff like that and they have a whole video on how to do a rewarming drill and so what he does is him and his friend jump into a frozen river and then go into a tent and heat themselves back up again Wow dude you watch this and your whole body just goes ahh because you there in the winter and they jump into a river they've got to move the ice around and hop in this fucking frozen stream and they go all the way under and then they come out with their soaked down and all their soaked wool clothes and they're soaked synthetics and they get into a tent they climb into their sleeping bags and they try to heat themselves up if you yeah if you have no access to a building a house no shower know that you're fucked you're out in the woods there's very specific things that you have to do in order to survive yeah if you you don't follow the right steps you absolutely will die hmm yeah it's really common that kills more people than probably anything in the woods freezing today yeah that movie revenant freaked me out just going into the woods up north for three months yeah to collect pelts and you're walking through fucking streams and it's pouring rain and you got no heat or no electricity fuck that yeah that's how people died a lot of people lived that way too a lot of people lived that way until they died I mean that do you think about those people that made it across this country and the people like Lewis and Clark and all these pioneers they just didn't even know what the fuck was around the next corner right and they just walked on through with would they have like donkeys with shit on their back yeah how much food you have yeah do you even know where the fuck you're going you hit an impasse you you hiked four miles and then you come up to a mountain and you got to double back and go around Jesus Christ no Google Earth no nothing shit Maps dogshit maps written by people you hope knew what the fuck they were talking about you know you get maps from Native Americans get maps from a sailor and then you randomly go into the wrong territory and Indians want to kill you you know there's an interesting film that's out on Netflix right now the ballot of Buster Scruggs it's a yeah comoving and it's all about that yeah about the Old West right it's really weird man yes so weird they are the weirdest guys of all time the Coen brothers yeah yeah Big Lebowski one of my all-time favorite yeah they've just made so many cool weird films but this one's really weird it's like a bunch of non connected stories I thought they were connected but they're not they just all taken place in the same time period Wow all the Old West and they end pretty similar like they're all fucking dark and you got to go go into it I would highly recommend it but go into it knowing it's gonna be fucking dark you got to go there yeah just accept it but Tom Waits his one is fucking amazing amazing yeah dude amazing yeah I thought it was Nick Nolte for a second hell yeah an ulti alright dude it is so good that one that one was really good the singer guy was really good I love that he well I don't want to spoil it I don't know it's yeah they're all they're all great but at the end of it I was like what the fuck that I just watch yeah did you ever watch that would I never did know what the thing about Deadwood is I watched it once and they were swearing so much that my bullshit alarm went off that's why I stopped watching yeah I was like I don't think people talked like that back then yeah because they didn't talk like that in the 50s and the 60s see like the trend doesn't make sense if people talked like that in the Wild West then what where did that go where'd that go that all went into the ether like they had kids they raised their children the children around this kind of language and somehow another it escaped and it went away and it stopped that's not how the world works right the world doesn't work that way the world works in the way that like you slowly introduce fucked-up words and then they become like the word fuck have you said the word fuck on television in the 1950s you would get arrested Yeah right yeah how was that pasta on stage you get arrested with Lenny Bruce George Carlin how is it possible that that is a hundred years removed from people saying it with abandon constantly I don't believe it yeah like I think a better example of what it was probably like is like gangs of new york and then it's probably more accurate yeah like that was probably what people were like right then right there were probably brutal as fuck but I bet they didn't swear as much as we like to think they did yeah the deadwood thing was like they were using it as a I mean maybe I need to go back and watch it before I talk shit but it felt like they were using it almost like to modernize it yeah well you know they were having these people talk like scallywags would talk today right they also say cursing is cultural like if you if you're in a you know they talk about how black people curse versus how Protestants curse this is coffee yeah I'll have some more that this this article about it says that they purposefully changed the words because to make it more contemporary because people have been buying if they're saying tarnation and goldarn and shit like that yeah yeah exactly but imagine if they do that with Vikings you know like yo we pillaging or what what are we doing gone but fuck man yeah I want to be king of this bitch yo thought let's let loose on this shit let's let loose on these bitches yeah I mean maybe that's that's real similar yeah see that's why okay so I'm not wrong yeah they did it on purpose they're bringing it back they're making a movie something or other bringing series back cuz it ed in the middle of season 2 in that writers strike happens right it's kind of I heard there's adults Viking one that's on Netflix now it's a I think it's a comedy is it oh yeah eight what is that Norse Norse gods no that's not I don't think that's the one out somebody else told me Norsemen is that it that might be it is that is that a comedy no it's weird my kids fucking curse and I never cursed around the house my wife cursed a little but now suddenly it's okay and they're 15 and 18 but it's suddenly okay that were at dinner and just fuck gets thrown around all the time okay that is it Norseman it's just kinda comedic five - I don't know if it's like a full on oh okay just based off that looks like some Monty Python yeah well why not hurt it's good though but I don't have a liven this might be it was this too many new shows I can't keep yeah I can't keep up I know it's uh it's like it's great this such high quality the things are so good but it's not great in that you can't keep up have you started watching the marvelous mrs. Mazal yeah I saw the first season and then maybe one or two of the second season but it just I really liked I think she's fucking great obviously the cast Tony Shalhoub but it just got so Jewish don't say anything cuz I'm I'm just starting it okay this is what I did you're gonna love it up I fucked up and started with season two how you did started with episode 1 season 2 got to episode 3 I was like what's wrong with this yeah that's hilarious no I didn't even know so many other tell me someone need to tell me the store I forget who told me but I went back and watched the first episode of season 1 I was like holy shit this is even better but I thought it was good watching the first episode of season 2 not even knowing how she got there because I knew was about stand-up I knew she was a comic but then going back and watching it from season 1 I'm like oh okay yeah I think there's a lot there's a lot of stuff about how they and writing on a show that's similar and that it's about a comedian starting out on crashing it's I think they really capture the process of somebody brand new finding their voice onstage yeah yeah and the managers great the woman that plays our manager there's always somebody like that that's in your corner that's helping you develop yourself and and she's she's natural onstage I buy it I buy her as a stand-up onstage I buy her as being actually funny yeah yeah and it's interesting seeing Lenny Bruce the guy who plays with any Bruce is very good yeah who's that guy who's her too her name and uh spoiler alert you get to see her breasticles fantastic by the way Lord good Lord thank you Jesus I had to do a search not that I was but no I did a search on her news just let it go I did a thing on her news old she probably put it up so she won the Emmy she won the gold wow this year for that yeah yeah Rachel Brosnahan and Michaels Egan and now Joel nasal gray and who is who's playing Lenny Bruce is that the guy Luke Kirby Luke Kirby Luke Kirby outstanding he did a great job he sounded like him you know he sounds without doing an obvious impression it sounds like he's got the tone right yeah it's got the inflection right it's not overly stylized no no no it's satin that you believe it yeah he did a great job of like seeming like a guy doing stand-up in front of a room people not like an actor playing a standup well the woman that created the show apparently her dad was a stand-up and he knew Lenny Bruce which is why she put him in the series because he's the only historical figure on the show right right yeah well it's also the show mmm they take some liberties with the history like they're what I don't think there was a comedy club back then you know this Gaslight called it that's down I don't think that was real I don't think there really was a comedy club back then I think back then people were just doing poetry nights and they were doing you know they did be like musician then a comedian comedians would host things right I don't think there was necessarily a comedy club yeah I think that came later yeah it's like catch arising star came out of being a cabaret and you know people would sing there and then suddenly people started doing stand-up there and the two existed together for years before it became a comedy good we should we should actually know this why do we not know what was the very first comedy club well it was a catch there was the hungry eye and San Francisco was at the first night it was the 60s though was that one yeah that was the 60s because the Ice House is the oldest running comedy club in the world the ice house is the oldest all the other old ones are gone except the ice house and the comedy and magic club is right on its heels alright that's that's probably second but what was the well that place is called The Gaslight yeah and I think there was a Gaslight I think it was a comedy club though I don't think the the way they did it which was great and again I don't want to give give too much of it away but the way they did it where like people were getting bumped like she got bumped yeah like I don't think that that was what guys did where they ran around doing fifteen minutes and go from one club to another New York comics do it now right I don't think that's real yeah but that's a nitpicky thing that's it's more you know it's more indicative I think of how people do it today mm-hmm do you think they were do I mean who in the fuck know so maybe they drop in back then maybe they did have nights like several nights where they had just comedy yeah this is booked by Cliff Nestor off about the history of comedy you read that no he's great I don't know but it's cliff any ste ROV and I had about my podcast a couple times he's great but the real first comedy shows in New York were the comedian's drunks thieves scoundrels in the history of American comedy did you find anything about the oldest or the first stand-up comedy club arguably it was in the United Kingdom in 1979 it was the comedy storm before that they would just perform okay dishonest English motherfucker got a hold of Wikipedia well that was everything that's just started the United Kingdom in the United States history it goes back into the 19th century in vaudeville places and so it just depends on when somebody first turned their venue right but what I'm saying is who called who was who had the various comedy club yeah did the hungry I San Francisco yeah so the hungry I was a 100% comedy club yeah and then the bitter end which was music and comedy hmm interesting in New York so those are the ones and what yours that it says in the 50s into the 60s it doesn't have a particularly wow mort's all I think Mort Sahl still around Google that I think he is I think he's still doing stand-up I think dick dick Gregory's around sitting I think that Gregory died oh he did is that true find out that first cuz I'm a dick yeah um yeah Dick Gregory funeral yeah yeah he died but I think Lenny Bruce might have started at the hungry eye as well I think he started in San Francisco I think you're right yeah yeah that was uh the beatniks right yeah let into the is he still around god damn you Mort Sahl still rockin nineteen ninety-one years old motherfucker Wow outlived them all good for him yeah all these guys were the originators I mean without them these are this is the original roots of the tree of stand-up comedy 100% right yeah we do know James it's a a crazy history you really stop and think about the the year it starts in the 60s and that before that it didn't exist like that like it was kind of a thing that people did there was court jesters there was funny people there was comedy in various plays and musicals there was comedic elements well there's cabaret yeah and there was emcees people would emcee things but in terms of like someone going specifically to see someone say things in a funny way just talking in front of a microphone that shit was really recent yeah that's what the fuck would we do well we might we might have done vaudeville from town to town your suitcase has no wheels on it you're lugging that shit on a train Oh fun no few young yeah you're young fun because if you think you're a big deal when you go to a town now go to fucking Columbus Ohio in 1919 and and perform you would be like a god to them you'd also be like a carnie yeah traveling from town to town probably fucking real loose with your morals Yeah right spreading god-knows-what around the Midwest all kinds of STDs and yeah io u--'s and babies constantly nobody pulled out I used a rubber in the 1910s right and they're also like they're living a savage life like to expect them to find a nice gal in Kansas and settle down that's right they just they're working the tilt-a-whirl and they got to prop it up with logs cuz the left side doesn't have a leg and that thing spin so you got to keep an eye on it you don't want to launch anybody into the parking lot and if you do you just pack up and move to the next town they just get the lawyers there's no way to track him on the Internet yeah they say you know a lot of those early it was very Jewish because Jews were having a hard time getting hired and so that was one of the few places they could work and that's why they say comedy was a very Jewish thing Oh interest leading into the borscht belt and all that Stan and olives but we just came out it's basically about this Laurent harlot party were vaudeville touring comedians in 1920s when did this come out just came out in the theaters right now no shit I used to be good yeah about two weeks ago and stan and Ollie stand for forget the Laurel and Hardy right yeah john c reilly and steve coogan Wow guys are both amazing yeah John see Raleigh's excellent I don't know who Steve Coogan is who Steve Coogan he's a British stand-up I think but that's cool I'm glad someone okay oh I've seen that guy in stuff before I'm glad someone's doing that Charlie Chapman was supposedly a bad motherfucker yeah he would go up to the Hearst Castle and fuck hearse wife Oh in the castle no you ever go up to that castle yeah when I was looking amazing yeah and yeah Chaplin would go up he was fucking everybody everybody's wife yeah he got off on wives really yeah there was a thing yeah so dangerous imagine the only happy if you're banging someone else's woman Wow that's crazy guess there's no there's no commitment maybe that it and if she gets pregnant you know he'll claim it he'll claim the baby there at the Hearst Castle Wow whoa that's him with the cigarette yeah that's so weird 1930s banging her this means Hearst would have hundreds of guests every weekend they had rooms for hundreds of people and they would have hunts they would fucking hunt during the day or you know they play tennis and then everybody would meet four high balls at like five o'clock in one room and giant fireplaces and then they have set dinners with fucking servants and if you got an invite to that he went for you go for like three weeks what yeah you come look at that dining hall you know what that looks like that looks like the haunted dining hall in the Disney ride the Haunted Mansion and past that you ever seen that do you know I'm talking about it got inspired from something I guarantee that's what it got inspired by it looks so much like that so look at that image right now and now Google the dining room at the haunted mansion Disneyland as seen when you fly by and you're on the little train and you pass by and all the ghosts are dancing around shit it's beautiful looks just like that and then it was as if all the grounds were a zoo at Hearst Castle that was fucking giraffes running around zebras he's like El Chapo he couldn't get rid of his money he had so much fucking money that's a shit image of it they don't good image of it oh all right how's that possible huh I really supposed to take pictures in there are you yeah that's a good point yeah Wow so everybody but everybody does now but people are always taking pictures of shit you take pictures of your kids in there mmm anyway it looks real similar to that but yeah that guy had way too much money he brought over wild boars he's the reason why California has a wild pig problem no shit yes Wow him that fuck goddamn yeah wild boars they didn't they go hunt them yeah come here Wow that's why there's a hole like it's not down here see it's not Southern California they're all up there yeah they're they're slowly making their way down here uh-huh but the ones that are down here the closest they are is to hone ranch to hone ranch is about an hour and a half from here and they have wild pigs is it that hard to just get a bunch of guys with ak-47s and hunt them down stop that hard but you can't do that in California California you can get depredation permits and they have gotten depredation permits and they hunt them at night with night vision because sometimes the pigs will start making their way into agriculture or they start making their way into the like they'll lay down some fresh sod and put some grass down and these pigs will destroy thousands of dollars in landscaping damage yeah when they prove that that's happening then they get a special permit and then they could just start whacking yeah and then they just take out like everything at night and they do it you know sniper rifles and shit but then when a normal person wants to like say if you wanted to kill a wild pig now you know you can get as many licenses as you'd like you can get five licenses you can get six low so you can go out and shoot six pigs in a day it's totally legal as long as you pay for each individual tag because the the understanding is that at least in most places California's the only place that treats it like game in most places you don't even have to have tags for them most place they're encouraging you to shoot them and that'll probably be the case in California eventually like it isn't like Texas France for instance right Texas is a real pig problem they have a giant oh shit there's millions and millions and millions of pigs oh I remember that from the Friday night Late Show at The Improv in Houston you said that was you really had me believing they didn't believe it and you're setting up to joke the holds aisle it's nice I think it's like that with alligators in Florida too yeah when I was a kid they were an endangered species they would ask us to please not feed them marshmallows because I lived in Gainesville right by this place called Lake Alice yeah lake outside alligators I was fucking 11 years old I was crazy yeah there's a goddamn dinosaur but there was a small population of them cuz they had been whacked into oblivion before making suitcases out of him and then they made it illegal to hunt them and they made him a protected species but then they fucked up they over protected those goddamn super lizards or everywhere now they're fucking everywhere my mom belongs to a golf course down in Florida where she lives and there's this alligators apparently like this fucking 14-foot alligator and the people were playing golf and there was a deer and everybody's on the everybody's standing there going like fucking alligator comes out grabs it pulls it into the water does that spin move takes it to the bottom fucking done so everyone's talking about it what do we do about it so about three weeks later my mom is out on the course and her ball is right next to the lake where the alligator is and she forgets and she goes over and her ball is right on the edge and she's standing there and she was standing on some fucking like dead some dead grass and it gave out and she fell in the fucking Lake up to her neck and then she remembered and she fucking started scrambling up the mud and grabbing at the reeds to get out of there and and her and the people that she was with had left who she was playing by herself for some reason and she fucking got out of there and got in the cart and and then she just started laughing oh my god my little mother my little five-foot-two mother oh my god we're having a tasty meal happen so quick yeah better than a dear old lady nice soft old lady way way more tender yeah corn-fed my mom's corn-fed I never told you that no yeah yeah I thought she was organic no no we let her free-range though sometimes there's a great story about a car chase cops were chasing this dude was so in car and the guy jumps off a bridge into the water and immediately gets eaten by alligators Wow yeah he's like a little overpass over a river she just hops out of the fucking car jumps into the river and smash he lands right in front of an alligator no Jax him in front of the cops Wow what do you do if you're a cop do you shoot at the alligator you try to kill the alligator what it's calling a guy good point I mean that's a reckless thing to be doing when there's a lot of thrashing around you just gonna empty your clip pop out you know I mean how much distance is there between the bridge and the water would right what can the cop do well you know the guy's gonna die so I think it's a I think it's a safe bet to take some shots anyway I think it's a not safe bet to take some shots because if you're a cop what have you hit the guy and they said oh you shot a man trying to cover up I got some fucking alligators eat them it's true you got what the alligator him now go save your job hear about the guy there was a guy flying a plane from Florida to Cuba or Cuba to Florida and the plane fuckin went down and he survived the crash and then got eaten by sharks that 20-minute period where you're floating in the water but you're thankful and you're almost giddy I did it I fuckin survived oh my god yeah bad day well you know that story about the World War two boat that sank and the guys were floating around sea for several days and most of them got eaten by sharks you know that's the the story that they talked about in the beginning of Jaws yeah remember where the the captain the captains it the fucking scars and he starts talking about his his time on the boat yeah do you remember that seemed very Scheider no not Roy Scheider the guy was talking to Roy Scheider okay the who's that guys what's that guy's name again old-time actor the guy was fucking amazing just pull up Charles no no no no no Richard Dreyfus was a scientist Roy Scheider was the sheriff Richard Dreyfus was the scientist and then there's a older gentleman oh yeah right she steals that fuck fuck yeah he steals that movie where is he yeah he steals that fucking movie he steals that fucking movie you believe him wait so what was the opening scene not the opening scene but he describes what it was like no that's a different shark attack typed in World War 2 follow the naval ship yeah that's it that's it I'm sorry I was thinking once it's worth shark attack and history I was thinking it was that story about New Jersey where the bull sharks killed people scroll back up so I could see what it says er 1945 u.s. naval ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine the ship sinking was just the beginning of the sailors nightmare yeah that's the boat that's the story how many people died shitload let's see almost 300 people died yeah of the 1196 been aboard 900 made it into the water alive their ordeal so that's that's how many survived the crash so there's 900 of them that are alive now how many of them make it to the end out of 900 SPRO its growth scroll it scroll it yeah this is they're just giving you the full line of the story that not giving just the actual facts 317 remained so so almost 600 people got eat estimates of the number who died from shark attacks range from a few dozen to almost a hundred and 50 so the other people died from other things starvation probably oh he stroked being in the water and so I bet when those guys died then the Sharks ate them and it got even worse fuck man Wow that's fucking crazy just imagine 150 people eaten by sharks the amount of blood in the water fucking christ that you know but when you're around any kind of thing that can eat you and kill you it puts it all into perspective that you're not you're not around that enough it's not it's not like you should be around it all the time but you should know it's a real thing and when you're around it you go like oh oh sharks just will just eat you Oh a bear will just eat you Oh about lion will just eat you Oh like these people that got killed this year was our 2018 at least was very rare and that two people were documented killed by mountain lions in the Pacific Northwest one guy in Portland outside of Portland one guy outside of Seattle it's pretty rare that mountain lions do that but Oh Matt Lions will just eat you oh that can happen - like we think we're so safe and I think it I think you're right it would keep you in the moment I think we should release like grizzly in cities just because like you might be worried about oh my the fucking stock markets down or I think my wife's cheating yeah you're in the moment but then you gonna have to allow people to be armed to protect themselves guys gonna have open carry fucking ARS slung around their shoulders looking over bears everywhere yeah taking a kid to school you better bring the rifle she's only two blocks away yeah bro bringing the rifle saw bear here a couple of days ago okay imagine you walk outside your house and you hear a branch snapping you turn and you see a 900-pound wild dog like thing and that's not that's not one chef that's gotta be a pretty good gun to take that thing down nine-millimeter now it's just gonna eat your bullets all right it's gonna kill you anyway fuck yeah you would have to you'd have to have a perfect shot right in the perfect part of its brain to shut it off quick to prevent you from getting mauled the amount of strength that they have - you'd be like a water balloon they like tearing open a bag like a ziploc bag full of jello yeah they just rip you apart yeah going back to that movie revenant that fucking bear attack was insane the bear attacks nothing compared to what really happens yeah like if he really got bit by a bear but like that like he'd probably be right destroyed like I think the guy that was the we're really happened to him in real life it's kind of based really loosely on a story I think he got kind of like a little malt mm-hmm that was enough yeah a little malt leave you like that that bear was throwing him around for like yeah yeah that bear would have killed you yeah you'd have no bones left snapped everything into a fine powder just crush you and then eat you right fuck yeah why not eat you especially once you start stinking they like to bury things let them rot for a while uh-huh they do my friend Adam he shot a moose in Canada and bears claimed it and he went back in this video of it it's so spooky whoa who says buried it's a giant big-ass moose by the time they got you know they shoot it and then it goes it runs away and then you have to track it you have to let it let it die it takes a little while so you the smart thing to do is to sit out for a couple hours it'll be dead for sure but what you don't want to do is spook it while it's injured if it's not a perfect hit if it runs away because then it's gonna just keep running run for a long time on adrenaline so the the correct move is if you don't see an animal die you don't see you see it run into the woods you wait and you wait just as a precautionary mother well the damned will died in seconds and a bear claimed it immediately it died probably right in front of them what state was this this is an Alaska so the bear is just there the moves dies right in front of him he's like oh look at that that's mine it starts eating it and he starts covering it up so eat some of it covers it up they come tracking in a hour later or so it's already covered in dirt Wow oh that's crazy oh yeah holy shit yeah fuck no I don't know think about what it takes to take fucking frozen mud round myself they might have shot it and taken some of the meat and we're going back to pack it out because sometimes when you hunt you'll hunt with one person but when then you go back to pack out a big animal you bring like five or six can I help you yeah but this is the video of it look at this to give me some volume hole moose is buried yeah that's my movies under there yeah whoa yeah I don't like this so everything is like you know five and a half feet high grass or you know you see I mean how tall is that grass four four-and-a-half feet at least yeah so bears could be in that shit they could be hunkered down in that shit so I'm seeing the skull on the ground and the skulls skinned out so what that means to me is that he had already started butchering the the moose and probably went back to it so that's I was kind of correct that was right about that or not but so this is what happened they could only take some of the meat because they were terrified the Bears gonna come back and I only think they had a gun on them and you know I just scan in the area see how the the boots the head is already off of the antlers yeah you know and so this is the next video that's scary shit man so they didn't even see the bear they just know it was a bear exactly yeah think about the strength to take frozen earth like that and dig it out yeah what's the type of bear you know if you run into a black bear you're more likely to be thought of as food it's kind of interesting like you're more likely predation on humans is more common with black bears they just decide to try to eat you but with Grizzlies Grizzlies are it's rarer that a grizzly decides to eat you decided to chase you down and eat you it's more common that you fuck up and run into a female hmm or you try to steal his food like that like they had to get the fuck out yeah because if he just decided to run at them they got a real giant problem most the time a bear won't though they're cautious they'll stay they'll hang back cuz they figure what you gonna do you're gonna eat that whole moose they're gonna leave me some I ate a bunch I'm gonna wait a little while see what the fuck you're doing he's probably full anyway yes but they had to get out of there they only took a little bit of the meat and they took off like it's too dangerous it used to be everywhere it needs to be ever in California that's why it's on our flag yeah we killed them all not we you and I were in Boston yeah we didn't kill anybody and kill anybody they killed all the grizzly bears in California yeah but it's still an under state flag the state flag has a fucking grizzly bear California doesn't have any Grizzlies right it's weird yeah I was in Alaska once and they were they were like raccoons they were behind restaurants going through dumpsters around or brown bears or black men I think they were I don't want both they've both up there black bears become more well they all become a problem if they start getting around garbage because then they're smart they know where the garbage is yeah just keep returning right there's a place called Levesque the vet California it's off to five and it's named that way for the last guy to die in a bear attack in California oh really yeah huh they're like enough e fuck enough apparently they wound up digging this guy up afterwards find out the story's true and he was just in pieces yeah shit all right so coastal bear to Zaire bear attack shark attack or dying in a cryogenics tank died in the crowd would be way less painful you just freeze that's the way to go I don't know if that's the way to go though because then you're not gonna get eaten like shouldn't you return to nature yeah I mean you really should be eating and I would rather be eaten by one of my kind which is a ground animal those fucking cunts in the water I can't eaten by those heartless assholes I don't even take care of their babies yeah you know a bear at least takes care of their young I mean they're they're they're shitheads they eat their babies too and especially males males kill babies left and right they actually actively go after them and kill them but sort of sharks sharks sharks have inter womb competition they eat each other inside the womb oh no she Wow you ever see like a an MRI of sharks in the womb now it's a monster movie that's insane is that real those images that's a good question I've seen those much done I feel like it might have been from a movie but I'm looking at now let's see I think it's real I think the reason why I thought it was fake and then I found it was real it's one of those either I thought it was real and I found out was fake or I thought it was fake I found out it's real but the image is if it's real it's fucking amazing it's these little monsters inside a inside a womb and then you gotta think you know I guess no one had it fuck it because it lay the eggs out and the men just jizz on the eggs really yeah that's how it works they don't fuck have a terrible life Wow yeah the women lay the eggs on the floor could salmon that's what happens that happens with trout they lay the eggs out and the men come by and shoot loads all over them yeah and then the things pop up and no one takes care of anybody Wow all those kids just grow up without parents parents don't give a fuck about then the parents will eat them yeah happens all the time with little fish now bigger fish is hungry there's eat that they don't even know if there's fuckin eating it I'm hungry they just they have a system of maintaining a population and when there's not enough food no some of you guys gotta go I don't remember this in Finding Nemo is it wasn't in there they fucking left it out they didn't even eat yeah all those bear movies the movies about bears when Disney they don't eat yeah how come they're not chasing down mooses and assholes right tear and Bambi apart and eating their face while back legs are kickin the Bears just hold them down neat and like a grape eating that ass yeah okay yeah it's um it's very inconvenient to show that in the Lion King the show has a lot how these lines where there's their food I never eat everything is a battle we're going to war with people trying to reign retain their Kingdom all right where's the snack where's all the food yeah how come I come I don't see that you're fucking with kids giving kids bad information that would be a great movie to do a feature-length animated movie where you show how it really works oh my god the killing awful yeah be awful yeah cats cats are the population control of the world those motherfuckers faster than everybody can only eat meat and all they do is just run around and try to catch people slipping mm-hmm try to catch animals slipping try to catch any they're just they're just Darwinism yeah they'll eat bugs and Lion King come on yeah come on that's a bug that he just ate yeah it's like they've met Timon and Pumbaa and he showed them how to get grubs or something like that and that's what in the fuck kind of propaganda horseshit is this that guy that's anti-american but it the way his dad does is in a stampede of like wildebeest which he probably was attacking I just don't remember them showing that in that movie at all that's how they really yeah see the problem is kids grow up and they see this stuff and the soft-headed amongst them will then think that animals are really like that so they'll venture out into the forest to try to make friends you just have to be open spiritually yeah just go to the Lions Den yeah open yourself up spiritually and let the forest know I talked to a lady once she was a yoga lady and she was talking about Colorado and she's like when I walk into the woods I just walk out there and say I'm walking out here with love please do not harm me like yeah that's not gonna work they let's see you're having your period get back in the car well not only that they don't it's not a morality thing it's not a good or bad thing it's like some things going to get eaten if you're out there and you're the slow thing you're going to get eaten no offense no one's mad at you yeah it's just Darwinism you're the wheat calf if this is not a this is not a discerning organism that's got moral value that it places on you know attacking thugs only or not going after yoga instructors Oh Oh slow she ate that I can eat yep there's they have no language they're just they're just an organism looking to survive complex set of reinforcements and and reward systems that are set up for it to be an incredibly efficient predator yeah fuck does he only see male lions the size of that oh dude just the biggest jaws do powerful yeah so the shark thing I found articles saying what you were saying could not find a video and I do believe when we found that before it was fake I'm trying to find Google even like fake oh the Sharks know the sharks in the body just Google MRI image I found something that kind of contradicts it though this is a dead shark that they performed a c-section on and there was 98 live pups inside wow yeah that's true but that doesn't mean that it happens every time no I know what I had read was that it happens often this is the only thing I can find of a shark that's 90 look at all those nuts and so he's just throwing him in the water he's pulling him out and saving them that is nuts man look at all those little monsters just swarming around do you know they fuck that's crazy do you know that millions literally millions of sharks are hunted and killed every year that's crazy all for the soup that's mostly yeah you know that's changed people's attitudes on shark fishing because people used to catch shark and used to get it at restaurants all the time I remember you remember on the East Coast he'd get mako shark yeah fucking player yeah right pimp Oh consumption right lemon some butter yeah right it was a common thing they'd serve in restaurants how many sharks are fin Oh research indicates that about a hundred million sharks are killed each year Wow eleven sharks an hour that isn't crap this is by finning that's incredible it's likely that many sharks are caught without being reported oh so that okay so this is just what they're reporting my god that's sick this is like the first time I can remember in history that people are concerned with people fishing for sharks because we talked about this was the governor in New York who was it who was the cat that got in trouble for legally catching a shark and cooking it needing it I want to say was the governor governor of New York but Cuomo I thought maybe the government son whatever the fuck it is Jamiel find it andrew Cuomo tweeted a picture of himself yeah after yeah so this was all normal when we were kids this was normals fuck like that might as well be a Marlin or a halibut just you got a shark oh cool what's it taste like oh it's good it's good you cook it with lemon like swordfish very similar yeah I remember eating shark yeah it's a little tough a hundred eighty four pound thresher shark so that's um you know Mako was particularly delicious it really does taste a lot like swordfish but in our lifetime it's now become taboo because people have this rough idea of what a shark is and that sharks are being targeted and sharks are being murdered and there's a small amount of sharks left I don't know if that's accurate cuz I think this is just in one part of the world they're killing off all these sharks it's like if you say that there's no more grizzly bears left well if you're talking about California you're right but if you're talking about British Columbia you're wrong there's a fuckload of them up there yeah and they're scary they're big they're big and they're fast and they need to eat every day and they berries if they find berries they'll eat some berries or they eat your asshole too I present would you would you say this is it this is happening is it let's do it right yeah I was in Alaska once and I was in I forget what town but there was an island called Bear Island okay and I rented this guy had a had a 1948 I think was called us Stenson there's some kind of plane prop plane and I paid him a hundred bucks to take me over bear island and this fucking shitty little plane and we went out there and it took him like 30 minutes to get the plane start and I was like I should get the fuck out of here and so so we go up and and the thing is getting tossed around by wind and and we go out and we go over bear island he's showing me fucking bear all of it was like the highest concentration of bear into anywhere in Alaska Jesus Christ those bears are giant two miles yeah those the coastal bears they're all eating seafood they're eating like fish and salmon and they just get enormous yeah they're so big there's so much bigger than bears that are inland like hundreds of pounds what are the inland bears eat whatever the fuck they get ahold of my elite salmon if they find salmon if there's a Salmon River the lead fish they'll eat berries well he calves eat a lot of calves did a lot of calf's of elk and moose and deer fawns the small things it can't get away I need everything they can yeah they're so big yes just imagine how much food you would have to eat if you weighed 800 pounds how much food you have to eat every day well four times as much as you eat now look at that fucking creep yeah look at that fucking long nailed creep that's a monster man yeah but we think it's yogi oh look he's so cute he will eat your kid in front of you yeah and that's what they have to do I mean they're they're predators they're out there they're they're omnivores I mean they do occasionally eat whatever the fuck they want they'll eat roots and berries they'll eat everything else too but they'll definitely eat you yeah and love it yeah have a good old time yeah that's Salmons a perfect food for them it's all fat yeah just store it up yup it's almost like it's designed for them too because the salmon die they literally die on the river like you don't you have to catch them how I didn't know that every year oh when they have to die they go back up to where they were born right yes yeah yes they say that once the salmon make the trek from the ocean to the freshwater they're already on a path to die their clock has already gone over it's already flipped over into no return land you couldn't take him out of there and bring them to like some salmon pond they live forever it doesn't work that way there they they breed they make the track they breed and when they get to the spot where you know when they were then their life their their body starts changing color they start getting mushy they look rotten and they just fucking wind up like pooling up on the ground and then the Bears move in and they eat hundreds of rotten ones see this is this is while the salmon are in the run and these Bears are there fighting over territory look at the size of these motherfuckers Jesus Christ dude they're fighting over who gets to salmon yeah but these are salmon that are still pretty fresh and healthy they're swimming around they look good and so they catch them like that's a perfectly healthy salmon and he catches it right in the middle of it we're tried look he's all slow-mo and shit here he goes they trying they catch some of them oh look at that imagine just standing in freezing cold water waiting to catch something with your mouth it's delicious right but they figured it out and it works yeah look at the Cubs like come on mom it's a fuck so mom's probably going to give him some of that yeah see she breaks off pieces of it and so they just keep doing that back and forth and they'll do that all day but then once the salmon are done with their run then they just die and coincidentally when they're dying is probably right when the Bears are trying to fatten up and get ready for hibernation so though like sort of happens together and they're all in the right place at the right time all right see if you find bears eating rotten salmon because like sometimes they'll pull up and these these rivers and these like little ponds and shit and you just see there's all these bears just chew on these rotten carcasses yeah yeah those salmon are endangered now we eat so much more fish yeah remember when I was a kid I'd have fish once every three weeks now yeah I mean maybe it's because we're in LA but I have fished a few times a week do you yeah if some fucking sushi one day wife will cook some salmon on another day go get one of those pokeballs we're constantly eating salmon it's a lot of food think about all those little organisms and I have to fuck will not really shoot loads on eggs yeah make new organisms and then all the people with nets scooping them up do you see a tuna got sold in Japan for the highest amount ever three million dollars for a tuna shit I had no idea did you have any idea that a tuna could be three million dollars I know that they wait on the dock and in Japan and whoever is like certain chefs have more cachet and they're able to come in first and pick the the tuna but then they but then they auction them off and yeah they go for crazy money that's so crazy that's a giant fucking fish though isn't it like 600 pounds or something how much like oh yeah least 278 kilograms what's that in English yeah look at that thing god damn that's how hard that is to bring in yeah I caught a yellowtail in Hawaii that was like 11 pounds boy oh yeah battle really what a battle yeah six hundred and thirteen pounds Wow yeah we caught of quite a few of them you know what's interesting they're catching ones they're calling hamachi because they were actually from a hamachi farm that was on the Big Island that broke during the storm I render that storm there a couple years back giant fucking hurricane Hawaii well it destroyed this this containment area that they had where they were farm raising hamachi for like sushi and shit so now this type of yellowtails everywhere in the ocean oh wow yeah we caught it quite a few of them did you eat him the other great so you caught it there you brought it back to the hotel and then they fried it yeah it really good for you yeah yeah oh it's amazing so good they made sushi for us they made they made sashimi they made ceviche they baked it they cooked it a couple of different ways but you know they're so powerful a ten pound one nine pound one is so powerful you can't believe how strong they are yeah like you're wrestling so imagine that thing 600 pounds yeah holy shit the whole family fish no just my youngest yeah did she love it loves that she loves fishing yeah yeah we put a video up of the dolphins that were with us I saw that that's crazy I was amazing you just never seen that many dolphin swim with a boat being here it was incredible they just all pop we just hit the right spot yeah and then they all decided to swim with the boat they just get in in front of the boat as the bows pushing the water yeah and they sort of surf it that's amazing so crazy you worried about you're gonna hit them you worried that they're gonna hit but the right people are one on the boat they don't worry about it all the Dolphins know exactly what they're doing yeah they're smart as shit yeah it's weird to watch man it's weird to watch them all coordinate together and then we're done they were done like by yeah Wow yeah my daughter surfs and they come out they play around a little bit sometimes they ride the waves when she's surfing that's one of the dark sides of fishing right commercial fishing is what happens in Japan when they take those dolphins and they look at them as competition yeah they're gonna kill their tuna so they you know they've been doing that forever the large-scale slaughter of them yes scary shit they just shoot him they caught them they bring up you ever seen the documentary The Cove oh now I heard about that oh it's awful there it's it's like they're slaughtering water people that's what it's like yeah so this what a dolphin is is some strange super intelligent creature that we don't totally understand yeah and it can talk they can talk to each other and we don't know what they're saying but they know what they're saying and we could train them you could ride them you can do flips for fish all this conch that's all true that's all true but what's also true is they have a giant brain yeah if they have a huge brain they have a cerebral cortex it's 40% larger than a person no shit yeah Wow they just it's designed for you know the movement of its body because it's a lot a lot larger body but they think it's also got some sort of probably not totally understood or measured cognitive ability they don't know like how smart they really are you know we were talking about Timothy Leary he's to pal around with John Lilly John Lilly is the guy who invented the isolation tank and he's also he was a pioneer in interspecies communication you give dolphins acid and he would really yeah he was set the float tank up next to the dolphin tank and take acid and get in there with them yeah yeah he was trying to figure out a way to get dolphins to speak he would get them to like make a noise it sounds like haha you know but they could they don't have the vocal cords they can't make the sounds that we expect yeah but their sounds we don't understand right which is weird cuz they know what you're saying if you say okay we're gonna jump now we're gonna jump we're gonna give you a fish they know what they know what you're saying we have no idea what they're saying yeah yeah it's weird when you would what is the cutoff for killing an intelligent animal you know like you can't kill dogs cats dogs aren't nearly as smart as dolphins right yeah but you can kill dogs in some spots it's cultural yeah cuz pigs are probably as smart as dogs oh yeah eggs are really smart I mean that's a that's a tricky one always you know like that is one of our criteria like even a lot of vegetarians will still step on roaches yeah you know our criteria is how smart is the thing how close is it to us the further it's away from us the easier we could jet like nobody gives a fuck about oysters yeah you know Sablin an oyster gets got I don't care I don't care at all I don't feel a thing someone shucks an oyster and opens up and scoops it out and swallows I'm like how's it good yeah I know like pour a little piggy put the poor little piggy that's real yeah that thing smart oh let's say so scared so terrified yeah whatever these things are dumb what about lobsters getting thrown in a pot can you do that I can't do that oh yeah I can do it freaks me out really that they're like moving around and alive and then you throw them in and don't they scream they're bugs the other scream they sing first yeah no scream they don't know sound like a frog at carnagie oh I don't think they can make noise I don't think they make noise they're lobsters yeah yeah but they taste fuck I'll eat tons of them when I used to work in Boston at the the Copley Mariette that was my day job for a while in college and then when I first started doing stand-up and we used to go down and it was the biggest banquet hall in Boston so we used to get all these conventions all these fucking hayseed farmers would come from the Midwest and they'd stay in the hotel and they could order any kind of dinner they wanted for their banquet but they always wanted the pilgrim the pilgrim banquet and we used to have to fucking dress up as Pilgrims and we would serve Lobster it didn't even make any sense clam before Thanks so so they would make and the thing about banquet cooking is you cook ten percent more than the amount of people you're feeding just in case which meant there was like you know thirty thirty college kids all waiting tables and and so after we fed them they would usually have like a presentation or whatever comedian or a speaker so we would leave the room for like an hour and a half and we would just fucking go to town on like a hundred lobsters could eat like three lobsters if you wanted really then our friends were all working the bars they were all the bartenders so we'd be doing shots drinking beer so is the upside was you live like a king the downside was you were dressed like a fucking asshole remember clambakes people would do them on the prowl yeah those were good yeah like a clambake what you would bury it and get out seaweed over the top and shit wet seaweed and it would just steam everything I've never done it I've only eaten it at a restaurant when you order a clambake yeah and they give you something I've never done the beach thing I did it with Kevin Flynn and Nantucket it looks attractive yeah it's fair it's great it's very earthy right the fucking corn in there everything potatoes - something about a bonfire on the beach right it's like extra special yeah like here it is that's it right there how to make a steam pit make a nice fucking steam pit look at that we got a lobsters we got corn god we've got clams yeah it would be lobsters and corn and clams potatoes yeah potatoes and it would all be buried in like a burlap sack under the ground yeah mussels - god dammit that looks good uh-uh people say they don't like Lobster I just do not understand that you don't it's like Lobster Eddie Bravo won't eat fish hates fish not a big fan you son of a bitch slop stir crab nice little asking crab a little bit look at that with the little of the green stuff what is that minced onions or something we'll just crawl crow I think with no weights the stuff on the no that's not that is that's like a spice right cuz it's on the corn - no yeah I think that's like a note is that like a celery or something like that parsley chopped parsley as I'm sure just like grow and then the eggs are the ROE that's at the top right yes it's nasty I like it you eat too rallied everything now shit I chew the the inner cartilage up and I suck the meat out of it I feel like if that thing is gonna die I'm gonna eat as much of it as I can I bite into the you know how you take the back yeah and there's that meat underneath with all the crazy gills and all that shit I just chew into that stuff like really it yeah I chew it up chew it up good junk all that shit and butter that's what I'm talking about and I did throw a move on with those waitresses I'm dressed as a pilgrim I'm drunk I hate not some girl from Boston College did you know that globsters were like poor people food in New York they would just go out to the East River and pull him out of the water yeah serve Him as bar food and get more people food do you know in Ireland during the famine they were pulling fucking Lobster out of the ocean wouldn't eat it they considered like rats oh my god they said they'd fucking me the British would just ship it off that's so crazy yeah how'd they not figure it out they're drunk one person just boiled it up made some butter just shut the fuck up and try this all right look what I've been avoiding yes what have I been thinking what the fuck are they been doing lot the whole family's starving it's good time delicious we've been eating potatoes we have been Indian this fucking Lobster or even a Miss fucking lucky
