his career is not gonna be affected by that no right now we accepted he's he's the wild motherfuckers the bad guy it's a bummer that he comes clean yeah be that guy fuckin love that it's always better to come clean period yeah cuz you can smell the fakeness from a mile it turns into like our McGregor but on coke good luck you that guy hey I just think of you if you're if you caught up in the demon in the demons and if you're completely honest about it Americans love you they forgive the shit attic Charlie shit fucked up again exactly Charlie Sheen's like the best example that ever who the fuck ever admitted to doing crack yeah like on a regular basis you talking about how he does it that's how I do it that's how we roll and then he goes on it gets a TV deal for nine hundred million dollars yeah Robert Downey jr. - did he got the West TV yeah but he went to jail he got compunction yes nice right what's that Ron I was fuckin heshes really he's Robert Downey jr. it seemed when I was growing up was in the news you always saw him in court for something right Robert Downey jr. was always asking for forgiveness for being on right yeah like a man no joy yeah yeah he was always record Robert Downey jr. is in court today right I remember you know what he still makes humongous music Iron Man Illinois is amazing yeah we we forgive drug problems in easily it's when you hide back you'll be stuck movie start with dudes or drunks like an ex-cop and he gave up on life and it's just a loser he doesn't care about anybody terms of pizza and a blender and that's not only that as we root for Escobar when you watch when you watch uh narcos aren't you kind of pulling I really wanted to pull it out yes that's when you know somebody did their job as a storyteller if you're like that's why silence Lance was so genius because you liked him and wanted him to be free because you were like you know what he does he people but he wouldn't eat me know I'm for Hannibal everyone not only did everybody root for Tony Montana but when I only anytime I would see that movie another time I was hoping there would be some kind of alternate ending I would always as a kid buddies try to just leave town go back to your he's like an anteater remember when we were that what's-his-face is Larry David show Kirby enthusiasm yes here that krazee-eyez-killa guy and he played he played Scarface Homer's house 24/7 like that's what yeah yeah I remember I'm afeeling yet the asthma on the seriously Scarface 24/7 is crib of babies at Scarface on it it's a funny thing man Scarface is a funny movie another remake in it it's probably the first movie ever with like an antihero it was that the first one uh well no not the first one I don't the first big one but like Clint Eastwood movies are kind of like that right yeah yeah Clint Eastwood it was like the High Plains Drifter he was kind of a narrative well came back but he would do good thing yeah wouldn't do shitty shit yeah it's never a douchebag no but the guy came back to life ago The Godfather was that was that yeah that was that yeah it was the one where he came back to life was a high plane you know was a High Plains Drifter he came that they beat him and whipped him to death and he came back to life yes good moral hit man and he came back oh I know buddy up well I don't know that that was the case but I know that when High Plains early takes his shirt off and he's got all these bullet marks and the guy goes but you're dead you mean didn't he announced he's supposed to be like a ghost made him back and killed everybody maybe see if that's the case do you know how sure that was High Plains drug story line was that he was like he came back from the dead he was a different person look different I'm pretty sure I love that movie Adams alley no Clint Eastwood from his current movie those always old she never saw the Outlaw Josey Wales yeah we mean all the shit no yum-yum that that movie stands the test of time oh I'm young is that the best Glen we're moving high plane I mean uh outlaw shows who else man it's pretty closed-mouthed oh it doesn't matter it could come out before our time honestly really that was like in 1970 or so yeah if it came out now it would still kill it's a race I don't know too much about Clint Eastwood I wasn't really into westerns but I know there's a bunch you here Joey talking about and stuff I would be interested in in in seeing a documentary based on his career me too yeah it started with the good the bad and the ugly I was the first to walk yeah and then how many did he make after that questions he may have so many and here's the budget amid Italy in more than actually what but here's those controversial they were called spaghetti westerns because they were doing them in Italy because they would did film in Italy and pretend they're in New Mexico and sure that's what she's wonderful two of the most controversial moments in movie history with Clint Eastwood one is he rapes a woman he straight-up rapes her in a barn he just did have a nice weekend yeah wait a minute he's here he's a hero and then the second movie was that raised drifter - no it was at that point with no douchebag in the movie or what movie without just him as well he's just a man committed he raped a girl she then she was on Lovelock and then she calls in love with him later what okay how about this ready what is this call really good look yesterday look at this they're making him do something do it oh yeah some toenails on him is toys they always check my toenails if you got a trim your toenails do with a fucking toenail clipper and then file that shit down I know my uncle John Mike Winkeljohn doesn't have a fucking eyeball because of that that's not bullshit that's something true that is something very serious it should have been taken care of a long time ago if I was fighting this guy and I saw that he was doing that to his toenails right before a fight with fingers I'd be like fuck nah he's using a clipper well think I'll sharpen is yet to the point he sit down there's a pilot door so sharp like that big stop trimming it and then on top who's gonna do the other toe to their apps gonna do it now imagine if he goggle+ I am the fucking ref is trimming his toenails man he's serious this is crazy he's very realization but they should be polished you should sand those fuckers down yeah I agree we don't touch the condoms all the time to start Rondon it's not about that really Hey look fingernails fuck people's eyeballs up you know that's a big part of what's going on with these AI posts yeah it's not just a blunt object it's a blunt object with a fucking hard edge - did you hear Glover he goes when I got poked and I saw three Gustafson's and then he goes what they go can you see he goes no but I wanna keep fighting the oh all right cool they let him fight off him I'm glad then it stopped the fight and he goes it wouldn't matter though he had my timing is faster but you know he had everything well if he couldn't see I don't wanna I that was he was gonna beat up before that though but he did say he goes it wouldn't matter what does it say Jamie I Plains Drifter had the rape and I can't quite tell if this is the one we had together we'll say yeah that was the respect in this out that's one of the reasons why he got away with it because he was this guy coming back from the dead well what is the what is the what's the premise says that this at the beginning attractive towns woman deliberately bumps into him in the street knocks a cigar from his no no no I don't mean the premise of the rape I mean the premise of the movie it doesn't really have it's a long plot oh I play my dresses here's the other insanely controversial Matty and Clint Eastwood he may there's a girl she's about eight maybe younger she saves him from he's a Union soldier she saves him from the Confederate soldiers he saves life she says no he's not here and he looks at her and cuz he said like he turns and kisses her on the lips for about five seconds how about that oof yeah more than that it's it's like you're like what I mean they got a winner she drifters yeah but by the way no no it was a different movie movie and he and this he wasn't you knew he wasn't like a pedophile he was just so happy that his life had been spared that he you could never get away with that it probably shouldn't in movies but you know the city is really crazy is like how much cultures changed since 1970 yep how much humans have changed it's true I feel like Paulo here could rape a girl and get away with in the movies I mean he is a dime piece in this get fight before now it's a monster yeah he's very good he's a plump pronounce his last name it's gonna be tough you're asking the wrong gentleman here he's built like a like a creature in July congratulations what is a DJ me see if you can find the pronunciation of his name what we'll hear from Brian Stann there's things that you can't do anymore nowadays but there's things now that you couldn't do back then like shit seems to be slipping into TV every now and then and maybe a fuck after 10 they're starting they're starting to away this that do you see the waves they were talking shit that's a separate them Wow cuz you guys question who are in the know I know you sada is very strict but if you're in Brazil are you allowed our how dare you how I'm asking a question this is very I'm literally just hash see my shingle an autism let's say his name let's what do you think his name is Ronnie Sheena bouchy Nora Sheena worse bourchek booze Sheena Barbara Gina and then his name is ole Ola bum bum ba-bum bullshit I think he's from Nigeria that's my guess you think yeah let's hear it let's hear it give me some volume maybe

YouTube YouTube bunch of lasers oh oh oh somebody's explodes I swing he said somebody's explosive yeah the ballsy's black pepper I didn't say I said somebody bro don't ever put words in my mouth well the black I didn't do anything well he's explosive I didn't say that no oh that was a stereotype for Mexican if any when you're watching two guys fight like this when you're watching two guys fight like this they're so tense you know these guys are like when you have a bunch of bad blood between two guys like you you can almost like see it in how like wound up and pulled back they are they also don't have a lot of experience though either Joe like it's only homeboy second fight mm bored she's not double yeah they cut the shit out of his back yep does that work Brian what is what's going on

stagnant blood yeah look at this zombie shake shit look hi back I'm out he's getting a little sloppy there he's just a little too wild yeah but he's attacking we just barely missed that left hook now he's getting loose guys he's getting loose jack yeah they're Bullock's fellow you see on the beach yeah I had a black feller the Brazilian although they both look like Beach Boys yeah the couple of each month couple Beach bullies I was talking about the Brazilian character though he looks like some dude coming out of the water with speedo on yeah 4d or making sure super uncomfortable about being on the beach sure yeah I go and run my Kido ass away I don't think he's cute eyes oh nice inside leg kick great cake I'm Boucher boom shake that up Babu shit those Jonjo legs those things are dangerous he's very shy very stiff for the supper oh we just get kicked he throws big shots and he's getting in mumbles it looks a little tired guys yeah and we're only two minutes in right that's being all tight and wound up I mean these guys got to catch their second wind and I see a patient he's moving like it like nothing smooth it's all fuckin movin a lot of look in the spin from him a couple times I like what I was little bowls guy been bamboozled hey one yeah I think he's won us that he doesn't big a shot that musil's gonna lose bum cause when he throws it's big he just waits for a shot yep he's not fuckin around he throws big shit yeah it's whether or not he can sustain this yeah it's like those guys his style of his Oh jumpin shit Dominick Cruz way I was like thank you when I saw he keep switching stances oh yeah but I mean he's he's obviously not as fluid as Dom you know what that that he looked at stolen heat though they're both thrown Heat these guys are two dudes who don't really like each other okay oh boy oh boy you talk to him he's like oh I got you I got ya keeps looking odd or just as crazy as a 1000 he's getting her through a while shit now yeah skill boy cheering go and get bamboos let's come oh that's kind of her that's kind of smart Oh bullshit was worried about the body doing a body no the punches vicious body choke damn first fighting got home tonight it's like Roberto durán those rebel comparison God Joker writer Duran and Dominick Cruz and she come on no no no talking about yeah the Brazilian yeah oh my god he's like way better than Adam boy better than Durant is OJ's it pretty you see that fight oh my god of the dress no okay no chance oh your head the hips pressure Duran's boxing is like some of the best ever got tug you know the body shots that strips that's like who you're Cesar Chavez right there I could have dropped that mark on his the inside of his neither on Bora Cena's knee knows how I roll they are boorish Sheena I don't think that's the right way to say it well when what I'm chewing it like you're in France or on machine ah you got a good Brazilian okay boys she knows yet kaathal yeah I don't think you've done do books can you commentate in your Brazilian accent for just a little while yeah it's been a while for me you know I'm gonna try now that guy's gonna go look at oh oh control the posture Oh posture sound see because friends know that gay guys because I was in France Jamaicans because I was your Jamaican I was in France but I'm from Brazil Wow control position come on my posture very good posture wow the first round bamboozled is he's having trouble wobbling dude he's wobbling he is fucking wobbler yeah he'd point he gave up his Jesus Jesus cancel me this dude's ass she's better distance fucked in oxygen tube or chena just poured it on man but are Lisha present shows be fatiguing at this point because online you know what the blog dudes in shape cool look you can be built and still have endurance looks I mean when Tim Kennedy was at his best he was always built like a tank never got tired good endurance yeah well he was a shredder him every strata look at those Strikeforce days broken shred city but it's a fine line man yeah it's a fine line like you get too much mass and not enough conditioning and you work too much on explosion in the fight and not enough on technique not enough on pacing yourself he's got giant look at Anthony Joshua he shreds right at City 240 pounds 240 and and came back you know got drop like fat lines almost and then she met a track in the next round no he got he dropped Klitschko and then Klitschko drunk today and he dropped Klitschko twice in the final round yes uppercuts were cool by the way I think was a controversial stoppage boy that guy's built home shit poor chena it's the shoulders dirt was docked yeah he is man yeah yes we just toss it up genetic so like Stefan I got amazing Juno that's what I'm saying what's altering that cuz you know that Golden Snitch is sniffing around these two like backin while he's young blood hounds got that mesomorphic structure doesn't look at Apollo he doesn't surprise lb a hard place to hide yeah I know he does look like no that would be cool this is really a FIFA CJIs I don't know did you see I'm saying I'm not cook you double front shot anybody well isn't Vitor on the car tonight we're gonna find out what the fuck is up so what is he gonna look like a tour gets made Marquardt Bobo have down in an Iron Man both yeah yeah oh you're gonna kill the girl I love the omegan deal they're gonna say listen I'm gonna let my sister for me oh yeah your cousin P for you he just she hates dropping bombs and now it's gonna be bad oh yeah real bad yeah it was a clip T or choose not really tired and may fight Hannah I didn't see the fight but how did it all for Chino pukas huge Eddie what was that MMA fight that you posted on your Instagram where someone was gone for the gila Island be trippin Oh what was that MMA fight you post on your Instagram today where someone was going for the heel hook that was earlier today I was in the mainland but the other dude is beating the shit out of him while he's going for the he look within the minute rant out who won that fight Matthew Lopez the guy on top because for my bones yeah they got the Brazilian I forget the Brazilians name so the Brazilian was a cat that was going for the heel hook yes damn that was a battle yeah I put them right in fifty-fifty tough and he had man he had to he'll having and he had it but he held on and uh Matthew Lopez used to dealing with heel hooks all the time so great wrestler - yeah and impressive defense oh man because he got the death's door you got to death's door a couple of times yeah real good defend an amorphous from hell yeah that's the danger in going four leglock MMA they work they weren't but some of the kinks man Jamie's gonna play it look it up there get up there in the left Matthew Jackie I mean this is like goddamn heel hook as you're gonna get this - is jacking on it yanking on and homeboy Matthew Lopez a bad motherfucker cuz he was in pain here for sure and he survived look at this pain kid man oh yeah I'm still acid right here they should allow a head kicks with the puff fuck you should be able to find another Mouse it would be not right listen why can you kick someone in the head standing up you can't kick some of the head on the ground zero sense it's a viable move ass pelic if you want to say that the guy standing up can soccer kick the guy in the head or stomp from the head okay we can argue that because they came here because the king a guy can't go anywhere but you can't argue that if they're in that position yeah the guy's going for he look they're both on the ground you should absolutely be able to kick just like you can actually elbow to the head you could punch to the head yeah why can't you kick to that thanks zero cents zero up kick should be legal younger percent you're on your back Wooper get free might get too hard is it is extreme we're gonna guy with the milk is too hard that's too hard meanwhile you can hit a guy with a wheel kick but you can't up kick him when you're on your back and he's trying to close in on you fuck that you should be able to go crazy you should be able to well the guys on his knees you should be able to kick him two knees one knee you should be able to kick the shit out of him if you're on your back straight I was in Singapore and I hung out with shot tree the guy who owns evolve any owns one I've seen the guy who owns evolve owns one FC as well yeah one championship cheese yeah daddy I swear I've been to have some great I've been to a thousand UFC Oscars I never been to an event like this really dude hey bro they won championship as far as production goes and high fuck really winning sometimes I level who does English commentary for them it's the most incredible like month like this VIP section was just the way it was all setup was let's just spend there's no budget it was incredible every fighter every fighter that came out had its own music video an own show they really uh go off on promoting the each individual fighter each guy came out and had his own music video his own song cut up who's the big stars of his a star over there ask him is a huge star don't be a boy dude that guy had some ladies my waist is my gosh relax you know I figure the reason I bring it up Joe is I was talking with them and I asked a buckin goat-cheese deliver I said he was going from frozen go back and forth on the rules like it cuz they allowed soccer kicks initially will you see Brandon beer soccer kid savonia eventually he said we got to pull him out you know there was a couple really examples tena koe de Maio saying no but it's his decision he doesn't have a commission he could do whatever he wants so yeah it's just after him it's up to him and he decided to pull that the soccer kicks butt out we end all kicks on the ground and I said he including up kicks and he goes well technically yes but he thought about it for a second or maybe he allowed him maybe I'm a little confused but as to what he said but he agreed at the end of the conversation that up kick should be legal I mean you're on your back and you allow a wheel there's no condition you 100% should be able to up kick and at any time well the guys says one knee on the ground two knees the ground grones in the grass to gray or on your back you should be able to get back to your feet it's a viable technique and the guy shouldn't be so confident that he can close the distance okay the only reason he's so confident that he can close the distance and get it get a hole you is because you can't kick up kick them when you have one knee down right it's a bullshit strategy well it's a bullshit strategy based on a bullshit safety so Eddie there's no Commission out there now he's everyone going sizzler how crazy but I like I said I've never been to a show like that I mean damn only way you sold me bro don't worry yes Lee mmm do you guys have one dude shot tree he's the man what kind of nyssa tea I got yelman it's like he just wants the best show what ethnicity he's uh he's half Thai half Japanese who is does the commentary for English does Rich Franklin do it Rich Franklin just moved all the work form as a VP some rich rich Franklin Ben Askren wants to move there and his chakras bad sister wants to move to Singapore and and work for one Fc holy Sh after he's done buddy the great thing about retiring thinking about was thinking about I never get so you'll see that's such a fucking shame yeah that guy's an animal man I can't see you and beat our champ right now do you guys think that you share you job do you think it should be illegal to be if you're inside control to be the head whatever sent really I'm gonna go under on your hand and we should be able to don't be in that position right if you if you know if you guys can get you inside control you should be fucking scrambling like a wild cat if you're not scrambling like a wild cat it means you're compromised and if you're compromised it means you either got too tired or you got to her and that guy should be able to capitalize a knee to the head when you're down the only time it's a problem in my eyes is when you can't move your head that's why pride was superior in that respect because they had those ropes so you can go under the ropes and avoid soccer kicks you could avoid stumps you could avoid knees the only argument against soccer kicks and stomps and knees to the head is the fucking cage getting your head pressed up against the cage and getting stuck in my opinion that makes it a problem yeah because you can't the guy can't get out of the way of a strike so then the artificial boundary of the cage becomes a weapon it becomes and then obviously you can strategize to get the fuck away from it don't let it happen to you if it does happen you it's very dangerous it makes fights more exciting because there's more opportunities for Kos but you're going to shorten careers I have a different point of view on it in that I don't think that when you don't have knees to the head we're in that position are when your hands are on the ground or for example soccer kicks I don't think it it makes if you added those things I would do think of it do two things it would not make the sport more exciting but it would make it more brutal and it would probably shorten careers so in my opinion it's brutal enough and is enough technique to really go and see you then I know but to not allow certain like but I think you're talking more brutai up kicks our second story they went ok and I also think something's trying to rip your knee off and you can kick them like from that position I think that good luck yeah yeah yeah yeah you could break usually a lot all right our brains if they got their head cut caught in a bad spot and you actually stomp on it 100% can you imagine sock let me get you holy yeah yeah yeah yeah well listen man that's that's why you need Ivan Matson ok exactly there's bull shark and fighting championship I also asked them I asked them about I go what if a fighter wants to wear spats like or a rash like a anywhere rash guard whose decision is that it was my decision I go so kiddo I mean women wear rash guards all the time it's never a problem in a in MMA fighters never like what do we do with the winds rash guards we can't have them fight topless what are we going to do it's just like you destroy rash guard nope no big deal there shouldn't be a you know a rule prohibiting fighters male fighters from wearing rash guards in my opinion I mean it's not a big deal for women white you know and he he agree you want it around you said he would let anybody wear anything you want to wear Aggie and yeah one Fc you can wear a geek neato pants if you want in one Fc I think you should be able to wear ye and I think no gloves I think gloves good if you can need some of the head elbows some in the face you can kick them in the head with your fucking shin to my shin is so much less vulnerable than my hand should we get a really bodacious Isis - no but we should take away the patent on the samples why Happ that if you're not padding we should have padding on the shins we should have padding on the knuckles we should have absolute padding on the heel because the heels the most dangerous in my opinion because I could wheel kick something you could hit something really hard it doesn't really hurt your heel right like you get you punch someone in the head you have a really good chance if you hit the forehead of breaking your hand I've never heard of a guy wheel kicking going ahead and hurting his foot I mean I've hurt my foot to the point where I was limping but I didn't hurt my foot and break yet I never broke it it was like oh we but that was alley off of someone's fucking head right you know like the idea that you could pat up your knuckles you don't pat up your heel is crazy or heals a goddamn hammer I mean dick what's that dude's name there's a dude who just fought in Bellator recently I'm gonna pull this out because I told this kid I would give him props but he knocked out Sony with an axe kick I saw that is my topic to go back might be the only time ever Hey Joe it was after the main card all right like use the night he was on either before the handcart or after the main bout Doris Duke like so they'll be the main event and then it's over TV and then they'll have guys fight after yeah like one or two guys fight after okay homeboy his name is al Pierre Davis yeah alphy are davis alfie are davis and he acts kicked a dude he acts kicked dude and k on with sweat this don't oh wait a minute go again back it up again here guys watch this oh no way come on told you someone was gonna do that eventually cuz that's happy I've seen that happen another dog once he went on front foot hook kick that's what I want to see if I don't dribble where's Derek the black beast Lewis no that wasn't that one wasn't I wasn't out when I do just for Angie but Derrick Lewis got knocked out by Shawn Jordan with a front leg hook kick get the fucking red Shawn Jordan who's 250 pounds George 60 pride feel like shit out here man British bulldog but can do backflips whack yeah shall I pull back a little hook kick front like bill Wallace that's awesome style back on Shan Shan Shan was a freak he's a freak Apple here it is here it is what what yeah that was a bonus loss actually looks like you brought it from the back yeah and look like it was almost a sidekick right whoa let's go again boom definitely a hook now you're right and let me show it in slow motion you see the hooking haha nice to meet you all right could be a shitty sidekick in my kitchen cuz I'm here look at the whole string of look straight up hook kick from Ronnie we're amazing

Glen FL the backflip about 250 pounds fall back flip flies to God ain't built like a like just a troll like I just feel like the thing from fantastic I was the guy they said he was going to UCLA as a fullback or whatever he wasn't he was that big and he's dunking a basketball just stand there and just jumping I'm going like what the fuck no Sean Sean Jordan was supposed to go to the NFL but he got caught with some Brazilian supplements crossing the border Oh what and then I felt like wicked oh yeah oopsie he's up free you got to send those in the mail son okay mark was the same which I would get appeal but now you get over stuffed animal animal I'm saying teddy bears to a sick everybody's up nothing to lose put up their ass come on what are you doing bro listen how 32 years old you still have student loans it's time to become a mule time to become you're a twins man we had a gift like if one day in the future you have 100% transparency and used to get to see all the crimes that are committed all across one how many times per day are dudes coming across the border with drugs up their ass oh my god I got him in my ass right now yeah I've been offered a few what's the number though a hundred a day good more oh my god more thousand a day yeah a couple dudes a day got caught going through Kennedy I think with coke taped all over their body oh shut up - they pull that up well you can you randomly touchdown man that's a big rest all right Jim plus the dirt but I think dogs can only smell one thing and they usually use them for bombs no because with drug dogs though they can smell you know right okay laughs right yeah with drug dogs but no no that's true there's Lang's muhfucka but wait - yeah that's very smart a good job put that in your ass you know what he should have done he should have got it shaped like one of those bat and suits where all the muscles are like yeah he didn't actually do it yeah yeah but he's in deep shit is going to jail he's gonna give you those oh look at that vagina coconut vagina wow that looks like so large it's a butterball that bitch has a big pussy yes well I feel sick now once you've had a few kids I guess you could probably get a turkey and that's cool to us play that mean if you had like six kids half a pound that compress Christ in her vagine think about what windowsill additional cane if you pack it tight isn't it like a rock half a pound might only be like a fist I don't know I got big too we might give this gal more credit than she deserves look at the size of that fucking thing that thing is almost yeah boys in perspective tell me Oprah's now it's almost as thick as my cock if you know there could be a pill look at Vitor coming out for the last time maybe what if Vitor like I mean he's only got one more fight left in his contract he thought this was the last fight and he's gonna leave they fucked up he didn't count right not a good sign and then the one of the other things he said recently that was crazy he's like he wants to make UFC bigger than uber and everyone's like hey homie uber is crashing right now if you understand like the amount of punishment that uber is taking on a lot of huge rubber scooper 300 million dollars we have a really really lost officer school yeah all sorts of controversies attached to Ober like what is the question of the CFO so that their final but a bunch of people or their actions but they'll come back you have no say your seizing the uber yeah but it wasn't we're kind of the scoober the actual idea and the service didn't work out or is it was it just bad that's a good question I don't know what you know I looked at it peripherally like I saw bruising trouble again Uber's a new president has system shit that they've lost a lot of money and it helps lift yeah that lift is um the new version right that's a lot of people use I go it's like the 99 cents or for uber it's kind of everybody I know uses uber and they rely it's awesome you ever fucked up me out uber pool on accident people use like six people to call oh thank you you were trying to save money I'm gonna get somebody I just be on accident cuz it automatically goes to Italy I'll just fucking wait other people's yeah get out of please I I got an uber for my friend and he was gonna he was going to my podcast so I'm watching him from his house and I'm watching the car dude all these fucking turn the flexibility towards Jesus Christ he'll veto is crazy parks flexible he's just doing standing splits oh yeah he's a fucking athlete man oh my god well the greats man if this guy never had a chemical controversy you know I mean if we if we had a frozen time machine from 1997 on got it all dialed in mm-hmm you don't want the grace of all he's just the one like he's won once they got caught yes that's what I think was for sure but he's also an interesting case Vitor is in that you know he's had like these spectacular victories and then also some really brutal defeats and his spectacular victories are very rare because he's a sprinter he attacks you and Sprint's at you which a lot of people do like Vitor just Dean's you a little peep a little bit and he Sprint's back in the day has he ever doesn't work these days lately guys know it well sir I don't know see didn't the TRT days it absolutely worked but he's also 40 right so it's like every bit of man like what is me there's a there's something to be said for the strategy if you hurt a guy in MMA you have little gloves on and you just fucking swarm them but you're going all-in you push my chips in your all-in hasn't been down has he ever been down and come back that's the question yes wait when Anthony Rumble Johnson because I fucked up by Rumble Johnson in Brazil Rumble didn't even make 185 Rumble was way over 185 this was back when Rumble went up from 170 to 185 didn't even make 185 put a beating on Vitor and then ran out of gas he choked them out until Chuck ah yeah I know who else choked Rumble out the people forget about uh yeah DC did rich Clemente motherfucker old school how about that rich Clementi we used to fight it 55 that was Delta that was that yo okay dumb run Z that's crazy you know what it was a hundred percent he cut too much weight and he couldn't sustain that notion we didn't warrior he was walking around 235 235 remember asking I said you're a giant and I said you're gonna suck down on 170 I go how are you doing he goes I'll make it and he did such a bad idea min well I think that's one of the reasons 65 pounds he had this bad feeling about MMA in the first place yeah you know he says he doesn't like fight MMA Jesus Christ you're one of the top two fucking light heavyweights on the planet top two or three mean Rumble beat him I mean DC beat him the last time oh look at these two veterans rounds John awesome get Vitor Belfort 455 454 453 452 Mount Rushmore fighters veterans didn't sink earlier and for those who don't know Brendan Schaub extensively trained with Nate Marquardt back in the day and you said you never saw him lose around never never eat then you know I realized right Vitor and Nate trained together two for the Rumble Johnson camp we all flew out there to help feet or so that you know they know each other a little bit and they're also jesus brothers if you don't know that yeah they're they're also brothers and we're gonna see who Jesus likes the most in this fight on Nate is working quite thick yes he is strongest shit Nate is a freak athlete man yeah super freak he's awesome if I'd sends you 17 it's almost like Nate just just missed the time periods you know like of Nate in his prime whoa Nate is coming strong here man he looks very confident he looks very fast too man oh yeah beautiful trip Vito yep Vito is back it's not good this is not good except against John Jones against John Jones John was slacking left his arm out there and Vitor pulled off the rare armbar off his back and a lot of times arm Oh Oh in that fight oh don't eat you might be don't sorry I know I you look at Vito with the elbow from the bottom was actually very strong people sleep on H jits or two he's a legit black legit and he's a fucking strong dude - and if he could hold Vitor here and beat him up and he's doing aggressive shit - he's sticking his fucking the same old Nate man oh it's such a smart move by Nate cos Vitor like you said he's only dangerous than the foot really the first round that he Taylor's off so bad so for Nate this and the second round Betty TKO well especially the Vitor of today so I'm saying his testosterone levels he says her super depleted and he's got a real problem and yeah I mean he sees God it's a weird argument right I mean why they depleted your only forward I don't stand them up it's a dominant issue that's terrible fuck you it's Brazil bro we want to see people bang yeah but that's terrible they're doing it because it's Brazil that's what I mean mission I mean I don't know what how many warnings he gave him though we're not listening to the commentary well he's trying to movie tours tying them up well you know what looks like to me here it looks like Nate is like super confident coming in here this is a like an eight who knows his opponent and feels real good about his chances he looks confident he doesn't like tentative at all Nate's gonna make knows he's Vitor just physically does not look that good he chose just waiting for that one like look at the look at the excess body weight around its waist as legs look is that Center consistent forty though yeah but I somebody 50 fighters away that I'm 15 I don't have that and by the way he's endocrine system is probably a little bit you know compromised oh that's what I'm saying yeah 100% yeah yeah it's a oh shit hey oh hey just tripped oh this way you can't caught that one to the body to go ref but he caught it on his elbows fucking go from like psychic to the leg I love that kick it's got some tricks kids I love that people are doing that now that's a legit technique you know the people think that it's damaging to the knee you think it's dirty what about heel hooks look it's a good technique if you can kick the leg that's a good way to kick the leg right what are we doing here you could blow a guy's knee out with a regular Thai kick I can't believe that's even a debate I can't believe it is you must think it's dirty the Jackson can't really ones who started it they do it brilliantly yeah they really do and they also do with that elliptical kick or uh that uh what's not not elliptical kick what am I work on the word oblique kick that's a beautiful kick that's a beautiful kick cuz it's weak that that's that a lot of fucking flying knees you've calmed down to my left over there whatever your name is it's Brendan Chuck sorry Brendan Schaub you fought in UFC my door does not look good here I get excited my test my test my test starts spiking guys when I watch fights do I listen Brooke what about wrong here engines they say never no no it goes down Brian if your your testosterone the spike and in no disrespect bring up V tours wife good God God mighty the Brazilians on how to make a wall you're gonna talk about my stand-up and coming to my show no uh I don't know no I don't know didn't know oh it's an Irvine June eighth nothing tells a good Jackie brought that up with Liam Nate gave him a finger like yep you got me there oh the one finger not the bad thing right they've got a nice nice couple couple front foot leg kicks guys cookie said no you didn't oh geez Nate the thing is

back ups will you look down to our 4012 dog mm I that that's a beautiful look it's incredible I gotta get on testosterone right now I don't think that's more than test all right well I'll do whatever he's doing it's post endocrine crash two on the right hand side like a healthy looking dude who's 40 years old the right hand side could be pretty jammed and apparently the birds collar looks terrible

right hook Nate with a high kick - do you read the story of Vito her sister dying man when they took her for ransom but there's that uppercut yeah horrible horrible man took her for ransom they killed her little dryer Brazil don't fuck around of it no that's the worst thing I can imagine one of the guys working for the UFC got held at gunpoint this weekend really yeah what happened nothing gave

they doctor photographs my mommy she really leave he's not a professional maid Marquart with a fucking dude in sidekick easy this is red how do you call this fight right he needs to finish him these guys are bruised up because illrick fucker sealed brazil nate is looking great v12 e tours a legend so he's already up two rounds no one man Nate looks super strong in this fight it does his back is looking good nothing like by super strong technique thank you again that's got his defence looking good too well he looks like health it's not tired at all yeah he looks healthy right I think also a big thing for Nate was going up to 185 improved this gym improved his vitality yeah I just think being at 170 was so depleted wait he was a big s7o huge he's so big walking on 12 they just so strong man oh I really don't oh man he just clipped Vitor did he catch him with that left hook that a graze I'm great look like great them this is an interesting fight man because I think both of these guys are kind of at the end of their UFC rope right arguably Oh tag them both bottom on the back nine yes look right but they're both they're both like if you didn't know that and you saw this well Vito you tell kind of by his body you'd be like something's going on he's a legend though so you put up with the body fat yeah well it's not just the body fat it's like oh there's a looseness to him oh we I kicked him with the left did a bunch of muscle dinner was so much more meat it's all go so meaty but his technique is still really good it was just a matter well to freak oh jesus crab on the elbow people forget Vito is one of the best athletes to ever come in the Octagon come take on the steroid shit out the guys roll wheel kick at all until he fights Luke Rockhold throws one and misses and there's another one in chaos him boy Oh Nate got hurt there he got tagged while he went looking for that tape looking at he had what I call an educated jab guys oh but that left high kick is strong and he keeps moving to his right yeah you could block that all day do this shit's gonna fuck your arms I'll tell you what's weird as neighbors I try start with GSP forever oh shit ain't him with that head kick someone a frost really helped Vitor with this game pal for sure you know some fucking trails something about later can't believe what you're saying I'm just gonna let for us look at that right Rader when they show Nate's right side like look how red is fucking Armas he's also pale as fuck I know but that's why you can see the impact like when you have a super white boy you get to see like where he's been getting scratched up stupid white boy yeah how long was a was Vitor with for us just this kiss that's just one another all the redness all over Nate's arm Vito has been known to jump around camps that's kind of his thing well sort of but I mean not that much I mean a lot of guys have jumped around more than him it's like me from Nate Marquardt ladies and gentlemen oh and that's stuff in Brazil they're probably nice daughter got ready night was great fight one round one and two it's great fine I think so well now I'm balls deep in cheese and half a glass of wine but from my perspective one and two as well or cheese I'm time traveling from that weed that goddamn la speed weed with it what does I say it was bamboo leaves or something like that they wrapped these blunts with with bamboo nail some panda style yeah some koala bear style that's a beautiful acknowledgment fuck with bamboo Minh didn't have that rap that's right come on you guys tough was it no no it's not a store the other day no I got shit on it yeah yeah I know what you're talking about what's like a needle does something real the real interesting thing if you're gonna go blunt you really should go Charlie Murphy style which is where you take a swisher Sweets class take the weed and you put it inside take the tobacco out and so then you're getting the harshness of the tobacco and you get that weird tobacco buzz from the outside that weird nicotine buzz I like a nicotine buzz every now and then man I've smoked different cigarettes before but yeah whatever eight times but I've smoked a couple cigarettes before going on stage before I really so whatever this was a great fight man what's up we're Donald Cerrone oh yeah I ate some dip oh fuck that I swallowed some dick you look serious every now and then I say when I say Nate Scott urban HSL should win two to one it's 29:28 marketers ill but do they have the same split-decision jizz let's see what we got here Oh all three three tore the piece of shit Brazil an eyes I'll fuck you oh come on result damn it's Brazil that's y'all figure you up yeah you just like one bazillion lose around I guess I don't know good fight those are terrible Jersey to see the fee great fight that was it he definitely won that last round yeah you know one that I gave to one so you thought Vitor one two no no no hell no Nate one one and two and then he then veto in the third that way that's all around Vitor do anything again I've made a shit little problem I've got to mine I'm in a live watch some good moments on the fight by vitor and I thought I saw a few more good moments by Nate but I was in no means judging the fight by no means powerful Brian Stann with a pink tie confident gentlemen it's no big deal you know even if he those first two he did lose the first round kind of big right cuz he got taken down yeah that was drunk yeah he's I was all about Raziel room is Brazil going with the new rules they doing the fuck they want but today do they have the new rules like as far as judging everything I don't think so he's a classy man the Texas doesn't doesn't accept those it's like Brazil's the Wild West in New York that's it everyone else you're there fall shit well New York is just juvenile New York they're just morons let me hear what I'm saying here but it's what it is is they just don't have a lot of experience New York State has only had MMA for a year or so so they're just going through growing pains I feel like that's what's going on with New York it's just when I say juvenile I mean like their childish no they just start haven't had a wob with the mistakes to make and I mean you're talking not dream mistakes right but who made that mistake was Denver Gugliotta Denver glee otters a super experienced referee the guy made the mistake in the beer associate murkly ah no summer you either hurt by thoughts 14 which one was Mark leotta there's what which one was the Mousasi fight was that herb Dino her deal yeah okay then the murgh leotta fight was there was another woman's in New York was it Weidman Weidman watch what was wide Mousasi I thought I thought it was hurting her Dean was bright that was that one but there was one with uh there was one with Merc Liana recently either way the point being both merg leotta and Herb Dean or excellent refs and you know shit goes wrong man her been fucking up lately though he's my favorite reference locking up a little bit a lot of people been saying that I'm not going with that well I'm it's just I mean you're gonna fuck up every now and then you're gonna fuck you really can I drown I fuck up and it's some submission only and I fuck up every now and then yeah that I've done maybe two or three big fucker hoes Dean's fucking done a million fun you're live man how can you not fuck up that kind of speed sometimes I think I'm saying like Vitor but I'm really saying Nate like I'll fucking I'll have it in my head just crossed because what I'm trying is just I'm trying to pay attention and I'm all trying to talk at the same no it's not the weed oh no because I'm doing his back I don't do the UFC high ever ever I did like too high ever I didn't like it like when they back in the day back in the day like 2002 or something like that but um I don't do them hi I'm cuz I don't want to I don't want to ever have the urge to talk about some shit non fight related because that's what this is like yes is the whole this fight this fight companion podcast shows the whole reason why I should never do weed what is that we watch it that's more girl outta there that's the wisemen Mousasi fight okay so I was right so Weidman versus Mousasi was Danberg leotta the other one that was similar there was another one that was similar that was herb Dean that was a recent fucking fight with that foul as well who was the fight people online right now oh no it's Eddie Alvarez and poor yay thank you very much my fucking brains et fuck you beautiful yes thank you beautiful thank you very on top on that is that's a perfect example don't do that to my hand that's what I respect super well if you had to give me a list of top 5 best referees on the planet Earth Dan Murg leotta and Herb Dean or bolt on that list and they both made errors from the conscious número know the he's number one in books and by the way in fucked up oh yes not like this oh sure he did but Merlot Bustamante vs. um Night Man lately I fuck yeah he he tapped him Murillo tapped him and then they restarted the fight and did it again look he's the gold standard because of his experience and that was a mistake it was just experience and that's a while though currently though he hasn't fucked I feel like he's the best I feel like Big John's the best but I'm by far you know here's another one that doesn't get enough credit because he went to the pokey Josh Rosenthal he's the I agree Joshua stand that's right outstanding right see he's out buddies out yeah he's out but he never got reinstated for we yes so it's snitched on him a little a k47 so right before he went he um at the men range also brown belt in jujitsu I think it might be black by now yeah but uh what am i doing my job now he's refereeing Jenny just keying the cages and shit but here's the deal he just can't read 3x excellent excellent excellent excellent right he's one of my favorites yeah and also like super like out of the picture like you don't know he's there so it's homeboy with the the Yosemite Sam muster yeah Mike Beltran out my sleep on Beltran Beltran's in my top ten in the world to not stop me from he's one of the smartest I've deal with a lot of people in the industry over the years he's one of the smartest dudes that I've every man mike is a fucking great human being well I really hell is he so nice Beltran she's did a nice job gotta be nice don't rush like that by the way a lot more you did you know he was a cop and you're a Mongol it was like he was like an undercover uh I think an undercover like special detect I think I might want to look at you know know where tuck yeah I don't know Mike Beltran my dad was a was an undercover like uh I shouldn't say that if he's not sure he will doubled it I don't know no actually maybe all it knows I shouldn't be talking about Eddie too late you fuck sorry just rat him out now you gonna die for sure by talking about it what you should do is not I didn't know that but I'm just gonna but I got a look at you know he's writing a book I think I didn't give me super sceptile hippo eyes cuz Eddie he's writing a book I think he's gonna write a book about his is someone gonna true my name is sour he's writing a book that okay he was not just a regular see whole thing hey this is Sakuraba going to the Hoffmann commented on I come in straight from yoga to do these fucking your sweater looks so fucked up I look greasy I have red marks on Novation head hot yoga all slept for the next two days but I just looked at myself and like thinking only usually a couple seconds of video may I look at all I know look at Don Frye I love tequila oh man I'm robbing the UFC Hall babe greatest that's what they're doing I think that's what this is that I'm in a big sin to wear shirts it said water on him he fought the UFC and also because the UFC owns pride it's a legit uh oh sui-lan pride guys in the hundred percent they should obey Dorian phaidor wanna lay croak Marwan delay should be in but Hobbs I always got that issue he landed a train sidekick on V Thor that put him down on the ground did remember this with Euler Euler didn't tap and then they stopped night anyway and he's like no no no I didn't tap Taku rubba broke and so Gracie's arm gente has a picture of that broke Enzo's on but with Hoyle or Euler just didn't tap and hurler was like I'm fine man like yeah the night I'm getting my arm chewed up but like slip for Euler that proved to be the case in your fight Eddie because when you had that grappling master you fucked his leg up I remember watching that from the sidelines and I was like this shit is so over there's not God I just took it he just let his knee get mangled or is he that flexible dude there's no way give me the antal he's just tough as shit he's just tough as shit he dealt with it he dealt with getting his knee torn apart gente watches on Channel shelters open the paper wise his own thing Henson ever that has a rope to us to tap yeah the watch is fluxes he just watches his own fucking arm break he will not tap I'm eating this cheese like a Monday can another some crazy love him Jay get afraid is never know something crazy yeah shot tree wants me to do a you know that tone in did it Superman yeah yeah okay yeah yeah shot she wants me to have one again Sakharov you see daddy doing are you gonna do it how's your back dude I don't know man my back is not 100% yet how's your back for 100 Wow what'd they offer you like serious cheese yeah we haven't even had your back 400 on a wheel of cheese I want you to shut up I'm negotiating for him we're not starting at a hundred at least the hundreds of cheese bro and all this shit I can do real cheese we're talking about shekar's they come to talk about dollars a couple things shackle still haven't recovered from my back surgery one two I'm trying to find out if I'm I mean I might need surgery on my shoulder I'm not sure I've been doing that hang in therapy I don't know man like you're a man right now not yet but based on those videos that I'm watching about the hanging there you know if you have any kind of Tears if you hang eventually it'll fix it up that's what I'm hearing is that wrong hinge Mint's what it is is one of the things that happens with people with shoulder injuries is you get a lot of pain from impingements means your mobility is impaired because you get tears and damage and then your shoulders sort of like gets scar tissue to never it never increases its mobility or never regains its mobility and one of the best ways to regain your mobility get our chin up bar and fucking hang just hang and I hang every day every day it's one of the main things I do there's two main things how long do you do it for two minutes well I'll just start out with thirty seconds just loosen up get my hands loosen up then I let it go and then sometimes I'll go into a minute and a half or sometimes it go into two minutes but I take my iphone I put it on I hit the stopwatch and then I hang and you know one of the reasons why I did it because when we first of all cuz it's really good for your shoulders but too because we did fear factor and we had men and women I'm hanging and the women all one the men couldn't hang because they're lighter because it yes because the men are too heavy and they couldn't hold their weight up because if you're a man even if you have stronger hands and stronger muscles the amount more that you weigh like against a hundred thirty pound woman you you know most guys are weak in that regard and most primates that's one of the things about the shoulder like our shoulders came from primates so the premise behind this hanging is that what some of the the lack of mobility in impingements and problems that we have with our shoulder joint is simply from a lack of your shoulder articulating correctly and stretching out like in doing so so doing range of motion things like I do a lot of kettlebell shield casts with not a kettlebell but a club I do the shield casts which are really big so these big movements you got a wheel to sort another thing I saw Wonder Woman bro strong the other thing I do that I really recommend is bottoms up kettlebells where you put the kettlebell upside down not so much the trainer you're working on some serious stability this is only 40 pounds but not matter a difficult to could you do that right I don't know it's pretty impressive let me see brilliant rather well I could do it now at 70 I want to start it out but just me okay can I bring you to Italy for a second and pour a little wine then out then I'll show you how and that shoulder was fucking hold on no it was yes that the shoulder I had ambushed I had stem-cell shots shot information now you're unfit already shoulders jacks on the show that I'm pulling back I shot maybe 80 arrows today with a 80 sister when we get Brian with this up he'll spoken before well no so that's all you did it he did it as a gentleman but it's hard imbalance yes done well that's really good it's really good for shoulder stability they okay we'll listen thought you should start off light if anybody's doing it and I recommend no more than five repetitions I believe in that for weightlifting I believe in no more than five repetitions and I think you're really cardio yeah your cardio and your endurance should be done doing other things either skill work like martial arts mmm whether it's Jitsu or kickboxing or strength and conditioning work like running stair just shit like that fucking twelve reps wait a minute by the five and you're going so son hey you ain't yo sure lift off bro help me strong I'm ready show your 250 now no no Freddie chakra my smells I hope you look grown out I'm not sure nothing so so sir hob reps with 600 pound Robin over I'm sure I'm not done so he wraps with 600 pounds live you know that announced that impresses me those fuck movement oh god the power pound that's the best you can say pound barbell that's right sitting there doing this shit yes so even big girls like this motherfucker will let huh now he's there strongman in shock you know even lifting statue at but fourth grade fifth grade it's got some tense ami to shoulder question what was it sorry just take that goddamn fight okay I like this no but yeah well the thing about the Bottoms Up kettlebells is they say you should be able to do 90% of what you can do normally most people can't like 99% can but they say if you have a real stable joint what's going to hold you back it's not strength it's a stabilizing muscles right a stabilizing stabilizing muscles the ones that oftentimes cause issues with your range of motion and with using it in terms of functional strength and using it for martial arts or if using it for you know anything where you would be using like I I guess what I would even think sports like throwing things I mean I would think that shoulder stability is like super important I remember when I was going to ask you when you say no more than five reps do you mean use the amount of weight where you fail and five rounds no no just regular I've I've been following this Pavel Sat sueleen regimen and he created he's like The Godfather of kettlebells in the United States he's the guy that came over from Russia he's got a ton of books out and videos and and his belief is that strength is a skill and that you should never do a skill when you're tired and so the idea and I'm if I'm paraphrasing and fucking this up please I apologize but the principle behind it I know of and the principle is that like say if you can lift something and you get to like seven eight reps and you get to the age rapping like oh like keep going keep going it's like should never do that because you get the strength from doing the amount of repetitions like say if you do five reps you can get to if you do five but then wait a long time wait like 10 minutes sounds too good to be true wait another wait another 10 minutes then do another fun a lot of people beg to differ right you're right you're right on of a lot of people will a lot of people would but I guarantee you if you had cobble on you should listen to Pavel on tim ferrissí spot because he's doing a little bit every day it's kind of you do it yes exactly you should make you it on you can you can do that too but I'm telling you one of the good things about this is you have people that get injured less because your muscles are never working like fully fatigued they're never working to the point of failure but you're still lifting heavy weight but you're lifting say if you could lift something and you could do 10 repetitions don't do 10 dou v dou v put it down take a big long break I think it's like this one returns some work but it's not endurance work so you don't be the same number of reps the problem is it takes longer like you would need to be at the gym for an hour and a half versus 40 minutes you've been - I had a guy name on that means I'm is that longer there's some benefits to it I think I think there's bestest - I don't think doing that all the time knows the answer maybe I would love to taught it to have you sit down with you shopping on your show man the guys in California Paulo he's a wizard he speaks perfect English no wizard my changing three of us should do it cuz you're a fan he's a yes we should do it I'll do it I'll do what you guys let's do it I want to listen could even have him in here with one of the things that he that guy brought to to the United States is not just a kettlebell but also like some serious fucking body weight exercises and then like some movements that now are become become like really standard like Brian counts for me if we go into Italy we know the lira now we're now in Italy we're going to at least 2008 I want you to take your time like I'm wearing - I need a fruit I'm easy - earthy he's gonna like my Italy hit this is Via Veneto sure I do but what I was gonna say is that um Turkish getup which is a big one of this it's huge yes Turkish getup is so big there's Pavel the dudes of stud by the way always wear sweatpants hey bring shop up doing a church get up with 145 please bring him up - and that ridiculous with a bar which is even more like only 200 pounds then you do 225 yeah but it's not like : 225 yes Turkey the techniques awful yes the technique is off it's not that awful then begging for a blown disk but that's still super impressed you 25 225 oh yes there sure on them in this shop I told you hold on I'm gonna get you I'm gonna fruit you up you want to go California you want to stay in California yeah this is your dress look at this how much weight is this that right there is 145 that's 155 155 look at him he's a fucking beast and he did it with 225 is redonkulous that is redonkulous the technique shit though but it doesn't matter man but like though the point is that you have that kind of core power that you can get up for your feet and how applicable is that grappling so one of the most applicable like in terms of like functional strength Turkish getup is one of these most applicable because if you can fucking lie on your back and press something and then sit up with that fucker overhead that was my move if you remember like with relay as soon as the arm would pass inside and try just oh so strong if you didn't watch my fighter - Turkish getup yeah strong Turkish getup man is like one of the most for Jiu Jitsu especially one of the most applicable movements logic Adalia vs Karolina give off she's got Jackson is no fucking fine I got somebody to change camps of Jack had some traps on her and she's got that dude not Greg Jackson who's the old guy that's a main coach oh fuck um-um God the forgotten man in New Mexico oh my god I can't move I can't remember Claude Goodell yet he was part of Jackson

Zillah Mon and gets head kicked into another fuckin dimension does it look up there look at why they know watch this look at this huh but watch watch the combination though watch the combination they hit it again Jamie oh is it a Instagram watch this why watch it front kick to the body bank okay insane the other guys in MMA for with a decent record he's got like a six and four or there's Muay Thai comparable there's that his high champions training MMA had evolved right now lured Zilla she's a professional on earth yeah he's got the best Lord zillah's real name - now relax Ellie che SI LLL kill everyone kick to the body and then run around me out of nowhere how the fuck that guy fight him it was like a fake leg kisses ahead right yeah you fake front kick roundhouse kick or they call a questionmark kick yeah but what happened was a bunch of people - lion fights this is - you know - they're just credit credit or in the interest of full disclosure they had two people pull out that didn't want fight this guy that would fuck that yes guy was making his debut so I fucking fight him cuz crater boy if I was his manager said listen to me son that wasn't an MMA fight though right no no no but it was a guy who had a record in MMA that was like wasn't good it was amusing salty record yeah he had some losses and he had some wins over six and suddenly he wasn't you know he wasn't heavy even ever go mad off yeah and we're not talking about a guy who's like an elite world-class striker and he's fighting this guy lured Zilla who's just a fucking assassin I got a thousand bucks for that and a headache I think for a year thousand dollars anything coach long headache Nunez versus chouriço time your heart is sad come on top Robert will drop the bottom I like Whitaker in that fight and I use well you never know no I'm so that's the main fight now that TJ and and Cody you're out yeah well you know you all wins and then he beat spare you how come you saying it for you pretend you do Robert Whittaker could beat anybody in the world on her Yahoo yeah well like Irwin he might win well he might get put the peanut buddy excuse me sir excuse me up gentlemen he's beat everybody who's he lost her you lost a jock ray you got foot Chakri got fucked enough are back here but yeah she's not defeated in MMA Yeah right thank you gentlemen yeah I've been saying it from day one world two-time world champion bailout yeah well you really picked an underdog right well he is a gorilla when it comes to wrestling he would take a major hurdle it's ridiculous in the world title at 40 years old he might he might or Robert Robert Whittaker might put those fucking kangaroo paws Robert Whittaker is gonna take that fucking right hand from Australia and knock his f sir sir I'm gonna need you to calm down you come on the will constrain you got this 80s NSYNC jacket on which I appreciate and thinks from early to die whatever it is you keep on the blocks like bring me new kid on the block first of all I appreciate it thank you I admire your courage your fashion career thank you I'm also outraged at the same time let's toast into pot that you did you get it for us he bought it we got well it's New Kids on the Block man you got the new kids on the block store they're back by the way ok so this is the main event we're at the main event already already yeah it's 9 o'clock dude oh you want fight well we didn't miss it because it was on the prelims but a Sun salver stat Morales kid from world series of fighting Oh what happened son Sal beat him really nice what decision some people think rise yeah rock people think nice one but a sin so beat him Wow interesting Marlon mirai's in my opinion was the best 135 pounder in the world outside of the UFC world series of fighting them well nobody he's really elite if you look at his skill set and the way he moves and who he's training with our can retrain Mark Henry Frankie Edgar at some Barboza I mean that's his camp everyone's so high in a man I always am I on to buy the hype machine till you get to the OC man to beat people you're right but I mean it's his first fight in the UFC and sometimes a motherfucker first fight but it should be though you haven't lost since 2000 like for some shit ok true but if you are the UFC if you're if the UFC someone says like Brendan Schaub were tired of running this take care of this wouldn't you want to build them up I would want to build up Marlon I would want out let everybody know I agree just want to get my highlight reel win yeah me 3 because it's striking so elite he was not bitches out he's an ass and they need a new content exactly you put him in there with a guy who's it's a monster a monster and he's not that exciting right yeah you put him in there with a good 135 pounder who tests them but you know what man that's how guys lose and that's why you find out who they are I mean that's what happens Sergio Pettis right fought Alex casseras they threw right to the wolves and casseras chokes them out and you realize like okay like you got some shit to learn kid I'm your fucking talented yeah but hey trying to Frank agar your Rodriguez thing uh mr. sharp yeah you know who do you have in this fight because you tend to be very scientific about your big man this one's so tough to pick cuz a Joe say it's so tough to be against fuckin Joe's a although but is max always time I feel like his boxing he's bigger max Holloway is very smart and he's very very like fluid with his movements he moves in and now really good he stays on the outside he'd do anything here's the question what was he gonna do with all those leg kicks big question and if it goes to the ground people forget all those up fucking world champion on the ground uh Aldo bilko he beat Cabrini in a regular to match yeah no one everyone forgets about his grappling he's such a piece of a striker ways of trouble for Holloway cuz Holly that just wants to fucking strike and I think a lot of it depends on like where's Aldo at mentally well he just can't off the Frankie Edgar fighting look fantastic but before I was done I retired remarry retired you play soccer that might have been have ex always all-in though that's always on what else is instrumental in steep a is these guys they just run their camps like he's not at some super camp why is he holding a British flag up when he's from Hawaii you son of a bitch that's a Hawaiian beside you in arm British my oh my good even no have you better know why can we meet Mike for that you never been know why your American green state shit mmm yes Australia and never why and never sat down our fuck everyone up into all those rimmel when you talk all this shit about traveling yeah come to my world I well brother yep

take me to this island and I was going low Beach no your boy Jason from England the Maldives got to the Maldives yeah Jesus Christ probability hey did you see Josie Aldo in Brazil he has a restaurant it's just American burgers in Brazil really just cheeseburger I'm smart it's called famous burgers that's ridiculous Leah's famous Ana sells cheeseburgers hey man like is that cultural appropriation because a bunch of chicks got round Portland these girls got ran out of Portland because they were white and they're making burritos yeah because the United States is vulnerable appropriation that's how you get better and not a white girl bit my burrito Bryan's about to go up Fox News on us here that was a Korea I was talking everything Korea they got a Mexican joint curry they say fucking Mexican music is making the burritos rice cake mean I'm trying to make it back to the food so boys if we ever do a fight companion that's like in Europe or something my dad it's on the weekend I got to take you guys to a real legit Mexican joint down the street there's no like there's Mexican air oh yeah there's a super legit you order for us there's a super legit Mexican joint down the street we're like air all the meat all the TV is in Spanish all the music is Mexican the people barely speaking you could barely order you'll be the only English and I and him will be the only english-speaking people in the room it's fucking tremendous don't lead somebody Mutoh on the weekend whoo I can't really JIT menudo hey why do these guys all have Boreas what's going on a super skeptical eyes guys what's good son authentic shit like I was raised with the Mexican like it wasn't we didn't go time we went to McDonald's when my model Q Hey we're like we're going to all those rambling of Mexican restaurants yes dude he looks tremendous like physically dude he looks as good as he's ever loved her that looks like although when he fought Chad Mendes what are we saying he looks fantastic looks like he's motivated I'm not saying shit about steroids bro it looks like yeah any beautiful shit I didn't say shit let's just by asking what he meant he looks tremendous that was cure our skill is very strict I think for the gut for a guy like Aldo who's been the champion besides Connor McGregor there's only been one ever 145 pound champion the UFC that's that guy you're looking at right now so with a guy like that I think many times it's a battle of motivation yeah I mean he's so dominant he's been in the game for so long and here's the crazy shit he's only thirty unbelievable all the years that Jose Aldo has been dominating and you think about it I mean there's a guy who beat Frankie Edgar Wright first time beat some Italy and then beats me again the second time maybe even cleaner maybe even better right sure think about all the people that if I the the Chad Mendes fight the second fights of war and as first ready hey awesome mark harmonic fight and draw she's not a huge fuckin Toma but that was also when he was having a hard time making that wait yeah that was when we did that press conference the day before the fight and it was the day of the weigh-ins and he barely be on the Dia's because he was so weakened by the weight cut because he hadn't weighed in yet I think although I mean the crazy thing is he's always going to be judged by that Conor McGregor fight which is fucked up which it's kind of crazy I don't judge them for that fuck that but it is what it is but you kind of have to well Mike this week is my profile fire showed that a guy can come in it will guys talented his Conor can come in and first of all fuck with his head which is with Conor absolutely did get inside of his head create a lot of stress for create a lot of pressure forcing a rubbish and then Connor just relaxes fuck slides out of the way and drops that left hand bomb on him here's a question for you guys he solved the puzzle what happened if holly comes in mercs in the first round with this striking that it's gonna really taint his legacy here's the reason I've never fought any really really good striker set for a Conor Holloway for what happens if Aldo kicks the shit out of his legs and has him hobbling on wobbling really early and winds up stopping him do you have another Conor fight and we just Connors knows he got 35 did you go up to 50 short cause he wants to see dana has dana goes just to get him to commit this I have a serious talking like Connors never gonna fight you gotta move on like that's never happening it's so crazy we kind of make up fucking hundreds of Gillian dollars fighting Floyd and then come back and take on a fight against Jose al right I got nothing to win you're right but is a guy that just fought Eddie Alvarez a year ago - right and you got to remember the result of what happens with Mayweather is huge like let's say Mayweather let's just say that on the off chance that may weather just just merch it just mercs them it just doesn't get hit not even one is it I don't know is that Connors gonna come back with the fury yeah he's gonna come back with the fury to the UFC and say fuck boxing I'm gonna come back and this is my sport right now I gotta fight at welterweight see if he makes it to a decision he looks tough he won't be tainted it all depends on one out if he loses and occassion soup are played with yeah he's gonna come back to the UFC with a fury yeah but if I don't even tell me letter wanted if you can if he goes a decision like you're saying it's a win for MA yeah buts close right a long time win for us no he's not even if it's oh no I think you need to give service for to this there's no way Connor would ever let Floyd survive maybe everyone but although if they had a five-run MMA fight let's all agree Oh Floyd Mayweather would never fucking survive I'm nervous it's not a chance in hell there's there's a chance there's a very very very very slight chance aterial I have to bring you guys to the attention of the great no Jose Aldo we have to watch this fight and give it the respect it deserves and listen settle down no I won't settle down because this is a very serious offense I what kind of takedown training yeah takedown defense training Floyd Mayweather puts himself there it's let them have him so do the delusional kind of training or the real legit takedown it's good points that's a good point yeah they go here they go 457 456 455 454 if you're sinking it's one of the best matches for the year mm not the best feeling each other around here hmm how nervous are they both Holloway looks very smooth and relaxed so does Aldo everybody looks good no one I can't let's see act up without his back I just want see uh always answer for those late cakes well these Holloway's very clever he's not gonna rush in man let you see the way he fought Jeremy Stephens I mean he adapts we fought Cub Swanson one of the more interesting things about Holloway's because he talks you know he's like a cool Hawaiian kid like people kind of sleep on that like they think of Hawaiians as being like fun-loving like surfing partying people use a pen it's yeah I know I know but there's something about like the way he talked take him Sara somos something about it's almost like you think he's just so nervous right now he's BJ talk about coming back yes yes I fight and fuckin homeboy I feel like Tennessee Varanasi Bert in tennis yeah year was too much you know yeah BJ can still have some awesome fights but yeah year was just not the right matchup hey this but all don't look like his himself right now is he looked nervous oh he looks perfect nothing's happened just right now he's just moving see he is probably aware that max Holloway wants him to commit and max wants to counter max is taller longer fighter yeah and he's also max is very good at not loading up if you ever watched max Holloway's fights he throws things very precise for the most part meaning he'll load up if he can we can get away with it but he's like with high attrition he's verge is very technical with his striking he doesn't have a lot of super super straight yes yeah very straight punch he doesn't have a lot of fatness movements and because he's a long tall guy that makes up for means so much he's got long tall which is great and then he also has like super efficient movement he's hard to hit hard to hit yeah he's really hard to get like a clean punch yeah super hard to hit anything again he's fucking smart max always fight IQ is very high super and crazy doesn't come from the super camp either but he just saw totally good left hook he clipped all the right there with that left hook and he also knows how dangerous all those leg kicks are so right now max holler shit oh my gosh Josie although all those on high it on my tire oh my god couple lion oh my god gosh Jesus II forget no knee it's an extra forget about good always confidence I remember when he hit Chad Mendes with the Dutchie I'm gonna level to the body that right leg kick and you watch him do it you go oh Jesus max humming weather that storm he weather that fuckin song did Jesus his eyes are wide open Chad should we come back anyway right off the suspension yeah do you know what his suspension was for no I mean straight up easy well no was for something that he used for psoriasis some shit they test the Jumeirah there's something in some psoriasis medication that makes you piss hot mmm I sound like a fucking alpha male apologist right there don't I yeah we shit peds no Brendon no it's right even though Chad Mendes could jump out of a fucking five-foot pool and he's only five foot seven he's good he's easy as a freak super freak athlete but out for real that is what he said I believe him i cured my stress he does have it I know he doesn't have a lot of photos with it where you could see it on skin I know that steroids are a way that they handle Dutch but if you just put that on the thing you might be alright gh RPS what it was before it came out he had no idea what it was mendes explained the test results came back they told me it tested positive for us I don't even know what that is but research sucks I love Chad it says it's used to treat plaque psoriasis skin condition he's been dealing with for years five so it seems legit or Chad yeah he's fucking you solder relaxed yeah but here's oh oh my god too much time we gotta take you yeh call max Holloway dumb him back mmm this is I have fuckin whoa I'll tell you what there's a huge speed advantage on auto side all those so goddamn explosive he's so good at closing the gap man like you remember that Mendes knee he landed in their first fight oh my god whoo no I will never forget calling the your I favor oh my God look at that Uriah favor if I was one of the most horrific displays of leg kicks I was worst thing in the world your eyes said he wanted a feint he was trying not to faint from the pain that's they said how tough is your I fake office to toughen I didn't touch forgot everything we miss the Hall of Fame never never quit enough Tom Scott we broke both his hands against a fucking Mike Brown you kept fighting killers lion nobody tougher than that guy you don't get tougher dude first round first fan he documented the damage to his leg oh my god max Hall with a man that doesn't work on Josie Otto's what would have worked so there's something in psoriasis that shows up as different as a treatment for psoriasis something in the treatment that shows up man that'd be a good eye so I get on some juice a haleyss and go get a dyke go get a prescription for this stuff something you can buy what are you doing look at that uppercut that took that was brilliant but I cured my Sarai's I have plaque psoriasis i Karen I don't know what happened but I just started sucking a lot of dick sucking dick oh you can do steroids suck at this shit in the bathroom John out 12 and Mary okay no and then I bro heard you were sucking dick stopped eating at taking touching a cow dairy and there's this book you wrote a book called the plant paradox about lectins really good book about yeah psoriasis yeah was it seriously well they're certainly riot you guys gonna put about psoriasis are you ridi but if you had psoriasis like he did that's a reason to read it yes not really literally what he's recommending no no it literally I think I get it why he's alone I get off my face I get on my legs really back to round two you wear shorts he saw Scientology short yeah we all agree the below one that first round fuck yeah fuck yeah right now that that book not a 10-8 till he looks good it looks good cool oh oh oh fucking sneaky left hook to the body man although one of the best ever ever ever still that sneaky left hook the body is no joke and he follows it up with that right leg kick a lot and by the way he hasn't thrown any of them yet I know not one no no yeah he doesn't want to well they're the same thing to wait if you're one hottie but that's the same thing that happened with Frankie Edgar see a lot of people anticipate the idea that all those gonna try to take him down Sal's got some serious fucking hands and when he knows he's not gonna kick you but you think he might then it opens up his hand she has it too dude and his hands are no fucking joke because he's so much faster than Hollywood attitude all those hands are like lightning he's he's been talking lately I mean I would like to find out how serious he is but he's been talking about lately about possibly one day fighting and pro boxing that's not out of the question oh my god it is nice to be he's getting 55 I think what's left for about 45 let's be well I mean who knows man me seems to be this if he makes it through five rounds looking like this we gotta shut the fuck up because he made 45 I don't put anything offensive oh my god doesn't matter he's looking fantastic unless they can make a case for him to fight McGregor he 25 they should yes 50 50 50 super Connors never coming down to 45 for him but I would feel like if I was if I was Aldo like you have to be Co undeniable my god this and at thirty years old he can become undeniable still yes he still I mean to us to the hardcore fans he's undeniable undeniable but in order to sell that big pay-per-view that would make Connor want to catch a revenge might get your revenge because he's got a merc everybody he's gotta become this guy like Gennady golovkin like we're to the point where like canal had to fight him everybody keeps talking about clunking clunking oh boy I was good I was like what happened to Jose Aldo came up and fought fuckin Kabhi more Tony Ferguson worked there them crazy Conor was forced crazy yeah yeah it's talking shit yeah yeah he and Merc and Tony I'll tell you that much I knew you say that I'm just saying you have to do the lot let's be real I'll be real oh no it's too much oh no listen I feel like Tony is so fucking durable and so nasty just like such a natural fighter he is too basic game but also ready for super smart super skillful and disciplined as fuck Tony's a handful for anybody anybody anybody I need to see him and fucking could be fightin I know man you know what Tony should just ask him like hey man what do you weigh like let's let's fight at 65 let's just fight we don't die yeah don't die let's right oh follow along with those punches I don't think you tag them actually oh dude I really get that oh man this is beautiful two of the Pharaon back bacon not a whole lot of young folks cuz I think Josie's afraid is gonna catch a right hand if he kicks although I mean I tell you what though Max is showing his fight IQ man he's showing his fight IQ Glyph how he's stretching those arms out in front of him he's he's giving that out good Conor as he beat both these dudes yeah but it also like do you see how he's doing that first of all he's doing it totally legal oh good head movement acting with the right again this is crazy hey Conor beat him - with a torn knee by the way I don't want to hear about that all body kick Dan they're going off now whoo man strong kick to the body back his back oh yeah it will fight what a fight Matt won't it matter she like a motherfucker got the savage as he soars Aldo pista you know if you take away that one punch by Conor right the best effort he's passed the table number one I was so crazy I would say it's crazy did take that in mind but he did take that hit ain't that a bit so you know what it is man it's like there's a puzzle to every fighter the question is did he seal that puzzle problem up that little hole that Connor found you seal that up like no fights kind we won't know damn it they have to fight that could be five if you were that if you were the head of the UFC would you be like listen we got to make this have a voice know what to do I would have Connor uh prime fight GIP first item fight floor than GSP gonna pay don't want people to be educated I want oh nice chair oh man I want people to feel about fights the way we feel about fights you know what I'm saying I hear you I got want people to be a joke Oh max not an enemy like always about hands up hands up hands down Oh Oh max Holloway well I see us baby body and get away yes tactic Oh Oh buddy in slap you just bitch-slapped him oh shit oh well you've been careful up here after the bell - Jesus max was trying to give him the thumbs up and although turned his back so max lost a psychological war there he gave a thumbs up to do that it's back to him that's not good what a fight long what finals all right max always a guy is down too though you think oh uh uh I mean probably right if you had a gas just in Bridgend remember games down to the shore like right now that is clean that's key so much quick lean he looks good look at this one GS move I love it I love it I love it look at C now oh he gave the thumb to his Badgers never too nice you gotta be quick Paul no got some bad fuckin ginger playing the hand and you got a double and you meet might need to walk towards him after that right yeah yeah yeah you might come on boys and play no stool in between rounds now no no as dangerous as although a standing he's got high level chokes oh yeah although our last round two diamond yeah like that's not even being yeah not many thought about banners jiu-jitsu going on here at all he's been gonna salsa mustache bodied up in this yeah great head astir steal your girl with that face water right it's all yo girl I wish i okay so here's the question we're in round three now right it was for forty four max is down - let's be yeah I would say right if you had a look at the score cool but interesting rounds right the max has got his both guys has gotten things off but all the looks fucking sensation only the second round will ensure the first row knows like well max monkeys Brandon please my t-shirts you're crazy I was interested in the first round Godse I'm saying that first round though max really got outclassed I was second well there was a big better there was a big long period to begin where everybody's waiting for somebody to move true and then although eventually got the best of the exchanges he's just showing something really nice Maspalomas trying to get him back kick back - what - I don't know if he's on the mountain oh my god this is some Oh Oh neck here's the other thing you gotta laugh how many wars all those already been in yeah I mean think about this no a real fight like took a lot out of him as the Chad Mendes thing though I mean and also Conor well he's had to it the Recaro Ricardo Lamas fight Lamas had a monster he's much too oh my comical Dominick crazy but he was on antibiotics when he was uh shit's gettin on my god yet is Brennan booth oh my god my following sagem your voice Oh need of the spotty got cake sirs Masshole both of them although with that sweet knee I know I don't know I'm hating on although get it although I max to win for some reason you know what one of the the best things that's ever happened at it being a commentator is learning how to appreciate just a performance oh yeah no I mean I've got favorites I always had favorites man always when I was are only human oh that right hand I try not to now but like if somebody that I'm friends with like if cowboy fights huh so we're it's hard it's hard for me very very hard for me to call your fights were the hardest I've ever had a call really 100% so hardest I've ever had a call so you have to like oh no oh my god always hurting it's not over yet around maximum length amount oh my god oh my god let them go say hello oh you're grappling going on exhaling I attacked him again Oh little mamas let him up yeah all do is out let a Meyer Street oh my goodness make him get up max knock him out Oh what heart what harm would hurt his right heart by Aldo to survive this he's

born holy shit Hawaii finally gots the rule champ god damn fucking Hawaii holy shit max Holloway oh you know what man Aldo he's shaking his head because he still wanted to be able to fight and it's a referees call to stop the fight and he's very upset about that he was stuck but man it seemed legit to me now's a legit stoppage it seemed legit to me seem intelligent oh so oh you know it's legit Eddie the cream to use legit was legit oh yeah you think it's legit right yeah I do yeah I would I would imagine - stop - long time ago I believed to protect the fighter company right I like this I like that that Big John let it go that long is business know what that was a fight change rarely see he took a beating for like two minutes straight yup yup came back man you got tagged glad that what girls oh so hard man sees what he goes through man what an incredible fight look at math son I'll let him jump in the fucking you want some hot lag you want this lag man yes no this is Fela flew all the way from Hawaii four guys chasing my mo where's the rock what the fuck yeah brah free up man you got a world champion Hawaii Cleveland Cleveland we got a world champ fuck Wow Cleveland we got a world chest-deep a that's right that's one of my all-time favorite a guy who just won the title things the Steep a Miocic did Cleveland's what'd he say about his situation somebody he ran out onto the cage you couldn't believe it after he knocked out my homie let's blame for that we got a world champ there's a choice / - assurance Kelly you like him what you like Machine Gun Kelly he's acted a battle Jamie like say something nice or say nothing at all hey listen there's a serious movement in Cleveland yeah well listen Cleveland is a I had a great fucking time we did the UFC in Cleveland just a little while ago and I did a I did a show in Cleveland I had a fucking great time man they're fun dude that Kadapa that city's coming back to life Hawaii with me looking comes time what's that yeah look at this bang Boober come on sign drops him with that right hand nothing fancy is it the one - the one - beautiful timing though man people timing look at this look it up oh my timing with that right hand is perfection he's on top of him dropping bombs on him there was a couple of times in the fight where it looks like it looked like Aldo went out but his will his will and his need to fucking get through this like right there bang come on man yeah all it is to be Josey Aldo so just once in a kind of freak fight with Conor rather than 9 to beat him like this I mean max Holloway beat the shit out of him he beat him in a way that no one's ever beat him because his bass and kept going to any beat him in a way that no one's ever beat him Conor only beat him cuz he caught him max Holloway beat him down and beat him and I'll be destined to beat him down he's got through the gauntlet how big is not taller we gonna be Hawaii and fighting his fucking giant I've been saying he's BJP on that island I've been singing that kid's praises for a long time he came into the UFC super young poor Joseph young - who's there on the background holding that devastated like it's his justice the worst result to lose though don't think yeah hey man it is what it did a great job it's a great fighter it is what it is this is fighting and people win and people lose and the sport ultimately it depends upon these sort of fights it depends upon these all-time greats like aldo facing some guy who's got the solution to what that guy presents yeah and that's what aldo did tonight how i mean he went out there with all of his championship medal and he laid it all on the line fought his best and his puzzle got solved by the new graham hug let's hear let's hear what it's Connor has both these guys give us some volume cuz know how to beat Bob they beat him with a torn ACL look at it a long time ago still is incredible packs all the way first and foremost our tank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ second of all got a lovely son at home baby rush you got a not going on baby you're not to go about rush Halloween great I love it George rush st. Pierre inspired Ness or no nah he's Hawaiian there bogna now though awful shout-out to Brazil always a good move yeah but there bonum where's my 50k you see although I made the decision right I'm a smart you see why damn UFC you why with very tough shit fuck I don't know I don't travel overseas but I will fucking fly to Hawaii and alright we generally be the I will that making it happen how about we do a joint show up in that motherfucker what we miss the running short show yeah how about we do a fight companion in Hawaii if they do a UFC in Hawaii we all fly out to Hawaii and do some sort of a fight companion in Hawaii so even if I don't work event we still there let's be in Hawaii yeah let's see if we can get a fight companion booth let's just cut the shit okay you see like this looks like it you wouldn't do a fight companion place is like at the show and get it in your decision live in this show no we do it from sources thinking this is this is what I'm saying this is the kind of commentary I like doing so what we need to do is we need to treat the fight companion like an embassy like we our own special country rules yes slice just push right in their lives yes just leave us alone I wasn't like this once I with our shit bring Jamie horn oh and let us do commentary you don't have to listen you got other options you can listen to the Tories into the corner to choice options right you can stop overspending shops oh hey you can listen to it in Brazil you can listen into it and Portia gives that green adenines ring I think I've been cool and sweet like we need to sit down with Dan White and have a fucking conversation gonna be better one of those doing Suites instead of ringside if we did I think we should order like a c4 season and watch it we could totally Wyatt or we just keep doing it for me right yeah yeah we're not getting on a plane for five hours exactly this is do it here do you imagine that laughter that in in fight companion if that was one of the options so you get fight companion or in a fight pass you get fight companion you don't aerate the rain as we go up if I didn't get what I've already contacted you that'll get you don't want that you know that it's not a good idea come on man nobody started long ago we have turned out on the fence head of files so we get remake those motherfuckers away there's 42,000 people watching right now live that many yeah hold on dude out is that a record I don't know man frankerz Alex Jones right yeah it was like sixty song Jesus I forget people here even watching there's a lot of the stadium watching dude how about dear close Mark Hunt look at that fight I got I should have done my hair grunts and Daniel Kelly Daniel Kelly might just be able to beat everybody there's something weird about that dude he has some weird old man thing going I can't you know thing man a competitor thing then the double knee braces right it's crazy fucks up I asked him about it after the last time I interviewed him after a fight and he said if he wasn't fighting he would get surgery ah he said but as long as they let him tape the fuck out of his knees dude he's like a mummy all judo guys are like usually judo P bundle all their knees are all fuck steady their knees get jacked goddamn max Hollywood so long fast Little Gym and Halloween with that fucking long punch but although countered him I'll get that right is amazing dude although counter demand him some really sure but that's it right there oh that's how good mask it you know it's crazy ding OH some people thought maybe cups want to get the next shop at max fucking annihilate it cub yeah well you know what here's what's important about this fight is not just that max Holloway did this but that max Holloway did this to Jose Aldo max Holloway left no doubt in anyone's mind this is the best 145 pound fighter on the planet Earth yep if you look at how Aldo got past Frankie Edgar look at how although got past everybody except for Connor and then you look you know the Connors not coming down to 140 anymore that's the motherfucker right there and you an ecstatic tonight Holloway Frankie your well you gift you then what in the world don't you think that your Yaya Rodriguez has two forks in the road right there's the fork of unrealized potential so he comes into this fight he's got BJ Penn behind him right he'll annihilate BJ Penn he hits BJ Penn one of the greatest of all time hall-of-famer with a 360 round kick to the net that just doesn't happen right yeah then he gets merked my French is strewing so he has ready for his hop was not ready but he has two paths like either he can learn from how Frankie was able to take him down and beat the fuck out of him and then figure out a way to never let that happen again or be overwhelmed by the pressure of that loss and the circumstances and the sorrow depends on his mind and also depends on matchup like I like yeah it's all away that's a great guy good fight as always I can take him down so it just striking for striker tax both bill 45 hours that's a great fight yeah you almost it'd be damn near even money I bet yeah but I guarantee you're gonna see max Holloway taking people down to I think that dude is smart as fuck well he changing Frankie's adding to his Ricky's not gonna take Frankie down you're right there's buddy Sinclair's less an extra foot reaching but Joe there's really no grapple a lot of grapplers left you're right Frankie you're right Frankie's the big threat if you're a guy who can't stop a takedown the number one fetes Frankie and because I the white gave him - yeah here why would you give him the one guy you think I your body yeah but are you still yes potentiating your own young you're having your young you say that you believe in protecting fighters you get a guy like John Jones John Jones youngest ever build does a flying knee in his opening movie yet show it on all right look what he did that or but that's what he did that's a hard case though because couple good fights but that hard case because you don't give him to a grappler like Frankie knowing that the guy cannot stop a legend all time give him time to develop and give him the other guys who are very exciting strikers he's gone already John before he won the title had some very good fights a time but his real good fights were after he got the time for sure boy Brandon Vera national guard says yeah cradled Ryan bear the dantos fight with the Stephan Bonnar fight was one of the most interesting ones because he showed up creative it when we show seen it's been an elbow yeah he sure how creative he is and he showed out fluid is moving is and it just showed that he was on another level i guy you really never got that but also yeah you're like he had a split decision win over Bruce leave early right this very good point and they're like over his right leg hurts like god yeah yeah yeah it's a very good point because I feel like he felt so good after the BJ Penn fight he felt like he had arrived and he's like that Alex Harris fight is out the window I'm fucking past that now and he might have been but he wasn't there's just this disease level there's level you know how it is cos there's loving everybody everybody that knows anybody in any kind of martial art whether it's boxing or wrestling or jiu-jitsu there's always people who overestimate their proficiencies pronounced you should chew gym again Tamura dilution guy stay at my church food he quit that earthy you oh this is your fruity that's your kind of money but the boys my boys night we're hanging in Italy I'm fuckin super impressed with max Holloway man allow me to razz him Bruce a Frankie that's coming that isn't the only 25 how was max Halloween now I want to say he got into the UFC Winnie's either twenty years in Hawaii because Hawaii and you're sure gather like fucking peanut butter and jelly me they fucking love fighting cuz BJ BJ started that man dude listen I got my shit champ yeah and a legit champion be who's a sparkly one of the great if look I gotta say Connors the greatest 145-pound of all time because he knocked out all the who is clearly teachers consumed but in terms of like who's got more victories of course it's although body is no more motive or its but the product the problem is the the ultimate question is it's not we're not doing MMA math here you're having two guys actually fight each other so if you said like who's the greatest of all time well it would have to be Aldo because he beat all these guys no no no because the two of them fought and Conor Merck dub correct so you got to give it to him otherwise there's no other metric there's no other metric other than a knockout what happened does it right it's the most important body of fun how you can be penalized for beating someone easily me like you beat him too easily account yeah oh you got a really got lock him down but this is my balcony hottest thing is in the locker room they show him do the exact combo yeah like it wasn't like a freak like oh my god oh you show him step back throw the exactly on goes this is what's gonna happen yep yeah and they also showed him do that front leg side kick to the leg it's no he created the distance he's hopping in and out and he wanted to slide back and counter with the left and he hit it perfect he called he's the best ever you have to say he's the best ever even if he never fights featherweight again why because he ko'd the best ever the real reality is all does the best ever but Connor kod yeah you couldn't say without the Aldo fight that Connor was the best ever because you look at all the different people to both of them fight like wow it's really close it's really interesting but well then what you know but although I was more fights but then once they actually fight which is all that says it's all it matters the same is all that matter it's not MMA matter right you're right the competition they fought it is I mean that's so you got to give it your life and people fight against it no because although is the champion for so many years you're a hundred percent right his body of work is much more impressive and there's always going to be an asterisk next to Conor because you know there was just this one time he fought for the title at 145 Kayode all those like yeah well be cool y'all be cool I'm here and I read says the belt come get some opera it's really clear it's really clear they're tied for the second guy this shirt would say and what's the tiebreaker oh they're fight that's why you what happened in the fight right you decide right you know what but I know what's interesting it's really simple but sometimes like you look at top tens you look at a guy who's number six and then the guy who's number eight knocked him out in the last fight you're like what in the fucking body of work that's crazy I know also say like all chosen upset he got lucky like says who when a guy punches you in the face and wanted to punch you in the face and then punched you in the face where's the luck we what are you doing rolling cotton but one common of hand the defenseman wanted to be in the argument of the best ever like for although to be in the argument and from aggregor for anybody Jon Jones like just to be in the goddamn argument yeah who's the best ever known as in fedora or is it an Anderson who is it is it face those are the two are that's the two argument I'm always been in the hands of Jon Jones is in there no not yet what make you so could be his body of work you're right he could but there's so much there's so many problems with that so many problems with the off the field is the OSP problem you know we where he had a good fight I think I think he performed well gets a really dangerous slick guy but he didn't put on a show okay then Anderson Silva has the Demian Maia fight the thought is nice fire those horrible fights never had some boy fights Anderson had those earlier and then he started dominating people and when you look at some of the crazy Anderson fights like the Forrest Griffin ko when you look at Anderson like motivated Anderson when he's like in shape and the James Irvin when he went up to 205 to serve I know it's true but when you see him as an assassin against Vitor Belfort Vitor who a mark Hortons prime to be dangerous yeah - Artie Artie Vitor but go through Don Shogun you know I'm saying yeah it wasn't that's not true wasn't TRT Vitor back then no Vitor wasn't on TRT and became on TR 25 Torre fought Anderson he looked different when he fought Anderson he was like Eden leaves Vitor Belfort yes John PTV was being tracked was that what was Vitor was Vito when he was 19 is that still considered TRT before no no no that's amore defeat told us that he did but he said that's my strong because yeah he was 240 that's every 240 with a silencer 59 sure chimpanzee for every ready and I met his trainer

Photoshop on the one side I'll just get two champagnes I think they actually had a shrink too well that's him after braces yeah racist names like 40 that's that be braces in veneers yeah this is yellow teeth were also off to one side I don't know how he got I want to know the story of he how he got in is there video out there to Scientology how did he get in like what happened that's good question I think somebody recruited him from a movie he was good no he wasn't already in movies he wasn't god yeah oh my god yeah Jackson I rode the guy who made that happen that one Henry already that Lee already who who had let loose on Scientology there's like season for my god Leah Remini yeah I can do my podcast I don't but you know when I first met her she was deep in it she was with Kevin James she was on K in Queens and that's when I first met her and I know he's like she's a Scientologist like wow she's really nice she's very cool man that's just cutie to mind control she's my man that's all that is well somebody figured out how to control people a long time ago just in that case I'll come up with a set of rules and say that this is like someone's looking out for the set of rules whether it's God or it's Buddha or in students create a college to do that and people follow it it's a great earring is the stuff that too you know on it's nothing but reports of child abuse it just gives a lot of uses cults yeah yeah it's one of the big problems with cults you know one of the Joey Diaz his ex-girlfriend's was in a cult like when she was a kid and she said that the guy who was the head of the called molested everybody yeah of course lest all the girls yeah molesting one of the fuck everybody zweite yeah it's all just that's girls yeah well it's all in most of these cults that's what happily give me all the crazy David Koresh that's a crazy thing David Koresh they shut that motherfucker shit down we are allowing this to happen it's like we want it to happen it's like it's a CIA MKULTRA experiment all I told you look at the time penny hey give me an ultimatum let me feed the beast I love riders out of the storm I don't know shit I don't know anything like a guy was loading them how and when you look into it you gotta look in the look into it I've been looking into it hey think about this think about how crazy that religion is yeah about that which one and think about how it's allowed to survive and thrive you see like Scientology even better I'll do you one better Scientology doesn't have to pay taxes do they figured out a way how to not fuck how is the government tell you hold on I'll tell you I'll tell you the actual fact I'll tell you the actual fact they organized a massive lawsuit campaign against the IRS and they said that if you can say that all these different religions whether it's Catholicism or Mormonism Mormonism as very questionable backgrounds Mormonism was started by Joseph Smith who is a known con man I mean Mormonism course it's the others there's like he found it when he was 14 he said he found golden tablets that contained the lost work of Jesus and only he could read him because he had a magic seer stone like when you look at the actual you're talking about a guy who we know the guy right so Scientology was like well so fucking what if you can take that if you take Mormonism like why can't we get tax-exempt status and they said no fuck you you're not a real religion and like bullshit if if anything is a religion where religion in that sense I support them I don't they I think all religions should have to pay taxes but I think that if anybody gets a free ride Scientology's you should get a free ride soon you're gonna have this goofy loophole and then they qualify justice or an appellate if Mormons get up so that's what happened Eddie his massive lawsuits it was then this is all you could find it I thought I saw the HBO documentary so I'll dash it load of lawsuits and the IRS was fucked I'm outgoing clear the galaxy so nice brought amazing dark it's a great point the books even better great because it goes into the sick book it's being abandoned everything is allowed to happen the thing is no one could pay attention to everything everything is allowed to happen all the time and then once we find out that something's happening it's like okay now what like with your shop son anyway you can't shut down a religion well you can't shut down anybody's freedom I might beat you if you have an ideology your freedom of expression your your ability to gather and talk shit all I know is if if I had a country to run I would start if I was running in the country I would start cults and have mind-control experiments with two but I would have time in between negotiating oil deals and trying to figure out whether or not we should stay then I would make NATO and climate a parent control I I know what you're saying in a way you in my and me you're right but no one has the time to do ever is not enough to micromanage the entire world to the two kids right it's just there's there's there's only so much shit you can let you take care of this without lives I guess good let people take care of themselves Illuminati got keys giving I guess not enough time for my control experiment there's too much shit going on well they definitely have done some fine control experiments to that no to say you are the pride around a country I'm saying of already if I read a gradual way let's say I'm saying a by comic book guy right comic books I would do my job I got a question for a new this one you're gonna start a religion you're gonna start a religion you're gonna start a run do this and just yeah no bullshit him this way and what can I just watch master - what who I want to know from you and you better tell me my country would not really 500 or so the handy always hold on you know it you have a question Brian you better tell me this cuz I know you know the fucking answer Brehme as a dictator hold on I want you to ask know you got here like the air with us I want to know right now on this podcast who's running this country I have no idea come on bro I don't know give me a little idea cuz I know you got a fucking I don't know bro you're right you're playing dumb right now my god I'm gonna guess I'm gonna ask a state based on nothing but circumstantial evidence I'm gonna Oprah I'm gonna guess uh and you can get us control the banks that's I don't know who would they be Rothschilds I don't know right here I could be wrong that's thirty Rothchilds could be a complete notification hooked up on the end of the day in the Rothschilds like a family here's what salir it's 1 billion to like 70 trillion 700 trillion 1/7 million or trillion is build whatever this number lays it the amount of money they own it's either one billionth or that sounds very sets real a hundred percent there's a family that owns all the banks no there is a family that has a considerable amount of money they passed down from generation generation and these may be hundred situations how much it out has the conspiracy third the run the century a the examples are you we don't we don't know it is that's what they say like say between 1 billion in 700 billion up says 500 tree but do they even exist do the Rothschilds even exist that could be a conspiracy I can I say one thing the Rothschilds are hoaxes okay anyone existing about the Rothschilds when you talk about the Ross Charles and these different big families there's one thing in common it's a hoax nope follow me on this there was if you hear nope they're all Jewish and by the way if you look at their roots you look at the roots of these monies you a lot of these rumors lobbies rumors conspiracies they start Indy the free mail not to kids and their ultra right-wing camps and a lot of the anti-semitic auntie you know thank you know history Nelson but not to consider ways that goes way back into Europe that goes way back with the Nazi so just be careful where these things come from you'll find the federal route I know a shit but their routes Adam on YouTube yeah the would sometimes start and really at awful realizes so you should read a book every now and then hey Alisa gots I don't know you aren't right the guy he's had I don't come here and the looming tower to relieve I don't know the plant paradox which I'm reading now about food very interesting unless it benefits me to believe something unless I make money from it yeah I could say to do you know fuckin idiot you're a fucking idiot you know like what if I believe this dude you could be fucking your kids could be go to college very measurable religious and just if you just sign off and say you believe it Mike that's not what's gonna happen is it illegal if I don't believe it well I get thrown in jail no then I don't want to I don't want to believe shit if it if it doesn't hurt me I it shouldn't be such a big deal that's you know that's I don't know what to believe man I don't know if the Rothschilds are real I don't know reptilians are real I don't know that Satanism Israel I don't know shit one thing I say is learning getting closer to the truth can be achieved by looking at all the independent lines of inquiry all in part lines are use they come to nineteen cents how to come to the truth you know yeah is that what you're trying to tell me exactly how to come to no I'm just saying general I'm that when I'm general because I would never tell you to get close okay okay okay come on come on man well I'm talking about let me say this cuz I think this is really important one of the problems that I've had me personally I've had with any idea is that once I have an original idea or once I start looking at something a certain way I've become married to it yes and I've had real problems with that and all of us have it's confirmation by the speakers in but I'm just saying I've had real problems with that like personally where I had to look at like what I believed and go well why do I believe that and why do I think and there's been a bunch of times whether it's your Bigfoot or UFOs or I mean I've looked at the JFK assassination a hundred different fucking times you know there's been times when I said well maybe Oswald got lucky I mean like people do get lucky like the I've shot the first animal I ever shot I shot at 200 yards and I probably shouldn't hit and it dropped I could have fucked that up you know you can if you're aiming is something pull the trigger and hit the president back of the head it is possible I don't think it did it seems to me more like some other shit was going on if you look at all the different pieces of evidence you know man and the problem with saying this happened that happened which I used to do all the time is that you don't fucking know you don't know you don't know but you until you do know when you say you know and you might be wrong it becomes a ego thing so you can speculate yes you can get closer to the true she one approximates it here scientists they always say it's so fascinating scientists start always with doubt and what they do is they always say if you really corner signs that say well this is the most likely based on the data I've looked at our literature I've read carefully this is the most likely possibility it's really simple here how they talked that way because like with global warming or anything have you held Krauss uh yes Pascal listen I've had him on my podcast I listen to you both the podcast you had with him and tried to read some of his book it was tough but yes I book is rough - yeah when he starts to have to have a back edge symmetry when he was going to gauge symmetry and I fucked up by opening up my podcast asking him to explain gauge symmetry oh I know it's insane you know I got some analytical physi yes I got this one I got somehow in your head I got that there's a web there's an invisible web and we come into contact with it we we become mass but we have to understand as skeptical as we are of this shit these are the same motherfuckers that put together the Large Hadron Collider they are spinning atoms just slightly under the speed of light slamming them into each other and recreating the very instances right after the Big Bang they're doing that shit right now see there's a team of science I'm a size 130 countries yeah thousands South you guys feel like guys about how many of the relief you guys all agree that Nikola Tesla was a great scientist I was a Jewish he was a genius but you got to remember that Nikola Tesla lived in a world where he was so far ahead of the curve and there's very few people that were able to compete with him or even understand what he was dealing okay do you know that if you go to youtube and you punch in Nikola Tesla hoax fraud nothing comes up that's amazing sense yeah that's nothing I there's not anybody on the planet trying to say all that shit was bullshit there's no you go to YouTube punch in Nikola Tesla hoax fraud not one fucking video so there's videos that come up that saying something else was a hoax Nikola Tesla proves it or you know Nixon Nixon Tesla proves hoax but not one video of anybody ever say Nicola touch it I feel like I like that but yeah but this is just the fact you can take it or leave it put in Albert Einstein hoax fraud endless videos it's love Rosa free yeah that's videos and like wait a minute it's an Albert wasn't Albert Einstein Time Magazine's Man of the centuries okay but not even let me stop okay how do you get smarter second let me just help you here that's getting very dramatic so let me stop for a second if you see I mean if you put in Holocaust hoaxes you'll get an equal number I'm not talking about but you know that's true if you put in Sandy Hook hoax you get an equal number you get it you get a tremendous number of people to think that a lot of Edessa your necklace right it's amazing well also about him how about people that don't think that Richard Pryor was genius whose are Richard Pryor have you ever met a comic once it doesn't think Richard Pryor's one of the Great's of all time they don't exist videos of people trying to prove that he was wasn't the greatest no but I mean look I believe was a hoax no there's nothing on Nikola Tesla I don't think that Einstein was a hoax dude a correlation no one nation shit I'm not I don't know nothing all I know is there's nothing on Nikola ties like ya know it wasn't anything but there's thousands of Albert I look into his life like oh is there anyone besides your little Tesla that oh does it happen is he the only guy well Thomas Edison was always a Thomas Edison was always accused of stealing the idea that Nikola Tesla in fact Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant in the middle of like what was it the world science and it comes Oh Thomas Edison Thomas Jefferson Oh Thomas Edison electrocuted a fucking elephants there's because he wanted to prove that alternating and direct current like what AC DC which was Tesla's idea there's video of an elephant electrocuted not my Thomas Epsilon nobody's ever since Thomas Edison did it the reason why he did it is to prove or to try to like it was propagate against Tesla's ideas which are more advanced or movable like he wanted he wanted there to be alternating currents and death Tesla's it was a direct line Stein's were alive and kicking at the same time Tesla there's quotes the quotes could be bullshit you know Tesla Tesla several dead washing course design the clowning him it wasn't like he thought Einstein was a wrong reason that could be a fertile I've heard I've heard little shit but there are quotes that can be bullshit of new Tesla there's I keep make a popping up anybody think braking hold on yeah hold on there's quotes test the quotes saying the theory of relativity is basically a joke there's test neuron no no what I'm saying is it could be bullshit but it keeps coming up well no no we know that the theory of relativity is used right so that we know that that's not so much a theory anymore but here's what I think that he's addressing so Einstein from what I have read is Einstein was a great mind but he was coming up up at a time where he got most of the credit he got he became very he became a famous scientist when there are a lot of scientists that working on very similar ideas an average scientist you got alona and contributing to to the larger debate about Nebuta where is it new uh quantum physics right now there was also a debate about their methods whereas Tesla was a big fan of experiments Einstein was a big fan of equations and one of the big quote big criticisms one of the big quotes is a witness of today what is this Tesla's overrated debunked all this ursula Tesla is a popular figure in conspiracy culture what is it saying what is he saying he says justice is that majestic is real what is he saying this is he's never right here he says Tesla was a popular figure today but he's also a self publicist Mista stuff he didn't invent he did not event alternating current he just was one of many people working on it okay but he's probably one of the four forefront minds right being a showman helped popularize use he's so good at that eventually had to I don't know if he's right or not not tested mean there's no way everybody said there's no one saying anything against him with but Midwest is brain energy and he's he's 100% official story he's not against not woo he doesn't believe in that one conspiracy yeah you're right 100% and that's one of my the only criticism they had about that guy like when we talked about the gulf of tonkin he doesn't want to even admit that Gulf Power Cell tag Thomas Evans obvious also with the operation Northwoods who's trying to downplay I'm like look man whether or not you know what happened in any other place well you know the Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote down a memo saying whether the plan was to have Guantanamo Bay attacked by Cuban friendlies that we're going to give them guns give them bombs have them attack America say he was like well it never was like implemented I was like it doesn't matter they signed it Kennedy had a veto yes but Kennedy vetoed it that's why those checks and balances in place a no no the mindset behind the type of person that would want to blow up Americans and blame it on the Cuban so we could justify the founding family I knew that there would always be people within the right that would do anything they could and so that's where the checks invalidate don't always go through perfectly that's I mean if if prep if Nixon was Reagan or I mean if it was rather if Kennedy rather was Reagan or Kennedy was Nixon he might very well have let that slide who knows I mean a different person in a different circumstance with a different view of the world could have let the Joint Chiefs of Staff pull that through so that shows you the mindset the mindset is undeniable that people absolutely do conspire so when you're a guy who never believes in conspiracies you do just as much damage as a guy who always believes well so Alexander Hamilton said that it's not just a king you have to worry about it's your actual government that's been elected so just because your Parliament he was using problem as an example jessica's Palmer was voted in doesn't mean that small group of people will not get power-hungry and drunk so therefore you've got to have all these checks and balances you've got to have courts you've got all kinds of things and you have to have a Senate and a House of Representatives this is where these ideas came from that's what the genius of those fucking guys what's the only thing right now is keeping Trump from his travel bans doing a lot of their encrusted ill but even with those checks and balances he's still able to cut back the EPA budgets democracy was from the Paris I'm in agreement so there's a lot of weird shit that goes on that they didn't anticipate but what they did anticipate they did put enough checks and balances that's keeping from one person from just completely dominating the thing because I know they came from modeling keys those guys they came from monarchies they knew that no matter who you are as a human being whether you're democratically elected or you're you're divinely elected like the king was in Europe you are going to take advantage of your power you're going to get drunk with power it's very human yeah and to want to have control over other people and do for them with what they don't know is best for themselves that world man look at whether it's Libya or look at North Korea or looking at people want to dominate the people around them they've been doing it since the beginning of time if you don't think they're doing right now you're fucking crazy right the question is what is the absolute objective thing that's happening here like the objective view of what's happening here that's where it gets real tricky for all of us whenever we say we know that something is happening when I there's no way you can know and I know that there's no way you can know so now we have a really tainted conversation because we're not looking at this whole thing honestly whether it whether whatever the fuck it is whether it's aliens or life after death or anything I need to absolutely fucking know that you're being honest yeah and as soon as I don't think you are or I think you're trying to gain power as soon as you see a politician give some bullshit fucking speech where you know that they're giving this cane this can cadence this nonsense rhetoric and you know as soon as they get in there they're gonna give in to the fucking special interest groups like look that's right that's a bush it happens with everybody happen with Obama that's why a free press that's why a free press from all different angles is so important uncensored press and that's why it's called the Fourth Estate man that keeps fuckin power in check transparency does and that's the other thing the other problem is that when government grows which it always has a tendency to do what does government do it taxes and passes laws to very coercive measures you keep growing government here's what happens it doesn't get more powerful jeunesse it gets more powerful but also more people are dependent on it more people are feeding from the public trough and then it becomes really hard to get rid of it it's really hard to get rid of a government program once it starts because there are a cottage industry grows up around to me that's a big problem they have right now with prisons yes there's so many fucking prisons and they start prison guard Union start passing laws they start lobbying to get laws passed to keep marijuana illegal and should their prisons are filled yes because these prisons become generators of money that's right they don't become places where become the economy's enslaved yeah dude it's over so your politicians not going to say anything that's gonna get it not grow that industry there's too much pressure what is a politician you spent 40 percent of your time raising money from strangers for your next election what about that conspiracy theory about hip-hop and rap gangsta rap being created to promote crime crime at kick-ass alligators get a natural conspiracy yeah thank you that was on your wife here is alone in there Long Beach apartment strange figure will skills are there private prisons people profiting off prisons right Michael Jordan doesn't want to do with pallone if they have any connection to okay but here's our timeline here's a problem that timeline through with the private prisons weren't really that popular is that seven prisons were popular like the rap music really came up the original racing wasn't even but it wasn't even a gangster rap it was gangster awesome economy way which I'm like no I came before like here when the Bronx was on fire no don't push me cause I'm close to know specifically gangster rappers they came out commerce' carnies and yeah the conspiracy thing take it to the next level yeah and the gangster rap from Compton and all that shit but it came from New York man it came from when the Bronx it came from that's where gaster rápido came from rap came from New York the whole story is really undeniable that like ice-t and NWA and you know Ice Cube that was thanks yeah that's gangster talk about what about that the game

there listening I want to help you guys out any remotely commiserate like bitch I ain't got that problem what the fuck save that for so over Oh Oh goddamn it I want to say this we're gonna wrap this up but I want to say this sometimes we have these podcasts and shit gets crazy we get heated and we start smoking pot and we're drinking and there's like a missing isn't a wrong impression that some people get that we don't love each other when I have the best time you no matter what we agree or disagree on you know I think it's uh is important this is like family man I've I've had a lot of arguments with my brother and my cousins and stuff and it's like you know you are mad and you are going back and forth and I fuck that when you said that and you said this but when it when it's all said and done man and I'll say something you know I think it's good because I respect your opinion I respect your opinion not like Jamie I got quite no oh you guys I respect everyone in this room's opinion and I think it's very important even if you don't agree with someone's opinion to be confronted by it yeah because I think if everybody just look we've all around that one person or many people like especially like old-time celebrities celebrities that are famous like the 70s in the 80s and shit when there was no internet and then they'd this never felt this need to check themselves sure you know they were never informed and I think that one of the best things about having a group of friends like you guys and like all of our comedian friends and I think all of our jujitsu friends too and I think that's one of the things that kind of ties it all together you get a different a different group of humans yeah who've experienced a lot of weird shit who a different group and you have a different point of view than me on a lot of shit whether it's MMA whether it's um I mean there's always we always you and I have had spirited discussions about shit that we agreed or disagreed on the entire time we've been friends but you can do that yeah and still be cool to each other yeah I think that's what's really important I think also the great thing about friendships after you get to be my age anyway and you spend a lot of time with people is it this is getting very I want some violin music but this is seriously coming up you're coming up now here's what I want to say amen we learned how to be friends yeah not it gets it they get to a point with friendship you know where and I'll think about this with you like you could do pretty much anything you're never not gonna be my friend no matter what the only thing that would maybe question is if you heard a child god forbid or if you were torturing animals in your basement then I'd be like oh you're fuckin back but you know I would run but I still help you bury somebody right exactly that's exactly right well there's a seat I'll take ya to arrest is only I mean there's a fucking small handful of people that I would call if I murdered somebody they're in this room yeah yeah I would it be a burner call me first yeah don't cock it you call the Royal doors cuz I do it listen we're all fuckin he'd get scared and go I over tell me they don't call me I got a tummy ache my mouthwash Joey six months alive it's an electrical fire my dog's afraid and a yellow living to do regression first guy you call your dog right here last time do when these podcasts got 10 million downloads well yeah that a lot Dalhousie yeah it's it's probably the the biggest thing other than the Alex Jones episode which I'm still number one I was number one and Alex Jones one of the Alex Jones episodes one of the best pieces of evidence that there's some potential opening for some sort of a conspiracy to keep some people down because the Alex Jones episode not only did it get more downloads in any podcast we've ever done ever but it got more by like what four million deep state couldn't buy five million the deep state cooking classical silence him it's up to fifteen million but no here's what they did do and I don't think that they did look it could be of catastrophic coincidence alright but during the time when the Alex Jones episode went running through the charts of our art like downloads yes what we get like if I have a number like this is my number one this is my number tuna the Alex Jones is five million downloads ahead of everything now here's the crazy thing iTunes ratings went down and I don't think they went down on Fox I don't think they went down on perfectly cool look essentially and he just copped a zero they coincidentally I said this is what's undeniable they coincidentally went down the very time that the Alex Jones podcast was rampaging fucking deep state now in my podcast oftentimes reached number one on the iTunes charts in terms of like the podcast episodes certain times it's a real if it's Lawrence Krauss or Sam Harris or you know maybe even this obviously so when that does happen I gotta say wolf look podcast got five million downloads more than any podcast I've ever done ever yeah for sure that one's gonna be number I tuned said yeah okay not only was it not number one oh but hold on wait come on here we got here no maybe iTunes is be incorrect gangster line hold on hold on oh shut the fuck up what Jamie currently number three and four overall okay we are our pot at the episodes Alex Jones podcast never got past like number twenty or so I raise really yeah not only that but the ones after it and once before they got way less downloads we're all right there all right time do you think it's because cuz I listen to that and you guys got so fucking crazy toward the end Mitchell Shyamalan oh you guys got you all God hillary clinton pletely nut i had i have turned you guys off i listened to two hours and I was like well now we're in love until our three oh it was not not crying this song is like oh no my god I need people turn they went are they're too
