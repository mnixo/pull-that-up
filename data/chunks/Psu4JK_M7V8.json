according bam what's happening right now bitches it says off air though look this is off man oh well you have to refresh that screen alright here we go we're live bitches it's me and Batman Batman with me so don't fuck around this is some new show everybody what this is this is some new badass jacket that you can get that allows you to also be a robber you could be a bank robber and you don't even have to wear a ski mask and look suspicious you just this is like a mask that comes with this fucking this thing show everybody okay show everybody how does that turns into the hood it's a hood but it's a mask so in these hard economic times snores hmm all right what's up bitches how's everybody doing we got two things going on here we got this this Twitter thing well you can if you Twitter your questions will answer your questions for that or if you go to my website which is forums Joe Rogan dotnet people asking about your dumb ass fucking questions all right what's happening fuckers what's going on give me some questions some good ones how many bong hits tonight we haven't taken any bong hits we've only used a little little pipe that somebody gave me no bong hits bitches bongs for Jesus somebody does it for him doing it they're doing a really good job getting all the information witness his eye Christmas dinner was like yeah Charlie Sheen to talk about he had terrorism to talk about somehow they connected with each other yeah he'll probably have something well Charlie didn't do anything it's the government doesn't want Charlie out there talking about 9/11 that's too high too high to be doing this show this is ridiculous it's the weed that they have in California it's just too goddamn strong ladies and gentlemen it's medical you could just buy from a fucking store shit as outrageous and that's train right that's night that's like one of the best ones you can get I don't like how you guys are looking down at me thanks for uncomfortable I wish we're looking eye to eye on the same level I'm gonna have to set this up so that we're looking I feels weird looking up at Brooklyn you need a smaller monitor I can trade you questions let's go to the Rogen board we're gonna go to two forums Joe Rogan dotnet to the official 1229 YouTube Ustream podcast thread where the questions are not limited to a gay hundred and forty characters that's ridiculous do you think there will be one world government in our life or do you think it will act and and how do you think it will actually affect those I think that's possible it's very possible if they can get the money sorted out between all these fucking scumbags that run these world governments yeah they would all agree to one gigantic system of government the problem with one gigantic system of government is though even though it'd be harder for corruption it would be it's also harder to keep people in line because you have to have enemies you have to have like you know the the turks hate the fucking iranians hate the this hate of that if you don't have that conflict it's very difficult to keep people in line you know and if we were all the United States of America then we start arguing about money we start arguing about taxes we started you know if we're all one thing it makes it very difficult to do but as far as like giant international banks they might already be in cahoots or close enough to one world government I mean there might be like a few that are really pulling the strings and running things but I mean you know because the future of the government was just the Internet so every time you wanted to vote it was just like going on a message board and voting okay so we have legal insurance vote now yeah that would be crazy yeah they'll be like for the people then people would hack it yeah it's it's all good on paper but you know anything that you do on the internet now I could do to play poker you never know if you playing poker against a real dude you know I could easily be playing poker that's a computer right I mean I don't know what kind of programs they run but it seems to me like at this point in time people can hack just about anything they can I mean there's there's programs like that's the problem with these drones they have you heard about this right those drones khakis are hacking into the drones the airplanes the drones I check the borders and stuff yeah well they don't just check borders they launch missiles right they have these fucking things these drones that shoot these things called Hellfire missiles and they use them in Pakistan and all these places we're not really supposed to be and they just fly in and Jack people well the insurgents have figured out how to hack the code and and actually view the monitor it's it's crazy shit man speaking of crazy shit I really do have to take a shit we planned this out best so I'm gonna take a shit in Brian's gonna answer questions it's wedding it's a and that's a $29 program that that yeah that they use just to hack our videos there's a toilet in his office what is your opinion let's go get back to Twitter Joe doesn't make the extract Listerine packages it's actually one of the products that sold here in California when you have a medical marijuana license you can go to a store and they saw the Listerine at the store like look it looks like Listerine strips so now he doesn't make him himself Joe has not seen Avatar yet were the last two people to see avatar and we're supposed to see it this week it's pretty annoying not being it the last one to see it underwear bomber was staged any thoughts that did from the airplane under coverage the government man the government now yeah Joe just thinks he's a retard you guys probably didn't hear that but he thinks that's pretty ridiculous how one guy did all that and that's how bad our security is and now shits all fucked up from that one dig show is not we're not reading the chat on Ustream Joe is only doing the Twitter so if you won't have a message Joe answered if you put on Twitter or Joe Rogan's website which is forums joe rogan net he's taking a shit right now so he'll be right back it's the coffee sorry it's the Starbucks coffee let's go back to the time ago read some messages on Cho's website forums dot Joe Rogan dotnet Joe would be right back almost 300 yeah I have the dark Vador Marc Ecko sweatshirt awesome but yeah that Boba Fett ones pretty sweet I have realized though it's pretty gay when you're by yourself and not with friends but these sweatshirts there's the Boba Fett one yeah you know I think Marc layman had one of those the award to the UFC Marc layman is a he's a comic book nerd and jujitsu and he's he's a big video game junkie he had a pretty dope uh questions questions from the Twitter world is my Twitter tweet - dude I couldn't get to refresh it and I think it's that API thing against you might want to close that and use the Ustream one only okay all right Twitter on Ustream let's go with the questions here bitches what am i back in Ireland not only back in Ireland until the UFC's back in Ireland it's not financially feasible for me to make those trips without the UFC to the UK but every time I'm there if there's a show if we're gonna if we're doing the UFC in Ireland for sure I'll be doing stand-up comedy there they could hear the fluence didn't hear me did you give me take it down it was so strong I couldn't resist it I knew how to go I didn't want to I want to do I wanted to be able to just man up and push through the whole Ustream but I was like I'm gonna do a bad job because I'm just be thinking about this dump I have to take and so what were we talking about before I took off because it was kind of important stuff I think the one Murrow thing is the last thing you talk oh that was the first question one world government our lifetime I don't know man I used to hide a lot more faith before Obama got elected I'll tell you that I thought that maybe what we had was a corrupt situation and you know that Bush and Cheney were corrupt in that if we got somebody else in there maybe they could straighten everything out but after Obama got elected man it became pretty clear to me that someone else besides the president obviously is pulling the strings Obama didn't want to send more troops Obama didn't want to go to Afghanistan to bring more people to Afghanistan he wanted to pull out a Guantanamo Bay and close Guantanamo Bay down all that shit but it's not I don't think he gets to say what the fuck they do or he was just saying that kind of shit to get elected you know I mean the the old Bill Hicks joke comes to mind you know that American politics is you know I like the puppet on the right well I find the puppet to the left to be more to like my liking hey wait a minute there's one guy holding both puppets I think it's right what are you doing oh it's not doing it him just I know you're just tracking the shit and I just you know closing the screen move and chill around fucking psycho he's a Tweaker but not like the meth kind like yesterday what's optimize my Internet's he's the kind you to hacks into his registry to make his internet like one kbh faster do you remember when computers first came out and I always had the friend that's today he could hack into the library and I get rid of all of it due fees and stuff like that I wonder if that was a real happy with this point I like that well definitely there were some systems that you could hack into if you were a wizard you know isn't that well Mitnick did a lot of shit with like phone calls right didn't he like get information from people yeah it wasn't even that he was like this great hacker it's just he was kind of like a con man by the way did you read that they just hacked the like a 21 year old code that describe that scrambles our phone calls on cell phones so now and the guys the hackers put it on the internet so anyone could have it so now I mean of course it's probably not gonna happen to us anytime soon but now there's actually people that have the code two they can listen to your phone's listen to your phone calls holy shit but it's just 21 year old code like 64-bit code I think that's where the world is headed to I think that's where I think that's the future the future is there's not gonna be any private information I think what we're seeing with like this Tiger Woods thing I think we're seeing the future of things to come I mean with him it's obviously that he's a celebrity and it's a but the way that everybody is swarming after this information me too man I can't fucking put down an Us Weekly if I see an Us Weekly at the market and some new Tiger wins information I grab that I can't fucking help it you know well I think eventually there's not gonna be any secrets I think eventually we're gonna get to a point where the way information is being distributed it's changing the way we feel about information I mean it's a weird what's with celebrities it's one thing you know we're looking at it like well these are famous people and you know it's like they give up that right once once you start you know put yourself in the public eye you give up that right to privacy well eventually that's gonna happen like it's happening with Facebook accounts to like girls are doing stupid shit in their Facebook accounts that gets all the internet they go well you know she gave up her right when she put it on Facebook it's like that new Google Goggles where you can just take a photo of anything and it figures out what it is and then searches it for you so you can now like go to us like if you see like a can of pop right take a picture of it it knows what it is Google's it but you can it's starting to get where you can they're going to do it where you can do flowers and plants and anything's are pretty soon everything's gonna be Google searched so there is no privacy so while I'm here I could you know what I mean like yeah yeah I mean eventually I'm sure that shit is gonna make its way into your house well it's already if Google Goggles came out on the Android know what I mean I mean you'd be able to search someone's house oh yeah take a photo and you'll be able to go oh this guy lives at 97 would Chris Road right people owe me five years ago you put a picture on your facebook a Christmas photo that has like your bookshelf in the background now present day that that's gonna start researching every single book that's on your shelf and it's gonna put in to base somewhere and a GPS location you know what it means to like when you're searching for something you're gonna be like Oh Jill has that book at home I think what's happening I think what's happening with Twitter and what's happening with Facebook what's happening with it just the Internet in general is there's way more connectivity between all human beings and a part of that is access to information so that information is not gonna be like it is now it's not gonna be private I think no you I think eventually technology will come to the point where lying will be absolutely impossible and you will know everything that everybody else knows and everyone's gonna try to hold back on it for a while because people have a lot of dirty secrets they do a lot of creepy shit but I think ultimately it's probably gonna be good for everybody I do think that that's where we're headed I think we're headed to a point where everybody has access to all the information that everybody else has and not just like like you go on the internet you search for it not like in the rudimentary way we have to actively look for it I think it's gonna be right there I think there's gonna eventually come there's gonna they're gonna eventually get to a point where there's some sort of technology that's created that allows human minds to interface with other human minds I think that that's definitely where this is all going I mean when there's talk of neural implants and all these different things people think that's all crazy but that's that's a small step from where we are in comparison to where we were just a couple hundred years ago I mean a couple hundred years ago the fastest mode of transportation was riding a fucking animal think about that you're the right 300 years ago the fastest shit on land is to ride an animal or have an animal pull you behind something with wheels or slave if it sleeps can't run as fast as out those guys can no way but I mean think about what a monumental leap between the the transference of information today in 2009 and in 1709 I mean think about what we can do right now we could send a fucking picture across you know space is send it through the air and it literally arrives I mean if I have a friend in the UK and I want to send him a picture in a text message I can take the picture send it and it gets to him whoop just like that I mean that's fucking and credible I mean it literally will get there in seconds we don't even we can't even fathom how nuts that is because we do it all the time what's coming next is gonna make that seem like riding a horse that's what's happening that's what I think it's happening that's what I think there's this whole this this rush for information that everybody has this insane desire that human beings have for the newest greatest latest technology you know even when you don't need it like people are always trying to pump up their computers the only reason why you need pumped up computer really is to play video games or if you're you're crunching video like like he needs stuff like that when he when he makes videos just for raw computing power but the average person does is not crunching videos they've hit a wall they've hit a wall and computers in general like they're you really don't need even like the fastest computers now the programs the video programs aren't even yeah that's why everybody's into those little netbooks you know those netbooks or the shit except for you watching like HD videos right yeah and that's kind of sucks and you can't you can't load a CD into it either a DVD yeah but that technology is like talking about the floppy drive right before the floppy drive left you know like CDs and DVDs are out the door even blu-rays have like such a small shelf life and we think it's ever gonna get to a point where bandwidth will be so broad and like mobile functions like laptops and phones like those little mobile cards it'll be so powerful that'll be just like your home oh it's totally it's gonna be all that pretty sir so it'll basically be like everything will be broadband do we even know what the fuck that is doing to human beings you know like to talk about cell phones like causing radiation and one week they say it's bad one week they say it's okay well I think do you think that it's possible that that's like altering human beings giving kids autism probably Yeah right it might be that it might be that it might also be fucking with bees there's been speculation that it's been fucking with bees and there's also been speculation that some some crazy virus I've read that as well but there's also been speculation that Wi-Fi signals and cell phone signals that it fucks with bees ability to to transmit we did a thing for fear factor once with bees man and it was a fucking trip because this guy was a beekeeper any you know had all these bees that he brought with him so the the stunt was these dudes they had to be strapped to this pole which trap him to the pole and then we cover him with bees never stand in for five minutes never again fucked up cuz every now and then you know the bees were argue or something they'd sting the dude and it was bad they got stung up well while this was all going on and while this guy's tending to these bees and caring for these bees a local swarm of bees came in so are bees and their bees were talking it out and we had a backup everybody had to get off the set we had to close down the set we're gonna close down the stunt and everybody had to move back and the beekeeper saying we've got you know a local local band of bees has moved in I forget what he calls them I didn't a hive or but that's like no I don't know whatever a local band of bees moved in to sort it out with these bees so our bees and their bees were just as fucking swarm in the sky and they were fighting they were just talking like so what's up what do you guys do not work for a doctor you know what the fear factor we got some dudes we're gonna cover them in bees and shit they were like working out what was going on and then they resolve their differences and the local bees went a separate way and then the his be stayed was it like a black cloud yes it was not it was a big fucking cloud of bees in the air and the bees were communicating where's your cell phone why weren't you filming back there's back in the day you can have an e7 no roll we had a press four times to get it asked do you remember how bad is the Motorola but um so we they wonder if that's fucking with bees if our cell phone signals and everything are fucking with beans it's that autism thing that it might be something totally like that it could be it also you know a lot of speculation about autism is the age of the parents and that women are having babies like into their 30s and 40s and that increases the risk a lot of people have talked about that that's very very possible make sense man you know when we're just older and smarter and we look at it now we say well God you know how stupid would it be to have a kid when you're 18 when you're 18 you're an idiot which is absolutely true but when you're an 18 year old idiot your genetics much stronger and you could you could have a kid in the kid probably wouldn't be as fucked up I mean the reality is even though we are lengthening our lifetimes with nutrition and you know science and we're figuring out a way to make people live longer really people aren't supposed to live much longer than like 50 you know I mean back in the day if you lived to be 50 holy shit you pulled off an amazing thing you know but not not anymore now people are living to be a hundred and ten and you got Sylvester Stallone 62 years old he's fuckin yoked shredded you know things are getting very strange now that's why guys they're smart they'll just knock up 18 year-old girls when they want to kick girls would definitely give you the better genetics the real question though is do you do you get anything other than you know like hair color eye color personality do you get learned experiences and is it better off to have a parent with a lot of experiences are those experiences transfer through DNA because they didn't used to think it was they used to think that ideas were only they were native to the person who had the idea but now they're starting to think that memes can actually be transferred through genetics and that useless traits even like racism racism can be transferred through genetics and it kind of makes sense because there's a lot of things that we have inside our genetics and our instincts that are basically ancient learned things like like for instances do name a Rupert Sheldrake Rupert Sheldrake is like this evolutionary biologist dude and he pointed out that children that live in New York City they don't have dreams about like muggers or car accidents they have nightmares about monsters about scary monsters and the reason they have nightmares about scary monsters is because back in our heads somewhere deep in our DNA we remember back when we were like monkeys when we were these these little Apes hanging around in trees and you're running away from big cats and that that shit is always in our head because that is like the number one thing that was that fed off of chimps and apes is big cats big cats are constantly killing monkeys chimps and apes and that's like when they find like old human beings like you know the you know evolutionary versions of human beings you know subhuman hominoids they find all their skeletons like a lot of them have like big fucking cat bites big you know markings so that's like that's like some memory that we have ingrained in our in our genetics you know in whoever the fuck we are it's very possible that if you're like 18 years old and you know you have you fuck a chick and she's 18 you're both retarded you know you're gonna have a dumbass kid you know I mean that might be it might not just be you know your hair color and your eye color and how tall you're gonna be it might be your actual experiences and your human potential like that second yeah maybe yeah yeah maybe if you're a loser like if you're a fucking drunk if you get hammered and you're fucked up and your life is in the toilet and you know you bang some chick who's you know on the rebound and you know old boyfriend used to beat her and you shoot a load in her maybe the kid would be just like really fucking dumb and prone to make terrible mistakes you know I mean maybe he'd get past it but maybe his inclination like maybe maybe we start off in a certain place in life not just based on the economic situation that our parents are in and you know and who the people we grow up with and what origin maybe it's maybe it's our position starts out based on what the parents were thinking and doing when they fucked and conceived you like maybe if that's the lowest point in their life you not even because the way they raised you they could take you away and raise you in an orphanage somewhere totally different but your potential is limited by the circumstances in which you were conceived do you think that's possible maybe I don't think we have any idea so I think anything's possible you know I but it's very obvious that there's a bunch of different types of humans there's like super powerful super successful super smart Inhumans and there's really fucking dumb people I think is the person of your brain being used you know I think people use more brain than other people and I think it's such a small percentage but even that you know yeah maybe yes that's the real way to become a superhero find out how to use a hundred percent of your brain but isn't that bullshit I've heard that that's bullshit that we don't use yeah well I mean when they hook it up it shows that yeah but that that's not what that part is for you know I think that all you know human beings only use 10% of their brain I think that's a myth yeah well they don't know exactly what every part of the brains for it's like they're still like it's like you know it's like charting out the bottom of the sea there's a lot of shit they still haven't figured out yet all right let's see if any of you motherfuckers are smarter than us and have answers to all these things that we're talking about it is weird when you see like a human brain on TV and you're just like that's somebody that's not personal be a person it's crazy it doesn't make any sense it's nuts I just twitter is blowing the fuck up ladies and gentlemen it's about Twitter round I spoke Twitter wrong I'm a Twitter backslash Jared and uh-oh retard so fix that No who cares a lot of questions she watched A Scanner Darkly yeah you know what man a Scanner Darkly is something that I bought a long-ass time ago I got it on DVD and I just have never gotten around to watching it I tried to watch it I stopped anti Kris why why did you stop I don't remember it just wasn't that interesting to him you hear that shit Kris motherfucker said it wasn't interesting you're recommending it and his he's saying it's wack canneries man can't resist tough action is there ever been a guy that more universally panned as an actor but more incredibly successful there's no I mean he liked it he blows him off the fucking charts by every time oh here's something I needed to they actually found I had a playboy article this month that there was a road house video game in being made a few years ago but the company went bankrupt the Patrick Swayze yeah that's the greatest bad movie ever it's right up there with showgirls if you haven't seen Roadhouse I don't know if the fuck is wrong with you if you haven't seen showgirls drop this chat and either download it or go to the video store and do something you've got to watch showgirls showgirls is awesome just a quintessential movie where the people who are doing the movie were just gapped out of their fucking minds on cocaine and they made a terrible movie that makes no sense and it's so bad that it's good it's like perfect it's just one of those movies that's just perfectly crosses over into parody to the point where you could watch it over and over and over again right I've only seen it twice showgirls is awesome but showgirls and Roadhouse are both basically the same movie they're both movies where it's like they got people that were just full of themselves enough and just under estimating intelligence the viewers enough and just hack enough and just you know they just follow the dumbest formula lines possible and the difference between Roadhouse and showgirls though is that Roadhouse seems to be raw stupidity on its own whereas showgirls is the most obvious cocaine movie of all time because it's just so dumb like you had to be on coke to think that was a good movie like if you if you made that movie in you word on coke you would watch the dailies you'd be like what are we doing what is this movie but if you're on cooked like yeah it's fucking awesome what's your bit I'll tell you later which one has something to do with like would you even be able to see it yet because you know the human brain hasn't seen it yet oh no it was it's my theory about about how we believe that everything around us is everything that there is right and I talked about farts and when I say is that if someone farted and you didn't have a nose you'd have no idea something was go I don't know I'm talking about something you used to say a while ago something like kind of you were kind of saying like how cuz are would you even be able to see it because our brain has been seen it yet like the tiger or the tiger bit was if a tiger was running at you would you be able to even watch that because I think your brain just start producing I think it was a pyramid or something there see how it used to have a thing where you talked about like would they even be able to see it as their brains never seen it before and so I don't think so man that's not my act huh that's um I think you're thinking of there's a part in the movie the secret where those retards claimed that or was a what the bleep do we know I think yeah they were like looking like they said the Indians couldn't recognize the boat that's what it might see it was not my act right no my act is the the part about how if if we didn't ever knows and you had a friend you smell the fart and this is for the people that are watching us this is the ideas that we don't have any idea if there's more around us all the time that we can't sense and it's very possible that there is and what I say is the fart theory and the fart theory is if someone farted and you couldn't smell it you'd have no idea that there's something around you it's totally completely invisible but if someone farts you fucking smell it but if you didn't never knows you'd be just sitting in someone's stench how do we not know that there aren't an infinite amount of things that we just can't detect and that smell even though we can't attack it's like it's for Biological reasons you know they smell gas no it's dangerous for you you smell fire get away there's a reason why we have a sense of smell it's good for us but what if we didn't if we didn't it would be an infinite invisible thing and it's just our imagination that limits the possibilities of how many other invisible things there are around us all the time that we can't detect there's all sorts of animals like worms you take your hand you roll it over or you know above a worm they have no idea you're there they have no idea it's very possible that that exists in nature that there's also some shit like that with human beings it's very possible that we are constantly like the idea of dimensions dimensions might be dimensions of perception we just might not have the ability to perceive all these other things that are around us all the time I mean that could be like bad energy like you go into a house I mean people many people have told stories there they go into a house where people have been murdered and they could feel it I can feel fucked up energy in the house like that all might be real shit you know like we don't have a name for it and we're not good at detecting it you know we call it a sense or a feeling that might be real energy that you're detecting we're just not evolved enough to the point where we can really tune into it yet why is it that we like our own smell your own farts but not somebody else as far as my farts are delicious do you think it's just like I don't know do you think we would enjoy if we made her say like you know like if you forced yourself yeah no my first and enjoy like make yourself into it you'd have to be one of those sick dudes that wax off the fart porn you know because there's doings to do that just do that one oh yeah fart baby those dudes it like that that's real but I've never heard of anybody who likes their buddies fart gee that's weird though meanwhile I enjoy my own fart hey I love my father everybody does if you're in your car and you you feel a hot one and you're blasting me do this you stepping when I'm in the shower I cut my hand around the pass I called the Donald Duck because you're good you make it make that make the Donald Duck noise when you and when I fart and it doesn't smell I'm always disappointed yeah I'll go by far nothing on it's worse yeah but like there's somebody else farts like on a plane you're like oh you motherfucker I can't believe he did that we yeah and it smells the same it's not like your farts smell different than right well with our farts I think we get a little reward like oh you're getting all this bad stuff out of your body but with other people's farts it's like oh you stinky fuck you know it's not the same reward now is there any other smells that do that I don't like to smell my shit I don't like that I'll tell you that I don't like that when I take a nasty dump one Oh get me out of that room right I don't when I go back in like I would blow my nose or something like that I'd go to get some Totally Rad oh what the fuck that was my shit yeah I don't like it but I dude that's funny man you do like if you ever a shit outside you're about to take like a shitty ones that's the worst because there's no water I think just just ste me stinky fucking dump on the dirt yeah it's a girl's most horrible nobody ever like this like they're sniffing their their pile of shit and getting all happy about it it makes no sense yeah it doesn't make any sense it's like what is what is the evolutionary reason for that you know one of the reason it's part of like the cure of AIDS somewhere in that hmm something happens like researchers are I'm not gonna have research on farts what do you think okay what do you think about all these dudes and there's a bunch of scientists online like what what is that there's just one guy that's at the head of the cause Peter Duesberg and they're all saying that HIV does not cause AIDS and that HIV is a very weak virus and that the only reason why HIV exists in the systems of these people that are have AIDS is because their immune system is so compromised that it can't even kill off HIV well I think it's really weird that most of the people that seems like that had AIDS are drug users and gays so they're gonna have it has something to do with the immune system but then you can get fucking what's-his-name the basketball player they had fake AIDS that's the other thing is that people test negative after a while like in the rich he goes into then it goes into into a dormant stage yeah I mean Magic Johnson had AIDS and I was doing like mattress kumar's right you know right it's like crazy why they do a mattress commercials you didn't get a lot of money on AIDS medicine yeah I think I don't know man I guess I mean they probably pay him millions of dollars do any commercial he's still got a good name how much mattress is though what like how many more of these basketball players all these dudes who you know are out there just fucking banging chicks left and right they must be freaking out about this Tiger Woods shit this Tiger what shit will throw a monkey wrench into your endorsement deals and like if you're like a Michael Jordan type of dude like that's like where those guys make them the motive bulk of their cash is in endorsements yeah that's why this is so dangerous to Tiger Woods it's not the Tiger Woods can't go out there and still kick ass and golf and say fuck you I do whatever I want he can but he can't because the endorsements is where he gets all his cash well look at Letterman same thing it's like it's blowing up this year 2009 yes no it doesn't suck it's what I was talking about before I think what we're sense it what we're seeing in celebrities is mirrored is going to be mirrored as human beings we're seeing more access to information we're seeing less secrets I think it's a trend I think it's it's a it's a trend because I think that's eventually what the human race is going to come to it's gonna come to a point in time where there is not gonna be any secrets and that's a good thing there's gonna be full information disclosed from you to me and everything and what it is is the convergence of all human beings that's what's gonna that's what's going to to start to ignite the convergence amongst all human beings it's gonna be full access to information I know everything in your head you know everything in my head it's pretty weird man it's pretty fucking crazy and that's where it's going it's going through technology and this is what the Internet's about is with Twitter's about this with his you stream chat is about this is what all the shit is about it's about a convergence of human beings like human beings are eventually merging into one thing I mean that's the the whole ancient line in Eastern mysticism and each Eastern religion is you know that we are all one we are you know we are one consciousness like the Bill Hicks joke experiencing itself subjectively you know that's the the Timothy Leary ideology the the ideology of all the all the psychedelic heads all the people that you know you really got into like heavy-duty psychedelic drugs is that it's just one thing and that we can't recognize that we're one thing because we have ego we have survival we have all these things but that our technology and the technology forcing that's to evolve that the access to information that technology provides eventually will cause human beings all human beings to converge and literally be like one consciousness if I know all your thoughts I know all your information and we have an access to it an interface that's much less crude than what we have now with typing and with researching or watching documentaries whatever it's like an instant access a human neuro transplant something that allows all of us to link up our minds together that's not that outside of the realm of possibility that to me seems just as likely as the ability to send a picture through the internet on your phone that's just that's just as fucking crazy that you can send video through the air and you could watch a YouTube video on your iPhone yo what the fuck I mean it's just coming through the air and you put the headphones on and it's in stereo and what that's going through the fuckin sky is just as likely that human beings are eventually going to come to some sort of a some sort of a technological invention something that we're going to come to something that allows all human beings to interface together it might be through this thing it might be something you put on and everybody else that has it on all links in together or it might have actually become someone something you put in your body or it might be something they broadcast through the fucking air that links people together I can't I just can't wait to it gets cheaper to be able to like upgrade your body parts like I want to have better eyeballs I want night vision I want to have fucking Twitter I want I knew I bought that woman that they made her a new bladder yeah they took her own bladder they scraped the cells together and it's the group yeah they did grew it is I don't have the stem cells yes but then I know they they grew a new bladder for her in a fucking petri dish and then install it in their body that's crazy you know a bladders just a kind of a bag for piss but that's that's gonna happen with other shit too man I transplants are crazy too though that's amazing like imagine Jessica my friends uncle died and they donated their eyes and how help somebody see that canal seat and they got a letter just to let you know your your uncle's eyes were donated is so-and-so person who can now see may get cinema Leonard imagine somebody you know is dead now but their eyeballs are still being used that's incredible that's like a nightmare that's like a horror movie right like well I heard about so I listen to the art bell show about some lady who donated her or she she's got a liver from somebody in the operation and right immediately after the operation she started having cravings for what others do my serious yeah that's fucked up yeah cravings she never had before then she found out two dudes I'd really like to eat this certain type of thing very strange now I wonder if you got a butt transplant if you like that person's farts if you like your own farts still if you got somebody else's butt people may ask the weirdest questions Dawkins 20 look at this Bill Hicks the comedian how are they the same guy what kind of question is that what what does that mean that doesn't mean anything that's not how are they the same guy he's one guy how are they the same guy what Alex Jones is Bill Hicks oh this is people believe Alex Jones abilities I met bill X I'm friends with Alex Jones they're not same guy isn't that retarded these people cannot be sued it's just it has to be a joke it's a internet meme right is everything if they're big so if you guys are being serious about that you guys are fucking retarded yeah that's pretty silly all right let's go some questions here Magic Johnson's bought the cure for AIDS yeah Magic Johnson great South Park episode - I love that a cure for you there's no better South Park episode than the one where the the gay dude had a whore off with Harry Sarah's over a possessed I remember watching that how do they get away with this you don't pass on circumstances but you can pass on the psychic ability to create them alright alright Christine M Vail is how do you know that do you really know that are you just you saying maybe maybe that's what's happening but you don't know this psychic ability to create them have you ever met anybody that says that they're a channeler or says that they're sorry that isn't a fucking retard have you ever met anyone I don't believe any of them every time they do it they're like fucking scam artists to me yeah I've never met one person that says they're a psychic or says they can channel that isn't retarded they're all retarded but then it's like almost like do you have to be retarded to be able to do that maybe you have to be like like some sort of a person that can but like you're you're so socially inept you're so clueless to how other people perceive you that you can achieve certain frequencies that other people cannot is that possible anything's possible can I get Alex Jones on Opie and Anthony I don't think so man I don't think that's a good idea I saw a little Jimmy little Jimmy did to Jessica oh yeah yeah I don't think we'd like that man Alex Jones is not the kind of guy you're supposed to like argue with like that he's supposed to enjoys company and I asked him questions and we start talking about the New World Order black helicopters ladies and gentleman I see them outside my window every night you tell me I'm crazy but I see black helicopters outside my window so what is going on you know you don't argue that dude you go damn man motherfucking black helicopters that's he's supposed to do that's supposed to look and I think if if I was in the room with Jesse Ventura I'm certain I would have handled it different than Jimmy did but Jimmy is one of those dudes were Jim Norton fantastic comedian funniest guy on radio without a doubt by far he's one of those dudes that when he you know when he's in the face of someone who's like a bully he doesn't like that shit he doesn't stand up to that shit well and he feels like that Jesse like has this slow burn in his eyes and I'm on Navy SEAL and all that shit and that you're supposed to listen to him because of that and Jim Norton just ain't buying that and that's why Jimmy just shut him down and clowned him that's just what he does he's just he's not good at people being bullies I respect that people that meditate have large frontal lobe Cortex's study show says peach shreds I wonder that's very possible right it's very possible that it changes the way your brain works I mean if you lift weights you know it changes the way your muscles look if you if you exercise your mind in certain ways if it doesn't don't you think it Brian is gonna smoke marijuana live right here on Ustream thank God it's all legal supposedly that's the only thing Obama's done that he said he would do it's not going after weed ridiculous all right what else what else party people let's go to the Rogen board and read some of the questions that you find people have what is my opinion on free will blog talks about how we're all living through different circumstances which is very true but it seems to denote the power of free will which kind of sucks you know I go I start thinking about free will I think about free will in a couple of different ways I think it's very possible that you know you are shaping your own destiny and then you know you can you know choose your path and you can you know go through this life and you know and make something to yourself and you know the fact that you did it by yourself and you have to root freewill it's all good I think that's very possible but I think it's all pass it's also possible that life itself is a gigantic mathematical algorithm that all life itself is like a gigantic mathematical equation and that it just doesn't seem like an equation because we're a part of it but like that everything your personality your biology your circumstances your experiences they're all set up in line to put you in a very specific position to move forward in a very specific way to interface with all the other very specific things that are around you all the other very specific people very specific events and that the idea is that what the idea of free will is sort of a misnomer like you have instincts and you have experiences that guide you into a certain way like say if you you know you drank poison you almost died and it was terrible and you didn't know it's poison well you'll be much more careful next time and you won't drink poison the idea that that circumstance that you've experienced has led you to in a very specific way and that your experiences literally are set up as a part of a mathematical equation and that it's all to lead this entire human race which is really just one organism one gigantic super organism to lead this entire human race into a very specific place for a very specific purpose that's possible you know I don't like to think it you know when your ego has any control whatsoever over your mind your ego wants you to think that no you know I am in control my whole my life I have done what I have done and I'm proud of all that I have done because it's my own accomplishments but really it might be you're following a program it really might be we're all a part of this gigantic program that's you know and that all this you know ego justification ego gratification sex and love and fun and happiness and all these things are really just like numbers and and equations and like the powerful number that you get from love forces you to you know to be in love and have children and to create more people and to be good to those people and those people create more good people and that these these rewards are all in fact set up as a part of an equation to move the human race into one specific place that everyone is working together all over the world and we just don't realize we're bees yeah we're bees I mean like when I mean we don't know how bees communicate we don't know what what sort of a culture bees have but we know that they don't have books they can't study their past they can't study their history I mean how conscious how where are they and are they just going through the motions because that's how they're programmed and if that's the case if that's the case with wolves and bears and every other animal that sort of goes through these natural motions to achieve a specific result maybe that's what we're doing maybe we're just doing it and it's way more complicated because what we're doing is we're actually changing our environment we're changing the world we're creating computers and creating technology and we're we're the only animal on the planet that's involved in this symbiotic relationship with another life-form and that other life form is technology I mean if you don't classify life as something that has a heartbeat and something that bleeds but if you classify life as something that evolves and changes and grows and something that is like inexorably linked to human beings technology is just like a virus technology is just like something some sort of a bacteria that's in your system that you can't get out of you know like you have to you have a lot of healthy bacteria in your body all the time and that that's like you have a symbiotic relationship with this healthy bacteria and it keeps you alive and it actually fights off other bacteria I mean that's what probiotics are that's what acidophilus is you're taking in a live culture that will be your your warriors and they will fight off bad bacteria well it's very possible that that's what technology is the technology is a life force that we are interfaced with and we are we have a symbiotic relationship with this other thing and we need it to keep us alive we needed to keep the power on you know to keep to keep us warm in cold climates to you know to make sure your car gets you to work you know to make sure that the airbag goes off to save your life and all this shit is designed to help us but in turn we keep it going we look at old cars on the side of the road that are broken down and dead and those things are just like dead bodies you know cars that are old that stay alive that's just like wow that's fucking cool that's just like seeing an old man at the gym with big muscles like holy shit you know I mean literally like technology and things that we create we are helping those things evolve we are helping those things evolved with our materialism with our obsession with technology we are trying to always constantly get the newer better cooler shit and in doing that and then supply that we are forcing people to work in that industry and continue to evolve technology I mean it's very possible that it's all one fucking big thing so that's my opinion on that what I get for Christmas your mother's pussy Oh what's my opinion oh this is too trippy some people just get way too DMT on me let's dream is the extreme hippies this is dudes question this is in theo shaman what is your opinion of the non ordinary reality access by DMT and other and theo substances and theo jinns are i think the literal translation is something that connects you to god but it's psychedelic drugs do you feel there as much to learn from this version of reality how can it be applied to ordinary reality that's the real problem with any psychedelic drugs whether you doing salvia or doing DMT or smoking weed it's like well are you bringing any of that back is it enhancing your life do you think anything enhances I don't know that question to me seems like he wrote it in in the garage with his car run what's my take on Charlie Sheen Charlie Sheen is a dude whose friends dogs jokes like me but he's not laughing he he is a 9/11 conspiracy buff he's an actor he knows that he's an actor after the tough action man I mean I know a couple actors that are pretty cool but not that many most of them are really annoying somebody said it best that the actors like comedians but with no pun marks they always want to toggle and good shit they're not giving you anything back at least like with Joey Diaz is talking like you're gonna be laughing and you're gonna enjoy it you want them to talk but actors just talk you know actors always have the answers to like you're talking to actors very rarely does an actor want to admit they don't know why something is this or something is that why you know they always have opinions like really poorly thought-out opinions whether it's on politics or war anything have you recently on - followed somebody on Twitter because they just 20 too much I just supposed to unfollowed them yeah no I hardly ever unfollow someone you know all the time I I block people if they just looking to have arguments with me in sort of boring but I'm I follow the dumbest motherfuckers I follow so many dumb people I didn't want to tell you what they're doing I don't wanna tell you who they are because some of them somehow who were just fantastic fantastic with their terrible tweets I just unfollowed Kevin Smith the other day because you spent I literally spent two hours replying to every single person that has rode him like the last two months and did you get it because it blocks up here it was all him and had no one else I'm like oh next page are you serious yeah don't you like him though I do like him but that's bullshit the dude needs to learn how to fucking use Twitter well how you're supposed to do it if you don't reply direct messages but to all those people if you're gonna if you're gonna release all our time we don't care what this answer this question is if you do yeah but then I got messages the problem of the direct messages is that you can't everybody else can't see it and one of the cool things about Kevin Smith is it like why I think this following Kevin Smith and you get to see everybody saw Kevin Smith responded to you well dude this video type shit then and reply at all you know like a go okay here's our next person from Twitter because it just ruins everything else I met Kevin Smith and he's cool as fuck he could put pages of shit on my Twitter and I will keep it going dude I love the new role I love the day too but that's just uncalled for what do I think of Ben Stein calling Ron Paul anti-semitic I don't think about it at all it's hilarious there's two old Queens I would love to see Ben Stein and Ron Paul sucking each other's cognac I would pay a thousand dollars you see pruning it no I have that on video too dude watch it and it's it's it's that whole part with Ron Paul and ever since I've seen it I always look at him and he looks like an old queen of me now ever since then yeah just how he handled that he hit it like I don't know well he's super religious so possibly is gang right if you're really intelligent and yet super religious I always gotta go alright what's going on what are you doing blowing guys we done it's weird yeah there's something wrong either money or gay you're really intelligent and you're you're really buying into it and this is not saying you know that there's no God it's not saying that there's no there's not something else I'm the first one to say that I don't know I have no idea but I'm also the first one to say that you don't know either and anybody that pays any attention to religion or follows religion at all and it looks at the history of religion knows that it's a it's a disjointed mess and nobody even knows the origins of all this stuff and nobody knows how much people altered the words and what we do know about it is that even the Bible itself the oldest version of the Bible didn't even use the Dead Sea Scrolls that's the oldest version of the Bible by far they don't even they don't even use that when you think that's like the best one wouldn't if that's like the the purest version of it now we're still busy using the New Testament the New Testament was created by Constantine and a bunch of bishops they piled it together in the Old Testament well the Old Testament the real real version of it was written in ancient Hebrew and to this day in 2009 they only know three out of four words in ancient Hebrew that's 1225 fucking percent of the words they don't know what the fuck it means and on top of that letters also double those numbers back then because there was no numbers so the letter A was also like the number one like if you did it that way so there was like numerical value to words that was completely lost when they translated translated ancient Hebrew to Latin and then to Greek so like like the word love and the word God they have the same numerical value so we don't even really know what the fuck they were saying so no I'm not saying that there's no God that there's not something else what I'm saying is to follow current religion as it's you know practiced and preached today it's ridiculous it's ridiculous so if Ron Paul's really into that come on man they go Queen what is he doing let's see Ron Paul Big O Queen look if he just came out and said he's a big old Queen I would still vote for him and I think he's a bad motherfucker I would like to see if somebody really tried to get in there and shake up the system and change the way you know the world is run and you know keep us out of other countries and to demolish the IRS and get rid of the CIA and imaginating fessing to see if someone could actually do that and not get killed I don't think that could give a kindle yeah I got a Kindle well just wondering I just got one of those sonja-rita for Christmas when it's cool because Googlebot like all these books so I don't know if you can do this with the Kindle or not but so anyway you can just go to google and download all these three books on it really and they have your issue of kung-fu magazine or whatever karate magazine black belt oh yeah they have that some guarantees and so that's the Sony Reader you can go and get that so you get any book basically for free and well not any book but any other ones on Google has like a ton of books but they're all like old school out of print books I think as yeah man I got the Kindle and I couldn't get any hotter Russ Thompson books I really like one book that he wrote that was for sale but they didn't have the great shark hunt they didn't have good google.com back slash books and see if they have it there and he was downloaded I don't know if it works on Kindle though probably well the Kindle read PDF files it does but when it reads PDF files let you enlarge the text which is annoying oh and our question earlier when we were talking about can poker can these BOTS you know on poker sites poker J who's John Carlos Alvarado who's on the road bore it says poker sites catch bots of the program that can see if you click the same pixel every time you make a move something that's impossible to do by a human this is why you have the program go over a couple pixels yeah how was the shit I just took it was excellent did I really forget everything I learnt during the Taekwondo days no I still remember some talk window stuff some stuff Taekwondo is effective let you see Conley uses a lot of Taekwondo he uses a lot of turn side kicks and front leg side kicks and front leg roundhouse kicks where he doesn't switch to the legs that's what there's a lot of power that stuff it's just it's not complete in Taekwondo needs other things it needs more time wrestling and jiu-jitsu and all that stuff but it helps there's some stuff in it that's it's different you know the style of like karate that Machida uses like the leaping in and leaping out nobody knew that that would work before no cuz no one was ever good at it that was good at other stuff as well and I think that's sort of the same thing with Connelly in Taekwondo these questions also suck get out the Twitter suck cock on my website guys are a bunch of gay ass motherfuckers stupid ask questions all the same questions are the same people circumcised here's a good question would you get your kids circumcised in this day and age because most guys in America Orkut no I am NOT gonna if I have a boy there's new baby we don't know what it is yet we'll find out soon and if it's a boy I'm gonna let him have a big elephant day your disgusting dude why that's you care what my baby's dick looks like I'm gonna have to fuck his I'm gonna have to watch a lot of video of it no I mean I was thinking of that just the other day it's so funny justperson assets did comes out a certain way I've seen your nose yeah and it covers it like a turtleneck yab you ever seen porn just felt bad for the poor guy oh fucking creep dick yeah had circumcision have you talked to girls about this I don't give a girl I like oh my god head and unsurfaced a guy's dick it was so disgusting but I've talked to girls that have sucked uncircumcised dicks and then you don't care well it's a little different yeah yeah any girl that would care as a cunt it's good or keep console way from my boy I'm picky cunt it doesn't like a uncircumcised dick and what what's your white why do you think it's just ridiculous it's totally unnecessary and it feels better supposed to do you need I don't need help coming faster it's not coming faster it actually feels better it's more sensitive it's not whether you come for us you actually it's more enjoyment why so weird I'm so glad you might I'm just like I think every day I'm like thank you Dad for oh no there's websites out there were dudes try to regrow their skin it's a long process to recirc implies their dick they stretch it out they have like little things like an attachment it's clip on to the tip you take it it gets before they get more infections in a shit like dirt inside there and it's like if you haven't clean your dick that's why I answer that clean your fucking dick look how hard is it to wash a dick I hate he's a dirty dick people should not have no circumcised ha's newark circumcisions but if you're a cleansing like you should be like my boy will be he will have an uncircumcised dick goddamn have you ever ate okay I think we already talked about that what you ever get out of girl that had really long pussy lips yeah how about that there's one way that I get stretched probably that far it just was like chewing gum when I was in your mouth see this is too old these questions are like old this is like our no he didn't funny his Twitter sure is his Twitter is the bomb diggity what is it the mark Hayden that I think he changed it to the dumb art gate in I'm certain I think it's not real I know whoever's doing it yeah why would they do that man we got a thing going on motherfuckers do you think a lot of time microchip system like they do with dogs where it's can instant access yeah I think that's gonna happen yeah I think I think it's very possible there's gonna be some sort of a microchip thing where human beings are gonna be scanned into a database their real problem is there's how many fucking people there's so many goddamn people how do you do that how do you keep track of it who's gonna watch it like people just say oh man what if your phones are bugged who's bugging these phones and workers government workers how many people are they watching there is it one person for every person out there they just look circling on you because they know you sell pot like come on man how many fucking people are out there that that could actually be monitoring people's phones well now they have the technology where they can just sit there and record every single phone call and it transcribes it like dragons speak but times 50 technology and it pretty much looks for keywords like you're uh you know yeah that's that makes sense I've heard that before there's things like video programs like what's it called predator so I thought they had one yeah that was a would go through the internet and let's search for like al-qaeda search for terrorists search for certain specific keywords peak oil versus science you know what man I think they're gonna figure out some other shit besides oil I think it makes sense I think you know there's a lot of stuff they could do with agriculture there's a lot of stuff they can do with hydrogen there's lost it's just we we could have come up with something else it's just we got bamboozled into going the way the oil because it was easy and cheap and it was already in place and we stayed with oil but I don't think society's gonna crumble because we run out of oil I think we'll come out with something just as good she here those new Mini Coopers in in the cold if they electric ones in cold weather it only gets half the power how big is that yeah they're only good for like a hundred miles as it is right so I'm cold whether it goes for 50 miles that makes sense because your batteries more dead in the cold weather yeah piece of shit yeah but imagine buying that car that's an expensive car imagine you know what Top Gear did you know that show Top Gear at the BBC awesome show they took one of those Prius is an electric car and they drove it around a track with a priest as a hybrid right they drove it on a track with an m3 and all the m3 had to do was keep up with the Prius that's all it had to do the Prius code went full blast on the track and the m3 obviously a much much faster car all I do is keep up the Prius got 13 miles to the gallon and the m3 got 19 so when the Prius drives hard it's just as much of a piece of shit as you know any other car it's like it's it's nonsense it's like it's it's fake being green and apparently it's much more toxic to the environment to create a Prius well I thought I thought how it worked as Priuses only our electric under 25 miles an hour or something like that yeah for stop-and-go traffic it's it's running off battery over that just a normal car does that make sense yeah and over that as a normal car it's terrible yeah yeah he's just a small terrible goddamn piece of shit that was BB Jones with a circumcision question it's so weird I was just thinking that there's a good question man that's a good question that's that's a weird thing with people I didn't really worry about what your kids dick looks like did it start well I I just think every day how how thankful I am you're so silly somebody posted this on the board today about any Indian men and that there's like some what is it 160 percent of Indian men oh I don't know if this is a true statistic somebody I've been rocked posted it so tell you what a grain of salt 60% of Indian men cannot use a standard condom one in five condoms fall off during the intercourse so this is from the BBC is it true I don't know but we're gonna go to it damn the BBC you need to go to India day to fuck some women wow it really is Wow it's true sir if you have more than a thousand men in India has concluded that condoms made according to international sizes are too large for the majority of Indian men that's crazy that's sad as a magnum user I feel for you bitch Wow scientists even check their sample check to see if their sample was representative of India as a whole in terms of class religion and urban and rural dwellers so even like the peasants you know even the slaves in India have little dicks so sad at least the presence of a man like the lower-class America are generally thought to have the biggest dicks slaves back in the day when they had slaves those cats almost had monster horse dicks yeah how many white women do you think fuck floats back then Oh fuckin tons of do you think they did yeah yeah when their husbands stop fucking them right yep snuck in and just got some Alabama black snake how many white women do you think had babies with slaves back that think there was a lot of dead babies really yeah yeah there was a lot of white guys who had fucked their black slaves that was very common and have babies with their black slaves what a fuck that must have been how weird must that have been to the the guy who was the father would fuck the slave have a baby the slave the slave would have his baby and he would see this half white baby and he would just leave the half white baby with the slaves and let them take care of it like you wouldn't even bring it in as his kid just because of a race thing that must be that must have been fucking enough talk about like haunting your conscience hmm how weird is Witch Trials you know the old school wits trials or they would like way witches or it still goes on today you know in Africa in Africa they still have a huge problem with people accusing people of being video where they caught him on fire and they're sitting there on fire yeah beating with sticks and kickin this is a real reason there was a yeah I'll put it on Twitter I wrote a blog article about it that's one of the worst videos that in the Hong Kong girl snorting herself to death yeah there's that video that you can see this Hong Kong girl she snorts this gigantic line of ketamine ketamine is a fucking cat tranquilizer and a lot of crazy kids are doing this and she snorted this gigantic line for a video and then one of dying and the videos available online along with a store trying to find I'll put that article online that I am that I wrote about I think it was called humanity gone haywire I think that was the that was the name of the article but it was all about how nutty it is that there's this like real problem they have right now I don't know when that was from there's no search option my blog archives are gay mm-hmm that there's no search option it's weird I have is they're chopping this is terrible let's check for tell you dude look at that my fucking website is this is way better yeah Google is way better for searching than my own website fucking website my website can redesign right now people you've been saying it for eight years yeah it's been being with design for eight years damn it let me find out the Twitter this bitch all right I put it I just pushed put it up on Twitter if you bored you want to read the thing about witchcraft watch the video still there it's really creepy you know a funny thing about witchcraft in America or like everybody knows about the Salem witch trials well what I read the biggest connection they have to what what happened there and then why everybody thought they were being possessed and there's witchcraft going on was that there was a late frost and that the wheat got frozen and when it thought out apparently when that happens when there's a late frost and wheat freezes and thaws out it grows a certain fungus on it and this certain fungus is called ergot and a God has it's a really similar or identical rather chemically to LSD so when they would take this bread that they would make from this wheat that had grown this fungus on it these people would fucking trip their balls off they would have these crazy horrifying bad acid trips so they literally thought they were under a spell which totally makes sense and they just started burning bitches and women always want to say that it's you oh you know men were you know back then you know men were the the spell that a woman would cast upon her you know upon him with her beauty was just too perplexing and the men couldn't deal with the fact that women had all those powers that killed him yeah come on guys have been raping chicks forever it's how they're gonna stop back then there's this is not that much this is not that perplexing it's guys want to shoot a load they shoot a load you know guys wanna shoot a load they jerk off they don't want to shoot a load anymore you know it's they're not gonna start burying people because they want to fuck them I don't believe that I think it's a much more likely scenario that this fungus grew on this wheat because they had already taken soil samples and so they had known from there you know whatever climatological studies they use to figure out how cold it was during a specific time there was a late frost there was some evidence that there was a late frost and that this forgot was also found somehow or another during this time period so I think it's just speculation but it's much more educated speculation than the idea that the men were under the spell of these women and they decided to kill him that doesn't make any sense I think they probably did the acid from the wheat and then killed the cunts that's probably what it was you know that's why I was a witch trial those are probably the countries women in the town let's put these major bitches yeah like these chicks are bad energy like you'd be around like fucking bitches giving me bad vibes you know because you're all acid and now they probably just started lighting them on fire okay let's kill this bitch while we having her around yeah magic that's what the witch trials were about maybe like afterwards people were so nice they killed all the cunts off possible ladies and gentlemen that makes a little fuckers call me during my goddamn podcast tape Fletcher know my fucking Ustream bitch oh let's go back to questions ladies gentlemen have ever seen the Northern Lights in Iceland no I've never seen him in purpose so awesome I've seen some shit online now it looks incredible it's like the sky becomes like a desktop screen saver I've been seeing way more falling stars lately that gets almost getting to the point where it's so kind of ridiculous yeah it's maybe if you're coming once a week maybe I see it at least one could you imagine we know for me it does it doesn't seem like it's real like you sit and talk about like asteroid impact so the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago or the one that killed you know everything before that the mass extinction before that 250 million years ago or the one that ended the Ice Age ten thousand five hundred years ago there's always speculation about asteroids but the real reality is there are giant get 200 thousands of gigantic rocks in space that can fuck us up and every now and then one comes crashing down it's happened many many many many many times over the history of the life of the earth it's happened so many times and it could easily happen today it could easily happen tomorrow you can easily one that comes from behind the Sun and we can't see it until it's too late and then and just fucks the whole world up that's so possible we don't like to think it's possible because it's never happened but I always like to I always say it's like an anthill the human life is like an anthill like if you are an ant and you're living in an anthill you were probably born that anthill and that anthill is all you've ever known I mean how long do ants live like a week couple weeks something like that so say like this anthill has been around for six months that's been through the generations after generations long dead have made this anthill and then you know you're toiling away in your little anthill and one day some kid is walking through the field and he sees that ant hailer just Oh boom she starts to stomp on it for no fucking reason and then your ant hills crushed out of nowhere you never thought it was gonna happen it's always been fine everything's always been cool at the ant hill if you had a ticket gas and you how to make a gamble you would say yeah yeah this and I was always gonna be here it's always been here always will be here BAM some kid just stomps the fuck out of it that can happen to people that can happen to earth Katrina Katrina how about Detroit slow yeah well he somebody has a magnifying glass on that geez right I watched Anthony Bourdain's how-to show about Michigan the other night what I went through horrible terrible you've watched that Anthony Bourdain show yeah that's good show make sure hungry he goes oh is it your future yeah no reservations or anything shows makes me so hungry doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo nasa says there's an asteroid with a possibility of hitting earth in 2029 yeah there's there's a bunch of them out there that they don't know about they come to the problem is the sky's too goddamn big I mean it's covering everywhere shit's coming from the North Pole and the South Pole and you ever know where something's coming from I mean it could be coming from anywhere you never know there could be something heading our way just we haven't picked up on it could be behind something we don't see it gravity distorts our view of things as well like if you look at the Sun you can literally you know you look at some of the telescope you can see things behind the Sun because of the distortion and the gravity of the Sun because it's so massive I don't understand how that works but that apparently is how how it works and so there's occasionally things that could be hiding behind something that's coming straight at us so we don't even fucking see it until it's too late you know there's just not enough human beings out there monitoring the sky to really accurately predict you know well we have a hundred percent clear skies nothing's gonna hit us for the next 200 years they don't know that that's they can't say that there's always something that comes real close that just barely misses us and they go whoa holy shit that was three miles long and it missed us by two hundred thousand miles that's not much you know okay let's go some questions your daily bitches nibiru in 2012 says the anti Chris so some people think here's to the 2012 movie yes horrendously bad really bad not even worth even a special-effects sucked oh really they're there I mean it was awesome things were happening but it didn't look real like the cars if there's a limo ins jumping things and landing fine driving off and look we looked all computer-generated and silly you know it's like every five seconds the fucking you know the car was almost going off the cliff but barely made it you know it's like come on stop stop with your nonsense this guy here the easy dog double-oh-seven says yeah I believe in God how did everything originate but how did God start hmm well that's an easy question God the real promise believing in anything you know that's that's the real problem no problems believing in anything it's not believing in God or believe in G the real plan is believing in anything you don't know you don't know God created a really good video game and we're all in it that's possible this is like God's version of The Sims right and this is on somebody's phone but wait no we're not even like a good video yeah we're just like a fucking cell phone but you should play when they kill time right right we're Britain break earlier it's God the real problem with believing in God is that believing in God just makes people feel better you know it's not saying that God doesn't exist it's very possible that God exists but you you don't have the information no one does you can decide that you have that information because it empowers you you can decide if there's a God because it makes you feel more comfortable or it makes you feel more you know that there's a future to this world and after you die or something waiting for you and that gives you confidence and that gives you that it can't empower you and that works for a lot of people I know a lot of fighters who are very and that that belief and God that actually empowers them and it can it can work that way but it really is just a tool it's just a psychological tool that they're using to empower them and doesn't necessarily help them you know what helps them is the state of mind that they put themselves in by believing in God you know it's a really kind of a funny thing it's a catch-22 believing in God can empower you the ideas of Christianity are very empowering ideas the idea is that you know that you know love your man as if he is you and you know look do unto others as if you would have them do unto yourself and you know turn the other cheek and don't be violent and be helping be loving and and be humble and worship God the idea of God what God is God is life and energy and the whole universe and that you treat the whole process as it's one gigantic fantastic thing and that in in in going to a religious service and in practicing or you know any sort of a religion and like sticking to a certain ethic the way your doing is committing to positive energy and if you commit to that positive energy and then those positive thoughts and the positive way of thinking that's empowering and that really will help you and if you really do believe that you have a destiny and that God has carved out this destiny for you that's an empowering thing that should that shit will absolutely make you better things you say that's evidence of God that's evidence of Jesus well maybe but more likely it's evidence that you put yourself in the exact proper state of mind to achieve things by thinking positive and having positive energy and being a loving Christian by doing all those things you put the good energy out there and you've given yourself confidence because you're doing the right thing and you've given yourself a strong belief in yourself because you're following the right path and in doing that that's very empowering that's how God is real that's how religion is real but what it really all is at the heart of it is you tuning in to the correct frequency of the universe with the least amount of resistance the least amount a lot amount of resistance from you the least amount of negative thinking the least amount of being like when I was a kid I'd get an arguments all the time with everybody about anything and really I was just a knucklehead I was just a dumb fuck but I didn't realize that by doing that by creating all this drama in my life like I was it was just distracting the shit out of me and it was keeping me from doing things that I wanted to do it was keeping me from being happy and comfortable and friendly and keeping me for like I was constantly in a state of causing trouble and and causing drama and and creating all these obstacles in my own life and I didn't realize it at the time and I was thought of people that were religious like I was thought well there's gotta be a lot of power in that because like like I was afraid of a dude who was religious who was on one of the u.s. Taekwondo teams back when I was fighting there's this dude I think his name was Bobby Clayton and I think that's his name don't but he wasn't the best guy but he was crazy religious and that used to scare the shit out of him this dude used to read the Bible every day and this dude was like super super super religious and he really believed in himself and I was you know not very religious and even though I was doing really well in his tournaments and I was you know beating a lot of really good guys there was something about this dude and his religion that scared me like on paper he shouldn't been the scariest guy to me but he was for whatever reason because this dude was really religious so for you know that that belief that he had in himself that the the belief in his faith and his that all that shit was is empowering to him and I recognized that it was empowering to him that he was really legit about it and that he was his super religious behavior kid like he was never never swore he didn't drink he was friendly to everyone he was like really really really dedicated and that was that made me nervous I think religion is empowering Bryan has been a huge advocate of Scientology ever since he moved to Hollywood I mean tell us about your experiences your Scientology ah they're they're sluts they're usually yeah they're real easy to sleep with I really just have to trick them and just a lot of positive energy it's like that what you do yeah and you just take their money and they sleep with it it's great Tim do you hear that is the Scientology have a thing with fucking a lot of fun now folks yeah it's what it is no you don't definitely married or anything no I don't think so yeah when any new religion comes around you can't be nice like okay he's alive I think if I had to pick one religion like if you had to do it I'd be Buddhist yeah that seems like the one that makes the most sense but the problem with being a Buddhist is you got to hang around with a bunch of fucking phonies a bunch of people who are pretending to be Buddhists you know yeah they almost smelly feet yeah looks like it's like the idea of hippies it's all good on paper but the real problem with hippies is you know they don't want to work they're fucking lazy and stupid a lot of them and then you know it's like the stereotypes of like the pot-smoking lazy you know Nair do wells like that's that's like accurate in a lot of ways that's the real problem with hippies you know what's Buddhists women look like I don't think I've ever seen a Buddhist one do they're vegetarians all right yeah do they have like boat heads I gotta take a shit again so I can't believe this we ate sausage subs at this local place down the street they're a little bit too strong too powerful 524 viewers I appreciate this it'll be only a couple minutes but Brian will answer questions while I'm gone I would be gone for a couple minutes my bathroom is right down here I'll bread that all right what's the

not one of the same ones psychic there you go should I take DMT no you should not take DMT if you're asking Joe on a Twitter yeah if you're our alien our aliens among us yes they're Asian yeah I think

Twitter program is why doesn't even shrink through URLs whoever thought that that would be a business yeah it's gotten big we getting a tiny URL buzz man what are you talking about Omega people website names Rose ball yeah one of the fuck would ever thought there would be a market for that one of the websites I can't remember I don't think it's tiny URL but it's one of them like almost got bought the other day for like a couple million dollars and that's all it is is a URL short short no that's hilarious that's another one that was grown all right sorry for the long delay that was ridiculous wasn't even that interesting but it is kind of interesting I put the picture up you can go see the picture it's on my Twitter what's next after a weekly Rogan podcast in the book what's the next project there are no next projects this is about it this is about all we're gonna do a weekly podcast we're doing a show for Sony was gonna be called LOF mao but now we might have to call it something different yeah we've been trying to do it for like two years and now there's a fan called lmao or something like they're close well we'll come over the name for it but it's basically interviewing convenience about the creative process and we're also enter in there in the middle of coming up with another show it's comedy related so I can't talk about blood should be fun dad and just more shows more comedy more good stuff it's Fear Factor returning anytime no it's not no there was a rumor that no yeah there was a rumor for a while they were gonna try to bring Fear Factor back just Fear Factor when they cancelled it was like it was kind of like they could have kept it going there really honor I think that's a show that could come back easily and if you did it without me huh yeah I'm sure it'd probably be great if they did it was like Mario Lopez no you can't pass up on that easy money especially if you're working with all the same people again stop I might be willing to do it just for my kids just put money away what's your movie kind of October damn October should I move to Colorado I loved Colorado man sideshow Sid said shit I'm going to call I fucking loved it I I would still be there I didn't mind a cold I like the people I like the sky I like the way the fucking mountains looked I like the vibe I liked everything about it I liked it for me creatively I liked living in Colorado but when you have a family you have children you have a wife and it's not that it's not as easy as just me being by my it was out it was just me by myself I'd probably still be there I'd still be on the top of that mountain but she was not into it it was just too creepy when her dog got eaten our dog got eaten by a mountain lion that's not like a rumor that actually happened dog got eaten by mountain lion and she's bad driving in snow she crashed the car so it was a couple different things and then she got pregnant and the pregnancy was the biggest reason why we had to move out of Colorado was because we were living over 8,000 feet above sea level it's really hot that's like three we are 3,000 feet above Boulder and it's a really really high altitude and when you're pregnant it's just a brutal it's really it's not good for you it's unhealthy for you and for the baby Colorado is like one of the highest states in the country that like one of the top states the country when it comes to premature births and a lot of it is because the altitude just you don't get enough air up there it's just it's great for your conditioning but it's not so good for from being a pregnant woman so all those factors I had to move out of Colorado but if I could just be somewhere and live somewhere live in Colorado Oh in a heartbeat if I didn't have to travel stay in Colorado or you know deal with snow when it comes hey you're fucking snowed in no big deal that's that's what it's supposed to be like the problem with me is I travel all the time so I would leave my wife and leave the kids there it's not the same by myself I'd have no problem with I loved it so if you are gonna move somewhere and stay there I would say yeah Colorado's fucking bad-ass it's my favorite state do you think there will be a time when all handheld axes will have a pipe in them like the tomahawk is how the tomahawks were there were a pipe and an axe all in one is that true if that's true the Indians were bad motherfuckers I don't think that's I think that dude just went to our Renaissance Festival because I mean if you think about it was a pipe off well listen this is the beauty of the Internet right now we'll google this did tomahawks have pipes on I think there might have been a couple that did but I don't think the majority of it oh well I speculate let's find out okay it just doesn't seem right it seems like it would just make that the weapon weaker having a hole through the middle of it yeah that's true good point maybe it's enough yeah we had me a pipe tomahawks that's a pipe axes the crazy crow trading post show me a pipe Thanks these pipes pipe historically accurate pipe axes we have spent years researching and manufacturing the finest line of throwing tomahawks pipe tomahawks belt and camp axes available today did you even know there was a market for that kind of shit that's the beautiful thing about the internet let's see what this thing looks like I don't see the pipe part where's the pipe part hand drill for smoking Wow something been hand forged iron head drilled for smoking so basically the pipe is this you put some tobacco up in that bitch right there and you smoke right out of there or do you smoke out it you know I think you smoke out of there Wow well suppose I can make the handle weaker and a weapon weaker yeah it's plugged definitely right but this seems like it's like really hard wood look at this one's got a metal piece through it original 1802 1825 believed to belong to Red Cloud wow that's pretty dope Red Cloud didn't think it out dude I think we should start smoking pipe from a fucking tomahawk we got to order one of those come on man we'll do the podcast we'll smoke out of that that's that's ladies and gentlemen what say you on Twitter I need to order this right I'm gonna order this add to basket listen click that's right that's it all right I'm gonna check out now I'll check out later because I don't want a bummed out at me it was boring enough looking for that toiletry coming up on two hours we should make this two hours Saint why you getting bored huh you know anymore let's go back for in a 71 motherfuckers in here we lost a lot of people for being really boring yeah two hours of things just about right you want them wanting more not less is that what we want lazy girl is that I see right this is correct what is the time on top left I think after two hours also doesn't save maybe hear something I think Josh people start hating us yeah fucking faggots got nothing to talk about boring ass shit so so far we've answered questions they put photos up on Twitter we've talked about some heavy subjects one more TV that is and gentlemen we're all living in an alien's petri dish says Dawkins 20 maybe you know that's possible it's time illusion shred 431 wants to know if time's an illusion I don't think it's an illusion I just don't think time is just one thing you tell that the David Copperfield well I think time is you know I mean we already know that time changes when you go fast like if someone's in a super fast spaceship you know and they go at the speed of light like time goes by much quicker on earth and doesn't in their plane so if they come back and they're super fast spaceship you know for them it's only been a year but for us it can be like a hundred years depending on how far and fast they go so time moves in a way that I don't I don't think it's the way we look at it I don't think it's as cut-and-dry like you know this is midnight and this is one o'clock I think it's it's much more dependent upon the state for human beings and like the the frequency the person's and where the person is living you know that you're living on earth you know the this dimension you know that there's the time varies throughout other dimensions and you can access those dimensions I mean if they really do come up with ships that can fly through space that you know closest beat alive something they really will be able to go to a place where they're they're literally going forward in time they'll have lived one year they come back to earth and hundreds of years ago and that's just that's nutty shit and that's real I don't think we understand time enough I think tom is one of those things that we we think we got a grip on what it really is but it's probably far more complex and confusing and variable than we're saying I didn't you should get rid of daylight savings time because I think it's bullshit that he had fucking pitch black outside and sometimes 6:30 yes she's absolutely like farmers there are all fucking thieves what how dare you but seriously have you a joke then Mellencamp hater back then it made sense because everybody was a farmer you know everything had to do with farmers nowadays why didn't they just get up earlier yeah I don't ever think it makes sense I think you know if you have a regular job you know sometimes it's dark out sometimes light out the fucking earth Spence that's what I love about Arizona the Arizona they don't change their time fuck you yeah no it's stupid what they need to even do it better than that they need to like really fuck it up like I want it to be bright out to like 9:00 to 10:00 o'clock at night don't you think that'd be cool yeah but then it would be dark out until like noon yeah that's fine no that's most people would rather like to have a daylight era most people would rather have daylight then you get off work anything I think that's silly I spelled Twitter long while my link I know I did I don't think I could fix it though and it's too late no what do you do it yeah the program oh yeah shakes oh shit it's not yeah it's just numbers having the whole thing why is it lunch okay because it's like two lines you know what I mean okay if you hit the right button yeah put it a Joe line yay I fixed that shit didn't change funny Steve wizzy trying to be funny Steve whiz he says besides Carlos Mencia who your other favorite you're like Kozma see you know what that's what does my sense being a silly goose my favorite comedians though for real our guys who I look forward to seeing like Louie CK Dave Attell Doug Stanhope definitely riser Katt Williams only female video cat wins was on TMZ yesterday just got out of jail or something like that and they they he got in a fight at a bar and he had a gun in his pocket like it he's crazy that's crazy yeah he's crazy for real I want to meet that dude I thought I liked his comedy I think he's very funny Garrett listen to him on grand theft auto no she good yeah he does like the voice well no they have a comedy club in Grand Theft Auto see I like it if not telepathy what's next for human evolution Johnny Bananas 21 wants to know boobs for men if not telepathy what's next for human evolution probably a reversal if not telepathy if we wear our kid I think we're in a race right now between technology and retards between technology and and caveman style living you know they're talking about invading Pakistan veining Yemen and more war and more craziness you know we're at a crossroads and I think we could either get hit by a meteor or blow ourselves up or figure out the next level figure out what what's gonna take human beings from where we are to the next stage of existence which is like a real thing I mean I think we're really going to evolve we're really moving towards something new you know I think that's what this this frantic fucking society we live in is all about I think we're pushing and moving towards something all working together towards something and I think it's gonna be technology driven so it's one of those things either that's gonna happen there's gonna be some sort of a technologically birth connection that all people all of a sudden share some sort of a some sort of a convergence of all human being it's either gonna be that or it's gonna be we blow ourselves up or a meteor fucks us up or Yellowstone explodes and we start from scratch you know what if what if in the future the first robot to get pregnant machines so closely tuned into human beings that you can fuck them and get them pregnant yeah I think that's very possible man don't you anything is possible at this point I've that's not that crazy you know I mean they can make so many things artificially they figured out a way to make pork you know a laboratory actually the meat they could take some of the meat from from a pig and they make in a laboratory the problem is it's not it's really because it doesn't exercise at all and it's not like it's not like taut sinew but they're trying to figure out a way to maybe electrically exercise the muscle you can literally like just make gigantic like rooms full of meat you know that doesn't even have a life attached to it if they can do that if they can do that why can't they if they can figure out a way to grow me why can't they figure out a way to make an artificial human being that's gonna be just like Blade Runner though they're gonna be all sad and shit kill you you know I mean you have to give emotions if you don't give them emotions and you know they can't relate to people they can't empathize with people then they just go on mad raping and killing sprees because if you make artificial people what if you make them look they get hard-ons and shit you know my calculator has a boner robot I mean if you make the females you can make males to like for like old gay dudes you know dudes and what you know like to have a robot fucked all right the gay dudes would want some robot they do dick and froth you know imagine if they could make it like a real live like safe there's a guy who was your neighbor who was really creeping it was fixated on you and he make a robot that looks exactly like you and just fuck it all day long and punch it and tie it up and shit on its head and there's nothing you can do about it so literally next door to your fucking house this guy's like putting that the robot head out the window and waving to you look look I'm pissing his mouth and it's like you but it's a fake you and he's just fucking it up all day how disturbing would that be it's not any to do about it do you have the papers on this it's not a real human sir and these shows the papers okay I guess it's a robot I mean if it's a robot right look if I have a grappling dummy in my garage that I use in my practice my jujitsu you know and you can practice positions on it it's like it's called a Bubba dummy to Gracie you could buy from the the Gracie Academy in Torrance they're the ones who start selling out their website I forget what the website is but if you look up Bubba dummy it's a dummy that's just decipher jujitsu and we filmed once playing around remember we're in the aren't in the garage we were beating the shit out of it and kick it in what if that was a real person I mean that's a dummy that we rented but what if it's a robot person what if there's like a robot person that you could practice jiu-jitsu on you can rape them you could punch them in the face you could just beat the shit out of you could chop his arms off and be screaming and yelling and the cops come to go look it's a fake person yeah but the laws would have to probably change that our new intelligence is just the same yeah cuz then yeah yeah because I mean a dog isn't as smart as a human but you're not gonna have you're allowed to chop the the dog's legs off and stuff if you're a robot that has artificial intelligence it's still gonna be considered artificial intelligence I think yeah but do you think they'll treat it the same way as a human being like I think if the laws it'll be like murder or right I think if it's if it can think it's gonna be considered life but before they figure that out there's gonna be a line there's a couple years of mastery next direct replica of you and he's gonna fuck its mind right in front of your window or he's gonna blow an air horn look out the window what the fuck is he doing you looking he's fucking your head all right and you think about what if that was me what if I was the the duplicate and the real me was watching me get raped that's weird shit that could be real that could be real that could really be a possibility you know what I'm surprises that there's not technology yet work and we can I can have a program and type out shit and make it sound exactly like you yeah like you know like listen to your voice give you the exact levels so like you can print call with your mom you know like that it should be better this should be that totally yeah why ever they figure that out it seems easy you know it's really ridiculous to is that you still have to sign things you scribble because I mean I write taco all right penis I didn't even care they don't look at it I don't check your I need no I don't sign my credit cards I guess if you look at my driver's license I scribble my name yeah similar sample but what are these fucking people that work at Target or they scribble experts yeah I think you look at that scribble I don't know this is not the same guy yeah sometimes I write full sentences honestly yeah it's ridiculous how is that still around this you write something with your name and that's legally binding if you write something with your name you know I mean like you know when I got married I had to get a marriage certificate you had a right scribble that's it that's what ties you up yeah when you write it what is your right hand I would say I would write this is not real if I get a divorce I go no sir if you could see I wrote this is not voice what not valid maybe maybe you could say it's like shit then I could say well we have we have the documents you signed then you can look at and go look what I wrote yeah it says this is not real yeah maybe just sign I I'm a gun is being held up to my head they have my dog hostage robots will have rights after a while see that's a guy watch that Will Smith movie yeah so they need to make an AI movie like with the kid but like like you know sex was it I am a robot yeah yeah I am everything was Mac remember all the robots look like Mac's yeah does Gilbert I will have a chance again still Santos this guy's talking but I'm out here against UFC leave you won't talk about UFC will answer one UFC question yes it does Gilbert eigvals dangerous he's a really good striker he's a dangerous motherfucker actor and he knows this is a big opportunity for him he's gonna come charge with guns blazing don't you think it's stupid when people ask he's gonna win the fight because obviously it's a fight for a reason meaning that there's not an obvious winner of this fight so most the time it's not an obvious winner but most the time I mean there's a lot of times when when everybody agrees that a certain guy's gonna win I mean doesn't mean that you're right but in this fight this guy doesn't know that much about this Gilbert IVA guy probably you know he wonders I think Gilbert's got a real good chance he's dangerous if he trains hard if he's in real good shape he's very very dangerous he knocks a lot of guys out his knocked out of Gary Goodrich in pride was like one of the most spectacular knockouts ever head kicked him boom one shot like ten seconds into the fight and put him to sleep he's you know those questions that you can ask a dog to bark once for yes and park two for no and had the same percentage of the outcome of the question may be the answer that you know what I mean like if you say yeah that person's gonna win I know someone's gonna win right but someone's I'll tell you if someone's good or not you don't know if someone's gonna win okay no more sports questions order it I'm gonna order that fought the the tomahawk pipe next broadcast hopefully if they get it to me in time we will have a tomahawk pipe I think that's a fuckin awesome item like you need another pipe I think especially since it's a replica of something from a dude named Red Cloud very good look at those fanny packs they have sweet oh that's like a shoulder bag I don't do shoulder bags that's a goddamn purse okay fanny pack is fuckin manly that's a manly shit all right let's go through organ board and see questions there why is fanny pack manly I'll tell you why fanny packs manly because if you're wearing a fanny pack first of all you're saying I don't give a fuck what you think about how I look you know you just slapping this big stupid gay thing around your waist and like whatever I have two hands-free and I'm happy I'm not trying to look good for you I'm not trying to fuck you I'm not trying to get you to be my friend I like having all my shit in a bag yeah I'm not trying to get laid so people talk about oh man we're fairly perfect it's so great it's a bag that connects to my waist this is silly the only reason why you don't think it's good-looking is because women think it's disgusting and women think it looks gay so women have figured out a way to bully guys are not wearing it by telling us it looks gay why would you care what kind of a bag another where's your unless he's wearing a bright pink Hello Kitty strap the covers up your crotch yeah it does cover up my crotch it's right there so if there's like a micro meteor that comes from outer space and could potentially hit me in the deck it's gonna hit my cellphone first well perhaps my wallet it's right there it's easy for travel when I go to the airport I unbuckle that thing thing put it on my car keys are in there my cellphones in there whoo fanny packs are the shit's on there would be cool if gay people love the smell farts this fella says when are you gonna come to the east coast of Canada I don't like the east coast of Kent no just kidding we were in Montreal last April that was fun I'll be back mm-hmm I'll definitely be back up there all right page two we were going to the Rogen board right now to answer questions what I think about Jersey Shore I don't like Jersey Shore as much as I thought I would like it because I knew too many beads like that growing up to me it's like more annoying and stupid it's fun for a couple seconds so a fish pump you know but after a while it's just it's fake did this is my theory on I tell you my theory no I I think kind of like when the hills first came out everyone thought that was a real then slowly got to the point everyone figured out it was a fake show that's film to look real I think Jersey Shore's real yeah our way to dumb down what did you know half of them are like male strippers I had to audition like they're all in the entertainment field it's called Jersey Shore instead of the hills you know I bet you anything they all get yours of that yeah I bet you anything and they all live in this house it's really nice like real Roadhouse ya know what I mean but there that's the real people that's really a genius show if you look at it that well right but I think in three years we're all gonna be like knowing it's fake like that fight somehow is fake really it wasn't fake when that do punch that girl in the face yeah unless that chick is like a you know stop woman and they fucking practiced it for like 50 years you know if they practiced the punch a lot you know hmm I mean you look at movies you look at that punch it looks real they filmed it like to look fake mmm I think that dude got drunk and punched that bitch's yes listen someone said would I have full-blown AIDS or spend one year in Mark Hayden's body pick one what anybody you know what full-blown AIDS you can recover from you know we have a money here in mark Hayden's body it would probably be torture David I think full-blown AIDS if you take your vitamins probably okay in a couple of weeks dude you spend one year in Mark aid his body fuck every chick he could possibly find he's gonna fucking eat amazed you're not gonna get out he's not in Mark Aidan's body you don't get AIDS in Marcus body you don't even understand the question no I'm saying if you have one year in his body you could just abuse it like fuck and get the fuck out of there in one year in this let's end this a couple more questions no I need the fuck out here I gotta admit some of these questions are really lame but it could be that we're really high and they just seem lame that's a distinct possibility that's more coffee right now I apologize for the wack ass internet I really am gonna fix that should I go 18 tu verse or should I go comcast cable charter charter charter cinammon oh wow this guy says I think red bands life is fake how about that fella children to Karen is fake he says your life is fake I think you said your face is fake his face is his screen name is fake look you didn't you have an picture was this dye what would happen well it's faking on faking mom's not funny nope look at this this is the laziest rapists ever Dave Broomfield at hotmail.com says hey Joe Rogan why don't you invite me to come trip with you and your isolation tank how lazy is he that's not how you stalk and rape somebody's son it's gonna take its gonna you're gonna have to be a little more clever than that that's ridiculous fuck this we got a fake Brett Rogers hey Joe Robbie did you see my last fight no fake Brett Rogers I didn't garage is not on Twitter ladies and gentlemen that's a fake Brett Rogers the rail but Rogers a bad motherfucker but that's not him but it was really funny when the fake Brett Rogers was having an argument with the real war machine that was pretty funny one machine didn't get it thought it was all really happening mm-hmm Brian you stop talking a while ago what happened you giving up on us yeah I get to the cutoff point where I'm just tired of staring at computer yeah well having a company an Indian headdress to go with my tomahawk pipe says amuse 1994 yeah that's a very good question and I think yes I think if we're gonna really get in touch with the spirit world we're gonna need full India and tire anything mm-hmm yeah we're gonna need the whole thing man we're gonna need feathers and shit and the you know the correct type of weed gonna make sure what we only smoke what the Indian small smaller condoms some what no not those Indians American Indians that India Indians did I see the girl mosh pit I washed it for a couple seconds but it was like one of those terrorist videos where they cut some dudes head off after a while I like just shut it off I'll see if any of these questions don't suck I think if anything came out of this somewhere someone right now is thinking about designing a robot where you clone your neighbor and make a robot out of them and fuck them and rape them in front of them solid somebody is thinking about that and I think if this chat has done anything good for the world it's introduced that idea that possibility out there of making a clone of you you're just gonna suck because we're gonna be like 90 years old and they're gonna make the perfect fuck robot but we're gonna be so old we're not gonna even care anymore yeah yeah I guess but they'll probably have more problems than we have now you know we'll probably look back on these days and go remember the simple times and just get on the internet and drive to work you have to worry about monsters and aliens and UFOs and fucking you know the hyena flu that's killing everybody lately you know that's the next one something scary like pig who doesn't scare you bird flu they don't scare the fucking hyena flu who's gonna scare the shit out of you yeah it's a flu that came from hyena it's only shit yeah from from eating their own young they came up with a fucking crazy new flu and it's an everyone who gets it dies we'll be keepers outfits everywhere fucking mask person cat in California last week got the first h1n1 really people to cat so maybe it's gonna be cats we're gonna have to kill our cats after you have a baby cats become just really annoying dogs are annoying like shut the fuck up say but you know that babies rule dogs are still like cats I can't started pissing in my office right after my child was born new plants pant little cunt so obvious what she warned Dave you little bitch a couple more questions here let's go to the rub and board see if we got a good question there do you ever get mad like in anything actually push you off to the point where Rovin smash I'm gonna are you upset have to be pretty fucking a bad situation yet mean that upset I'm pretty rational when it comes to most things I have a I mean everyone has the ability to freak out over something it's just whether or not you choose to let yourself get there you know just gonna make sure I think them the most important thing about not getting mad is manage your biology you gotta treat your biology like it's a bank account and if you have you know if you're in debt you know you owe it something if you know you're over drafted you you owe yourself an expenditure of energy you know especially if you have a certain type of body if you have a muscular body you know a person is engaged in athletics your whole life you you have a body that's used to exerting a lot of energy well you owe it to that body you have to like you have to a debt to pay and if you don't pay that debt you're gonna you're gonna have a problem where you're gonna have too much energy that's stored up and built in and not blown out and it's gonna come out in unusual ways look in traffic or at work or whatever it'll you you'll start screaming and freaking out about something you really didn't need to and really it's all just about managing your biology managing your thoughts it's very important to have some down time where you can sit alone by yourself and just think that's very very important for me the isolation tank does that like times 100 that's my favorite but sometimes even just sitting on the couch and just by myself just thinking you know you can call it meditation you can call it whatever the fuck you want just spending time to organize your thoughts and put your mind in a certain place put your body in a certain place with exercise with yoga with nutrition all that shit's important you got to manage your biology and when you manage your biology it makes managing your mind much much easier managing your mind managing a biology that's the key to not getting upset at things you fucking faggots what the best art is created from the starving artists it seems the bet this is a good question seems the best art is created from the starving artist being wealthy do you feel it hurts your ability to create art comedy or do you believe that not having to worry about your financial well-being allows you more time to be creative that's a good question I think a lot of times people are much more ambitious when they're starving they have much more energy they are much more dedication toward something but that doesn't mean that you can't have a lot of dedication towards something when you become successful it all depends on what was your motivation in the first place if your motivation in the first place was recognition and you know adulation and then you become famous and then you get that then you have no motivation to keep going but if your motivation is the actual art itself is creating new things then I think you can be more free as you become successful because you're in a position where you don't have to worry about money anymore so you have one less thing to think about and you're ambitious in the sense of being creative instead of concentrating on money your mind is not geared on that your mind is geared on the art that's how I like to think that I am and when I'm at my best that is where I'm at that's that's my mind mind frame you know that's my my point of reference is that I think about the the creation of the art itself that's when I'm at my best if I think about money and I think about like how much is this gonna pay me is this worth this it's not the same motivation so it's you don't get the same results it's not the same passion to it the passions got to be real it's gonna be my comedy the way in my head my motivation is all about whether or not people enjoy it I don't want to do anything that people don't enjoy I want to make sure that everything that I'm creating I'm creating it so other people get enjoyment out of it and that's the reward that you get for that yeah as long as you're concentrating on that you do no wrong as long as you have the dynamic in the relationship between you in the audience as long as you respect that and as long as your relationship to the creativity is all based on just producing more stuff that's good that people enjoy as long as you're doing it for that reason I don't think you have to worry about you know money robbing you of your enthusiasm but if you were just in it for the money and just in it for the adulation yeah you become successful and then all of a sudden like you're not gonna want to do it anymore you're not gonna be you're not gonna be enthusiastic about it anymore honey a flu equals super AIDS yeah so I'm talking about what our plan on doing December 21st 2012 um no I'm gonna stay if it's really what people's are you gonna go to the pyramids man if it's really what some people think it is this convergence is technological convergence we're all human beings will interface with each other where someone creates a time machine where some huge technological breakthrough happens if that's that's what some people think December 21st 2012 I think lighter or whatever it's called the Hadron Collider I think that's about the time it's gonna if that's the case then it doesn't matter where you are right my friends I've done nearby maybe Brian and I will drill you stream that yeah shall we commit to you money for our let's commit to it right now we commit to a Ustream for December 21st 2012 December 20th 2012 we'll commit so that as the 21st turns over we'll do it at midnight show at night we will start out 8 o'clock Eastern so that's 11 o'clock Eastern I don't care what time it is in England you don't care okay that's not December 21st 2012 it's all based on fucking America okay because the Mayans and the Americans were basically on the same calendar sort of right no really I think time is in chichén itzá is the same as miami okay it's just a little bit below that either way December 20th 2012 2012 Brian and I are committing right now to a Ustream we're gonna do it feel strong about that yeah that is a possibility you know I think people like to know that something's gonna happen we have a friend that likes to believe in UFOs and psychics and chemtrails and anything anything wacky this this dude it just jumps on board you know and I think it's just as possible that nothing's gonna happen I mean as more impossible this is not contact you know I think it's possible to son might happen on the day because everybody's thinking something's gonna happen on the day right if it's some dude sitting somewhere with some bombs I don't even think that I think you know the idea that we're gonna for something to happen by really concentrating as you know as a point of focus this is one point yeah but that's what everyone thought is gonna happen in 2000 that is true but everybody was waiting for the clocks to break in 2000 was a very specific rains falling from the sky fucking stop working bud I've stayed home I'm embraced at home that was one of the first first years where I didn't do a New Year show cuz I I think I probably was worried it's so weird is that everyone was really freaked out about that and then we had all this like built-up stress because of it and then just shortly after 9/11 it's like then we finally got the release all the stress like the roads I think I just remember being really stressed out thinking someone was gonna happen it seems like right after that Nylund all right quick brains much easy to give up two and a half hours Ryan doesn't take vitamins yeah it was two hours of 20 days I hate it bag of carrots today I have juicer now oh man well we've dropped down to 424 viewers with that says to me is at least a hundred you motherfuckers thought we were boring your shit yeah so I think that how hairy is my butt from one to ten how dare you sir how dare you big to to thug from one to ten my butt three three or four I really could use shaving and trimming I was listening to an old Howard Stern broadcast where they were fined and he was fine for talking about savings but you know you don't realize how crazy those fucking regular radio shows are like what you can and can't do until you hear something like that but it was inspiring and I was thinking about trimming my own butt hair but it could definitely help solar flares are not in our control and that's the thing to worry about says Raptor 94 wrapped in 94 thinks that solar flares are gonna do us in it's very possible man nobody fucking over flares a gay make Brian clean my room for the next Ustream that's just my other desk it's covered with shit it's a desk but I really use it as like a place to just leave shit I'm a slob and have problems gentlemen what bullshit resolutions will you say you will keep and won't no I don't make resolutions and not a girl because I'm not a fucking girl alright and if I wanted to fix something about myself I would start now I wouldn't wait I always say I'm gonna work out more this year I'm gonna fucking get my shit together but for the most part I put out as much energy as I want to put out I focus on things as much as much as I can while still enjoying them you know always dancing around obsession that's very important to me whether it's with comedy or anything else and with games with anything in my life always have to dance around becoming obsessed with things so for me it's just just enjoy just try to be balanced and try to consciously you know just try to have a good time be positive when I get obsessed with things whether it's about jiu-jitsu or comedy or playing games at pool or video games I get crazy about things and I don't I don't like that feeling I don't getting obsessed with things Brian you get obsessive jerking off flat no they do oh how much porn do you have I get obsessed with the internet there's like I constantly want more information about everything yeah it just branches off more and more and more like I'll be looking about what what how apple sauce is made but then I need to know about how the apples are grown you know and just keep on going and going and going yeah wasn't that way when you were kid right no not at all I fucking hated reading and I didn't want to learn anything I just want to play video games and isn't it funny how different when you get older your your idea of information changes because when I was a kid information always meant school and shit you have to learn man boring might suck you know they were all connected together but then when it's no longer a requirement then yeah you find out what you're actually interested in you pursue those things Brian just fucking fell asleep on me leave that shit the fuck all right my Twitter friends I think we're gonna answer one more question he's sick fake snoring like the goddamn Three Stooges what is that Moe are you doing mm - this guy says 2012 something very subtle may happen that we don't realize for a while dude what's it don't smoke your AOL disk something cell is happening right now we won't recognize for a while that's not what 2012 shows me if that's what happens then 2012 is bullshit it's 100% bullshit if the if December 21st 2012 rolls around we just go nothing I don't feel anything I don't feel a thing then it's bullshit 100% it's not like oh man though there's a change you're just not gonna realize it for a while no it's supposed to be BAM it's supposed to be open a door here's a new thing you know I mean if the internet turned on like if there was a day that the internet turned on we all looked back and said ho December 10th 2000 or 1993 testing the internet turned on and the world changed forever if there was like a recognized date first of all that would be way more important than fuckin Columbus Day how about that how about we study Columbus Day and that dude never even landed in America right who's in the fucking Bahamas raping and murdering people and shit you know and then Columbus Day oh the internet Day is a way bigger for American history than fucking Columbus Day if they came out with an internet day that would be important but December 21st 2012 has to be like that internet day it has to be day we look back and go wow that day some shit started off that's the day that changed everything that's what December 21st 2012 gotta be though all the hype behind it if it's not that then it's bullshit you know this whole idea that it's the end of an age that's becoming a new era maybe maybe possibly but to me that could just as easily happened tomorrow or I mean why do we assume that the Mayans were absolutely correct about that even if they were correcting recognizing that human beings go in cycles you know that's that's not an old idea that UGA's is a and I believe Hindu idea I think it's Hindu along the same lines there's a little there's like stages that humanity goes for goes through and that these stages these cycles that they're all repeatable they just keep happening like in a cycle over and over again just like how you breathe in you always breathe out humanity rises and falls and right now we're supposed to be in Kali Yuga and this it's also supposed to end the same time around where the Mayans believe that this this age is going to end and the same time we're tense McKenna's you know time wave zero novelty theory which a lot of people think is bullshit I don't know if it's bullshit or not there was a guy named Terence Mckenna that had this crazy mathematical algorithm designed to track time and it was based off to each hing and the idea was that you could apply this to past events and show that all human innovation that progress in humanity is all like you could chart it on a graph that it's all like going along a certain direction and that eventually was gonna reach a point of what he called ultimate novelty and the idea of ultimate novelty would be something that we would figure out or do like create a time machine or something like that that would literally change everything as we know it you know and that Ray kurtzweil calls it the singularity you know that there's a bunch of different scientists that believe we're moving towards this convergence this one big invention and they tie that into them that December 21st 2012 is exactly the same as the ending point for ultimate novelty for time way of zero and that Terence Mckenna arrived at that time completely independent of the Mayan calendar I don't know if it's bullshit I you don't have really studied it either right you about this whole thing and he just programmed this logic around that day it's possible it's possible it didn't seem like he was a liar though in meeting me he might have been kind of a hippie in there they're all lies they all want money so they could buy weed fucking-a truly maybe we don't know if it was what we do know is this fucking thing's been going on for 2 hours and 30 minutes and that's it it's over ladies and gentlemen Brian and I are gonna get something to eat and we're gonna sign out we're gonna try to do this every week now 2 hours every week 2 hours 2 hours and a half you're right 2 hours is not so good but 2 hours and a half is not so good two hours is the perfect fine now but we appreciate all for it and fucking whatever year we had 500 people at one point in time okay it's like a comedy club and as soon as we get some more internet in here we're gonna start triple broadcasting it on both just and TV and all the other yeah well we'll put it on three and world's also will give you different angles to it yeah different if you want to be a fucking weirdo you know can we get bitter bigger heads up a couple days yes my friend Jim Dirksen did know did Rick Didrikson Jim Didrikson yeah we will we'll definitely give more advanced time we just figured it out yesterday we're gonna do it then I put it up and say we're gonna do it in a couple hours but what we'll do next time is what we're eventually going to do is have a specific time we start at every week that sounds like a Wednesday yeah usually an afternoon yes yeah you're right because even if we go on the road for comedy we don't leave until Thursday usually so we'll do we'll try to do a Tuesday or a Wednesday and that's we'll do we'll do like late afternoon in LA like three o'clock is perfect somewhere around that long and we'll do it on a regular basis so this week I'm at the House of Blues on Saturday no yeah Saturday night the house Friday night the House of Blues this Friday in Vegas that's January 1st they're still tickets available at New Year's Eve in Melrose
