haha hello freak bitches oh you saw I'm sure you saw the His Majesty thing right you saw that huh so you'd haven't seen this yes so University of Michigan like a lot of universities yeah is now doing this uh you know like you sign up for class your professor sends out an email to the entire class I'm professor Joe Rogan my preferred pronouns are Ian and then this one kid was able to because you can voluntary choose your pronoun he was like mine is his majesty I love it I like what a good kid word is yet his whole thing was to point out the absurdity of it but then people are like you're fucking asshole like they're all mad at him now his name is grant Strobel chairman of the young Americans foundations used the new policy to update his preferred pronoun to his majesty how could they be mad at him that is that is no more ridiculous than hir of course there's like 18 different gender pronouns now well identified and we also know there's astral gendered if you're feeling like you're part of the cosmos are you Polly I'm Polly Ann bye yeah yeah hey you put it on your your potty putting on his podcast or he's a Twitter page yeah like it was like bye Awareness Day and then and then some some guy a real professor was tweeting yeah and he retweeted it what a like something that was so close to Perry what the fuck did he say he was just like it was the wording other was too absurd to even recall but it was like remember when you're the today on by awareness day your gender and your to be by is not to be gender specific but your specific city of your gender can also dictate what your sexuality might be like what like something like that something I don't know yeah and then it was like happy by awareness you know I finally used an all gender restroom in Portland and it was at a gay bar and I got like I didn't enjoy it and it's not because of the whole pronoun thing it's cuz you've got like dudes taking gnarly shits next to you delete it yeah I don't need it yeah I don't need it Zim's or Z's I'm Polly and bi and I'm also fluid gender my favorite thing is to be fluid gender because you can go mmm however you're feeling in the moment but you have but people have to know what to call you so you have to update them on your pronouns constantly this that uh we what we saw this video of this guy who was like he was like you know you should really respect people's pronouns which which I'm like ok then he goes and if you see somebody and you're not sure just ask him be like hey what's your pronoun which I say no you fucking don't like you're not gonna just see somebody and be like hey I'm just wondering what's your pronoun did I think the owner should be on the person yes they went crowder steven crowder has a fucking hilarious video where he actually does this and really oh yeah it goes out and asks people what their preferred gender pronouns are and they there's the looks they give him like he goes to like grown adults and dad goes up to them on street and just talks to them and just wonders what their preferred is your phone on it nobody knows what the fuck you're talking about no preposterous I can't wait for the backlash wait will you well what's that video that guy Dustin Dakota Dakota yeah we have to show Joe that one Dakota is amazing did you they sent you the thing yeah Dakota is incredible yeah see this this is Emser Zim's our scissors a Oh for the the different gender pronouns why is it so hard it's why don't you just do what they ask my pronouns are not preferred see and the thing is like I feel like there's enough people going ok really that it's kind of a legitimate thing to not be a hundred percent on board with us you know cuz I feel a little like Oh am I on the wrong end of history there's one notes are not preferred ask a gender terrorist area whoa this is the newest video on my ask a gender terrorist playlist on my channel are we allowed to play this without huh oh yeah you can't just play it well we're not showing it on YouTube are we yeah take it off I know it's this dudes there's a dude P whatever it is yeah that's got a beard not I don't it doesn't have a preferred gender pronoun well that's what you work at we're gonna get to so that's the thing now right you can kind of be whatever you want to be yeah which is fine I guess I just think it's funny that some people are saying that you should see this individual and lead with like it's almost like it's rude for you to assume which I think is absurd that you're gonna that it's rude to assume like if you if you're gonna dictate a different pronoun I think that should be on you it should be on like a status like you should just show people yeah what some people do have these little stickers they put on my preferred gender pronoun is that's cool well here's a radio lab and this is one of my all-time favorite ones there's a radio lab podcast need take it so seriously because it's radio lab and there's a guy on it who's clearly out of his fucking mind and he goes back and forth between male and female he's during my podcast switches while he's talking to I'm like this I just switched I just switched I'm the man now hey like well okay when do you get to be a dragon what do you get to read minds when do tell the future then we're supposed to respect this you have to because it's it has to do with gender so if this guy was telling you about his past lives you know as a Roman gladiator or if he was telling you about the future when the starships land you would think that he's a crazy person right right but I think it right now but we talk about gender as soon as you start talking about gender you you really you're supposed to like give people the benefit of all doubt like even if you think you're switching gender back and forth as you're talking like oh the idea that your your gender is like some sort of a seesaw you're on the precipice and you can just left or right and left the right and it is you those mated a speck just aside yeah you don't understand gel but here's the thing aren't we different a lot of the time yes agreements be expressed in gender like you the other day when you're cranky cuz you didn't get your sugar yeah right yeah like what does looking like scrunch yeah right B you have a different personality trait you fell into this bitchy sort of doesn't like but doesn't like that that feeling that going back a sexist and made a fire joint up jet boat phobic well looking forward I'm looking forward to ignoring so many emails that are gonna come into my inbox about this conversation entail but people get mad oh I know they're gonna get so mad my point is like we talked about this like if you're feeling particularly lovey dovey right your your pet and kittens and you're you're putting your daughter's hair and ponytails met you're it's a more feminine feeling so did you switch genders at that moment no still specifically this guy wanted to go back and forth to being recognized as a man and then recommend all the converse and then as he goes back and forth he becomes a totally different person huh like yes like he's not gonna tolerate any bullshit I feels like in the military too it was like it was like there's a lot of weirdness to the story and he's under the care of a psychiatrist right no no he's wandering around getting government grants and great no idea I have no idea what he's doing but um I just you never go like if someone goes back and forth and pretends to be Hungarian like I'm Hungarian no no no no I'm from Ireland right no but I feel today I'm now I'm Hungarian again right I'm identifying that way but that's fine like here's the thing if you want to identify throughout the day sometimes I am more masculine when I'm at the Comedy Store performing I am very alpha male I'm very its macho but I do I have to demand that people know what to call me at every given moment that's a little unrealistic what's a new thing today oh yes dear I mean it's so presumptuous and narcissistic that you should know what to call me does this for you at least say like right now address me as her like right yeah two different names helix knit and just you know depending on who I might be misgendering or not depending on how he here or she hears it at the moment when you get point if you're in relation with that person yeah you would you cook like you feel like that's a respect like something that you'd be like okay I'll respect your wishes I'm not changing your gender you got to pick one yeah if you say girl okay your girl I'm cool with that I don't have any problem with that but you can't go back and forth yeah okay where I can't talk to you yeah so much work that's the point I think that's the whole thing yeah it's too much fucking work and if you're an adult it's got a full life how the fucker you have room in your head for the Zim jerseys every second changing well not only that that's somebody else's issue right what about yourself yeah no I I don't have any I don't leave any room to communicate with you because you're you're concentrating on yourself so much you want people to change how they address you just can you just change how you feel occasionally and not have a new fucking name your absolutes right three o'clock in the afternoon no I'm Bob right why do we have to label at every moment of every well it did we're self-indulgent thing and that's what you're getting out of this and that's what like the people that are you know they're being labeled as insensitive like that's the guy yeah the point is like yeah you're supposed to be insensitive of nonsense yeah this deserves a fair amount knock really does I agree I'm out but we're afraid to in part because we're going to get shamed on Twitter people are going to call us phobic of this and that even if you say something remotely you're gentler on politically correct or whatever yeah look there's a bunch people out there that are just not happy and they might not be happy with the gender they might not be happy with the way they look they might not be happy with how old they are they might not be happy with a bunch of different things but we have like rules as far as like what you can change and what you can't change and we're allowing people now this is like a really recent thing to just decide to change your gender which doesn't affect me yeah yeah I want people to have freedom that doesn't bother me but what what is this yeah an addendum to the Radiolab story she made them edit out the references to her actually changing her identity I guess she stopped she stopped switching what huh after all this no losses right here and she no longer flips interesting woman hmm she now remains comfortable as a queer trans woman what does what does that mean what's like going it's not queer is not gay though it's not no oh I thought it meant where is like weird like you can do both all right isn't it what is queer then let how do you know I thought my beer was genius no gays gay queer is not gay queers like non-defined okay so I'm not an on defined trail on binary that's Tom's domain Tom can you explain this yeah I mean basically on press please well you guys you fall on the binary spectrum where it says gendered privilege yeah okay here we go range it a queer feeling note that's on it a homosexual no no see they're using it different now see it used to be homosexual but it's not just a homosexual anymore okay terms and definitions LBGT right there click on that one LGBTQ now oh no there's an I in an a in there

what is TB LG queer a sex queer or asexual or question or questioning and asexual or app but there's intersexual - there's AI some people choose I mmm wait what's I what does that know let's get to Q queer intersex says Jaime an umbrella term used by LGBTQ people to revert to the entire LGBT community an alternative that some people use to queers the idea that labels in categories such as lesbian gay bisexual etc similar to the concept of queer of gender queer oh okay genderqueer is different hmm what's genderqueer I think that'd be like me like non-binary where I don't fall under the spectrum of male or female gender queer is a term which refers to individuals or groups who are queer or problematize what and make it a fake words hegemonic notions of sex gender and desire in a given society genderqueer people possess identities which fall outside of the widely accepted sexual binary you're not mine you're genderqueer oh yeah genderqueer Jumeirah may also refer to people who identifies both transgendered and queer ie individuals who tosses this a lot of work man it's a lot of words this much time this is what yeah when you don't know chop firewood yeah you fucking easy to get water yeah it's too easy yeah water too easy society we have to invent all these things now that in addition it must shit in my mouth this is a real this is a real hate mail episode we gotta we always bring the hate though no gender stuff this time you know what a real gender stuff though no no no no fake stuff no not the legit people they're like dude I'm a man trapped in a woman's body that I do believe office Lee right but just keep yourself cute yeah take your weird shit scoot to the press that shit successor is a exactly person's good yeah I'm telling you the 1950s not all bad no but you know do is keep on the transgender people or in the turn of the century turn of the 20th century there's a lot of photos of transgender people from back then it's always been a thing I used to learn more in Hollywood when I lived there about 15 years ago I just don't buy the going back and forth sorry yeah yeah I don't I don't think most people do I think it's an attention-seeking something something something else is going on there I think not all your feelings should be acknowledged I agree that's important right thank you that's important you like this the guy wants to be the six-year-old girl I mean they have all these specials on him a nice 57 here's like an economist I can't they don't have specials on him because they're extraordinary story they have specials on him because you know it's ridiculous and you watch it yeah it's funny yes yeah it's weird yeah you look you can't go back in time right you lived a long time you have to be responsible I have a special on him the same reason they have a special new lady who doesn't cut her toenails these are my special nails so true don't you and I can't get a job right right and they can never get a job that's got the donor days before employable is the one common denominator [Music]
