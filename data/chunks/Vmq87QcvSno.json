[Music] is it actually happening alright ladies and gentlemen flight companion and started Brian Townsend root Brendon shops in the house edy motherfucking Bravo with the new haircut yeah I like it thank you you going straight up Tong PO you should grow a ponytail on the back of that motherfucker all right if you never listen to this before this is a podcast where we watch the fights and we talk shit where day-drinking it's 11:15 the a.m. Eddie Bravo hasn't cracked open one yet here we go specially post Epstein is a lot of conspiracy what the big deal that's what everybody mera beg Tyson lobster fucking beast and he's about to fight Diego Ferreira and that is an excellent fight so if you never heard these before we're just we talk shit while the fights are going on we kind of commentate on the fights but now really let's be honest depends most of its not this is a very good fight Marivic tyson off is a fucking killer Ferreira is a very good fighter too so this is this is a good fight and they're in Abu Dhabi so you know when you think about a guy like Tyson off who's Muslim you got to think there's a lot of a lot of pride him fighting there but maybe a little bit of extra pressure home-field advantage right so I don't know about home-field advantage man because sometimes guys don't fight well when they're fighting in front of everyone they love and care for too much pressure and there's a lot more to worry about did you hear I forget what journalist is cage side but I guess the around the cage and the mat it's hot as fuck oh it's hot dude no but they're saying it's like unheard of hot around there so as the rounds getting going yeah I think I think it could affect some of the fights most most people and most teams do play better with home-field advantage he's kind of like yeah it's like you have no choice you can't you can't crumble under the pressure it's like there's too many of your loved ones watching you have no choice it's like somebody's will just fold man tie some I was looking good though just land a good left leg kick and a good one too he's a solid fighter man but he's one of those guys has had a hard time I think he's had a hard time getting into the u.s. I think that's I think he was denied visas or something like that I would imagine a lot of these guys on this car did like khabib dad can't get in but he's in this corner for this I'm not crazy yeah what do they think he's gonna do but the problem is he's got a tie to that guy from Chechnya tough yeah Oh Diego Ferreira just cracked him tossed him off has the same barber is Brian challenged on this TV to Cyrus I don't have to so you have to know knows on Apple TV I can't reliable you guys know we're alive we don't know where we live I'm looking right now it says there's people watching but I can't find it so boy looking I'm looking are you watching it can you see it I can see it I'm my thing we're having a little bit of an issue with YouTube ladies and gentlemen um when you get it to me get it do me a favor give me a link just just tweet it or something and I'll retweet it something something some when I was over there when Anderson Silva fought Demian Maia it was hot as fuck and it was outdoors I was that you you were there that's right you went to that one for the UFC we had no choice yeah and you have to go did you have to go about it though we were like yeah it's gonna be awesome we were pumped to put bro there were bugs the size of dogs oh hell no like bugs I never saw before like I didn't even know existed I heard it's cool out there though I heard it too great well Dubai is gorgeous and there's so much money hen zou said it's like he's hurt it's over Ferrara's hurt who really hurt he's really hurt he's a smart dude though he's gonna he's gonna stay away look he's popping out just to make sure that he knows it's okay that like that he's uh still still a dangerous fighter but he's in he's in real bats what is this forty five or fifty five fifty five I believe I might be wrong Jamie I'll find out for us I think Tyson mom's fifty fifty-five for sure lightweight yeah yeah fifty five Diego though hat is D Abel fought at forty five before maybe I'm wrong it's hard to tell Matt there's so many fighters in the UFC now it's just it's so difficult to keep track so long how dude how about Nate Maz Badal secure the bag it's happening yeah if it was it November 2nd not Square Gardens November 2nd and they're still working on Colby and Oman but they're not though cuz I don't want to pay well they are trusts oh yeah you would know they they don't want to pay Colby what Colby wants oh we cracked him again but did but Dana said that that will be the main event they don't want to put a title fight above that so then so so there there's no way you'd make Kobe so Maas Vuitton Nate Diaz is the main event I'm almost positive to him that's me it's five rounds of that and Dana said he doesn't want to put a title fight above that well if that's the case I figured it out they're gonna we are alive there's just the change they love the way it works now okay so is it Joe Rogan dot live make sure okay and Dana's making a belt fort just for that like the People's Champ belt all industries are well-well date wood Nate says is the baddest motherfucker in the game belt yeah that's what that's what he's making that can't say that you gotta say that on TV yes man can't say baddest motherfucker in the game major psyche the hardcores belt you know yeah that's the that's the fucking I'm so happy they made that fight I didn't think was gonna happen to die God anything is gonna happen when I saw it on my Instagram feed this morning I threw my arms up in the air like somebody knocked out well when I saw you at the improv I was like I don't think it's gonna happen there I feel like that Nate needs too much money it's as too much massive increases its worth money well you know Dana said something you know I'd said that I think that that Nate Diaz is one of the biggest superstars in the game right up there with everybody easy top five yes and then Nate and I guess there was some negotiations or something cuz Dana refused agos well I don't think that Nate Diaz in our long-term plans and Nate fights once every three years and Mike don't say that that could be him playing the game yes you trying to learn made out I'm like come on Nate and also let him know that look we got other plans there's other shit we're do you know I just retweeted it oh you did okay what is the link I don't know is it the powerful Jerry page yeah it's on there but it's not that link we have I'm just excited but I want you on versus uh versus Colby that's the fight to make a hundred percent that cards stacked though even without lucemon Colby I hope they work that out cuz I wanna see that but Maz ball Nate you just I'll just buy that fight I want those two guys not only are they to the baddest motherfuckers ever but they're funny is fucked they're both great they're funny they're both super necessary yeah all that shit three-piece in a soda I named a move a transition three-piece and so brilliant after him it's so great skit and I showed it to him to learn this I gotta know it yeah he's gotta know three-piece with the soda that guy is so good he's so good and so he's so clever you know that's one of the best things to say about Maz Woodall and the thing is people don't necessarily associate him with knockout power for some reason but yet the guy knocked out Eve had words with a head kick he knocked out Darren tail cowboy Cerrone yes now Ben Askren and put him in another dimension with a flying knee world record fastest knockout I mean it's weird that people don't associate Maz Vidal with a knockout artist because he doesn't have he doesn't necessarily have the most power but he's so good it's so calculated the way he set up that knee is this the card yes the Kelvin versa details interesting Derrick Lewis Lewis versus blog nev novel Johnny Walker Corey Anderson look boy I forget how to say that guy's name blog all have enough even off I think it's even even off he's a scary dude he is so scared yet staff yeah in the heart they stabbed in the heart Corey Anderson Johnnie Walker's a good fight but dude Johnnie Walker shoulders still fucked up I sent in that video of him working out he's the mobilities not great well he's also he's throwing punches with only one arm he's not in the videos of him working out and then there's other videos of him going through strength and conditioning and you see what he's doing with his left arm and I'm like Jesus Christ is like he's not lifting any weight with his left arm hopefully it's all right how about freakin Kelvin verse until oh that's he'll was like nah man let me just go after these fucking monsters well he legitimately is a middleweight I mean he that guy was killing himself making one seven I agree but why but coming off that the two losses that he suffered and then you know obviously either he had some issues while in a lab in Liverpool and wherever Bali or whether Hebrew in that hotel so he's going through something and then they just give him frickin well I think he asked for Kelvin I don't care god I'm a fan I'm a fucking I'm both both those guys all Kelvin is so good I think universe now better it was my favorite middleweight fight of all her hair which is rocked ice him off bro Tyson mop seen a little bit of trouble right here for Harris solid man he's solid Oh Oh Tyson off might be in trouble oh my god he's winging shots at his face to that right hand just barely missed some guy got starched on the prelims yeah dude some office in a little trouble here right now I laughing - yeah flat-footed huffin and puffin they said - hunty 9 degrees in there I know that is so ridiculous now is this an outdoor arena no I thought they built it for this that right are they saving money on AC it was the first one yeah this is the first event in the arena I believe it's the AC broke someone's gonna get hanged yeah yeah someone's dying so had a little money they're not fucking around oh my god is it really 99 degrees and I saw a thing it said 99 - Dead is so bad to fight at 99 degrees you got to be acclimated to that shit and even then you're still gonna have a performance hit you're gonna definitely have a performance hit probably similar to fighting at a very high altitude like Mexico City type deal they don't look at that sweaty though do they well it's hard to tell you know I mean we're not in the air they looked sweaty as fuck yes what is fucking sweating but I mean they just fought two rounds this is there in the second round whoo this is a big mouse into the left eye of Ferrara God we haven't done one of these in a long time it's been a hot second well it's the last one we did I can't even tell you it's been Mont Talon is in his gym shorts right now filming his television show he's on the way you think it'd be possible to do a team MMA like Americans versus Brazilians you know a rush you know but like in countries like you take Olympics like the Olympics but you do it in the UFC you take the best guy at 35 best guy at 45 like the ultimate Russians not to run the table yes light heavyweight you put all everybody could be everybody all the cousins are taken over everything look at what they're doing in boxing it's Russians and black Russian and black guys are owning the fight world well Russians like the whole light heavyweight division I had Andre Ward on the other day he's brilliant he is every champion all these two contenders like 78 percent of them are Russian it's crazy there's so many killer Russians when we think about the champs now I mean it's either well shit it's either Russian or black right Zephyr steep a and the winning team gets a billion dollars I dig it do for hair I just cracked him I hadn't ice mom's in trouble man he's bleeding - he's bleeding out of his nose caught the UFC Olympics that would be pretty badass dude if you guys who don't what oh he's gonna heat in there but he who doeth wasn't born what'd you say what'd you say heat index is 123 in there Dominick Cruz was his quota I'm cooking like a biscuit the heat index is 123 so it feels like a heart that's not gonna be good for performance oh that's ridiculous imagine the third fourth round four could be even does oh yes I feel like at advantage the quarry um no really training in Florida I'll be anybody's fun well they're in air conditioned environment they don't trade outside I mean he's not training the tunas I mean new or that gym in New Orleans had no a/c right maybe advantage for you yeah maybe I mean I wouldn't bank on it though I think everyone's gonna be compromised the fact that it's that hot I'm gonna don't text Dom I don't feel hotter just cuz I can see what's going on how do they know that that should happen well you got yeah Joshua verse Ruiz in Saudi Arabia and they're building just a fucking arena for it just for that one fight they've built this arena just for this fight no for Joshua Ruiz in December this is only the second event in this one maybe fuck the Pope or a finally the title shot here you go when this one though we're coming back to New Orleans I'd imagine all right just said he might respond in between rounds if he has a time a little woman in crew shout out to Dominick Cruz right hand to the back of the head her hair looks better and you got a thing for Hera is training in Brazil right is he in Brazil right now training and he's from Brazil I know I know sweetie but Brazil obviously gets very hot and a lot of gyms in Brazil are open-air gyms but I he looks to me better like physically the way he's moving enticed him off looks like he's just trying to get his his wind back and he had a really good first round so he might have emptied out a little bit in that first round I like for him right here if I was walking in right now and somebody wanted to bet cash and hair is looking good all day he's looking real good man he's look at that man said he sees he's fighting out a real good pace oh don't do it guys no I don't know who elbow oh right hand damn you know what I've been watching a lot lately on YouTube I've been watching left way you know what that is no that's that uh Muay Thai with no gloves and head butts Christ yeah this is this guy David LeDoux he's like the king of laughs way and he's friends with Robin black like Robin Blackston breakdowns of his stuff and Robin has done some commentary for left way wild shit to watch man where did where do they do a man not here I think you I don't know where he lives you watch that bare-knuckle boxing that yes you want you changed my opinion of whether or not MMA should be burning day well as I knew you'd come around Hut's I knew you'd come around the cuts are too much Chris leoben's whole face is like a ax murder it's terrible you got hit in the head to hatch you see it's a Bigfoot versus Gonzaga yeah I don't like that I don't like that makes me sad that's a Bigfoot on the yeah aw sorry it seems like it seems like that bear what's what's the name of the show the event they're not go fighting championship be KFC it just seems like it's blowing up it is blowing up people is that Domino G fighting art Tim Lobo got people excited do you see the numbers though what kind of blown up fall relative what's the numbers bring that shit up Jamie it's not great he said over two hundred something thousand but it came out it was like eleven thousand or so no really was it was it wasn't crazy let the pay-per-view numbers yeah dude Diego for Hara is putting it on ties him off Marivic tights moms in real trouble right now he just got hit with a big right hand and he's not offering any offense right now he's just trying to gather his shit and just moving away like even when he's throwing punches is like they're not dangerous so you like right here it reminds me of Tony Ferguson here just job just stocking them down and just do still money Tony Ferguson has changed the game in terms of like a guy who has the ability to put it on you and doesn't get tired he is at the top of the fucking list I've never seen anybody like him you know what he's gonna do the next project does he's gonna open up a 10th planet in Big Bear he wants to live in Big Bear I like it he's got some impact on it says just 18 thousand people downloaded it they said 200,000 but they know though this weighs the counters reporting Meltzer is a pretty solid source yeah legit journalist eighteen thousand that's not a lot 18,000 I would say I was uh no that that Logan Paul ksi - that's gonna be ondas own will get fucking 7 million or some shit like Joe Saunders is on the undercard of that which is so ridiculous why what what Billie Joe Saunders is fighting on the undercard of Logan palsy aside one of the top 20 fighters on the planet Earth I would say kickboxing no boxing oh it's two youtubers who fought before Wow well now it's a different game isn't it - I was on board when they were just fighting each other Billy Joe Saunders is a fucking he's an artist heavyweight no Billy Joe is middleweight right yeah no yeah he could fight I'd love to see him against canal I think you give Kanellis impress my favorites everybody's Tyson Fury's best friend yeah he's hilarious yeah they pulp and match in Ferraris all the time they're great he fights like him - in a lot of ways yeah very mobile he's a badass man very mobile Wow it's embarrassing oh another head kick bro entice him off is not offering anything dangerous and returned I think he's like severely compromised right now oh shit cracked again who are the judges um that's a good question Adelaide battle a bird see some people's who else I don't know who's like who do you get excited about four judges panel a bird's eye not gonna be chaos yeah I see ya Doug Crosby like for real who is uh-oh look at that that's the end of the fire there's no way you go Tim there's no another country you don't know what the fuck's gonna happen no absolutely I can't there would be an embarrassment for them if they gave that to Tyson hey don't give up most face got beat up so this is early in the fight Tyson mama tracked him why are they showing just his highlight hey that could sway judges the end of the fight is the end of fight this is the first round tie some off coming on stealing they're just showing okay they showed that novice then as the fight wears on then you see Diego come on strong listen I work in that fucking production they show the first round then a second yeah the first round was all Tyson off but then the second and third they see now they're showing four hair like we did they're all play him ten eight that first row do you look at this crack it's for hair as a beast man look at the numbers though come on he's in round one the numbers are crazy well the thing is like Tyson off hit him with big shots in round one that's terrible for Tyson off because Tyson off has not fought in the UFC in quite a while and for him to come back to the UFC he Jamie on the other screen can you pull up Diego for Harrah's record he's a fucking good fighter man he's a good fighter but again the endurance thing nobody's like Tony I mean literally like he's like a superhuman I've never seen anybody that can sustain an attack like Ferguson no one so what does he got here you lost to Dustin he lost a Benilde are you Sh you got Dustin ko time Dustin's a monster but he beat Olivier Obama Mercier he beat roost um kabilov those are good fighters man really good yeah he's about a fucker if he if he fucking loses are they won he won Mara Beck went down and he thought he was gonna win no no he didn't think he's gonna win anything he's praying yeah I think he's praying and then he kind of got a praying for those people you never know yeah no fucking way dude if he won that fight it would have been a horrible travesty of justice how do you remember Alessio Sakara versus Tallis latest no I don't you know remember that one no what happened that one Saqqara got the decision but Tyler's latest took him down over and over never really got hit standing and took his back like two or three times really and sakara escaped all the back attempts and then got back to his feet so the replays were also Cara's escapes back escape hmmm where was it at guess who won it's a car yeah really cuz the replays influence though judges ma'am you think so I know so did I was in the truck dude whoa Wow what did you say hey how come you guys aren't showing the replays of the takedowns in the back control I don't remember what happened where was that watch that fight and then you'll see at the end all the replays are Sakura escaping back control and he won was this back in the day when was this this was probably about 12 years ago oh wow yeah they don't know what the fuck they're kunai throwing chicken bones to decide watch that fight and then tell me who won who I don't know wow it's amazing that you brought that up that's a crazy fight great never forget that one that's how I know that sticks in my brain like those replays that's that's why I thought oh that's like replay because the judges are sitting there going oh my god what do i do what do i do so they look at the replays and if the replays are showing one guy is getting the better the other guy then they go okay um if they in the truck they think he's winning so then okay he's winning you know what's crazy is that that's what happens nothing nothing really significant has changed in terms of like the the who judges fights it's like basically the same kind of people the same people you don't you're not seeing look Ricardo Almeida's a judge in New York which is a great thing but you're not seeing a lot of that nothing you're not seeing a lot of me more card all made a typo yes yes either form of fighters or martial arts experts like if you say you want to be a judge I want to see you show me how you applied arts chokes show me what's dirty anaconda choke in the Darce choke show me when you know show me how how do you do a ten finger guillotine show me show me if you don't know what that is if you don't know how to do it how are you gonna know whether or not someone's in danger whether in the middle of a fight I'd also show him fights like the one you were talking about with Sekar and ladies and got how do you score this right you guys are talking all sorts of fucking common sense dude Dominick Cruz well I don't want to say that but he says so fucking hot part of what he said I will not repeat yeah he says fucking hot can't say fuck that's you know I can say that I can't say what do you I'll show you you wants me yes racist no no just Dominic's not racist at all no okay yeah yeah oh that's a Brennan but tell them to shut the fuck up about it I'm uh we should all go to New Yor in New York because

Australia they try to get me to fly over there for this one - I'm like hmm I'll be here I'll be here folks but style Bundy vs. Whitaker's to fight man right that's the fight just so they're both in

capacity 40,000 40,000 tickets already sold in Australia for Whitaker versus out of Sanya holy Sh oh my goodness October 6th in the month of fucked Marvel Stadium I like a Marvel Comics Stadium Ronda Rousey home holds the record does it get big if you said that record yeah record for MMA not really yeah Shane I remember being there that was crazy you think around I'll ever come back nope no I don't think she wants to I think Rhonda's a strong woman you know she decides she's done she's done she's gonna move on I don't think she wanted to you know to keep doing it I just think you know I think making money I think we came back and fought Amanda and then Amanda knocked her out that must have like really fucked her up mentally but like now looking back like Amanda's the she fucked up cyborgs like she would have fucked up anybody so I'm thinking that Rhonda's feels a little bit better about that a man to fight baby and well she got knocked out by Holly before that though and it just knocked out Holly with a fuck they weren't competitive he was today still even today if the fights on the ground you got to give it to Ronda Ronda still better than yeah I don't know about that with Amanda a man she's a lot Jiu Jitsu yeah shit yeah but man is brother life are the owned everybody on the ground with arm bars but she's had a very singular attack arm bars it was all arm bars just said she was there fighting great competition she's saying if she just focused on her judo and and her arm bars and and and didn't try to be a striker you think she'd be like a khabib now I think if she went to lose you come back everyone loses and they come back you know dude I think Rhonda would still be in the mix 90% she would have to separate and move to a real camp she would have to train with real trainers like a real group of killers grappling trainers wrestling traitors make sure she's got the best foreign partners and more importantly can coach a real mind a real like a like for us for us a hobby like someone like that or you know Mike Brown or you know the Duke roof is someone top of the food chain person Matt Matt Hume right a top of the food chain coach why would she right she wouldn't that's why she's killed in dub dubby she wants that certain Travis to do this I'll come back this was crazy shit watching steep a just knockout DC was crazy dude I was cursed lathe on now dude ste pay how much money is Rhonda makin in the WWE millions millions of money that she's ever met no no she's gettin paid to pretend so why the fuck would you risk all that and go back to UFC what do you think about Cain Velasquez you think he's gonna stick did you see him he's good it's I mean he put that mask on and with the Mexican which I leave it a fun true dude he could be huge and he said he loves you he could be huge flips and shit his legs kind of fucked up back how can he do all that chewy back oh he does or does he have a fucked up you know he just over it and like I'm gonna put this mask on and get paid well to get punched I think there's a big difference sheena flip that you orchestrate yourself versus someone fucking picking you on the clan you're on the ground you're in training and you know wrestle with how crazy is it that people are into fake fighting fucking they love it they love their passion about to and if you talk to you about they come at you in a row trust me I know trust me I don't but look Tony Hinchcliffe who I love to death that fuckin kid lives for it he lives for fake friends yeah barely Corrigan from smashing people one of the organization's yeah yeah they might as well make movies and TV shows while they're at it no they want to see it live they want to see like a live play it's like a live wild crazy play I respect it look they grind they grind it's hard it falls into other shit like video games cartoons comic books nerd culture it's like stuff that you enjoyed when you're a kid and these guys embrace it deep into adulthood it's fun for them I get it I don't mind it they always they always like compared to watch Jones they do make movies I don't know if you knew that that's enough these girls WWE movie no no

Jesus Christ don't like eight - you - those bro we get it we get it is he dressed like a woman in real life you'd have to ask him gun to the head yeah pumps are size 14 pump it is from yeah hey listen

ladies like Christie Brinkley's okay listen but still wearing makeup but if you're out Cindy Crawford if you're a transgender and you're over 60 you should probably dress like old ladies right and

50 you're asked why guys can be guys can do it though guys have different kind of assets long dresses holds but you can get asked jobs these days you know guys like ass implants no guys no no no God no God no guys but here's the thing girls are starting to develop ass cancer they're starting develop cancer in the same areas where women were some women are getting breast cancer from implants it's it's not always ticketing ask yes sir yes but she can't yes but from the implants or are they doing the Brazilian bone which is fat let me answer it's a reaction to the implants your body doesn't want foreign substances in its body if you put something in your body a piece of plastic and then your body like has to go why's is here what the fuck is is and your body starts to fight it and reject it and then you develop scar tissue around and that's why a lot of older ladies that got boob jobs if hug them there it feels like they got two basketballs in their chest it's fucking weird scar tissue

Cleveland now take a picture of Cleveland oh we're back home Junior are you kidding me do that guy's body holy shit find a better picture of there's better pictures that's time right that's Emily shaved lip how dare you shame how about that one there we go Russian bear right there it's a Harris man I've ever seen serious grappler holy shit I'm trying to get him to do combat jujitsu oh my god look at the hair on it up those arms good for him how many MMA guys have gotten into combat yuyutsu Jessie Taylor Josh neer oh my gosh near most I would say 98% of the guys that do combat jiu-jitsu have MMA experience they're pure jiu-jitsu grapplers they don't want to have anything to do with combat jiu-jitsu no oh that shit 99% of the guys that I have all have MMA experience when did Josh neer compete he was uh when we did um EBI 17 it was a the first 16 man combat Jiu Jitsu tournament we did and I think I think he got taken out in the first one he's coming back though he's doing the next one the next show next combat jujitsu is November 24th in Mexico it's the middle weights jón þór Blanc is uh he won that tournament - Josh neer did Josh sneers coming back John Thor's coming back Jesse Taylor's gonna do it the leap of Fogel in its it's gonna be insane November 24th in Mexico and we're at Mexico Monterrey Josh neer is like one of the Forgotten pioneer here's a killer dentist killer yeah yeah like when was the last time you find him in May though it's been a long time right so you just decided to get Pete again but yeah combat you get oh look at that boy curse beating the shit out of it last combat you get to show I did not you didn't see it oh did you guys get on UFC fight pass and watch the last one dude when did it it was insane it's a great I was saying it's a great step for guys who are thinking about fighting in MMA to go from jujitsu mmm yeah or jujitsu combat review together I just you know there's a lot of different ways to look at it you know you could look at it as if you're planning on transitioning into MMA and you're a grappler it's a great sport or if you're done with MMA and it's too brutal but you still want to compete that's that's another way to look at it I look at it as just the most gangster form of jiu-jitsu like when you just look at you just to forget about MMA you just look at jiu-jitsu and all the different formats combat jujitsu is the most gangster it's the most scary it's the scariest one and like I said pure jiu-jitsu grapplers don't want to have anything to do with combat jiu-jitsu dude all guys from MMA no sighs I was gonna say out of all the guys in MMA in the heavyweight division does Curtis blades have the best ground-and-pound by fine not yep yep by far well smash up in there oh yeah Kane has a mask on for god sakes right now but still he's still in the mix right in the middle he just got you know no contract what has he done I don't know he said right now he's folks on the nacho libre stuff and then he's gonna you know out your mouth man is that what's called natural ear and I'm trying to be funny lucha do that naturally rates the movie yeah that's a Jack Black you're gonna get I was kicked on line you better yeah they're coming for you bro oh no bring it bro no I heard his words I like his haircut to beat him knocked him out starched him both time you stopped him in the first fight no he didn't all right doctor stoppage yeah you got a crazy swelling in his honest unless Curtis blades trying to take down the whole fight yes he was and then then the second fight he got starts right away guys women just clip them look at me still finds number four oh yeah he's right there in the mix I think he knows now more than ever I'm just gonna guess but I think based on his experience in those fights with Francis that he realizes you know what I just got to be the heavyweight khabib I got to take people down and smash him on the inverse Steve Bates very interesting it's just hard when you guys stopped you a couple times in a row you know twos times huge sighing here I mean John's tiny though annex freaking tiny yes he'll tell zai anak well he's my height so he's fine no maybes five seven no he's short it he's shorter than you maybe five something for me I'm kidding the neighborhood you're right when people say you're sure I'm Joe Rogan I'm right there with five nine five or nine this is bad Sergi game an inch the uptight move I swear to god he you I went to the doctor and a fuckin had a physical and they measure that oh my god how is it now not good that's a big sigh yeah that's not good I'm not liking that you know before my back surgery the pain came from inflammation so my dad no disc and my bones are rubbing together my l5 s1 or whatever the fuck they call it so what ends up happening there's a problem they're in my back so my my body it inflames the whole lower back just so it's like sore so I was living life with just a stiff frozen back all the time finally got an MRI after years and years finally got the back surgery so now there's a titanium disc in between the two vertebrae but my body is still because I'm rolling now and I don't think I'm supposed to but I I gotta fuckin lose weights and I don't know any of you know I think you're supposed to roll my god my doctor told me he doesn't know anything about jiu-jitsu and he said he does you okay what are you doing exactly in this budget to thing I go he goes our people picking you up and slamming you I said no no no no no they're not picking me up with some always born guard yeah I didn't want to explain that to him cuz he didn't know what pulling guy go no no no one's picking me up in slamming he goes okay that's good but you're not like twisting or anything are you and I said twisting uh-uh well my nicknames the twister no a twisty so he's as long as you don't twist you don't want to do anything you don't want to go to the gym and twist your back at all no twisting at all you you can't can't no running no twisting and no snow adi running no sweat no running no squatting no squatting no deadlifts they go you we don't want any compression going on in your spine at all and no twisting and Jesus so what's happening is I'm rolling and my back feels the same like before surgery like it's hurts it's still inflamed it's still inflamed so it's my body's going something wrong with your back what what do you think would happen if you got like Regina keen down there all right I did that did ya before before the surgery you did but what about now that's another 10k I ain't gonna do that shit again yeah yeah you know what I'm just I'm rolling oh this is the fight Islam Akkad chef Tommy Ramos this is fuckin Ramos this is the fight I'm looking forward to almost as much as the main event yeah Davi Ramos is he is the shit and but so is Islam Islam is a beast man that guy is so good DC said he's the heir apparent they said if you see him go with khabib he said that motherfucker is a future champion I've heard he's an absolute monster yeah Jim he's so complete Ramos stand up skills but if the fight gets on the ground I'm I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's gonna be over you think I don't I don't think me that easy though but he's won decisions Eddie well Davi Ramos has won decisions against guys who are not as good as Islam okay okay straight savage yeah but maybe I'm wrong about Thomas Donna B Ramos his record is a he's a combat sports you know world champion so he's bursting grappling well he's so got to the islamist jiu-jitsu doll no i could be wrong i don't know anything about his he's so solid dude he's so solid look he might be hard to finish I'll take that back I'll take that back but I just wanted to you know say that I'm a giant fan of Davi rhombuses Jiu Jitsu what he's done in Abu Dhabi is insane yeah so see he's got he's got one decision against Austin Hubbard in his last fight who's this loss to summarize yeah but Sergio more ice another necessary fucking jujitsu fighter and Sergio is actually a larger guy Sergio's Sergio's fighting at 185 was he fighting 185 or 170 now no but he fought at 85 decisions he fight in the finals The Ultimate Fighter Brasil he fought 85 against Mutantes azar Ferreira that was 85 when they fought 70 in Neil Magny right now oh yes he's won a bunch of submissions but he's submission nick piedmont you know he decision nick piedmont he decision dis austin Hubbard character in those last fight so that he went three rounds with that cat that was a good fight to Austin hubbard's a good firing that was a really good fight how full Rick Lee in the back um so I don't know if he's gonna submit him quick I think maka Jeff's the best fighter he's fought yeah I really do I would assume he's an underdog got a piss on my I'm not dude hey um how's Victor's back cuz Victor had the same surgeries you right yeah he came in last week how's his back his was a little different than mine really surprised that like when you um when I went to have back surgery my doctor showed me x-rays of all these different backs goes dude they all look way different like everyone's back so different and some people have fucked-up backs they'd never done anything athletically the whole life so it's like his was different than mine mine was worse than Vic islam's 400 - 400 favorite he's I think he's the biggest favorite on the card the sides could yeah I didn't know anything about Islam oh he's dude he's so good if you talk to anyone who's in like the circles he's like the next they think he's a parent yeah he's a fucking nightmare my prediction no no take it back no no no I got a commitment once you say something you stick with that for life we didn't bet on it though least we didn't bet on it we could have hustled Callen wins Callen strongbox I said to be warning but he might never be here he said he was gonna be done at 11:00 but he's probably the wine-shop right now picking up vintages when they say you're done at 11:00 when you're filming the TV show you turn it one I bet you I bet she doesn't make it I be she doesn't make it so let me ask you this what was the difference rumors back in your back it just looked different ma you had to qualify difficulty for the this for disk replacement if you don't qualify for this replacement your bones got to be a certain way then they just fuse it then they just fucking put like a metal cage in your spine screw it all that's my kanga yeah so fusion is that's hardcore but the the alternative is the disc replacement it all depends how your bones sit and I was right dude I was right he was showing me my doctor said dude you bear you're barely qualifying for dis replacement you want to do it it's on you it was due to was a game-time decision um I decided whether I was gonna go fusion or disk right before surgery right whether right before they put me out oh my god that's gonna be the dad right so is yours not mine cuz I was on on the fence I was like on the borderline and I decided to go with a dis replacement so there's a risk there's a risk if you're not qualified physically and you go ahead and do it shit could fall apart like what is the qualification though that's what I'm confused to what your bones are sitting like if your if your vertebrae are like uh like horizontal then you're good but if you're like this if your vertebrae some people are like they're like no we got a fuse that motherfucker cuz it's slipping off your shit oh so it's so so cockeyed that it's like poking into the side of your body it's simplified it's just if you're horizontal and there's something that it's laying on it's good but if you're like this mine was like this my Mac was like they were ready to just fuse it ooh but the problem with if you get fusion in five years you got to fuse the vertebrae on top of it oh five years later you gotta fuse the other one so your back's just gonna be fine I know a girl she's two word of connoisseur holdbacks fused yeah she had some something fucked up with it lets you go fusion you just every five years you got to get more bro she walked like this yeah it was like she had a pole from her hey is she still there what no she's like this so but other than my back dude I had shoulder surgery and knee surgery and those motherfuckers aren't a hundred percent either I don't I think at 50 when you're 50 mm I don't think you ever recover 100 bro you still on the trt a little bit what about stems you say you're doing stem-cell - no no no you got to do that - you did that that fix that shoulder guarantee about to get my foot for my planner you still have plantar fasciitis or blue are you still running it yeah they have to you have to I just love it why don't you get one of them zero runners have you seen nothing that I have out here is it a would way no no it's a it's like a weird it's sort of like an ellipse sorry sort of like an elliptical machine but you you're it's you're actually doing it as a hrunta movement the movement is the same as running what could be cool I like swimming just got it here try it I like to run outside do I like hiking I do too but I mix it outside I mix it up with that I mix it up with the air runner which is a runner that you push yourself you you that's it there's no good way that's like a tank tire mm-hmm no those women swimming every week man you go somewhere to do that you have YMCA baby do you know same old school I'm sorry I'm doing the exact same routine I did for the metamoris fight trying to lose weight try to lose weight trying to get my cardio together do do my cardio is the word no but what about exercises on your back what about using like a reverse hyper I did all these different you swap your back no I do there you go here we go I do back extensions $20 regularly you guys ban and the last I bet it's my guy some - 400 look Dhabi Ramos can win this fight 100% anything can happen man Davi Ramos gets you in the ground he's a legit multiple time world champion legit and he's got real fucking power in his hands Davi Ramos is a dangerous striker he really is I mean he's not like a helpless guy on his feet he's explosive he will fuck you up on the feet I just think that maca czev is by far the most complete fighter he's ever faced much of the motherfucker men he's so technically proficient who is he who is he beat what are his biggest wins well that last guy Armand Tarts are you Keon that guy that he beat is really young kid he's like 20 and he's a fucking phenom - that guy's a future world champion as well you talk to anyone around a.k they'll tell you this guy's that a K - oh yeah no trains out with all could be be this guy right here yeah and yeah him and khabib go at it dude I've called some of his fights to form a test with them dude he's want to take Bobby down yeah good idea at least threatening Zombo combat world champion yeah but you don't want to come down I wonder you want to stay on your feet with Davi well think about yea big mistake Davi - is dobby's a goddamn tank I mean that guy's so strong he's explosive man look at the back on that motherfucker to me this is the best fight besides the main event me too the most intriguing fight yes I've been looking when I found out this was signed I was like oh did we talk about his arm bar in Abu Dhabi that flying armbar he did know I've seen it though amazing filthy oh dude he's so good he's so good and he's so dynamically so explosive who's the best right now in editing like straight Brazilian Jujitsu nauseous still marcelo garcia still the best he's still training and final I'm saying competition guys that are competing at like his booze Esch or like cyborg or those guys still doing the dishes fucking everybody up such bleep a pen yeah Gordon Ryan I love Gordon Ryan back from his knee surgery yep I love competing ready yep he just competed uh in some new quintet type of that's a good song dude his leg was ripped apart just like four months ago and that amazing oh yeah damn there's so many good guys right now dude there's so many fucking right as this has there ever been a better time for grappling oh it's really there's so many good guys dude they're all over the place and Craig Jones is not doing MMA right he's just fighting jiu-jitsu tournaments is that correct yes he's not doing he's one of the best - Craig Jones doing of course Gio Martinez right Tom PJ Darsh is one of my guys barch sorry I would say Barnes look he is fighting Raphael Lovato Lovato yeah Wow that's good we got a lot of bad motherfuckers at em planet that was just a super brown belt absolute tournament yesterday with all the best brown belts from around the world and in the finals both guys returned Planet gods Kyle babe and chase Hannah so whoo - planet in the house we may not be the best but we're trying do you know who nobody wants to fuck with and you don't hear much about them cuz just steamrolls everyone's Ryan Hall so it looks like if accountant but no one wants to fuck this managers trying to get him on the podcast I think you know he's a smart dude - great Ryan Hall is Ryan Wallace fuck reminds me a lot of Febreze Hoover Doom in the sense that a lot of jujitsu guys a lot of high-level juju so guys when they make the transition to MMA you know it's gonna take a while to get your striking together so a lot of guys come in they get it's just too rough and the striking is just they're just too far behind so they just say you know what fucking I'm gonna dip out and focus on jiu-jitsu I got plenty there's plenty of money and running jujitsu schools but then there's guys that stay and they get their striking together because if you don't if you you remember when farby Silverdome when he first started he wasn't that great his awkward yes wasn't that great he wasn't that great of an MMA fighter but he stuck it how he said he stuck it out and then little little dude is striking because he's legit and that's what's going on with Ryan Hall Ryan Hall he doesn't really need it well further when fuck I don't wanna good but that's why he's so good because his striking is they can't get a matchups they can't get close to Ryan Hall because no throw head kicks at you yeah he's throwing shit he's staying on the outside so Ryan Hall stuck it out he didn't quit he could've easily quit MMA and just said fuck it I'm running my jujitsu school and made you know 50k a month out he's stuck it out and now it's happening you're seeing the rise of Ryan Hall right kind of they can't get a matches there's no market it used to it's scary you know you just rip your fucking ankle off yeah because he does hate to take you down this fight is heating up Davi Ramos just clipped Islam with a big right hand oh did he yeah he's dangerous man hey back to her doom though for Doom top five of all time I think if you look at his record what he's gonna top five listen bill enough credit before his last few fights I would have put him at number one I had a number one loss when he beat when he became Velasquez you got to think okay here's a guy who be phaidor Nogueira and Cain Velasquez three of the greatest of all time submitted all of them I mean how do you how do you not have that guy people forget to when he fought Travis brown on Fox it was like the third fourth big Fox fight that was Travis brown in his prime I think Travis Frank like three in the world and ver doomed dis is Travis it's Travis Dunn have you talked to him no I don't mean him don't speak no I I don't know why I would but I think he works for a Ronda I think he did like man helps her with like her merchant stuff they're good man you know I'm saying I think yeah there's plenty of money there's no need to fight no I don't you get punched in the face but I I think with a Verdoux man he was people he was so good he's my favorite man in scar he was so nice in a while to get going it took him while I was a hard transition because when he first started five he surfer dude was like his striking was like oh shit I got it I gotta get this fight to the ground well he came in now he's a legit Muay Thai are you kidding me he's out Mark Hunt yeah with it he's amazing but you never went to knocked him out remember junior ko time with an uppercut one junior like burst on the scene yeah oh god I forgot about that uppercut that was Junior was an assassin when he was first fighting and then you're seeing that you're seeing that to another guy who didn't give up and it keeps pushing and little by little that strikings getting deadly Vinnie my girl ass BJ Penn on this job don't forget about bigoted Vinnie Michael s because that guy dude yeah he's oh shit Bobby Ramos has thrown some heat son he's looking for the takedown can he get it dude Vinny Magalhaes guard twice in the same night and and with two victories yup in that pfl when he's more he's a free guard twice in one night and so victory yeah you get lost in that finals you know what but money and dollar you know what he learned a lot from that dude he's it he's any dude have you seen him lately dude he sure right he's shredded he got his cardio too he's a scary dude you got it and he's he's like Bobby's he just keeps going he doesn't give up and little by little he's fucking knocking dudes Howard head kicks yeah you can't sleep on Vinny no he's elite how old is Vinny now I would say 34 so he's right there he burst on the UFC and just wasn't ready wasn't really that striking wasn't ready hit it his problem has always been cardio once and I always tell my co dude once you you conquer your cardio problem you're gonna be fuckin hard to deal with for anybody that was a good left hand the body by maka Jeff he's mixing it up that was a slick move he's been throwing them all the head and Dobby put his hands up and he went right to the ribcage this is a interesting fight man very it's not a cakewalk is this a second round yes they haven't been on the ground at all right no no I'd love for it to go the ground though no I mean both guys have tried to which is interesting that maka Jeff tried to bring it to the ground is it just Anakin Donna crews doing the Calcutta yeah just two man crew god anok go home kids go home to like my braces gig he loves it I don't think he was in China for for Zhang Wei Li oh did he catch him or was he going for a takedown it's hard to tell I was hard to tell there um how about Whaley's young or Zhang Wei Li like that chick yeah the one who just fucked up starts on Josh I didn't see the fight was it legit or the forty seconds of his rising striker watch killer managed the fucking sushi 2020 and one she's like 20 in a row she's a monster she caught her with a right hand hurt her and then finished Hiroshi and 1fc I don't she's being bitches up somewhere but she uh maybe maybe I gotta be honest I've never heard of her till then I was it going on Josh you're gonna steamroll oh really I've seen her fight I don't I don't solve women's fighting that deep she's fucking I don't know we need to change that didn't you get did people get mad at you when you're talking shit about the strawweight division I don't know I'm sure I don't care I have a fight show and then if it's kind of a fight it's like the lifestyle show not like others fight this weekend I know she is on Josh for the win that's our cover this is a but Davi Ramos is pushing the pace here I mean Davi is the one who's constantly moving forward here and he's he's trying to counter and throw these explosive bombs but it's la Miz using good footwork and good movement and you know what his right eye is cut yep nice movement there in the clinch da bees are just coming up short he's throwing that jab and then the big right hand but market chef is moving just enough away that's like fight IQ and he's popping that jab at him it's real technical fight very well then topic mocking chef fights man his his whole game is to and he's only 27 that's the other thing about maka czev dude that's why I think in the main event with khabib you know could be you a fuck around a little bit and play the ego game and strike with you mm-hmm I think his dad's in this corner now he's like way doing that we're not taking any of these risk and he listened to his dad well I think you need a full onslaught of khabib grappling it's also this fucking heat man Dominick Cruz has the hottest place on earth exactly what he said dureena good see Dhabi's he's swinging these punches but his entry is short he landed a hammer fist on his forehead how old is ramos 32 so it's lamas 27 Davi is 32 he's just like in his entry it's it's a lot of these guys particularly Jiu Jitsu guys the even if they develop power they don't necessarily spend a lot of time on footwork footwork is so crucial for your ability to move in and move out did you see Campbell versus Loma chenko yes whoo that's all footwork baby good fight though yeah Emma brought him yes he did that wasn't a cakewalk he's like work is overrated brought about footwork do what works everything that foot works everything you know one of the interesting things about watching a guy with really good footwork as you can see his opponent like doesn't necessarily know what how economy didn't get dropped them dude it dropped him and then he anyway takedown it was like good acting yeah well he was in the area it was like survival yeah the action but market chef definitely landed more that was a big shot though dobby's fucking dangerous man but look it's becoming more of a striking fight look out fucking he's out he's got his mouth open two men that's how hot it is in that joint I'd love to see him just grab can't understand why they don't have better AC do they have like those monsters that they have like a Universal Studios oh you're waiting in line how cool would that be well then everybody be greasiest and they'll be wet let me tear people's rappeling fuck they're all sweaty anyway man I mean how much wetter you gotta get nobody wants to see that shit on the ground anyways you're a bro standard bang OH hmm it's it's soaked Oh Oh God pound right that's that combat somló Grandin Pentagon damn son damn look he's going he's class son daughter he's my god he's going to London right there look at that let's see if he could pull anything off man I mean he's got to be exhausted right here yeah look Mike chap pulls right out pops right out of there so greasy yeah so greasy let's see if dobby can pull something off though he's gonna go for a try how many of these these guys traditional jujitsu guys are embracing rubber guard how many of them have come to you to try to learn some of this stuff because of the fact it's like the best thing to do when you're in a position with someone's really greasy you actually have control of your own leg and you can control someone's body and you know still it helps if they're not really people are coming around it's crazy I would imagine like this this is a not a bad idea but it's not as good yeah if you if you're still doubting if rubber guard is legit go to the Instagram rubber guard assassins go to that and and then just look at those clips and then tell me if it's legit that's a dope Instagram page rub assassin see I'm there every day yeah it's a reminder my spots I go to every day see what's up Callens on its way by the way allegedly pounds at the cheese store right now sniffing that was legs were shaking did you see his legs hit him right behind the ear dude his legs were vibrating yeah man ran that equilibrium that happened son yeah it does filthy though you know when Valentina Shevchenko head kick Jessica I dude she was down and out for so long and her legs were doing this little twitching thing like this here sound like a bat woof that girl Valentin Shevchenko you know I was talking to Gaston bolaños he came backstage to my show in San Francisco and we were talking and he said something I totally agree with he said she might have one of the highest IQs fight IQs in any division another female 100% hundred-percent she's so good she's so goddamn good she's setting her up with that body kick whack whack and then don't look at that right off the coconut he was shot on the bar on that left arm but look at the Russians left elbow not in a good spot for Davi he needs to get that elbow in before he goes it's Dobby a good guard player you know what I don't know he's known for strangling people and armbars shit his top games like high super high-level but right I haven't really seen him fight off his back yeah he's he's struggling here a little wrist control let's he was guy looking for the Kimura oh oh oh leg going through that was sneaky I like that setting him up for the Kimura on the right arm but going for the armbar on the left Hey Joe has Dominick Cruz talk to you about coming back and fighting yes he's on his way yeah yeah he's coming back he's trying to get a fight with Zack Udo triple C's great fight yeah and they're talking a lot of shit to each other but they're making other fight Benavidez he does that's what Dana said 25 yeah okay the only problem with that is like what if someone gets injured would have been if he didn't seats injured true so this is interesting right here because Davi has control of his leg and islam's on top of them not much time to work for Davi man not looking good yeah I think I think a decision loss well this is why you realize what Islam is a 401 sit I don't have to pay you 20 bucks today money down say $20 at all it's kind of fun in the moment why it's pay the money bro this is nonsense it's not fair people are watching - 400 people are watching let's just keep tabs what what does Davi do here Eddie tell me what to do if you were in Bobby's corner we should control that orchard dad orchard really is that hard to do on slippery folk dude dead orchard is the most common submission in jujitsu history a submission from your back in the history of jujitsu really there's more dead orchard arm bars than any other kind of arm bar from the garden any kind of style of grappling with dead orchard arm bars going on all day everywhere around the world there's a Instagram called dead orchard society dude they're everywhere and you don't see like regular traditional arm bars anywhere these days what was the last time you seen an arm bar from the guard in Abu Dhabi I could think of to Chandi Ribeiro he's got a good close guard armbar and Kron Gracie that's it that's a you never see arm bars from the car and this is Nathan orchards invention did he get really good at it you know he invented it yep it's amazing it's amazing when one guy finds a move that's so effective an orchard is a bad motherfucker dude is pain you know so pretty clearly Islam won this fight yeah yeah most excited see a ttle Nathan orchard just a little shout-out sorry about that who's running Portland that's Phil Schwarz that's another fucking monster dude we got monsters everywhere dude all over the world isn't it crazy all that should start out at the bomb squad yeah dude remember easy back in the day I got killers all over the goddamn world every day I wake up I'm like how the fuck did that happen you know who looks fucking great Ralph Ralph Ralph wearing look at you following Ralph's tenth planet Berlin oh cool dude I used to hate rolling with that guy he was way bigger back then too is really like he's leaned out he's shredded let me see the picture he posted 55 years old yeah full six-pack shredded back he's a super athlete and constantly working constantly training you know ralph was before the whole leglock revolution Ralph and Victor and Amir they were all training with csw and Josh Barnett yeah and Eric Paulson they were my leg lock guys lock crew my leg lock cruel I thought I was balls deep in the last time Viktor caught me he caught me with a hill hook those are my block guys and then when the leg lock revolution busted out I realized shit I'm not doing enough like I thought it was doing plenty with leg locks we were looking all the goddamn time in tenth planet but then once he bi took off and we realized oh shit I'm not doing enough leg locks I thought I was but I'm not so I fixed that shit was I do telling him what to say call somebody up right probably don't forget to thank the pain you ship right now no you don't know man you're home 20 bucks I don't give a fuck about that shit how come you're so aggressive about not paying you know I don't pay back what you know so nothing let me go back to you back since this is over Eddie because I'm very curious about I'm gonna poke you in them that has has anybody ever gotten that disc replacement thing and then gone into athletics gone back that's a good question I don't know I'm trying man cuz I you know all those little dudes Braulio is needed in there I'm trying to get my shit together because you know as when you're teaching jujitsu when you're teaching and you're not rolling there's a big difference man because if you're not rolling there's so much shit that you forget when you roll every time I'm rolling even it's like little blue belts and stuff I'm like oh I remember that little transition I gotta teach that oh I remember that one oh I don't remember this I remember that because if you're not rolling dude it's like you like if you're teaching and you're not rolling all your experience is just like plateaued that's it you don't you know you don't you can't it's so hard to evolve and progress if you're not rolling so man I'm just trying to roll just to keep my teaching evolving relative that's what yeah you know what it's really stop rolling dude you you're frozen it it's like it's like teaching a language but not talking exactly excites so important you gotta keep rolling so physically and I'm probably not supposed to be rolling but I'm a couple times a week like twice a week I roll and have you had your back looked at since you said that it's in pain I'm afraid you're afraid like some shits loose and I'm afraid I don't so if right now how do you feel right now like sitting there right now I'm fine doesn't hurt right now but what when it hurts is if I stand for too long remember back in the day of the comedy store when I would stand they go where's Eddie yet and Joe doll he's sitting down somewhere his backs fucked up I would have to I couldn't stand for over 15 minutes this was four years this is like we can stand it's early 2:30 ja let's say he's sitting down somewhere early two-thousands you couldn't stand yeah I can't I can't stand like in in one spot for more than like 15-20 minutes without my back freeze enough huh it's tough so when I'm puns I when I'm teaching now I'm teaching and if I'm just standing around teaching act like within a half an hour I got to sit down and start stretching my hamstrings because you get tired what do you know let me ask you this lamb if you strengthen all those muscles like significantly strengthen all these muscles in your back listen man this place is open to you anytime you want to use it there's a reverse hyper machine there's a bunch of back things I'll get to inflammation that I'm dealing with it's not it's understand weak muscles it's inflammation I understand but some of that can be mitigated by these machines into killers no no fuck that I'm this and then the other thing is sauna anytime you want to use the sauna here go sit in that sauna that'll reduce inflammation big time you know what cryo most is when I jump in a pool and I swim take the weight off of it it's like a it's like the coolness of the pool if I doing cardio in a pool dude when I'm doing sprints and I'm dead tired I'm on at the pool I'm gonna fucking pool and I'm be automatically being cooled ah in a pool it's the best for me like swimming is everything for me did you see that football player who win the cryo chamber and did it wear the booties and he stayed in the front yeah we're not about that right before the podcast oh really yeah the good the guy was his name's Antonio he got ya today cuz he's that asshole but he's the best player in the game and he junior okay she's brown right that's big therefore the best catch of all time the best catch in NFL history was by who the Giants retiree David Tyree no no no no oh no Beckham when he goes back with that one with one hand that's great like this but the home blade in the Super Bowl come on man no no that's the best catch in NFL history that's Odell Beckham any range jumper in case he gets cold inside in the fighting fan experience a Blair Serena specifically for UFC events well who are some ones in you they're gonna take someone and drag them into the woods with a camel I'll do the sand they might make their own woods out there you know they make it rain there once a year once a week 52 times a year that's like they built their own islands - yeah yeah they did though that's a that's Dubai actually I has a crazy island that's shaped like like the world yeah like a palm tree but it has its like each one of them represents the different continents that's right yeah it's really kind of crazy some of them are melting right like the sand like the waters taking about these huge cribs I can't really fight nature do that hurricanes in that area I dunno I don't think so I think so did you hear people who are criticizing Tyler Perry because Tyler Perry sent a bunch of resources down to the Bahamas a bunch of supplies but he did it in his private jet he sent his own jet filled with products down and people like you know that's the height of celebrity ignorance you're using a private jet and it's contributing to global warming I'm like how you think do you think that they're gonna get these things down there listen people just said words UFC legend even words he's from the Bahamas yes and he's like he's trying to rally as many people as possible to help to go down there go to eat it's at thug jiu-jitsu thugs Instagram I thought you thug Jitsu on Instagram if you want to donate and help the people out is it a GoFundMe it's some kind of donation just dude have you seen the drone footage of that Island that her eyes go Island dude that's like a bomb got dropped there's Eve Wow look at that that's crazy that looks like there you go Doug Doug but it soo master drugs into master but it miss Florida right it went right past Florida yeah but it was on the way to Alabama according to Trump did you see that no whoo Trump drew like they told Trump Trump said that's on the way to Alabama and they like no it's not so he shows a map of the hurricane and then with a sharpie he had drawn a line when she headed towards Alabama he's like look look he's fainted like what the fuck are you talking about dude people were watch looking at the picture like Kyle kolinsky had it up on his howling howling at this like Trump just added a sharpie you just drew a class line it's classic but a Jamie didn't you say it may or may not be like against the law what he did oh yeah yeah it's like against the law to alter a federal forecast or something like that you know what the top bullshit I'm not gonna do if I'm doing that that's just fucking bullshit what does that on CNN don't shit on trombone oh I know on CNN they're all over Trump for that shit they need to shut the fuck up at CNN you know this enn Fox News is making fun of it too dude everybody everybody knows no look Eddie everyone was making fun of it he literally drew a lot it's just funny the guy didn't want to be proven wrong he said that was going to Alabama the forecasters did not say he was going out he missed it so hilarious so he took a piece of paper with the forecast and drew an extra line a little loop headed towards Alabama it's just funny look at the sharpie line please above will cease like look see I told you the forecast look have people around like dog down it they don't fly man there's some people are gonna see the people around him will not deny that he did it do you know do you know the island that got hit do you know that uh the conspiracy theory I don't know it's oh no this conspiracy and hurricane City yes Wow what are they Oh conspiracy they're so crazy and the epstein and all that shit so crazy no no with epilepsy nothing happening dude you guys gotta be open that fucking everything okay tell us about the hurricane Eddie never heard one of her Caen I believe in Epstein I believe in fucking a ton of stuff I don't know about you getting mad about Trump he's that's what got him he's a trump supporter very trying trying to fucking save this country and they're fucking crazy left is trying to fucking put transgenders in in elementary schools okay so that's you guys believe whatever the reason was simple simplified narrative that's right come on man pop it out there here we go Paul folder Paul founder Barboza to Paul Felder is a blacken lightweight he has the shorts to keep them behind tie pro yeah I don't know why anybody would wear shorts that are loose because it gives someone an opportunity to grab yes just mobility yeah why so many shorts mean you could grab them because people just do grab them it doesn't mean it's illegal it's illegal but they do okay but nobody grabs tights maybe someone grabs tight so you literally I'm all fucking tight to check out the list for the straps heads I'm gonna grab your tights that's what happened in metamoris - there was like a big fucking give us some bullshit ass legal shit going on with that like cuz I was wearing pants and coiler was wearing tights they said since you're you're wearing pants coiler can grab and I said okay if he could grab my pants I'm gonna grab his shorts no you can't grab shorts like he's grabbing my pants why can't I grab his shorts because the shorts are form-fitting and your pants are loose hey Jamie can you bring up Barbara's a few fights no it doesn't make any sense that's everything to try to get you to be crazy shit where I had to go at the very end I okay you could grab my motherfucking pants and I won't grab your fucking shorts it got to that is that how you left it damn like what grab my motherfucking pants because I'm trying to make it legal for him to grab my pants because they weren't form-fitting but I couldn't grab his shorts because they were formed Fitch you ever find out how bad his knee is bro his knee I don't never forget that sitting there walk because I was live I was right there I was watching you wrench his knees sideways I was just going oh I was thinking is gonna tap any second down it's going pop pop pop pop pop pop yeah he didn't tab that shit popped all over the place he's an animal any wind tap he's an animal the fact that you tap it's been tough for him Las Villas last for shark whinny bet that's be fake right no your ko'd who the fuck shark whinny who is shark whinny we can fight that's right bro what do you mean it's fake Barbaro's over-swinging he never headlining March 30 that's fake and now what I've got someone Bruce Buffer jacket whose shark Winnie that's the greatest jacket is it fake it's a fake its fake job yeah because this last fight he'd knocked out Dan hooker right is that real there's no guy named Dan hooker just engaged Kayode him in his last fight yeah so who's this kind of a Charlie Barboza someone fucking around someone fuck with Wikipedia and got us to say it they got us to enjoy it fella first lost felder lost both fight though bro he was hitting him with the switch k everything that was like literally like he was moving through time this kind of a crossroads for barboza you look at his kind of you know I'm saying it's for felt or two men Felder got beat by Mike Perry broke his arm had to get his arm bolted together again was that his last fight that's this last fight right Mike Perry Felder's gonna be fine those accommodator oh he's a great comment I love musica his mind is so sharp - not having any problems at all and he's got a fucking chin like a piece of rock he also examine description a piece of rock well I saw it too last night I was it fucking legit man was it the ending little dicey Stephen King oh it sucked from who I don't know always saying people that hated Dave Chappelle's comedies yeah repels comedy special yes who did the crystal show me did you hear with social media no no no critics this is what happened it's ridiculous on Rotten Tomatoes it was so good so good the critics put it on rock they put it on Rotten Tomatoes and Rotten Tomatoes only left five critics judge it and they gave it a 0% they didn't have it open to the public and people were furious and they were okay here we go the fight started then they open it up to the public you got 99% which party nothing gets repelled crush that shit course it's Dave Chappelle so Paul Felder ooh look at that right away but hey barbozza finish it that low calf kick and then oh my rings it's tiring was it because of that LBGT bit oh yeah that's a lot of it Felder just top just touched him with OJ there's that switch kick he's always trying to go over the judges are they that switch kick that Barbosa throws is the best in the game his switch kick to the body is fucking insane dude Barboza's can is way better than Felder's it's a lot better look at that tan filters that Philly white boy God is putting that fucking pressure on him huh look at that that low calf kick Felder's throwing Heat Barbosa has a speed advantage for sure oh yeah for short but he hasn't over almost everybody he's so fast but they ever on slows down first fight I don't know I don't think so I think it was mostly a lot of this that'd be tragedy founders not taking anybody down he cracks with everybody look at this those trying trying to take him down he might just be threatening and also kiss hot as fuck out there he's trying to wear him out mmm I don't think it's that hot out there man I think you blown it out of proportion well Dominick Cruz sounds 120 oh there's blood if someone's got blood look it's all over barbosa's left arm is Felder cut hashtag in abu-dhabi nice where's that it's right down there that's important to them the ring looks a goddamn NASCAR Oh in the ring okay Oh who left took over the top where is the boo that leg kick and again hot damn fathers eat nose checked it though Oh left hand roll what he's gonna drop it so was getting knocked out well felt the left hook connect son Felder is bound and determined to get this back and after he got K owned by gage he he thinks at barbozza is ripe for the picking I think it's fair thinking who got knocked out by gauging Barboza did he did guard JG starched him right to him and pounded his face with the right hand and they're doing Goethe Cowboys what do you think about the fight night okay so Felder's cut and it looks like he's cut on the forehead there's nothing oh fucking switch to the bottle we checked that one though yes how you do weird is that no no it's not we get the body shutting out Landis what are you doing you can you certainly can dude look at the look at his fucking ribs now yeah but the way he checked it it was this Shin slam right into the thick heavy part of the bone above the knee or below the knee that's where Chris Weidman broke Anderson Silva's leg dude that's a disadvantage on the skin color like Bill burr anything that hits so you say sandy got head-butted he's saying he got head-butted he's shaking his head what does he say what is he saying what is he saying are they gonna bring a doctor in here he was talking that was that's so weird what is he saying hey it's above it so I was checking the cactus coming into his eyes I'm not really that's a fine cut I don't get it what's going on let's see what happened thank hundred percent headbutt 100 percent right there so what are they gonna say they're just gonna let him fight but I don't understand why he took that little break this one to check I think I wanted to let everybody know that it was a head but I think herb wanted to check on it to the prop but he was he was motioning to got it checked alleged thing he was alerting herb herb oh my god I'm telling me a fella can land that fucking left man well Barbosa is almost purely a stand-up yeah when you're almost purely a stand-up fighter chose Felder and you've had a few knockouts people bar both is still a purple belt I don't know I don't know what is jujitsu it's got to be a black belt by now you think so he's gotta be doing for me but in the mix for like eight years he's threatening with a spin under Ricardo meat all right if you look at his hips he's looking a spin you see that right hip he keeps he keeps setting up with his right hip hoodoo had a better wheel kick turn that mother he's got the atom remember that was the first ever wheel kick ko in the UFC he's got the best switch kick for sure I've never seen a swimmer at her ever never see even in my time never speak and it's also powerful man you ever see when Mark Henry's holding pads for him and he hits that switch kick it's like crack like a baseball bat call rack he's feeling good now he's he saw the blood it's a fun fight running down fielder's face he's feeling good now yeah Felder's in an interesting situation cuz he's a fuckin dangerous guy for sure he's a tough fight for anybody but his face is busted but uh but can he be a world champion you know and if he can't is he going to eventually just step back and just commentate ooh I would imagine if let's say he gets kicked ko'd in this I would imagine it goes through his head too well I could probably just become data I fish those are hurt his leg right there I don't like the way he wobbled after her fell to check that kick I think Barboza's right legs in a little bit of trouble because he wobbled and I don't like how he's moving which leg just right legs right leg yeah he threw a kick and Felder checked it perfectly and Barboza had that little oh fuck I hurt my shin wobble and now he hasn't thrown it he's moving away even 10ms something Wow look at them if you seasoned Muay Thai professional fighters can they still get like like kick out like no like like can they get their leg kick checked and it hurts yes so it still hurts it still get to the point where it doesn't hurt no more because the nerves are dead right no no it's always the muscle but there's all t-shirt around Anna trees but there's all this stuff for banana trees are easy dude I could kick the fuck out of a banana tree Muay Thai fighters will still feel pain in their shit they need to know most of it they feel on the outside of the shin the bone the shin gets what's called calcified right so you have these micro fractures that are happening all over your shin as your clashing shins and hitting heavy bags and hitting sandbags and all that shit gets dead but what doesn't get dead is all this shit around it so when he had hot on that yes all that can toot like here like this kind of shit here and I always thought is there a point where your leg is just like doesn't feel shit well your leg meat leg up here up top there's always always vulnerable particularly like Ernesto Hoost he used to target right above the knees if you get hit in the right spot yeah it hurts yeah especially a guy like who's good god yeah like more poses such a Oh leg kick asaurus he's such a monster with his leg kicks there's that that's wish leave that switch there's lighting ribs up he's checking it though and every time he checks it Barboza's gonna step back cuz you can snap your fucking chin and he's checking it with his knee that's it - yeah it could be honest yeah I can't wait what happened that was two hours quit the body felt it with a kick to the body Seefeld was like one step behind I think if you're gonna beat Barbosa like the way gait she did it you got to literally throw yourself and so did Kevin Lee like you get you gotta wrestle you can't sit here and play this well if you do sit here and play this game you got to do it the way gait she does get up she goes out he runs into the fire look he's made out of asbestos he just fucking throws himself into it he makes it a fucking brawn yeah he makes it a home outside of trade with you can't sit on that exactly exactly so this is Barbara see now great double look at this he wants to steal this round yeah Paul's lighting them up with some elbows down there and fell though Felder's double great oh oh but it doesn't matter he's dope though winning the round he does matter just if the round hole wins it doesn't matter if I open him up bad it doesn't matter if the round ends now but it's three minutes to go 330 to go I don't know madam when did he cut him from the bottom yes Susan went down there elbow oh oh shit everything fell there play guard the actor come sit down aka the actor where's your wine you want some whiskey where's the cheese you want some whiskey be little whiskey like what Bland's oh you still respond from acting I do didn't you wipe it on looks good you should hire someone to do that all day I know you have to watch you up dude I have a sheen and tight skin dude yes home bar from the bottom Villa fell there's a bad motherfucker man look at this this is a bloodbath it is a blood I'm gonna say a lot of like stuff that you know just generally how bad bet Barboza's leaking bottom fuck your mum man look at baby there you go thanks you're the best buddy you push her a bit of a pusher no this is what you join the fun this is this is the second round I was at this is the best fight of the card so far it's tuna made he's a mouse behind his fucking here yeah look at that man good God oh right hand Barboza's having a hard time seeing this is gay i odd the beds at the gate side of the first fight and he had such red welts on his body from Felder looks like such an Alan that I don't know if this is from the first fight I was there for the first was that one a camera but I could hear it go yeah say you want to travel how is it that all this blood starting when a savage walks in the room how weird is it Oh a savage like Brian you walk in and all blood spills Oh Felder just caught him that was a hard shot dude felt Felder's about to win this fight third round roses getting hot he's melting oh oh look at this felled is coming on strong yeah why 24 to go

you think like that but you're alive and you're looking great thank you I appreciate that I like your hair thank you you look the youngest out of the four of us what is you do I thought you but now Brendan yeah baby yeah baby not real dirty shit you've got a comedy career now like at 47 started comedy again I don't know how the fuck I'm doing last time I saw last time I saw you at the store you made me laugh hard I laugh a bunch of times thank you this story about you getting laid for the first time that is a fucking hilarious story did you try it before Eddie before this no I did I did some like before tenth planet jiu-jitsu was even a thought I was hanging out with Joe at the Comedy Store every goddamn weekend he was in town and if he wasn't in town and he was on the road I'm like hanging out with Joe so I was balls-deep in the comedy scene and I did some open mikes a little bit here and there but I realized back then that stand-up comedy was like a martial art it's like you have to spend a lot of time onstage getting good at times beyond the public speaking experience and the public speaking skills that's the most important thing you don't even have to be fucking funny to be a successful comic you decide to be confident on stage and have public but listen that's just because they're famous yeah the famous my point my point is that public speaking experience and those skills are crucial and I didn't have him back then I was I was horrible at public speaking experience why they should yeah why do they want to show that bra are they highlighting this dance well this they did while Dylan dance to talk shit do did you have to fight in the interview with Bret Okimoto no he goes oh it's not over he goes do you know everyone wants say oh it's for the fight he was not for me I see him which were basically fucking him up he was it will never be over whoa he said he goes he was people--they you know because they'll it's a sport and we fight in the cages it's bigger than it'll never be over and then we fight Conor McGregor absolutely never happened he was but if I see him outside of it we'll fight and you know how certain guys hype things up he's in his fucking boxers in his uh you know in his hotel room he's just dead serious shake Jesus that's why he's so good who the fuck is as good as could be when you're looking at a guy who's like what is he 28 and oh I mean what is khabees record 27 and only eight twenty seven twenty eight twenty eight twenty eight twenty eighteen oh fuck the best in the world mauled everyone and what he did when he what he did is like just like you see right now it's being publicized and so it's like it's not going to deter him from doing it again no you know I mean they're just showing the shit out of it right now well you know a will Harris from will Harris Productions is the one who filmed Connor throwing that dolly at the at the bus okay the UFC asked for it and he's like yeah yeah you could look at the footage but thought he was gonna get credit you didn't get any credit like will Harris anatomy of a fighter it's a fucking phenomenal you could do two great guy pod casts he goes over to Abu Dhabi he goes over to Dagestan yeah those guys Halle dude he gets the best footage he has the best footage fight foot injury training footage like inside behind-the-scenes footage of anybody and he didn't he like yeah but because he thought they would show it as like a news piece meanwhile every fucking promo for the fight was that dolly yeah that will film and thrown at the bus like he would have paid two million dollars for that right the worst shit that Connor did was the thing that they used to sell the fight literally a felony yeah I mean he's like people got gotta go it's a glass and cheese yeah tell you right now I'm going to say something right now I I believes can be general I believe that very little real these guys from a russian republic but now it's an independent and there you know what they're athletes no um I'm gonna say this and the jab is money I got my money I'm Dustin Poirier whoa how much money I kind of do this and let's see if we can move the money around here because patios branded $20 and he's never gonna pay so maybe eventually eventually I'll pay maybe that Rendon and if it's a wash if you win you'll let Eddie I just think that I just think that if if khabib tries to trade with Dustin Dustin is Cuba could be one of them best strikers period oh listen he proved that in the max Holloway from no question and he's got real mad hard real power and just engage he fight all but also the other rats fine the other thing why I like pouring a little bit in this as a dog is because if you watch that Justin Katy fight where gage is just applying pressure pressure pressure Dustin really doesn't fade he plays that game right but nobody has taken dust and down Maldon on the ground and that is the difference correct question is gonna be whether or not could be you can take him here's my question how did I want to keep khabib from taking him down how did he do what didn't Kibby definitely took him down but Iaquinta is a back his backgrounds as a wrestler yeah he's looked all of us but i but gage he never liked first of all Katie never fought khabib and gage he I'm saying with Dutch doesn't try to take guys down even though gage he's a wrestler he's also fucking 100% savage and that guy just throws himself into the fire but with you know a lot of people think he's definitely wild but it's a controlled wildness it's intelligent wild rice so here we go champion versus champion I think the UFC has to be very careful with this whole interim champion stuff because they take him away from people like Colby like this there's talk right now if Colby not getting the fight versus Usman and Colby says they're not offering them enough money and it's gonna be in New York State and apparently there's a lot of taxes that come Tony with fighting the same with Tony Tony's even more well they're both egregious because Tony got injured in doing promo right accidentally not his fault they stripped him I like the way he's running toward the fucking cage sorry to interrupt you keep calling well guys he's to expand well to let this moment over shy he's nice you know on paper could be this is definitely gonna win on paper but khabees never launched all around him guys just gonna fuck him eyes the doll Askren don't forget about that don't forget about that shit well my shit could happen uh what he said every person different but I had Maz of dullness I thought Maz vidal's gonna win that's a tough fight for Ben regardless same dimension would you say aspirin and khabib are in the same dimension better strike they take people down and they mall no but once a freestyle wrestler one guy's ass on but it's a little different okay okay I see what you're saying what you're saying on paper but I think the offenses khabib has way better striking than Ben wait but he's also another freestyle you know double leg super far out like he also smashes people punches and drops Connor and Maas vidal's set up oh yeah oh no the plan was to run Adam and throw a flying knee how do you set that up you set it up with doing the opposite where did he do we put his hands behind his back she leaned against the fence he did the opposite in fucking mind fuck Askren and then boom he bolted at him and not just bolted first a ring first he went to his right and then he comes in the opposite yeah does the opposite of what he wanted to do right that's fight IQ mazepa dollars is high a fight IQ as anybody in the movie he's happy to be I was the executive producer I would Schleich it this is a life's work guys don't talk over Eddie this is a life's work days waited for this moment feels creaming in this pants right now at home I mean he's he is literally happy to be here that's a huge sign of me well how can you not be skinned hey he's got Mike Brown in this corner I don't don't live this one's your peas if I say pussy if you wait this one oh you Pig who's that hahaha I go down my rarest style haha who's that here comes kabhi boy I would like to hear it Jamie can we give us some volume so we hear how crazy everybody goes nuts this is a big arena life is taken with it's not a big arena at all that is true like sixteen thousand capacity I think you should have the ability to do whatever the fuck you want to do with the UFC yeah you should but youtube doesn't pay I get you Angus fuck I get you I'll get I've had my shit taken down off of Facebook I've had my shit taken down off of Instagram has this proposed ever while you work for the UFC set you down and say you can't do this or that never know what about the companion show where they maybe chill out on though they love it Dana wants me to do a companion for Tuesday night contender series so like he's like mine do one for those I'm like maybe we will one night you know for fun if we're around I'm down for that look to some great fun do one for winter series and a lot of those guys eventually become like legit contenders there's some really good guys Canada yeah we should do that we should do a Tuesday night contender series fight competing for boxing no the UFC Yosi as fucking spike dude good luck finding my head the protection yes from that stops did you ready bet did you and Eddie bet on this but yeah you know hey Dustin's a friend of mine guys I'll through I'll throw the money in just for a goof I'll throw a hundred in on the on the Russian yeah he's got his he's got his I want to see your money I got it right here but let's put it on the table it's sitting right here dude he's wiping off his armpits listen it's not that I don't love Dustin Poirier but I do love action yeah I love that Hey look at me look at me after all here's a hundred okay right there oh wow your money down okay you boys run long cash was gonna back you but I spent last night all right it's okay we're all right I'll end up the money I'm gambling into myself this is good because this way I'm basically either giving Brian money or not so it's not like I'm gambling against Dustin who I love Habib is rather rather Jack more than usual in my opinion no that's what he looks like all right always looks I'd like to create a little drama I'm sorry the big thing the big thing is his father in his corner in the back to me that's the game changer his father can't come to the UFC here's the female because you can't get a visa the but and here's the other thing is khabib will listen to his father if you if you watch the the I Quinta fight when Javier's tell him what to do he's just like yeah whatever dude and does his thing his dad talks he listens so if his dad goes hey bitch quit fuckin throwing hands take him down he's gonna take him yeah here he goes motherfucker that crime must be going crazy I mean even think about how many people are Muslim in the world that competi this guy is the guy he might be the most popular Muslim athlete on earth I think internationally he's probably the most famous right we'll be UFC fighter international how many millions of followers yet does he have on Instagram too that's good no no no he's like 26 million no way how many is it on Instagram 26 Jimmy's gonna find I'm gonna say seven I'm gonna say ten they're gonna say sixteen million that's weird is that official 16 million but do you understand the before fuck Connor he had like one but not even one how many does Connor have thirty or does he have Beyonce I looked at just observe her the other day Heller 118 million my god Trump canto xxxii now no Selena Gomez says the minors good 32 Selena Gomez khabib is a way bigger star than Connor khabib comes dagestan it's where like the Nationals the Turks it's like justice the Ottomans that would you say yes everybody converged Lena Gomez says 156 million number 116 and could be but 16 million and Connor Energy 1.70 Connors got double Connors that big Connors a super Connors like celebrity beyond saying no way do you think there's a fake do you think that Selena Gomez wants a faker they little kids they love their kids the the toy people think girls have the most follow I have no idea I don't know one Selena Gomez song do you do you know one song no I might want to go to bed too and wake up name one name one no I can't name I can sing them beyond that can name a couple well we're out of this fucking yeah yeah we just talked about oh we are that's a Destiny's Child song okay maybe I don't know anything beyond saying yeah right Mariana in Auto actually has a hundred and eighty two million who does cristiano ronaldo cristiano ronaldo messi mercy yeah that sounds like a girl crystianna 102 from Messi like bacon again Renaldo's like a celebrity dates hot chicks and their look at him talks Messi has 130 Jesus Christ how many how many does LeBron have 14 no yeah this at 56 minutes the rock 76 156 for the rock at 156 the Instagram account is 312 million but no one air account no one does Twitter know wait a min who is there can the Instagram account and thoroughness in 3 163 for ariana grande yeah who can we got that's good keep it low keep it low stand on the radar it's funny how that's low now I was like I know used to be a big deal right remember when um when a structure was in a competition with somebody to see who hit a million Twitter followers no that's a while it's a big deal CNN CNN and Ashton Kutcher well on petition see it's a DNN yeah that's so these guys get down to 50 I think so cubby box trying it was to 200 Luke Rockhold told me he's like probably walking around at 200 pounds no way he's training yeah he's eating bad yeah just everything that moved he's definitely thick but he's never not to hunt out lean when he's at 200 I think about it's gots to close right there here we go baby here we go whoo boy it looks everyone looks sweaty yeah super shiny that's how it's fucking their bad let's go around the table Eddie Bravo what's up on paper could be takes this I hope he wins only because it would be like a monstrous fight between him and Tony ooh but you can't count Dustin out you know he could throw a flying me but you gotta be at gym if I had a gun to the head that gun to the head I'll go could be that's the safe I'm not gonna be surprised if Dustin drops him I'm gonna say poor a third round KO and then fights Conor McGregor for a five gallon we think I'm going that I love Kippy I'm good I think Emporia drops him in what rounded in the fourth round type move and I think and I think he's gonna fight Wow okay well you just said exactly how do those go Brian I'm glad you asked what were the lines no no no fuck those lines here we go we're about to do this yeah please [Music] knowing note how I've cleverly avoided making a prediction that's let's move on you can't make predict you have to [Music] interesting about Dustin is Dustin southpaw with a fucking nasty straight left hand yeah and great combos although he did fight Connor was also southpaw that's a wild cousins got much longer arms got better kicks Dustin also has hip issues he's had some pretty significant wear and tear on his hip he's a black belt on the ground but I don't think khabib gives a flying fuck that sends a black boss no Tim crater I believe there's a branding partners were guys like you know Robbie Lawler etc before a lot well Robbie went left ATT Cobra notice up right away doesn't he be stayin on the outside Habib is avoiding the kicks he's staying away from dust and striking length because Dustin striking light is a boxing length right so Dustin's forced to throw kicks which he doesn't necessarily prefer so when he's throwing those kicks Kabir's caught a couple of them or any or caught one of them at least but he's avoided the kicks but see the distance yeah look at the distance seems khabib is staying outside the striking range and looking for that opening for the shot see see Dustin's forced to throw kicks but he's not a kicker it's not a shit especially with a bad hip and so khabib look at this shot document here's the Dustin snow punk with his takedown defense men right but he's never seen anybody like to be never fought anybody that's that good but here he goes but the other thing is even f khabib doesn't take you down the draining he drained the entire Tula he died like this a lot of energy for tired though really yeah really I Quinta come Gregor fights he takes rounds off comes the Chris trait yeah the Molly monkey stand up the Molly Brown's not quite not quite yet no Dustin's very bad for Dustin very bad he might get smashed here oh look a pulls his face like that he's actually got fingers on his eyes I got bears at her toys that's but my hundred dollars you know it's crazy you know what's crazy is that oh my god it's over it's over he's gonna use that focus wrap no it's not over that was close to being over someone here's a jiu-jitsu coach to be sideways like not where he wants to be but sideways no no he's he's in a good spot against the cage right here this cage face man look he's actually using the cage to defend the rear naked choke cuz he's got that he doesn't have the angle see how he's sideways he's using that cage it's it's so good I just could have been done any worse for Gustus my beer this might be it Dustin's trying he's trying to survive man he's just realize that more people haven't adopted always been it's nasty no thank you survives it's doesn't survive standing standing standing don't count him out damn that was so close you just ask for your money back I don't remember you're off the train I don't know why did that separate the hands taken down just to separate the hands never turn your back on I think he's just trying to separate the hands all right okay you just try to face they got a minute left let's fucking go come on just just be cool he might just try to wear this out or ride this out he's gonna survive to the second round for sure he was a minute to go man anything can happen it's gonna take just keep standing up you know he's gonna get slammed right now he controls us here there's no one better man he's the best he's a mall or bus the best fucking wrestles with his hands were close which is not gonna work it's not gonna work now he's mounted man now he's mounted this is no bueno only 20 seconds but no bueno no he's good Connor chilled here in the mouth remember yeah but listen this is Lieb really don't do work this is a different fight it's entirely possible that khabib could get him here look at this just boom boom boom oh good so much time this ain't good ten seconds five four three two that was yeah he survives he's not a mark on this is gonna happen Emporium on a third fourth round man yep if he can make it third fourth round fucking monster guys but that's it that you gotta walk through the fire to get to that third fourth round man yes yes I hope he gets tired from whoopin your ass he's done he's done that third and fourth round he was telling Barbosa come on man you know his different animal but they but they know Dustin knows this heap listen his fucking how many fights 40 fights been the game for so long man yeah he's been down he's been up he knows how to lose he's not gonna freak out he's lost before and bounce back it's not shitting his pants he's a fucking full veteran he's a full veteran he's fine I mean he's he's not a guy that's gonna get broken at this stage of his life I've beaten Kippy Eve in front of hots are not good in front of Russia sir in front of Russia what I'm saying is that Russia's watch here we go just watch here we go well now you know Dustin's gonna want to avoid going the ground at all costs lower stance now and then avoiding the distance that's how he's still with those kicks man I think he waits for khabib to come in I would say avoid those kicks and just go Jesus look at that oh my god he got clipped do you have the problem about khabib is the strikings not terrible and just show worried about the takedown remember yeah please drop two other guys too it's like he's [Music] he can't get crazy now he can't get crazy because he'll run into a takedown could be might be in trouble here shit Dustin's tired Dustin's tie him for a minute it's also 100 and fucking 20 degree heat index inside I know he got so tired like it that something happened damn totally Adam right there what he means something happened he just you know put his energy out there trying to finish him can it hurt him well he got real wild you got real wild doesn't ask you out early in the second round why does he have to get wild when you write but he clipped him and hurt him he could just do that again he could just stay technical and keep it on the outside which where I think he has an advantage I don't think his wildness was the result of this takedown no taking the time but the wildness leads to you being exhausted but they're both big punches exhausted tired but but khabib is more efficient at doing this yes he Clips your fucking legs he's crosses your legs I got curls and no one's figured they're the scouts cross he looks like that no is that a move when camps did you go to is that like a merit badge I want to talk about it when I was younger I was dressed up under girls it's how I got myself through college all right all right here we go it's gonna be 2 minutes and 30 seconds of this Dustin just has to kind of hopefully capitalize on those little moments he's resting here he's kind of rest he survives here and then tries it again they're bored he just got to survive this case he's gonna get another shot you know it's really dependent upon what kind of recovery he can have how he's dealing with the heat and how what kind of God he gave his back up again but if he's gonna stand up and then use and then look he's bleeding around his left eye he's relaxed he's relaxing that's a bad cut this isn't a place to relax though to beat those face and Maggie's gonna get that left under hook and he's fine oh you gotta do is just pull that left under hook out and it's good pulled I love oh you didn't get it back there you go under hooks that pressure dude could be got serious pressures the head pressures pressure and the way he dips his body down he's in deep though do doughnuts well his head belongs on Broadway for khabees got the biggest head got up to his feet oh maybe roll I'll just keep getting up it's just kill time it's a minute just kill this is killing time for Dustin for another shot to get that smart another shot yes your best bet smart smart just running he does not a neck dude there's no way he's gonna kill it no your wish imagine if he did the only way you could guillotine them is if Dustin is known for a hellacious guillotine about to shit that I bet he's got a hellacious Darce is Darcis franchise good I'm liking this right with it man doesn't give you any breath he can't dude he should have just ran at that point like ran as soon as a separation run trip 19 not enough time is good 17 16 I'm telling you Dustin's not taking a lot of damage he might be tired but he's not taking as much damage as he could yeah aren't you an actor you got hit with a big knee there man who did Dustin did oh two rounds of fury look at this god damn he's tired for sure of course he tired is usually a tough time for him I'll say this though it's kind of impressive what Connor did coming back up that long way off cuz we see what he's doing the Dustin doesn't everybody I'm just saying for what cut it you know he did defend a few takedown you know what I see Dustin like like this is the game plan where I'm out hundred pounds Tyler said to survive survive survive stands a hundred percent dangerous he's in the mix right and you knock you out I would love to be listening to Mike Brown's coaching you know what if he takes you down just survive so I love my heard him he heard him oh shit another shot yeah the thing is you go looking for that job Duff you got to go serve ative looking for those shots you got to be real conservative Tom champion want to win if you want to win you gotta get wild just look at everything else here we go every beginning of every round is the time to knock him out and once you get shot on okay just survive that two chains in the crowd how the fuck did that happen two changes there look look it is how do you know what two chains look sorry I don't know what is that what'd you say Jamie sit next to Dana is he to James's what is to chain he's a rapper oh really he debated Nancy Grace about marijuana he hasn't been hot for a second but maybe that's why he's certainly tired you know he's certainly tired he's looking for like a problem and this is it Oh dougie oh it's tight yeah that's time oh he's rolling nose back dude is he gonna put him to sleep oh my god no we're right about this no it's time no I lost it he lost they're still in it no he lost it don't be though now you pissed khabib off he trying to take a little go that guillotine you tug on his neck you tugged on the Bears neck now he's gonna fuck you up look at his dad right there's nothing moves on his face makes you think look of elite Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt gets him in a position like that as he's trying to take him down he's an elite Brazilian she's a black belt hey no I got Bobby ROM no no no no you know you know who I think has the style to beat kabhi boo Tony Bryan Ortega or Tony Ferguson but briar take as far as his neck attacks but the thing about Tony oh oh oh here's that fulcrum truck oh this might be it nope nope totally cubes the fight all day I see I disagree with Brian are tell you because he's too small he's 145 pounder he's a huge 45 Ferguson is the man khabib he's a goddamn monster now dude yeah oh he could be look at this even could be said that the khabib is a goddamn monster what's he doing is he hugging his dad where is he running into the crowd for what they can let go did you go to hug his dad yeah yeah oh it's not Dana oh look at that man that's amazing he's hugging everybody Wow he's humping people too I think they're jumping up and down with him that's his dad I think is with the white hair we went we went out on a limb Brian it made it fun it made it fun but he's oh my god money - four hundred you gotta take your money look at this 400 for a reason mind I loaned you 100 you owe it to me poor poor Abe made it fun though for LA certainly dead that's what you got to do man great great oh that's that's his dad so that wasn't his dad that he was jumping around with there was somebody else his dad good guy good fight great guy great guy look at that look at that beautiful sportsmanship I think it Biebs only gonna do two more beautiful that's what it sounds like two more he's not interested in the long game well who Ferguson then who else I don't know he wants GSP just be wants the fight was just amazing man amazing what a man that's it it's Tony khabib that's it oh that's it that's the only so now here's the difference here's the difference in Myers Tony Ferguson does not get tired never gets tired tired doesn't matter if you take him down he's a scrambling motherfucker and he can cut you up with elbows from the ground and he's got Darcis from every everywhere dude he's got long arms he just fucked one little mistake and you're in a darson it's over yeah Tony G with triangles Darcis guillotines you name it he can hit you with his elbows from the back and here's the biggest differences Tony does not get tired Tony's want the older fighters who do bomb same from round one he's even better in four he's the only guy that we know who gets better than more you you've trained with him you've been in his camp what the fuck does he do to have that kind of endurance he just he is his uh you know my son is seven and he like he loves baseball and he came at me with some fucking Vince Lombardi quote did like some Michael Jordan shit one day we were walking to baseball practice and and my son's a savage dude and he and I said how do you like baseball so far he said daddy you know practice is my favorite sport practice practice is my favorite sport you can look at our fucking wall that's pretty bright this is my favorite sketch you be my Sepulchre with that that's an amazing trailer fucking shit Jordan shit that's Tony Ferguson shit that's a t-shirt Tony Ferguson he loves training did he loves what is it but what does he do specific he doesn't have been in his camp what does he what is his schedule like just cardio all day what kind of car do the the traditional shit and then he makes up shit okay starts off in the morning how does he start off in the morning you know what he does he's I don't know his exact schedule but when you've been there wouldn't you know give me a typical day I can Big Bear when you guys go to bake there he's sprinting doing all sorts of like like football calisthenics type stuff ladder drills like all sorts of shit Becky's mama loves training that's his secret weapon he fucking loves it he wants to train all day he just that's that's what heat like um when he's not training for a fight he eats like anybody else know when he's trained tacos burritos he don't give a fuck he'll blow up to like 185 when he's training about when he's training he's a fucking machine dude he's a machine he's just it's like all the best shit and he trained like when you're eating with him what's eating I don't need with them cuz I eat some bullshit I'll go to in and out you know what I mean he ain't going nowhere off on your own path yeah he's prepped everything's meal prepped him and his wife they're like him dude he just eats like a savage he's just he doesn't put the hat on John annek he always puts that shit on no he does it to you man Oh respect hey Jamie can you hear what he's saying is he calling anybody out yeah let's give it some volume I'm assuming he's gonna called Tony out let's hear this yeah maybe I can get permission from the UFC to play volume in the background no that would be dope why not come on he would really shouldn't fuck you for that that's not that it's just thinking here results here we go he is just saying how much respect he has for Dustin respect people can't hear this but he's he's saying respect respect teammates respect gym coaches keep cleaning your gym he's just a class he's wearing doesn't wear a shirt he is wearing Dustin Poirier beautiful that that makes me tear up he's wearing Dustin's fucking he's amazing he's an amazing human being beat is incredible I beat the nice guy in the world the guy's amazing that really is incredible 17 oh he's got 12 wins just below George st. Pierre's 13 look at these killers behind him all those dudes look at this dad yeah tough fucking into everything he goes right now he's speaking now in his life you ever hear when they were asking about the Conor McGregor stuff like jump in the crowd and he goes I gotta see my dad he's not apologized to my dad I gotta go home and see how my dad his dad price slaps I'm really talking shit John an exert a third it here we go here we go [Music] give me a couple days to think about it fat ass yeah good for him John Eric does the best post fight interviews in the game very clear-cut is the best so good so good at it I don't like doing them this should make him do him oh god who the fuck I mean Tony FERS the only guy can compete dis amazing a lifetime of discipline amazing well was it Dustin after let's hear this where's Dustin go from here I mean goes right back to the drawing board is a good fight keep it cranking up Jamie crank it higher come on Dustin everybody cheers it's under respect man for beautiful man people came from all around the world for that fight he's such a great dude now yeah he's just dealing with the aftermath to the shit all right let's kill that Jamie I love this this makes me more excited than ever for Tony Ferguson fight because I think he plays a gigantic factor and any could be fight and I think that is one fuckin tool that Tony Ferguson has in his box that very few people have the kind of endurance that that guy has it's almost superhuman Ferguson yeah almost superhuman yeah and also he's so good at rolling like you don't you don't just take Tony down it's not like you shoot and he resists and then boom he's on his back when you shoot Tony goes with you transition roles with and when you should she rambles are sisters yes Carolee train sir get in there he'll throw them at every angle remember when he'd ARS Magna 99.9% of fighters out there don't see Darcis look like Tony does Tony sees him at every that's the fire man he could be inside control in a fucking thrall mend and how about the fact that he fucking hit barboza with that shit when they were covered in blood and sweat yeah chaos man and coming off of this watching Dustin almost catch that guillotine one of Tony's strongest weapons is the fact that most fighters the boxers or MMA fighters or whatever their trainers will tell you the same thing though the goal is to take their performance in the gym and take it to the ring and most people can't do that most people fight their best at the gym they just can't take it to the the ring there's just too much pressure or whatever or they're just too cautious too much there's just so much pressure Tony does not have that problem the you could in it's any proves that time and time again when you look at like that when he throws like a spinning elbow yeah not only does will he throw a spinning elbow and not give a fuck but I'll throw two in a row dude that tells you right there he improvised this is weird he's a lot like Nate Diaz like Nate Diaz and like Nick Diaz what happens when they get in the ring is they don't give a fuck and they actually do perform like the in the ring like they do in the gym that's the biggest difference is remember remember Tommy Morrison his biggest thing was can we take what he does in the gym and take it to the ring in front of the world and he just he just couldn't do it on a consistent basis and most fighters that's the big problem can you do what you do under pressure under the whole world and tony has zero problems with that that's as big as especially now he goes out there and he keep dude he will improvise on the spot and do shit and throw caution to the wind even give a fuck that is why Tony is dangerous because he has no once it gets in the ring it's like there's no pressure what's like the pressures on you dude because I'm gonna come after you with everything so the pressure is on the earlier so he goes out there and he plays once Tony starts dancing it's over dude once he starts dancing and you see Tony just start doing crazy shit you're fucked has he ever lost yes to his last fought was too Johnson Michael Johnson because Michael Johnson broke his arm he lost the decision he threw a kick he checked the kick and it broke his for him and he was out for like a year he had like metal plates in his arm and everything so it was kind of hard to win that fight but it's gonna be a great fight yeah he's fine he's on a ridiculous win streak is there like 17 in a row 12 he has a longer win streak than could be in the UFC I think is the longest win streak besides John Jones right it's really kind of amazing that he hasn't got a legit title shot yet other than the interim well you just got hurt right yeah right in those kabhi fights you know like we miss Wade out or you missed way into it it's it's perfect now all that Sh in the past built this up so now it's better than average Capone's good it's better than ever is so so good gets on your back nobody can solve that problem well his grappling is just so superior to almost everybody else in the sport that's why I think Tony stands a chance because Tony's grappling is so interesting and he's so agile and the thing he does like if you watch Tony train like he's always like moving in weird ways and that's that's not like for fun that's actually how he fights the moves and he does that for real yeah I don't like you know this video that he put on Instagram of him like fucking with the Wing Chun dummy yeah and all these wind Chun experts came out like he's not doing it right he's though that's not Wing Chun I don't know what the fuck he's doing like dude Tony's doing whatever the fuck yeah he'll beat you up take a whiz Chung's dummy and do Tony Ferguson yes no beat your founder out there he is oh there sure was that when he was fucking up Donald Cerrone oh my god look at him dude he's the man the other thing you gotta think about with Tony as you can't watch you can't train for this shit you can't find anyone to mimic Tony he'll get you from all angles did knock you out and submit you in the same fight he's just so unorthodox yeah Kevin Lee was having a little success in the early in the early round but he didn't mean him Al Anam he got in a good position but he didn't do anything there's been some fighters that have had some success and you know but there's one successful - beep - what you're dealing with that fighters man whenever you're dealing with elite fighters you're dealing with guys that are gonna test each other I mean of course it's not gonna run through everybody he's gonna have some difficult moments but his ability to win is unprecedented it's right up there Tony could be ran through every the big difference between Tony and all of competing clip tonight got put into a bad situation just like Tony's been putting a bad situation to your clip tonight but the difference between Tony and all of khabib opponents is once generally most of us I forget most of the guys that khabib takes down they're spending all their energy trying to get back up yeah they're trying to get back up in the nerves that they're trying to get back they're trying to drag themselves up the fence Tony's not gonna do that Tony's gonna attack embrace it done so khabib is never dealt with a guy that's gonna actually go okay we're on the ground let's do this yeah so that's gonna be the difference you know what I'm not I'm not I'm not making predictions or anything I know I've been in this sport long enough where I know anything could happen you can't predict any fire does it promise controls on the ground and whatever your jutted to is whatever it is he controls your hips and your legs nobody has takes everything away okay he injured I respect that right he pins your hips to the ground see you later yeah but no he hasn't he hasn't fought anybody with Tony's weapons on the ground and the fact that Tony's not gonna try to like spend the whole round trying to get back up he might try to get back up here and there are spots like there's gonna be spots where it's like okay let's attack this him on the fucker and it's a different ballgame it's a different game when khabib 'he's trying to keep the guy on the ground who's trying to drag himself up the fence yeah and a guy just turns up and squares with them and goes okay let's attack it's a whole different game so I don't know how it's gonna turn yeah I don't know who knows who knows how it's gonna turn out but I guarantee no fight there's no other fight there's nothing else my feeling is it that if Ferguson can be busy enough on the ground guess I honor ranked number three he hasn't fought so long that seems so strange to me they're worried if they take him out those rankings are so odd you know it's like who makes those how do they do that I know that the pound-for-pound rankings are made by journalists like journalists submit their submissions so sort of these does that yeah really yeah they're ranking yeah there's a whole there's a good number of journalists who submit so laughter do you don't you think that after like a long lengthy layoff how long has it been since e5 coroner last time you fought was Vegas how long it could be twice a second a year and a half two years let's do ohm and everybody is out of here not Abby Christ dude I I do i I

Panama for three days I get the treatment and then we're gonna go from there and jet somewhere else and then have another Manik injury like so so let's just say my ankles and fucking ankles are so stiff a hundred percent I get fixed right into the joint can you get a little boat dock well this listen what Ben Greenfield did with uh with with his dick I took a bend refocus on his dick he got a shot through his whole body he got a shot in every joint it was like they put him under they did his bad ankle this they did his big toes he was numb yes oh yeah I mean he was like for a while I don't know where's like holy shit his whole body was like out of it but he said afterwards his biological age dropped he said he felt significantly better through his entire body like every joint felt better his energy level went through the roof he said he made the news today what they can they they can do they can reverse your biological clock by two and a half years human growth Foreman and that's the time but here's the thing about metformin I met there's a guy David Sinclair from Harvard who's coming on my podcast again next week he's been on before and the thing about metformin is when when he talked about it he was advising it and talking about the benefits of it but then when I talk to people like Greenfield and then also Rhonda Patrick they said there's a performance hit though like your physical performance suffers from metformin it's not you don't have as much like you're not gonna it's it's you're not gonna feel as good when you train you're not gonna feels good physically but it lowers your biological age it's a tricky one like she's not sold like listen man I put my fucking right hand on the Rhonda Patrick Bible she's her as thorough a researcher is there is and you know she's a legit scientist and when she does the research on something she looks at every fucking angle completely non biased and she's not sold on metformin and there's a lot of other people that agree with her I say there's there's a performance hit apparently but David Sinclair is not exercising if he does he's like getting a fucking elliptical machine while he watches the news he's not do anything crazy but if you're an athlete like I know you are Joe that's a great shirt I just noticed it that's a great fucking show while I was wearing the all like I'd wear the official ones at the weigh-ins that's a great hire them taking my shirt off in front of everybody that's a great shirt yeah they make dope shirts man there's a bunch of dope shirts the Yoel Romero wants my favourites I'll owe you the stop sent me the stop it looks like the matrix the color you see that cartoon of yo Romero and bro Paula coast is the only guy to slow down yo romero like literally like put it on him where yo l always puts it on everybody he made yo L fight off his back foot he made yo L like like little like having a hard time setting up to throw shot I didn't know he'd be sleepy 3 me neither he don't know nothing he could I can't play it I didn't know Costa was that goddamn countin what you saying we don't own it somebody else's video - holy bro what's manner oh you guys don't watch football so you can give a fuck something happening I know I'm Antonio Brown sign with the Patriots what hey so bad the Hoff dude was about to the dark side with the best team in the world and the best quarterback the best coach oh how is that guy started back at his age 42 stem cells is he well he definitely done some of them out ton of it yeah doesn't it's he thinks he takes it he's just not get any sense because before him remember his Drew Bledsoe like Drew Bledsoe was awesome he's going to think that drew blood cells back up would be the best motherfucker of all time especially cuz he no one ever thought that person cuz he's not a fast runner he's nice no one's ever thought that drew blood flow was a high level yeah how about that do they just retired what's his name what's that got the return Manning of Andrew Luck yeah why do you retire because he's 9 he had a hundred million dollars or whatever any Stanford graduates engineering or architecture Stanford had their options and he's like I don't want to get my head no he kept getting hurt though so he's a baller super baller but he kept having the horrible injuries had missed a whole year previously that thing came back NFL player that Comeback Player of the Year then just his line side kept getting hit and has money in the bank super smart kid was like I'm out man I don't have the passion for it I looked at the list of Kowski saying things like get a lacerated kidney he had an aspirin oh yeah lacerated kidney he had a lacerated liver yeah he looked at their listen I was so horrified my jaw was like what like that's it looks like you've been to a Cox and Brennan goes it's not that no there's guys wait wait worse like even robbed congrats key was talking to like a crowd and he started getting emotional timeout how he kept getting hurt and like his mind was in in it and he was hating to play it's just you guys play since through the fucking four man you're back to your 20s and it's like fuck this man right after where's money in the bank you also see these guys that are getting pulled around in wheelchairs from in their 60s they can't remember what their name is there's a lot of that none of that and we we're aware of it now they weren't aware of it 20 30 years ago I think fighters to fighters a lot smarter now like Natan is like dude pay me what I'm worth man I know I'm on the reverse side of that as you see a lot of guys like that have had many concussions and football like Troy eight men and Steve Young they've had tremendous amount of concussions and their commentating and they sound like a sailor Jean they say they can't ask for it did you get knocked out by some gigantic 260 pound guy running full Club like eight times didn't you get like there's offseason and then they're doing commentary commentating and they sound bro but there's fighters like that too like robots are over in Sugar Ray Robinson no no no Felder c-crazy no oh Sugar Ray Robinson you mean Leonard or Robinson Lander yes struggling yes yes struggling no and by the way Rob's a struggling no no no he has a hard time talking and and then Robinson was struggling real bad late in his life how do you really like Steve Young he's had him and Troy I've had it there's not a hundred like there's a season hundred is the Nexen job but in football you have an off season you know you know I'd say a billion a billion concussion no but seriously and those guys are commentating for Fox and CBS and NBC this is a giant zit killers are Gina Patrick you can't go for rich at all when you're commentating for fucking NBC you can't glitch you have to be on fine you know something I've been tested for it yeah yeah I don't know we'll see yeah I don't see any get tickets now because CT CT kick in any side you see no sign of CTU I see him yeah what'd you do why on who in Brennan trendin yeah you don't see nothing not even a little bit you see some that was good dude what why'd you do that no there's people that are fighting currently that do worry me though you have conversations with them they sound like they're drunk yeah and then they pull it together for fights yeah you know like they pull it together and they look at it fights but you know what the thing is dojo on average I know in the media and this isn't conspiracy you might agree with the setting this to your point okay so you see CTS everywhere see T's everywhere in brain trauma but the odds are you're not gonna get it there's more guys better off who played in the NFL and college football and fought so we're fine then those that are sometimes true okay the hot songs out there that have been like fucking shut off a few times you know no long-term Ct study that they did where they've tested 111 people in 110 of them at CT yes they were no no they have the ability to determine whether or not yeah that's a very that's it that's a little bit of a trick MRI those those correctly prolong those samples that were those samples were donated by their family and those guys showed some shows signs so that was a that was kind of not a very good control group their bodies are fucked up their joints the bass but their breath there's more guys that don't have CT than do that's interesting yeah well can can someone be kept alive with just their head yes yeah is there is improved oh you mean like a head transplant no no you're like like I lost my arm I'd still be alive right if I lost both arms I'd still be alive both legs at what you know a heart I knew everyone you'd long yeah you know you gotta breathe you need that hey bro yeah you need the whole sick medical side a weird road what have you had and you had like a submission port yeah machine you know there's guys that have been knocked out a bunch of times like Oh like I said over him over him is one of the best examples you talk to that guy he sounds fucking clears day he's been knocked out but I mean a gang no time more than anybody in the UC yeah a gang at times and he sounds fun super articulate for now it says no problems hopefully he I mean and he's still winning and still fighting well it's like have you seen that nicotine helps with that with that the studies on nicotine it's so nicotine the way it's delivered fuck's people's lungs up stuff like that but nicotine by itself Ian take you in the chew actually helps with brain trauma stuff like you know it helps is silicide dementia psilocybin apparently regenerates neurons really yeah it's one of the rare things a regenerate neurons another thing that's supposed to be really good for it is lion's mane lion's mane mushroom Paul Stamets who's a mycologist and possibly damnit so different guy close he's uh he's not my podcast before he's he's coming on again to it's a legitimate scientist and your podcast can you invite me please yes describe just one day ok please when you're younger yeah did you ever hear any anything back from Konya yeah we'll talk about that off there yeah not not bad nah yeah you just hit me I think it's better for that guy to not do podcast just make great music this is why I don't think you're on this why I don't think it's gonna work for you you're not gonna let him rant like Trump does and get away with all that stuff it's not what you do what truck listen I'm saying you never saw that video of him out making his own like book and vocabulary and Trump like that'd be cool dude okay you're on my side right I'm a Kanye friend I'm a-tellin fish I am - yeah she's amazing I think she's incredibly eccentric and I think if you're gonna be credibly eccentric the way he is you're gonna have a lot of nutty thoughts and ideas he'd say and he also has some mental health issues like legitimate that he's discussed yet the public yeah and that that I think in some ways may contribute to his art because he's off medication he was on medication for a while and the way he talked to about it he was saying that it was stifling him it was fucking him up telling him yeah I was dulling his ability to create how could it not it's a fine line though right because what a guitar amazing what made him amazing is this wild mind that he has but this wild mind is not it's not based on like mathematical truth and logic reason it's based on this ability to just go with the flow and think what you think could be confident in your decisions and just be and this be in touch with your emotions and your feelings and I mean he's a fucking incredibly prolific artist and to leave that guy alone and I think that Kim Kardashian situation is perfect because she loves him they have a family together I bet she kind of keeps him grounded her and her family obviously have an amazing business sense so like they'll keep all the money tight keep everybody together I mean she's got fucking more loot than God would you ever have Kim Kardashian on your podcast you know what I'd have her I don't ever come on and talk about our decision to help with prison reform because I think that's really admirable there's a lot of people that have made a lot of money and they've gotten real famous and they didn't do shit with it but what she's done she's got completely free yes she's actually and she's actually pushed a narrative that you can do something like this and she's talked to Trump but she's visited in the White House and she's got I think something like 18 people freed from prison that were wrongly incarcerated pretty clear so respect to her I don't know I don't know ever want to make a Kim Kardashian joke for the rest of my life plus I made a bunch of them maybe but even if I did have your last special one before but even that was Bruce that's right but if I did I mean I mean but I mean what she's done is like she's decided to make a difference she didn't have to mean oh she had friends shit she could just buy diamonds to get her toes done she decided to make a difference you know so I respect her 100% man there's a lot of fucking this there's people that learn and grow in you know will want to sell people short and write people off and cancel people because of this or that and turn them into a noun yes who you are changing yeah it's not about the difference between you and I when we were 28 oh my god I'm dubbed the more the level of moronic and hurt oh my god we were Maura's and what we thought about all the time in our head their problem with you and eyes we were together let's go okay this bowl that's poison easily get piranhas oh yeah piranhas in my tank I said to him one time I go yeah I want to talk but I want a dog that's just basically jaws on a leash I want a pitbull with a head he's like legitly went to a guy who was fighting dogs to get Brian's dog I didn't want to fight an eyes when I'm fighting knock that I would I was gonna fight it I just wanted a badass dog well you love sweet dog did you get the dollar was a great watch on a farm I'll tell you how to died good question I had my friend watch on the farm my friend calls me goes hey your dogs not with us anymore I go what he says yes sorry about that Wow I have news I shot it and I go oh and he goes yeah so you could have told me that that dog was gonna turn on at any minute I go oh the dog went after a baby calf a cow was holding onto it the neighbor's dog well no I'm sorry let me start again it killed a couple goats then went after the baby calf and when the family dog came out which was like a German Shepherd golden retriever pitbull was like yeah and killed God yeah and broke it broke its leg yeah and then that was when my friend he said when I tried to pull that dog off it was so swollen it was like it was like this smaller it was it was pulsing he never and it was covered in blood and it was so excited and I was like I was like oh this is a demon dog and he shot the dog yeah because he was like I can't have a gun he's a farmer yeah everyone been fucked yeah well they don't bite people I know he was how on four wheels I know dude had wolf dogs they were like 7/8 timber wolf and they got out of his yard or he let him out I don't know they went to a neighbor's farm and killed like eight sheep yeah they come back just bathed in blood blood wolf dogs they are illegal in a lot of parts that they should be because listen to him at all man no it was not like sit fuck you yeah and it was like the conversations over the dog sit yeah fuck you there big dog pack instinct is very very strong so children are lower on that totem pole than they are and so what happens is look at children as below them subservient they don't look him as part of the family cuz they're in there they're very pack for the bike kids and that's so they'll take kids out did you hear about that guy that got attacked in British Columbia while he was sleeping in his bag he's sleeping in a sleeping bag I'm gonna get a lot of mail me too then try to drag him out attempt people were screaming odd yeah a wolf bit him was dragging him the wolf's ass was hanging out of the tent pulling this guy out the guys screaming the Wolves got ahold of his arm and then some other people kicked it some other campers woke up kicked it threw rocks at it gray wolves almost never do that but they have in the past you know there's a story what happened well they kicked it and the thing ran off and they threw rocks at it and then the forest rangers got it shot it and by the way yeah I'm gonna get a shitload of emails from people who own wolf dogs don't send them to me I don't want to hear it I'm sure they don't don't they're great dogs just you got to

good for people who have allergies because they can be hygienic they they are and they are pretty good watchdogs but they're very dog aggressive you know what very one of their main characteristics are that my landlord had one is that they're only loyal to their master and they don't give a fuck about anybody else you know most dogs aren't all about love you know most dogs I guess all they care about is love they just want love love love not Akita they don't want that all they want is food from the master and everyone else can suck this chick dude I I lived around a motherfucker like that

talking about a really low fucking control no that's why they're Japanese police dogs is because of their quality is that they only care about their master and everyone else although they won't bite
