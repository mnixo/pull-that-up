toned down down down boom and we're live let's have a toast to Hugh Hefner yes we lost one of the great dick slingers of the 20th century certainly did they lost him he literally had a place where guys could go to be leches yeah you could just go and you had a mansion where everybody knew there's gonna be a bunch of hoes and that's why they went yeah they what they went there on purpose and there was guys that like we're notorious for hanging around the mansion for going to all imagine parties I did year ago I went twice I went once for a Marijuana Policy Project thing I think that was a company that was putting it together where I hosted something and there's bands and stuff like that was kind of interesting that's fun and then the other time I went was for Fear Factor we did something for Fear Factor with the Playboy Playmates do you meet Hugh I never met him man no I never met him he's just I think by that time he's he's old and I think he just wanted chill yeah he was just kind of done I never went there I tried to get in a girl tried to get me in and I guess they did they googled me and she go I guess I don't have enough credits oh come on it was I couldn't get in they have to look you up and I she was nice but they said no how long ago is this probably two years ago oh my god I know I didn't qualify to go like I do mollify to go with his fucking girls and fucking crazy you didn't have enough credits I guess so or maybe I didn't have the right credits or maybe they just didn't care like whatever you know I didn't I wasn't even that mad I was like whatever credits yeah gross yeah she said something like that but she was trying to be really nice like she was trying to let me down easy cuz she felt bad cuz we were friends since she wanted to go like you just don't qualify to come here and look at these tits really it was a weird place because it was super outdated like you heard about the grotto yeah oh the grotto you go to the grotto and has a phone from like the 1970s they're like what is this they left it like pie for the vibe the old school vibe I guess or they just never updated it it was really you know he's sold the place or it was for sale but one of the caveats of purchase was that he had to live in the building until he died yeah yep but it was like some preposterous amount of money like 200 million dollars or something crazy well the land is really valuable so yeah so what do they do at that now do they knock it down I mean is there no nostalgia to it is it like kind of died on the vine anyway or do you fucking what question well he has a son and his son probably inherited it his son I think was running the magazine they tried for a while to have no nudity yeah terrible idea it's like fucking it's like you're a mechanic fucking thing with no cars in it who wants to just read that shit stupid it's like having a New York Times article with all ads like woody where's the fucking intellectual stimulation here yeah it's like that's a really bad no nudity is a terrible decision yeah well they were always in this weird area right because Hugh Hefner was like the only acceptable pornographer like Larry Flynt who did a lot for free speech who did a lot for exposing corrupt politicians but they would show vaginas and assholes yeah and because of that he was always thought as a gross guy yeah you know well even their social commentary was dried member when I was a kid there was one who's the feminist Gloria no not Gloria Allred oh my god I know it's not him I think it was a Gloria Steinem parody but it was like you know her licking a girl's pussy that had period blood it was like some fucking vile thing he would do the most vile political kulluk he really showed his disdain of those people he was great he's a crazy guy he's still alive that fucker yeah he was shot you know and paralyzed like way back in the day right yeah and 77 maybe wasn't that late I think it was I over 76 yeah yeah he's gonna still get a bunch of casinos and stuff he's still out there kicking it but like who the hell is buying hustler ie well it's funny you mentioned I my manager got one today I haven't bought one in many years could there's I did an interview for them and it was actually a really good interview and they quoted me accurately so I'm in December's hustler which is out today Wow so it's funny I boy the husband for the first time probably in 15 years today why do magazines do that or December comes out and stuff no that's so fucking stupid why we pretend it's like new cars it's a 2018 will have the fuck is that even possible since 2017 monkeys it's gotta be something about the anticipation of getting it it's almost like when a Halloween movie doesn't come out October 30th because you're sick of Halloween by then so it comes out like you know say September 15th and then by the time Halloween comes the movies finished you like oh fuck Halloween no but that makes sense because they're not pretending it's Halloween it's just a Halloween right like they're pretending that's a December issue but it's not to sell it's not yeah I don't know the thank-you they come out like way in advance usually a month of before but December this is it is kind of so the new car thing is always weird cuz it's way ahead yeah Sigma yeah six yeah six months before the year turns over they're already saying that it's a 2018 model yeah alright it's like its 27th it's April are you talking about snot the 2018 model yeah it's like weird it's like Trix you know it's like when you buy something and it cost $9.99 make it $10 you fuck yeah what is this what is this penny stuff they want to say under $10 yeah well I I don't understand if it just looks better within 99 then the 10th I don't get it either it does for dumb people yeah that's what it is it's like you're appealing to people's mind like that the little part of their mind is trying to save a little sound better I don't know this is I mean comedians have addressed the gas thing for years there's a book about this it's called predictably irrational the hidden forces that shape our decisions and came out about 10 years ago maybe interesting so it's playing playing on the irrational thoughts that we have like specific anecdotes about like us like a Best Buy ad and why there's three washing machines and they're really trying to get you to buy the middle one but they have two other priced ones goes into things just like that all there are different aspects of life you know my favorite ones are when you're in Vegas and you see voted best buffet oh my god best 10:00 p.m. show like by who who voted for best buffet and if they did vote on it why who are they do they have to leave the house they were you going the fucking buffet voters in 20 minutes we're gonna miss the buffet vote yeah cares but there good buffet Sinbad buffets right like where's a good buffet in big do you ever go to the buffets I fucking love a good buffet if you want the truth a is great it rules very nice the Wynn Hotel in Vegas has a tremendous buffet the Wynn hotels tremendous period I've walked through it but I've never stayed there it's a phenomenal hotel it's like a very high-end place so it makes sense that their buffet would kick ass in here in LA they have a good one at the Four Seasons on Sundays as I might have said to like buffet yeah oh I've done the four seasons in Maui and they have breakfast buffet oh what a great way to get fat it is right oh it's tremendous they make you waffles they have the waffle thing right there something about someone making you a waffle when they pour the waffle stuff into that a little press you put it down you like all gonna have a waffle I'm just thinking right now about melting the butter on it and yeah you know what I did last time mmm I put peanut butter all over that motherfucker and then I put butter and then I put syrup oh yeah I felt great for about 15 minutes and then afterwards I just feel like this but even you feel terrible Wow look at much as you workout like I'm surprised like you don't cuz you burned through everything you eat yeah but you know what it is man it has nothing to do with that it's an insolent dump your body just hits all that sugar system in your body it's like what the fuck is this and it's actually probably worse for me because I don't do it very often like if your body gets used to sugar if you're drinking sugary sodas all day and you're eating white bread all day and if your body gets used to processing that stuff it has a better handle on what to do with it whereas with me it only gets it every few days so when it gets it it's like what fuck is that especially like if I overload like get crazy eat a like a banana split or something like that like you feel it oh yeah I look hard I'm bad in LA though with food like I fucking got for sushi and that yogurt stop on Santa Monica it's my favorite place in the world with n cheese no it's called the yogurts not oh it's on Santa Monica and I've been there for days where I've been in LA for four days I've been there for four times I can't stop shoveling that shit it's my favorite fucking place good I no man I've had yogurt that was just as good it just I'd always felt right to go out for the best sushi and then go down there and have some yogurt stop treat yourself a little Jimmy you're doing good with your life well you know I was having a sad day Monday and literally like a fucking fat girl I got my ex girlfriend who's my best friend and we went and got you over and I'm like I'm really sad and we went and got I treated myself to a you said I just go up and down I'm just relationship nonsense I'm a fatalist but you're doing great I'm doing okay you know how many people would fucking kill to be in your position successful touring stand-up comedian festival podcaster successful radio personality loved by all chip is a great podcaster that's who the successful podcast and the Norton Empire is like the best MMA podcast in the world thank you we have a lot of fun with that man thank you it's great I love Matt Wheaton I love them too but it's uh yeah it's one of those things where like I know that I know that it's a fun gig and I love doing it but it's one of those things it's not about like feeling like I've been haven't been blessed like showbiz has given me opportunities I fail but I'm not some unlucky guy logy they didn't give me a show they give me a million shots it's not being annoyed at yourself for certain things so it's not about like I get a good apartment I make money I am very lucky but it's rational like when you're feeling down you're like uh so she's a rational thing no you can't you can't turn it around with your mind no I'm too a most like I react too emotionally but the next day like I had a great week since then get off thank you she and I talked and I realize I'm just being kind of fucking crazy you know a girlfriend's shit yeah but I'm also not cheating right I don't know how to not cheat so I'm not acting out it's fucking crazy man also maybe part of your weirdness is like dealing with the fact that you're not expressing your normal behavior patterns yeah it's giving up it's like it's giving up a huge addiction like I still I still look at porn stuff but not acting out not having fucking girls the LA is a deadly City for me oh dude I come out here I got fucking naughty pussy deadly pussy well sometimes I'm a very fresh boy hey better now there's a whole ecosystem around that here you know there really is a lot of a lot of gals that are loose with the sex mm-hmm they've decided to profit off of that yeah and they said I'll just have sex with some men and not have to work a job and some of them are literally just people I've known for a lot like they're like people you meet up through the business right and they're just as dangerous because and I mean for me because they'll do anything right and because they like the fact that I'm open so they're like oh my god guys think I'm crazy go like right so it's hard just not to be unfaithful it's hard to not be fucking if this is how mean fans are I've been talking about this for a week so I've been up and down I've been sad that I'm great and I'm just you know I don't have a handout of girl fat in six years I'm talking about it then one fans like or we get it you're gonna girlfriend you're 49 you're being normal it's like Jesus you fucking rotten toad can I talk about my life being healthy for one week before fans get sick of it well you're always gonna get one person who complains about everything yeah I can't really bother you know it's just like well yeah you're gonna get that I mean and he's got a point - it's probably annoying to him which is why he said it but there's a she or she yeah well shut up mouth yeah fuck do you know bitch I gave her a sarcastic apology I'm sorry I didn't mean to share something good all to keep a negative and she accurate back it's all good like she believed the apology oh that's hilarious oh well there's a fake feud going on between me and Ari and Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura and people for whatever reason think it's real and so they're getting mad and I'm airing out our dirty laundry in public I couldn't be more obvious about how fake it is I even wrote good day sir at the end of my letter with all caps I mean it's just this is look at the new thing pray for Joe this is what it is Bert Kreischer our friend good friend Bert is a fucking raging alcoholic he's certainly he drinks six doubles a night yeah he's drinking 12 drinks a night and I go are you serious he was every night I go wow that is great I can't even imagine doing that like that's incredible so we said do you think he gets over he said yes ok so then someone said sober and run a marathon and I was like stop you guys he's gonna die yeah because first of all Bert likes to pretend he runs but he really only runs on a treadmill and I'm like that is not running you're lifting your legs up and the things coming towards you it's not the same different so now we started running on the real road and he's like barely getting in a couple miles and and he takes a lot of breaks he's not running any fucking marathons anytime soon and I'm certainly not saying that he could do one after a month yeah right so we said okay how about no drinking for the entire month of October and you got to do 15 hot yoga classes in a month which is fucking hardcore that's hardcore I've done it I love how high yoga but it really does where it really wipes you out it wipes you out especially if you're not used to it and you don't drink enough water you've got to really be on the ball so everybody agreed to that and then a couple of fucking days ago they started saying we're gonna be totally sober no weed no alcohol whoa whoa whoa whoa first of all you fucks I'm only doing this to try to see if we can get Bert sober I don't need to not drink I cannot drink for months it doesn't bother me like me taking a month off of booze doesn't bother me at all but me taking a month off a weed is like how do you expect me to write it to write I use it to think about things I use it to enjoy things I use it as a like a sacrament almost do you ever think of trying a month with that like you know you're gonna go back to it and that you're not doing a derivative it but I don't want to be bullied by a welcher yeah if fear was supposed to see Bert and Tom had a fucking contest and they were if they lost 25 pounds already was supposed to take them on a trip to wherever they chose and Tom wanted to go to Europe to watch a soccer game and Bert wanted to go to watch some crazy football game and re completely Welsh on the BET and then took off and went to Asia for four months and left me holding the back not only did you take off you took off went off the grid and don't think the two aren't related Shaffir I know what the fuck you're up to you didn't feel any responsibility to pay that bet you son of a bitch anyway I wound up getting them what did I get them tickets to wake some basketball game it's a big game right so it was a big deal flew him out first-class the whole deal put him up in a nice hotel paid for everything so I paid for it and because they did actually lose the way sure and so they're like we got to come up with a new test and somehow or another I got involved and already got involved too and they're trying to shame me into quitting pot it's like I stopped smoking pot all the time when I go on vacation I don't smoke pot for a week at a time when I go anywhere where you know I mean if I'm in Europe for ten days I'm not smoking weed it's not an addictive issue but it's something that I enjoy I could stop doing things that I enjoy but I it sounds like an addict saying this I don't have a problem with it but I really don't have a problem with it I like it I like pot I'm not willing to not do it for an alcoholic friend and a welcher and then Tom Segura who's dressed up like a medicine man lately like what the fuck is he doing he's wearing he's wearing some crazy Steven Seagal outfit he's got wooden beads on and shit some crazy hat are they loose fitting clothes what he's wearing yeah no okay he's in tremendous shape oh good for Tom Tom lost the weight and kept the weight off because Tom is like really disciplined you know which is why he just did another Netflix special in like three and a half four years he's done three net for my god yeah he's a he's an animal there he is look at his hat just fucking hat Jesus Christ beard to cross ting in the beer nice and trim he looks good I love it but he's fucking healthy look how thin his faces but look at the picture above that look at above that that one see that he's fucking out oh my God look like who is that outfit look like I've seen that photo shopped I'm sure what is that outfit from that looks like ohoo where'd who dresses like this like stag all this looks like Steven Seagal I mean this smoke in the back it could be like some Buddhist monk or something like that but these motherfuckers are trying to shame me and it's to quitting weed it's not happening boys in fact I'm gonna get high every day in October you ever thought of trying it just for a month to see it to see how like if it gets weird for you it might be you might get some really good shit out of it if you're going yeah I mean I would but maybe another month maybe I'll do in November November but these this month they can suck my dick I'm gonna get high every day you won't be shamed into it you'll do it when you want to do it I'll do it if I want to do yeah and if I really had an issue if I'm like man I can't get a day without if if I felt like I was reaching for it to do things like I haven't smoked pot today today I went running about to a podcast I like to smoke a little weed before a podcast but nothing today nothing zero no issues yeah I think it would affect me differently of you is a good example of a guy like you you function well well you smoke pot and you do jujitsu like I didn't do that well a lot of people that did you justice from pot it's it's huge in the jiu-jitsu community you would think like a lot of people have a misconception in jiu-jitsu where they think of it as being a bunch of like really aggressive mean guys that are like attacking each other but it's more much more a bunch of like really smart analytical stoner sensitive nerd type characters who are also like very strong right because they do jujitsu all the time or if they lift weights and get in really good shape a lot of those guys it's because of jujitsu and then of course there's people that come to it from like football or wrestling or some plane that they have a different attitude but a lot of times they fall into like a jujitsu mindset which is a very relaxed friendly mindset jiu-jitsu people are super friendly very affectionate to like all the guys that met very huggy and friendly and it's uh I've noticed a lot of like combat athletes are like that but there's a gentleness to it like we own on Hopkins I've talked to a lot and when he sits right next to you and literally he's a speed invade your space yeah but it doesn't feel menacing or fun and weird it feels like almost like he's just an affectionate gentle guy it's an odd feel you know you get energy from people it just doesn't feel uncomfortable well you know where the garlic Bernard is so confident in himself he doesn't exude any like insecurities or rightness I mean he's an all-time great yeah there's no there's not a single human being that knows boxing that would argue that Bernard Hopkins is an all-time right I remember when he fought Tito Trinidad you're a Stefano he fought Felix Trinidad and I believe he was 36 at the time and Trinidad was in his prime and everybody really thought the Trinity I was gonna run him over and he beat the fucking shit out of Trinidad and it was a weird controversial fight because he was in Puerto Rico and he took the Puerto Rican flag and threw it on the ground everybody went crazy I want to kill him yeah he wanted to get inside Trinidad's head and get him get him to try to brawl with him and he did but not picked him apart Wow he picked him apart and fucked him up and then years later when people wrote him off again he fought Kelly Pavlik and this is after Kelly Pavlik had knocked out Jermaine Stewart and he was thought to be like the guy you know and everybody was like Kelly Pavlik is gonna fuck up her an art Hopkins Bernard Hopkins beat the shit out of him too who finally knocked his last fight that one Joe Smith he was 51 yeah I'm pretty sure I think I'm either 50 or 51 he wanted to be 50 I remember thinking for 49 fights or whether I no no he wanted to fight when he was 50 he wanted to fight Mayweather for his 50th fight that was I remember him talking about that right before he turned 50 really yep he was taller would never fight him he's so much bigger yeah I guess he was talk about cutting weight or maybe he was just saying that but he talked about fighting Floyd Floyd coming up at him going down Oh Floyd I'd say fuck that thought fly pie I did I mean he never fought him he's not but I think that he was talking about that when he was 49 yeah because Floyd is a tiny man yeah I mean Floyd is a natural 147 pounder like when he weighed in for the fight with Conor he weighed 149 and Bernard was fighting 175 it's just so much larger yeah maybe he was talking about coming down and so I don't know there's the conversation but obviously they would have had to you know the catch right but he fought this guy Joe Smith jr. who's a young guy who's a murderous puncher and he just got fucked up and knocked through the ropes and he fell on his head it was horrible yeah yeah but he had such a great he was bounding it you know yeah he had to go down sooner or later but yeah just a like a nice dude and I love guys like that who don't try to give off just that shitty energy and I don't think I've ever gotten that energy off of fighters well you won't get it off the successful ones because to get successful you want to have as few things that are in your way that are cumbersome as possible few ego issues and as few distorted perceptions of reality as possible in order to weave your way through to the top ya know I mean there's exceptions to that where you have like phenomenal physical specimens that are incredibly dedicated and dealing with a lot of demons like Tyson in his prime yeah you know but I don't know if that would work in him and may the same way it worked in boxing like I just don't know with all the variables in boxing like with Tyson or an MMA rather with Tyson like in his prime he could just wade towards guys bob and weave and throw bombs and and figure out a way to just smash them he was just so much faster than everybody and he hit so hard yeah they were afraid of him yeah but I wonder if you're ever gonna see that kind of person dominate the way Tyson did as a MMA fighter like I just don't know and it's weird I never care what their face looks like when they walk into the ring like you know when you you don't watch fire you go god he looks frightening but you pointed it out and it's he choose gamma he's high steep M you know just when he wants him he couldn't look happier I was so calm Jozy Aldo won't look the guy in the eye he's terrified he's just kind of looking down and being humble you know none of that stuff seems to work with those guys because every one of them knows there's so many ways to lose I don't know what it is but they don't seem to try that shit with each other like boxers some guys do it was a big thing with Wanderlei Silva evangelise Astaire guys down big time you know and Mirko Cro Cop and him had like the greatest stare down the history of pride they're just both staring at each other was super intense I remember like Marco when you talking about his stare that spite whatever the year he came over to UFC was at 2008 you were on our show on Kara can you talk about this guy Mirko Cro Cop coming over at his fucking stair and we were watching his stare down look at this this is Mirko vs. vanillin vanilli used to intimidate everybody but Mirko was the head of an anti-terrorist squadron in Croatia well he didn't give a fuck and he was a world-class kickboxer look look how fucking intensely on he's completely unintimidating by that stare and he beat the holy shit out of andele he was the first guy to really flatline Wanderlei he had kicked him into a coma Wow yeah just blam it was the second time they fought the first time they fought was his first MMA fight and had all these weird wacky rules like he could only be on the ground for 30 seconds and they had to stand in the backup ride yeah the heat Mirko wasn't really doing MMA I mean he was sort of training in MMA but Wanderlei was a champion I mean Vanderley was a world-class fighter and so they had some sort of a weird arrangement and the arrangement was like limited amount of time on the ground and a bunch of other wacky rule on that first fight it was a draw I have no one finished anyone that was the other thing nobody finished anybody then decided there was gonna be a draw and the rounds were with a ten minute rounds well back then they were ten minute first rounds and then you'd have a five minute second round and a five minute third round if it was a championship fight but I think with Wanderlei and him they shortened the rounds as well I don't remember the whole deal but then the second time they fought it was a lid Pride MMA fight and Mirko had already fought a bunch of pride fights and really got into the groove and they become like one of the best heavyweights alive and he just beat the shit out of them that way I've never seen that stare down that was really intense to turn that's that was an intimidating yes there that smirk on his prime he's not moving you're not moving yeah but that you're right you're dealing with the ten-year the head of an anti-terrorist yeah we've got police group I guess there are police crew could I've sounded more like a fucking like my niece the head of energy police but if you're like an anti-terrorism cop I mean that's the face you have I mean you have to get information out of people well he's most likely seeing a lot of people die you think yeah yeah Croatia such a hard place man I mean he's a hard man in a hard place and on top of being like a soldier he was you know and the best kickboxers alive before he wanted to MMA so yeah oh man he was amazing he was a mate he was very good as a kickboxer but really came into his own as a MMA fighter because his style of kickboxing was unique uniquely effective in MMA because he was very explosive and fast whereas some guys would be like more it would be like more methodical or technical like Ernesto Hoost or Peter Aerts or some of these other guys that would they would stand in front of guys more and just pick their shots better Mirko would just blast you with like one or two single shots but that was way more effective in MMA like the explosive very fast style yeah I never so I would like to see a wonder boy one of his kickboxing flies he's like 57 and always a kickboxer I watched him kick box but I would kind of like to see line yeah my mom I should do that online because god knows what I'm doing it's not helping me you know I'm eating off so I'm trying not to as much but it there's so many fun things to watch I've been jerking off during the day because I it's so ritualistic for me that when I jerk off during the day I'm like okay I can be a person and I don't have to think about that for the rest of the day it really helps my day go much more productive have you ever thought of meditating do you meditate at all no I get it like you know before the we started Joe pointed he's like you always have an issue and he's right and that's like for me I'll be a niche well you were talking about some new issue yeah I'm like my throat but I've had that for years we're certain foods they fucked me up that too happens to me to the pot does that for sure really yeah we smoke too much weed before a show I get Flemmi I think it's a combination of maybe coffee and eggs like the eggs I think do it I went to like one of these alternative doctors I thought maybe my my adrenal glands were fucked up so he's like well you gotta cut out the eggs or cut out the coffee and I can't stop with the coffee fruits good for before a show like apples you know certain fucks behind I went around the corner I had one of the nice veggie thing and a pure vegetable juice smiley celery and a fucking vegetable just blows because it just dominates the entire juice I hated it's great for cleaning out your system now is it really good for you huh throws your fucking pipes free okay yeah okay celery juice is one of the best juices like if you have to take a shit you know I've been constipated accepted on a new medication that's supposed to cause diarrhea and I have but I have not been shitting and I'm usually will be on the medication for I just want its call it's prep it's so you don't get HIV and I'm negative right I know but I don't even brain eat it now because I'm in a fucking relationship I started to take it I'm like I'm just gonna be smart because I'm a fucking pack what's that smart to take a medication like that like isn't aren't there like AIDS medications now HIV medications they like completely stop it from there are but you don't want to have it I don't want to get it yeah I don't want to get it I mean I'm only taking it for a little while and I'm probably gonna stop trim in a relationship and I got to go for they want you to be tested after a month to make sure that your blood is okay your liver is okay your kidneys they want to like look you over yeah get off that shit is it bad for you I just got imagine it is anything that I mean anything that gives you diarrhea well it's only for a few days but if they can give it to me it literally stopped me from shedding but give you constipation they did yeah it can be good yeah just uh I just I mean isn't that that's a thing with like vicodin and a lot of the painkillers it gives you constipation yeah I've only taken vicodin once after I had my sinuses fixed um but the stuff that prep I took and I don't have anymore of them and I was like I'm gonna go back and see the guy and again I don't even know if I'm gonna do it again take that shit I just one point I was being crazy something I just want to make sure that don't get that yeah you know I would rather have some kind of a kind of I wouldn't be on it forever right but I'm like while I'm fucking acting like an ass let me at least one of the podcast episodes I took the most amount of heat for early in the day was I did a podcast with a guy named Peter Duesberg he's a biologist out of the University of California Berkeley and he's a very respected biologist who's done a lot of great work on cancer but he's got a very controversial take on HIV and he does not believe that HIV causes AIDS he thinks that HIV is evidence of a weak immune system excuse me and he thinks that when people have HIV it's because their immune system is compromised it's not that HIV compromises their immune system oh okay and he feels like all these people that are catching aids and getting HIV what's happening is they're doing a lot of party drugs they're doing a male nitrate and crystal meth and that's very very prevalent inside the gay community you know gay guys party a ton right and they're doing a lot of drugs and he points to the high correlation between all these people doing these party drugs and HIV his work is widely criticized I'm sure Jetta mad scientist and most people just do not agree with him and they say that the connection between HIV and AIDS is rock-solid and undeniable but he thinks it's not and it's and boy do people get mad at me about that one I mean I'm just talking to this photo who's a biologist at the University of California Berkeley I mean I'm figuring this guy's a legit scientist but he can't get funding for anything he's essentially blackballed from the academic community and it was really weird talking to him it's like has anybody debated you and he's like no no one will debate me you know is it almost like what about Arthur Ashe or is he saying that a direct injection into the bloodstream will give it to you how does he explain those well I don't know what Arthur Ashe was doing but what he was saying essentially was that transfusion I think yes one of the things about HIV was if you got HIV Arthur Ashe got a transfusion for what reason though oh I don't know I'm not sure thing he had something wrong when what he's saying is that when your immune system is compromised that's when HIV shows itself that HIV is a very weak virus and then it only shows up in the immune systems of people that are compromised okay in that is he saying we all have it or you can catch it like you know it's not saying we all have it but he's saying you can catch it but he's saying the evidence of it is only in people that have a weakened immune system again I'm just not something I believe sure and gentlemen don't get mad at me because I am white well you know there's so many there's a million different cases of people who obviously were you know who got it in in very weird ways or again through blood transfusions or they were born with it well here it says Arthur Ashe says he believed he contracted HIV the virus causes AIDS through a transfusion of tainted blood during his second round of heart bypass surgery in 1983 first learned of his inspection now here's the other issue that Peter Duesberg was saying was that what they were giving people when they first tested positive for HIV was AZT and that a Z T is a medication they used to use for chemotherapy but they stopped using it for chemotherapy because it was killing people quicker than cancer was killing people I mean it was just a brutal brutal drug and they had a bunch of it in his mind they had a bunch of it laying around after that and they decided to try to use it on AIDS patients and they said Rhian re and you know reintroducing it and you wonder now that and I guess the conspiracy thing is like thick pharmaceutic um had all these drugs they wanted to get rid of and needed where do they think that hey they were just trying to to do something else I mean obviously it wasn't the smart thing to do because they don't use it anymore and it didn't help people AC T did not help people with AIDS I mean people that took AZT died a lot of them shitload of them and AIDS back then was essentially a death sentence but there was a lot of people that didn't do anything that got AIDS that got HIV I never got AIDS they just took care of their body and it took a holistic approach and use nutrition and I just think it's super controversial like anything else I mean there's people that get cancer and don't die there they get cured of it sure but then there's people get cancer at ravages or system and kills them so like Steve Jobs I mean he listened to people I think he didn t try like alternative metal a Steve Jobs should still be alive he like they said a pretty curable form of cancer if you had pancreatic no I thought I thought his was they said a fairly curable one that he had listened to his friends and tried to go so holistic and they said if he had gone and just had it treated he probably would have survived it well there's probably a lot of that going on yeah how is a lot of fucking wacky people with their wacky ideas about holistic medicine dude I saw a guy do a TED talk I'm basically saying like strawberries are really good because it's they they cause other anti-angiogenesis or something which is about it stops the production of new blood vessels and that's what feeds cancer like he had this he literally had me convinced he could eat fucking strawberries not get cancer in large quantities so I mean if you hear somebody talk who really knows what they're talking about even if they're wrong right a lot of people are convinced by well that's one of the problems with like YouTube videos right where people have wacky conspiracy theories as long as they speak with big words I say things in complete sentences and they sound articulate you start to believe them they won't the one thing that has been proven to be effective with cancer some forms of cancer is ketogenic diets diets where your fat based we eat a lot of avocados and coconut oil and your body burns those rather than glucose and some cancers feed off sugar so to starve them you you go on a very low sugar diet and a very high fat diet and apparently there's real science that shows that there's some benefits to that but there's only certain kind of cancer yeah certain kind of cancers it doesn't affect at all certain kind of brain cancer it doesn't affect at all you doesn't matter what the fuck you do you better go to a doctor yeah I mean he can do both we want to just go to the doctor and try some of that like have an avocado you know to the fucking Hospital yeah shoes who you about to say Jamie well I just googled on the Steve Jobs things like both of you are actually correct from what I just found like it he had pancreatic cancer but he also could have been saved potentially but then this next thing also says that he lived for 20 years with it so he didn't have chemo or radiation the Swayze of pancreatic in time within 18 months oh they're saying that the met via the the the treatment killed him or are there different kinds of pancreatic cancer stupid lately isn't it like there's a Hodgkins and non-hodgkins lymphoma one is worse than the other Jesus Christ I said Steve lived for 20 years of his cancer it seems he did not have chemotherapy or radiation treatment at all the Hollywood actors pay who's that answering this this is what is this this is a bullshit see by the way I'll go up there right there Walter Isaacson he's writing the Steve Jobs biography he told 60 minutes that Steve refused what could have been potentially a life-saving surgery hmm but he did have more than one surgery right didn't he have his liver replaced or as I feel like he had a liver transplant what is it that makes a guy not want a surgery that might work like do people become delusional than that they're that or are they afraid of the surgery are they willing just to die like fucking Zappa hey to go to the doctor and he died Lucy 56 what was wrong it was a cancer I was just calling cancer or prostate the surgeon who gave Steve Jobs a new liver in two more years faces new questions that's 2013 what is it saying it says he bumped Memphis House for job convalesced what the leader bought the Memphis house did the doctor yeah he bought the house where Steve Jobs was living yes they said the guy who was treating George Harrison born on a guitar design lived in the fucking Hospital he signed this real quick yeah yeah revelation came with the end of a southern transplant mark boo boo Bulls say that name perusquia puru puru operate press kia press q / s kia press kia front page story route ER ru squ i perusquia front page story Thursday in the Memphis commercial advocate piece paints a vivid picture of the life-saving operation although it takes most of the details about jobs from the Walter Isaacson biography and blah-blah-blah-blah-blah so why what is the question how did jobs move to the top of the list oh it's one of those things it's like Frank Underwood in the fuckin yeah well I probably paid somebody Jesus how the fuck do you think he gets the top of the list yeah when you have 50 billion dollars you can move around yeah when the way you're emailing is because of something you've invented you probably get to the fucking top of the list fast yeah I wonder what killed his liver wonder if it was medication like medication for I know it a friend who just died from pancreatic cancer and he had it for quite a few years I met him I met him in 2014 and he already had it and he just died it says he once refused Tim Cook's liver transplant offer because he has the same rare blood type as him Wow whoa Tim Cook would have given Steve Jobs a calm patch uncle liver boy that's intense yeah than anyone's have taken over the company eh whoa yeah watch it must have been yeah if you want to give you a boss your liver I wouldn't get my boss a hat yeah I guess obviously they were good friends but could you imagine that's intense man well your liver is something that regenerates Hospital where jobs receive transplant was given 40 million dollars by him Wow that's how you do it yeah I guess he was appreciate a lot yeah let's look that's how you get to the front of one yeah what do you think the lines are supposed to be fair you fucks there's a way to cut yeah 40 million lady can cut yeah you give some money to the hospital is probably gonna save a shitload of lives we went to before he came here at my radio agent died of cancer he was like 64 was 55 was not that old and he had a cancer of Limp well I think the lymph nodes and he fucking was getting a little bit better we thought and then when the correlation between these people and he's like super high stress jobs like agents it can can I know strep buddy Bob was not a stressed guy though unless he swallowed all that he was a very calm guy like literally he was a gentle and he gave you bad news gently but firmly he was a very very unique guy he was not stressed unless he swallowed it and never showed it but he seemed like a very zen guy and it was something with his running for a breathing thing and just died I guess I'm enough weight on the table and on how the details fuck man but yeah he was not that old I mean it was like you know 64 when I'm 49 so here's someone 64 you that's fucking that's a graspable age I wonder like you know obviously there's so many different factors that play into like the lifespan the difference between life spans today life spans a hundred years you know 200 years ago yeah and obviously there's been some big advances in medicine but I wonder like how much our diet plays on the amount of cancer I mean it's gotta have a huge factor all this sugar all the bullshit people eat all the preservatives smoking pollution they say that just living in a city can take up to ten years off your life that's also probably like it's probably the air and is probably probably the stress to keep people in the city or just are stressed yeah I'm sure all that stuff goes into it I mean we try to avoid it but I try to eat healthy like grilled chicken but fun when I never took into consideration until just a couple years ago I read an article on the effects of brake dust like when you're around a high population area and people constantly hitting their brakes really yeah when you're in traffic all the time those brakes when you you know you're cleaning your wheels and you get that brake shit all over your wheels sure that stuff's in the air that black sooty shit that shit gets in the air and if you're in a place like say if you're in Manhattan and you got like a you know second floor walk-up your windows open you're just taking in break though you're breathing that in all the time you'll wipe it off your fucking furniture and shit you'll see it on your table it's something you never no one ever thinks of either I've never heard anyone discuss break dust but it's something that's all over the place well we find dust back there Jamie like what is that dust that we keep finding back there it's all black yeah it's probably just like LA dirt so because it's dry and dusty around but it's black yeah oh yeah I mean it that I see it in my house too and all right but I mean back there it's weird because we have a closed garage door just comes in under the air yeah yeah we have this workout equipment and when we wipe the workout equipment like if we go back there right now and put a wet paper towel to that reverse hyper machine the top event it's all black like black dust wait there's stuff behind that yeah it's a whole warehouse but there's many times I've been in this room I thought this was the entire room no I had no idea what a cool fucking sectional that is yeah there's a room back there and there's another room behind it okay scientists find new ways of freeways are trying to kill you what is it saying that the arteries thickening progressing twice the average in people living within a hundred meters of a freeway the connection between particulate matter and artery thickening or statistically significant for some groups yeah that's what they're talking about that's break dust and shit that's coming out of exhaust pipes according to LA Times 1.5 million people live within 300 meters of a freeway and the LA basin last year we found out the freeway pollution travels much further than that as much as 2500 meters from the source fuck all that so if you know I wonder if it's the same in Manhattan I'm sure it is but or maybe because Manhattan has leather you pie have a lot less cars going by your Street in Manhattan than you do there 2500 meters is far how far is that in like feet or miles a mile a mile that's fucked man everybody a mile from the highway is getting poisoned Jesus you hope it but how old is that study and is it still happening as much like our brake our brakes made me better now than they were a few years ago it's the same thing no the same thing this 2010 brakes are the same I mean there's no difference there they're the same fucking things they've always had these pads they press down they wear out you got to replace them and when they're wearing out there grinding down that powder isn't going anywhere right someone should probably figure out a way how to contain that I mean that seems like what we're doing now is it just it just goes out into the atmosphere maybe they should be like contained like where the powder the brakes would work the same way but the powder would have to be like sucked yeah into some sort of a pouch or something and you have to change it like a filter how long would you have to change it probably all the time but that seems like that would be like a real viable alternative like some sort of encased brake thing you know I mean that doesn't seem like outside of the realm of engineering well can they make the brakes if that sounds unfeasible can they make the brakes out of something that is actually just not as bad for you is there anything they can do that might be a little bit of a fix well I think anything you breathe if you breathe in sawdust it sucks for you it's a particulate matter like you're taking in things and you're taking in a certain kind of dust into your lungs and becomes an irritant this is not good not good Wow I'm sad sad for all those people that live near the highway well they live near the highway and I have my lifestyle so I guess we're all going to fucking drop that a lot earlier than we judges and you don't have HIV no keep a rubber on you're gonna be fine I can't don't anybody come in your butt and everything's gonna be okay this is fuck you want a party killer I know I've got a lot of rules but don't condoms though I can't wear them now well that's gonna be a problem it's definitely a problem my fucking dick shrivels how many guys have gotten AIDS from from regular sex though probably very few very few probably very everybody should have it I'm sure I'm sure it's somehow physically possible but you probably have to have so many things lined up to get it from fucking a pussy or even fucking an ass yeah you have to have so many things well I'm sure it can't happen though yeah what's it's the issue is it has to get into your body but I know that people get sick all the time from having a cut and then getting someone's blood in their cut yeah like that's happened to people in hospitals that have done surgery and like cut their finger while they're doing it and they get infected by the blood of someone else yeah that's that's common right so a little cut on your dick I mean when I had that I've told the story most people especially I had a threesome what ron jeremy after the porn Awards it was yeah it was fun it didn't feel necessarily sexy but it was fun sexy yeah it was yeah it was a goof you know is like a girl and he's fucking her so he went into the bathroom he was fucking one girl and he fucked another one yeah I remember you put rubbing alcohol on his dick and I don't know if that's that good for you but I think he was doing to make sure he didn't have a cut but he well he did that before he fucked her I think to think to make sure yeah or something yeah to make sure that it was clean in the window cuts is so hardcore it is but you know his dick is probably seeing a lot of action that might be a way to keep things off it yeah if that guy doesn't have AIDS who the fuck is getting AIDS yeah you know I'm not think about that you're not lucky I'm not a lucky guy yeah think about that if that guy doesn't have AIDS fuck yeah I mean I do realize I've rolled the dice way too many times and I'm like I'm lucky now I'm really grateful like a fuck man you just stop well it's also your you know I just think it's harder to get like for a man than it is for a woman it seems like unless again you let somebody come in your but yeah that can be harder I think it's harder to get but am ia doctor nobody right I think it is hard it's hard to feel like I'm about to go fuck without a rubber right now Rogan says oh no but I think they're you're right it probably is harder to get me when she have a cut on your dick and she has a cut in her pussy and they happen to just go air tight against each other I mean come on yet for a woman like you got to think like all their everything's exposed right all that area inside their vagina is all like open tissue right it's all like absorbing they have the worst situation they do setup but I think the air I was told years ago by a woman who worked in the health field that it's such it is such a delicate virus that if you like she's like a blow job you won't even get it from she's like because that you your stomach kills the semen she's like you can't give him a blow job I which I don't know how true that is but she told me that fucking she lived in Elkton Maryland I remember she was a really cute girl I met at a road gig and I remember the fucking town she lived in she was telling you this before she blew you and I don't worry about it yeah don't worry about it stomach acids watch [Laughter] really she was a wonderful health practitioner she fucking drained about a gallon of seeds and told me we're all gonna be fine Elkton Maryland good girl isn't it crazy though that so many diseases kill people from sex yeah I mean syphilis gonorrhea those are those fatal without you know like that's isn't syphilis what killed Al Capone um I think so yeah I believe even did but in the 20s there was nothing they could do for right right yeah but I mean it's just amazing that untreated so many diseases turn I mean think about how few things other than like severely compromised immune systems to get hit by the flu you know the people that died from the flu actually it's old people or young really young people they're kind of frail they wanted getting sick and dying from common colds and things along those lines but most people they get better from it can you imagine shooting cancer out of your dick you for that was like fucking that would be like that's where right we have a problem if you could if you could give somebody cancer sexually I know they say oral section throat cancer is possible well HPV right yeah human papillomavirus can give some women ovarian cancer yeah or you can get it in your throat if they have it for meeting pussy well isn't that what the Michael Douglas thing was they said that fucking Catherine zeta-jones put the kibosh on that she's like not true plus we're getting a divorce oh yeah man she must have been with you he went out and started talking about that and she's everyone's look at her pussy that must have been so annoying you know Michael throat cancer and oral sex photo of him if I get a few google throat cancer in oral sex Michael Douglas comes up yeah that's got to be a bummer yes I probably should hipster mouth shut about that but she was like I cracked me if I'm wrong but wasn't she suffering from like some serious mental illness like some some ruthless bipolar type shit no I don't know yeah I think Catherine zeta-jones is like pretty open about mental illness I didn't know she was it's not surprising that somebody that hot like there's always a price to pay yeah there's always you know you take someone that beautiful that hurt yeah her private struggler struggle Catherine zeta-jones bipolar disorder well you know it's true because it's in people celebrity yeah they always get to the bottom of others yeah she's too hot that's the problem nature just gives her a fucking curveball yeah you want to be hot how about beautiful and you want to hang yourself during a Sanka commercial hey you go she says I torture my husband had it tough few years from her husband's cancer to own public battles by ports ordered now the Hollywood stars back with a new film and film not not really new original because she's kind of vanished off the face of the map yeah you gotta wonder like when people there's I was looking at some pictures the other day of some movie star that I forgot who his name was but he was like in a ton of movies and that oh the guy that was in platoon with the scars all over his face Tom Berenger Tom Berenger and then just vanished you know what he kind of did man and I don't know why did it come up being a schoolteacher there's nothing worse than the white schoolteacher in the black school we get it we get it you're rescuing them fucking Hollywood assholes Michelle Pfeiffer and how great was she in Dangerous Minds remember gangster's paradise was the theme song and she was gonna go in there and with that bad accent and she was it was funny cuz she was - this is why people feeling like their music was getting lame where I think he was Bob Dylan lyrics she was teaching the young ruffians with that's like desperate white people wanting to go like look black guys are stuff school and they leave their cell like oh shit these are trouble times you know that's what it is can we check that if it was a Bob Dylan song first shoot a homeboy aah oh my god she wrote that down out of who should you shoot Kathryn her fucking shit she looks like Gilbert Grape with that hair - she was really hot but not in that one yeah and she had a leather jacket on show she was hard yeah or even endorse wears her leather jacket she was not her act it was not good gangster what was the accent it was southern but it kind of went back and forth I know she's from Tennessee Lenexa I think they make a decision one day the first day of shooting is 40 minutes into the film and 40 minutes off you know deep into the movie that's the first day of shooting and then they start somewhere else and they change the accent and it just changes by the time they get to 40 minutes in the movie picture of her with Coolio look at that yeah that's it going Coolio one fear factor did he really yeah and he was so high I mean so high I would open up his trailer door and just get a fucking ferocious contact hi just from opening the door I was like what - a ting God well I don't know I did what you a call Marc Maron had a show called Never Mind the Buzzcocks and one of the guests on there was Coolio and I did with mundum Wonder Mike from the Sugar Hill Gang Coolio never mind the buzzcocks might yeah Marc Maron it was a British show and then Marc Maron hosted it here in late 2000 and he was one of the guests that anybody he loved me we had so much fun and I saw him years later and he had no memory that we'd ever met so he I like do you love it he literally died I told him he literally got on his knees and was bowing to me cuz I said something fucked up so he was just enjoying it right so Mike the guy will definitely remember me it's like fucking dumb Slick Rick I brought him onstage at the Comedy Cellar one time we took a photo together I saw him years later in the airport nothing like how do you not remember being on brought on a stage from the audience if I was watching a show and they brought me up on stage man he was like padilha picture a lot of those guys in me they meet so many people that they're hard drivers is constantly full they're just constantly deleting files which is understandable it was just the circumstances that were weird like not the fact that it was like me like I've interviewed people and they don't remember me but I get that because I've done radio shows and I don't know who the fuck you are 10 minutes later you know oh yeah yeah you and Slick Rick at the site one of my favorite photos in history he was in the audience and none of the comedians would talk to him so I was going to I was tell him I loved him and I'm like I'm taking a photo with you after the show and Manny the owner was in there and he goes do it now Manny was so great and so fucking Rick you might say did he get shot in the eye or something I don't know how his I I believe he got shot or he did something like that was in a children's story like there was something similar in his real life when he went to jail like that rap a children's story but I don't know exactly how his I went I thought maybe he I thought he had an interesting story for that but maybe he didn't I interviewed Coolio before he won fear factor and the last stunt that he won he was telling me that this is already over he's already done this he's lived a thousand lives and a thousand universes and he was just so barbecued it was like inspirational Wow I was like I was listening to almost like whoa but because he was so high like I think it just had no nerves going in he just sort of did the event like it was nothing I'm afraid yeah complete of some balance thing I forget what it is they were on some beams or some shit it's a fucking amazing nobody died doing that show I look back at it sometimes and I just go who are they doing it again with another host yeah with Ludacris that's right Ludacris is doing it they did it once I don't know if they're gonna keep doing it apparently was kind of a flop was it yeah you know why because when it was done it was very timely but now what the Internet has gotten so much faster and we can watch everything on our phone it's kind of hot like you can see real-life deaths yeah so it's kind of hard to see people doing crazy stuff when you can turn it on and just see someone do it without a show around they're just doing it well it's also they did it without the original production team and the original production team like they cut the budget substantially so look con cheap and then the stunts Warren is dangerous like the original production team there were wizards I mean they were really good at that kind of show and they did a hundred and forty eight episodes of the first season and then we came back we did six more so there was a I mean they had just massive amounts of experience of putting together like the stunt people the the be stunt people B stunts were all the gross things like all that stuff was I think they didn't do any gross stuff this time around definitely the lawyers I got involved they probably now as corporate the lawyers apparently you know and then they're like worried about lawsuits and no matter what you saw they still gonna sue so the lawyer fire chop ply that shit out or they couldn't get insurance well with NBC the second inter eight iteration of Fear Factor and like what was it like 2012 or something like that when we did it again 2011 2012 when we did it again they were off I think was 11 they did it it was off the deep end scary like they went way to a jar yeah it was dangerous I thought it was dangerous like that some of the stunts they were doing were like so much more intense than the stuff that we had done before I'm like this is fucking weak someone could get hurt here did you not want to do it after that a third like a second season of the new iteration you should one do it well they cancelled it because people had a drink come why that should have automatically out of the second season that's what got it cancelled the way they played horseshoes for a donkey come yeah they were throwing horseshoes and you know no matter what you had to drink some cum like if you landed a perfect ring toss something you only had to drink like a couple of ounces but these drink these dudes were drinking like beer steins have come Wow why they can't with a complaint with the network go yeah they went too far TMZ got a hold of footage and they put [Laughter] NBC past on I mean they they passed they said okay to all the stunts right so they they they cleared all of the ridiculous stunts that they wanted to do and this was the most ridiculous like getting people to drink come on television yeah that's rough well it's just like it's so over the top and that's the idea was that they couldn't have fear factor the way they used to have it before they had to be it had to be bigger badder crazier fear factor and so the second version of it was just completely over the top a little too much and they pushed it too far and it grows people out yeah they drank donkey piss and donkey come and it was twins so one twin how to drink the piss wow she's drinking piss and the other girls drinking come wow that's a lot of a mug a mug of calm oh my god what a great girlfriend she must be though fucking ace you know what's interesting a lot of the girls wanted a drink to come rather than drink the piss of course they have experience with it the piss is a grosser think umm they're like I come it's not great but I've and that guy drank come and look at that they're hugging they got come on their shirts well it was deep man there's only been two times ever in the history of the show where I said to the producers hate don't know him do this and that was one of them you said they shouldn't do it I said it's too much it's it's too crazy oh my god I wanna come a shot of Palmer chugging it down oh my god I'm and chugging the town with me my fucking stupid big head hovering over here telling you to do it you were encouraging her to Jay the cop yeah it's like you know I mean I wanted her to win I wanted I wanted them all to win it's part of the problem with doing that show you like them well yeah I mean hopefully you wanted people to you know I was like a coach or a motivational speaker as much as I was a host tell him you can do it why did you get in their head and you just tell them like look you just put one foot in front of the other and just don't don't entertain any thoughts of quitting because a lot of quitting is just in your mind a lot of quitting is just your mind saying man we can't do this man we should find a way out man fuck this this is just too uncomfortable whereas if you can just force yourself to push those aside and don't entertain those thoughts at all you can get through a lot of things you can't get through yeah yeah that's the hard part is when you start telling us it's almost thinking people push themselves I mean Matt Serra's actually talking about Ray Longo and the way he'll push you past where you think you can go but my problem is I'll stop when I think I have to stop but I guess there is this stuff in the reserve tank but it just feels like there's nothing there well it's a mindset it's like if you get your mind accustomed to convincing your body that enough is enough and then you start entertaining those thoughts and thinking of those thoughts more than thinking about concentrating on the task at hand you start thinking about boy if I just quit now I can quit all this uncomfortable feeling and stop yeah all this heaving of my breath or burning of my legs or whatever it is that you're doing that can all stop all the nervousness can stop like you see a lot of times before fights we've had several instances over the course of the history of the UFC most the time doesn't happen but several instances where people get anxiety attacks and you could attribute that to a lot of different things right you could say well some people just have anxiety and well what is an anxiety attack well some people believe that a lot of what's happening is the mindset that you're entering into a fight with and that you're allowing your mind to just sort of run rampant rather than corralling it and channeling your mind into very distinct pathways like very distinct pathways of only beneficial thoughts and you will vacillate and deviate from those thoughts but always bring it back to those very important thoughts and to have some sort of a mantra like you are here to do your very best that's it and all thoughts of quitting if your body fails on you that's one thing but let it fail don't don't don't entertain those thoughts oh my god now it's time to quit don't stop yeah don't don't entertain those thoughts and there's a guy named David Goggins we've talked about on the podcast almost too much but he's a very famous endurance athlete who's a things a Navy SEAL and he has the world record for the most amount of chin-ups in a day and you know how many some insane amount right he's doing he will do sets of five where he does five chin-ups and he does them over the course it was over a thousand right but he doesn't intensify it was 2,000 yeah that way it doesn't burn his arms out oh but I'll only take him between each one it takes a little break you know do five take a little break relax a little do another five take a little break relax a little okay again and he attempted it more than once because one time he did it as forum two or a thousand and oh my god yeah so that guy one of his statements is most people quit at 40% most people quit at 40% of what they're capable of really yeah and I think that's absolutely accurate you know I I think about that all the time I think about all the time when I'm on a hard run like you got to know when you run in like Hills and particularly got to know when you're just fucking exhausted and you running the risk of falling down and you really can't breathe right like you're you're really pushing because but you like things like sprints or hill sprints you will reach anaerobic threshold yeah you'll reach a place where like you really can't go any further your heartbeat is 185 beats a minute you can't do it yeah you're you're blowing your shit out I mean you it's gonna fail but like when is it failing and when are you quitting cuz there's like some uncomfortable moments when my heart's like 150 160 where if I was feeling like a pussy I'd like we just take a break here and breathe you know which is what Bert Kreischer does yeah he probably has to having a man it's a lot of its mental do you think he's just quitting yeah yeah it's right not to go cuz you feel like your mind is telling you like I'm on the treadmill I can't do much yeah exactly you can't do it it's fucking boring too that's why I like running outside yeah I don't like running I think running on a treadmill would be great if you had a fucking awesome movie in front of you yeah like I save you were watching platoon and you're running on a treadmill it's right in front of your apocalypse now and you're listening to it yeah yeah I mean you can get into it but I like running outside because I know where I'm going and it's that's part of the goal like I if I reach this peak that means it's a mile you know one point six miles and then another one point six back can you run farther in real life or in a treadmill I don't run on treadmills oh yeah but if you had to look which one could do any more on a trip you can oh for sure first of all the way I run I'm running all hills like I don't really run flat when I'm running flats for very short periods of time it's only flat in between hills I fucking hate hills there they're terrible but here's the thing I kick box yesterday for the first time in months I hadn't done any any pad work any bag work anything like that and I was going through rounds like it was nothing it was crazy like it was so different the cardio is better oh my cardio is way better just from running these hills could I do it I'm committed to doing it twice a week I try to do it three times a week but I'm committed to doing it twice a week so I did it today and I did it Monday how long does it take you to run the hills an hour my workouts an hour okay his fucking Peru tile dude at the end of lost several pounds of water I'm completely exhausted I'm drained but when I do other stuff I have way more endurance and I feel great after like right now like I'm so relaxed like after that happens you just feel so good like you feel like like regular life is not as it's just not as hard because the the running is so difficult I should try that you know I fucking hate run so much but I'm so bored in the gym we live in Manhattan yeah it's C but there's still the park I mean it's kind of there's this little place you could run there but you're not running you know you know what you should do that's nothing there's nothing wrong with that I mean running is definitely a good thing as long as you're doing it the right way and running on the balls of your feet and not on the heel and but try taking yoga you know I like yoga I like women with yoga bodies that fucking long live long lean like thorax that's a sexy look on a woman or acts like they just have like a bit like an insect body almost it's long and lean sex what's that are you into bugs no but that's the best way I can compare them I've had bugs on me I don't care for them three times are you a bug catcher no those guys are crazy man fuck yeah they actually almost want it yeah they do want they want to hear that's a pressure tell people what we're talking about blood catchers are guys I've only heard it being gay guys maybe the straight guys are too but they'll go out and fuck guys tryin to catch HIV yeah or let guys fuck them let guys fuck that yeah I mean let guys fuck them to catch HIV like they really they want it and I personally think it's because then the pressure is off that's my guess I don't comprehend I think it's a self-hate thing well maybe yeah I think it's the same reason why some people want to amputate their hands people are just nuts yeah that is kind of a nutty thing to do to want to catch you know like why I don't even want it now even though I know that there's medicine that stops it well we're talking about this yes sir is like people that why do people like fisting it's just a show that your your past what everybody else is thinking of as hardcore like I'll take a whole fist right up to the elbow some women's pussies are weird though man like I gave the guy first I was the girl you used to feel I could never get all of it in I would get I have little hands too but I would get like the first four or like part of my knuckle and that would be our dirty talk like she would go crazy when I would talk to her and tell her that like I was what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna curl the thumb when I told I was gonna curl the thumb she knew that the fist was going in she'd go fucking nuts even I was just talking dirty to her I would say I'm gonna curl the thumb and she knit that metal he's putting his fucking final words bitch yeah I could never get all of it in like I would get it in like this like like a praying mantis like you're poking like a bird yeah well your thumb is touching the four curled it's cheating it's a cheating way to fist somebody I don't get it my asshole is zero ability to take more than a finger woo yeah a whole fist there's a video that Nick Swardson sent me and Whitney were talking about it yesterday where there's a dude he's holding it dude up like in front of him like you know I got a sort of a backpack on the front you know the guys around him and he's got his fists all the way up to the elbow and this guy's ass he just keeps like pumping it up in there and he's holding the guy yeah he's holding him up oh like he's got his arm wrapped around him and then the other arm is just going in there credit to both of those guys whoo yes amazing they're pioneers for sure that reminds me of holding up I was watching season two again of The Ultimate Fighter and there's one thing where they do it how long how many rotations around the heavyweight can I think they were either a middleweight or a welterweight do where he climbs on top of the heavy I've never seen that before and he was going around like how many different times can you go around this heavy which body without touching the ground I figured 10:50 I mean it was fucking like a hundred or 200 times yeah they went around it was the ability to hold somebody else up is just but see the thing about something like that is doing a contest like that you got to realize that person's blown their body out for days after that if that's not something you're accustomed to and you're doing on a daily basis that's like doing us a chin-up contest like David Goggins like if you do that don't plan on fighting you know a week right as your arms are gonna be blown out like your legs are gonna be blown out you're gonna get fucked up it's definitely a good skill to have but doing something like that you could do it one time to find out what your max is but don't plan on recovering from that anytime soon that's the thing about people and injuries like one of the big problems with injuries with MMA fighters jiu-jitsu people a lot of people is overtraining meaning you're you're not prepared for what you're doing like I have a friend my friend cam Haines runs a marathon a day he runs a marathon every day well he had to build up to that wait does he really yeah yeah he's training for this 238 Mile mob race in October so if you're running 238 miles his ideas he gets a marathon in every day so his body is just constantly used to this sort of stress but for him it's not that big a deal like he'll run a marathon it's not a problem but if you tried to run a marathon every day your body would break down you'd have some serious issues I'm the first day I couldn't do it yeah but again you might be able to do it it might be able to take you eight hours you might be able to get through it but you're gonna be fucked up for a while but if you built up to it slowly over time you could develop the kind of muscular endurance that allows you to do something like that you get conditioned to it so like doing something like that where you're doing like these rotations around someone or you're doing like how many times you climb to the top of a 30-foot rope you know someone's doing something like that if that's not something you do all the time and you just try to do it once like on a television show for funsies sure you could fuck yourself up like no listen yeah no I'm just saying okay things along those lines like when you're trying to do as many as you can anytime you're doing as many as you can like how many bodyweight squats can you do maybe 100 you know like okay let's see if you can get to 500 good luck walking yeah a couple days if that's if you try to do that I like a couple is it now this guy does chin-ups does he do like the perfect military ones probably if he's a Navy SEAL I'm sure you boys full body hand up yeah those kipping chin-ups are coming what's the keeping tonight where they flop around like a fish do you see the ones where they go they lift up and then they go higher like they pull their full body above yeah yeah you just chin up and then you do a dip and it's not it's a lot of people think it's not the best functional exercise they think it looks cool and everything like that but they don't believe it's a it's a vest functional exercise but the guys that can do that so like I've looked at guys do there was these guys that do these these guys these guys are freaks these are outdoor guys you know where they workout outdoors and they can just do an endless amount of things outdoors they can like hold the bar sideways yeah look at what this guys doing he's just doing like chin-ups and dips and he's doing dips inside it's incredible the upper body strength and control yeah not just the strength but like the static control he's able to do like oh my God he's fuck it looks like being blown in a hurricane yeah a lot of people do those really called flagpoles yeah can you do that I've never done that yeah what am I saying that's surprising of course I can't do it yeah it's not easy but I could do it so whatever what does that make these guys I don't have that kind of balance like that guy is he's doing like a dip to a handstand I can't do that in between two bars yeah and these guys they all wear gloves which I find interesting I guess they do that because the the bars get sweaty yeah you also you'd want to slip and probably flex your hands up mm-hmm yeah I used to work little fingerless gloves when I worked out just to keep my hands I'm like curly from mice and men like dice yeah exactly keep my hand smooth and squares those cousin want to shake hands all right I please I was like I was out of the roads I should do when someone would come over he curls his he's a fingerless glove I'll curl his fingers into the glove and give them a fist to shake the fucking worst handshake so crazy he hated shaking hands with people and he would go in washes I remember one time we were out to eat and some guy he washed his hands a guy came over shook his hand inside oh god I had to go to the bathroom again it's so funny that he's just he's such a pig on stage but he hates germs he likes fucking honey in his tea like he's just a big mama's boy he likes to be comforted yeah he's a he's a very interesting guy dice and he's also in a lot of ways a pioneer because he was one of the very first ever superstar stadium Kamini yes he was there was no one like that like even Kinnison never hit that level before Steve Martin I think at one point and had that but yeah but and he had a tremendous mystique to him to Steve Martin was was was the biggest comic in the world for long for sure but dice had this thing where he he came out like a fist and just punched through everything no one saw him coming there was no SNL it was just this fucking animal like I remember the first time I standardized play I was with a girl named Melanie who I know know whatever the fuck your name is my Michelle my girlfriend I was 18 I was at her house and she's a come in here this guy's so dirty and I stood there I watched Andrew Dice Clay it's the first time I swear how you remember yeah Richard prized my favorite Carla I don't remember the first time I saw them but I remember the first time I saw her I remember the first time I played dice a dice cassette to this girl that I was dating her name was Marta she was from Nicaragua and we were in my car I think I was like I think I was 19 and we were sitting in my car playing this Dice Clay thing fucking howling laughing I couldn't believe how dirty that was now funny it was it was it was it was dirty and it was funny do you ever have Florentine on no oh yeah Jim on I feel like I have 40 is hilarious it when he used to do is you'd make his girlfriend mix tapes of all these romantic songs and he would put fucking bits from the day the laughter died and the day that laughter died in just a line or two like a really nice song man I want to eat you cunt in a big red chair and then I saw a glass of milk dude my favorite heckle I never yeah oh good because dice have been talking about drinking milk and slipping I don't like it scum people are slipping like it's somebody's load and the guy so mad the audience he can't grasp what to say she was sure about funnies a bottle of milk because he just used what dice had just said on stage well we explain to people the data laughter died was when dice was on top of the world he decided to record at Dangerfield's unannounced so Dangerfield's in New York is uh historically been like a poorly attended club sure like we would do shows that this is how poorly attended it is I did a show there once where I think my spot was probably like at nine o'clock and I got there at 8:30 and there's just a couple of comics hanging out at the bar I was like what's going on and they go no one's here yet and I go what no one's here there's no audience so two people showed up a couple they said we're here to show and remember Scotty the big guy the big Irish guy you know Bobby Bobby rather well the I didn't know oh yeah bodily was Scott I'm sorry yeah Bobby he was like right this way ladies and gentlemen and he brought these people into an empty room they like what yeah and he sat them down and then the emcee went up so they started the show a half-hour late because that was the first time people showed up and we all did sets for two fucking people I've done oh shit it was really weird so dice decides to record his album there unannounced with no material he had no preparation he just wing the entire thing and it's both brilliant and terrible at the same time it's a 2-cd thing because it was like he was up there for fucking hours he three nights he did fucking three nights and he was up there well that's dice at Dangerfield's from the special you know you can that's when he did Rodney Dangerfield specials we don't Kenny toured with him no no that he was on Rodney Dangerfield's HBO special that's how he broke and then he came back and did the day the laughter died but I don't there's any pictures 1990 club so that Kenny was with him when he did those those scenes I'm so jealous that he got to watch those tapings well Kenny was like his body art or something right was good manager by 2-yard when I first started to her theis it was like 1997 and it was Kenny was the road manager in a bodyguard was at Rodney and Fabio Wow is that who's that I suggest Rodney's wife were getting married I guess is that Rodney's wife or no is that Fabio getting married someone's getting married Fabio can't get married with his shirt open like that Aegis so that data laughter dive for comedians there was a guy named Mike Donovan who's a boston comedy legend fucking hilarious hilarious comedian and he is the one who talking about the day laughter Todd didn't eat we were the back of the comedy connection he was just laughing until he was crying talking about dice doing an impression of Nixon while he's eating yeah yeah I mean he was doing a Nixon impression while he's eating ass and for whatever reason Mike Dunham and thought it was the funniest thing you never heard in his life he's just crying and laughing it's like this is a brilliant brilliant album it is Rick Rubin producer yeah for that album yeah and what it's a it's an odd masterpiece it's uh it's it's it's like beautiful that he did that because there is a flow to it but it's like it's the greatest watching a comics mind just fucking randomly bounce from joke to joke to bomb to joke and just really exploring and grabbing for shit yeah and there's no material preparation you know I know you can tell he's just totally ad-libbing just yeah that's the album covers right yeah I remember getting it and listening to and being so cuz look at that cassette one yeah and people who didn't know I like it was awesome who didn't like it knocks what is this but uh Chris Rock was at the cellar one night and I forget how and he was the best comedy album ever one of them he said Davidoff laughter that by yeah but that's also the best comedy album for him because he's a comic and yes he he thinks it's hilarious this guy just went up there and just had no fucking no preparation whatsoever I've left harder but your prior albums and I did it that they're better comedy records but as far as being a pure thing to show like what comics do sometimes to work stuff out he'd literally like you said top of this game he was a fucking 1990 when I probably sold a million copies of that - yeah - a fucking 800,000 unhappy people he even called it the day the laughter died he didn't give a fuck he would go up sometimes and literally like to see how long he could go without getting a laugh in clubs he would just fuck around and see how long he could go and not get a laugh my favorite dies is insult dice when you find some in the audience and go look at you look at you look at your fucking hair digging on people and they wouldn't know as a laugh or be upset and it would be like it was almost angry at them for being alive he described woman's tits um and he it he goes look at those big fat fucking motherfucking fat fucking tits and it was really dirty but I'm like my god that's the emotionally the best description of tits everyone's that's their big ones that's how you feel though you know you can't get the words that will describe the lust of big breasts more than fat fucking motherfucking fat fucking if there was something so guttural about that I'm like that's the greatest description of tits and the buddies every given as far as emotionally for a guy well you know what dice did to that nobody else had ever done before or since is he created punchlines that everybody wanted to repeat yes those rhymes amazing who wanted to repeat what's in the bowl bitch like he would point the microphone to the audience and they knew the punchline and they would yell it out Cheers yeah you earned a left to die they tried doing a palming there's no stupid like doing homes no poems yeah yeah no homes not even hey I'm not doing that like Robin Williams did in the album called reality what a concept which was the first dirty album I ever had was Robin Williams reality would come before even prior and he and somebody yelled out Mork and Robin goes I'm not doing work I'm here to do something different like he did it nicely and people clapped but he didn't go know like with dice they hated him that night and they're just trying to connect like weird of a poem they almost were being Punk'd like they were there for a comedy show and the most famous comic alive at the time yes came up and just ate dick for three hours the eighth dick for three fucking hours over a three night period it's a nine-hour fucking ball munching but he also you it's funny mainly he dice changed the language like people like what did political correct to start if you look back to when it really kicked in it was they were so disgusted and angry at dice yes that was what kicked political correct plus you know the internet was really kicking and there's a lot of factors but dice is the one who was that he was the straw that broke dick grote hell got people like I can't fucking take any more we have to stop talking this way well he went on MTV remember yeah he did a bunch of jokes that they didn't approve and they banned him from MTV for life yep and meanwhile today that's a goddamn I mean a badge of honor Yeah right nobody wants to be on MTV now but back then it was like holy shit they been dapper man TV Kennison criticized him for that people he went out and Kurt Loder was on TV talking about how unfunny terrible unfunny period jokes you know it's like but it was this this air of like pompous nough Slyke when he was talking about this like this progressive you know Kurt Loder type character that was always like the guy who told you about the amazing cool new bands yeah who's telling the dice just terrible and unfunny and they'll never be on MTV again and I remember thinking that like whoa they banned him from sorry I then from MTV he didn't give a fuck well Kenny again I can't even tell me that the guy Andrew may have told me this too but before he went out he was thinking of doing it there might have been not who's the guy Johnny uh the other Johnny he had with him whose name I don't remember fucking oh my god you know who I'm it's the the Johnny that he travel with for years these are possible not noodles know something Johnny okay but he said he said the dice do you want to be a teardrop or a tidal wave which I thought was such a great fucking piece of advice to give someone before he went out on live television with that dilemma well now I mean now that it's all the the dust has been settled who Johnny what's it was this Johnny no hot tubs Johnny Jesus I never see a comment I don't know he was dices guy here I wrote with dice he toured with them I think he was the road manager at one point but I never met Haase it was Kenny was there when I came in in 1997 but that was the day but I haven't fucking forgetting shit me you went well it's like just like Slick Rick shit happen yeah it does well you have too many experiences yeah you know like you talk to someone who lives in a small town about a small town and the stuff that he does in that town that motherfucker can remember everything you're right but talk to a guy who travels the world and does stand-up and takes pills to stop getting AIDS boy what a sigh of relief I was fuckin I'll tell you one of the most nervous I've ever been was when I took there just to digress for a second was to take the I was so convinced that HIV and I fucking took this oral test that you can get from CBS and there's a weird thing where you just did they said it's like up good up until the last three months it's like I'm a high 90% accurate not a hundred percent but it's a good precursor to the bucket blood so I did it and you have to you right you you rub it on your gums once each and then you put it in this this this folding like almost like a trapper keeper and you close it and they said what happens is there's a red line and if there's two red lines you're positive the one red line stays there and they said do not watch the progress because it'll freak you out don't watch it of course you watch it only for a second because I literally thought I saw the beginning of a second line and I remember closing it and I'm like I have HIV I was fucking convinced I went I remember where I went I went down to the fucking store bought a couple of our x-bars I'm like I'm just gonna have a nice fucking protein bar and go back in 20 minutes whatever it was and I said I couldn't bless that the photograph I couldn't believe that I was negative but I came back and it was clear I was I was a hundred percent convinced that HIV one scary man well anytime is something like that where you don't know if you have it and if you do have it it's a death sentence you know it wasn't even that toes died because now there's so many but this is really a surprise three months ago there's so many medications you can take right but it's the idea of having to tell a partner and like who's gonna want to fuck you at that like that's just a rough one you know I mean I'm dating some I'm gonna tell her well not a Charlie Sheen get it I don't know and if you notice that was the question that Matt Lauer I don't believe asked I don't think they got into it so I don't know yeah so Matt Lauer and him talk because he was getting blackmailed yes he was yeah and yeah and there's a shit ton of lawsuits because he had unprotected sex without telling a bunch of people that he had it that's crazy I mean that's that's crazy even if you're down to zero then you still got to tell them it's not visible because they cannot get down to it's undetectable and I really do think you can't pass it then cuz there are drugs that you won't be able to pass it and perhaps we won't go to get it but I still think you're obligated to say it you know you're obligated to say and then you let that person make the decision right you know I mean you you you can't make that decision for them ya know for sure but I mean this is all cocaine party think yeah I mean everyone's just having terrible judgment yeah I imagine that was quite a bit of doggie behavior in the sheen residence the guy was doing tremendous amounts of blow yeah they would talk about him doing below that would kill a normal sized person I heard somebody - what I heard about the black male and I don't know I really wish I knew who had black none I don't was that somebody got a picture of medication in his medicine cabinet I heard is a video of him sucking a guy's dick I've heard that - yeah I've heard that but I love Astro I mean you think he prided know that videos being - you hope that was taken you know without him knowing yeah who knows maybe when you're coked up your dad film it let's do it yeah you know yes I mean we have kids that's rough I mean otherwise who cares if he sucked the deck who gives a fuck you're great in platoon when you give a shit but you know it gives a fuck major league who's really yeah believe me a very unsung film I did Wall Street it was good in it very good mom him and Martin Sheen together fuck crazy I think that at a certain point in time when you're doing that kind of drugs like you're doing crazy disassociative piles of blow and you're fucking you don't know where the fuck you are you're writing out you're constantly paranoid they said his teeth were rotten out of his head it looked like a few pictures of his teeth did not look like in amazing shape Sheen also doesn't know how he contracted the virus but told Lauer it had nothing to do with needles well then he does have a good idea well how could he say well it means you mean actually had nothing he never did anything with needles rumors about the actors health recently emerged in the tabloid press so where where where's he at now he's like con he's kind of a fucking radio dark no no he just did a film he did a film about 9/11 but people trapped in an elevator he's on and they Connecticut said well you know he had some conspiracy theories they shouldn't have cast this gives a fuck it's a movie none of these people are dead they're alive they just did a movie well do you remember he wrote an open letter to President Obama he's a big fan of Alex Jones and your friend of Alex Jones and he Alex Jones called me up hey man Gary Busey wants to talk to you in the hey Gary Busey and Gary Busey talked to me and he's like I mean Gary peace he's completely out of his fucking life but Gary Busey has an excuse mostly done in a motorcycle accident with no helmet and caved his head in like real bad that's why Gary Busey when you look in one eyes up here he's got that Shannon Shannon Doherty thing going on down here when I was up there it's cuz his literal skull was destroyed in a motorcycle accident hit a fucking curb with his head right yeah and seeing that picture if his eyebrows are up and makes it look like he's okay but I'm gonna guess the one on our right his left is the one that drew yes that's what it looks like his left his jack but we've had him in a couple times when he came back in he remembered my I thought he's loopy but he's not like out of it yeah he knew I mean he wasn't he's a little nutty but he's always been a little nutty but he know he remembers lines he can he can act yes he has right eyebrows up yeah right eyes up and left ones down yeah he had a significant brain injury yeah yeah there it is oh yeah or that before that accident he was a pretty normal guy he has that injury that's fuckin cheap they were they call a TBI so traumatic brain that fucking wide open look at you again well you see guys with both eyes like that they're fucking cooked well there's a little bit of that but I believe this structural damage to his actual skull itself I think I'm almost positive that he hit the curb without a helmet is when LA didn't have helmet laws and he wiped out and curbed his fucking brain and was lucky to be alive yeah I remember correctly yeah I remember when that was but they scare me day I watched up there's a website I go to i watch a lot of terrible things that I shouldn't watch but um I fucking seen these the motorcycle accidents are always watching car accidents because that really does remind me to drive safe but you can't control everything but when I see a guy burning to death in a car or even fucking cut in half I'm like maybe it's not his fault oh yeah he went under a tractor-trailer he was texting and driving and that's what it looks like don't fucking do it so I'm really really cautious when I Drive I by the way we drove in your Porsche less when we did if I can pay and I was like well you're a responsible Porsche driver like you don't drive like an animal at all no you know you pretty much around the limit maybe a little over but you weren't a fucking maniac no I don't drive fast I would never drive fast with a friend the car either I don't I'm not a dickhead driver uh-huh occasionally I have dickhead moments for air when no one's around yeah but I don't I don't put anybody else in danger I don't I don't believe in driving like that no it was a delightful Drive who was not frightening at all it was comfortable did you get nervous when you got in the no no I know I've driven with you before but if I didn't know you I might but just having a Porsche is just known as somebody who's gonna move you know that are in particular because it's so loud and yes so bouncy and you know but I figured you a lot more to lose than I do so I figured you'd be driving safe like I'm like it's not like you want to drive at the guy who has nothing like how you doing I just lost my fucking house I got no gig ladies driving a V yeah two red lines yeah get the CAD Norton I just put a new engine in so yeah you want to go with a guy who's got a little shit more to lose than you do but it was safe comfortable right like those cars because they're light and they're responsive and it's like riding a ride like a Disneyland ride everywhere you go yeah it doesn't I don't like I don't want it's like people how fast have you ever got it - I've never gotten it that fast I don't drive that fast I don't i'm not i like cornering like I'm into cars that like grip and you feel good when you're you're connected to the machine BMW drive like that don't they sure yeah the hand I had one this did the wheel is that kind of stiff mm-hmm and they said that that's for it's because high-performance it grips the road well they have a bunch of different settings you could put on a BMW especially at the em cars they can make that you can vary the stiffnesses of the steering because they're electronic power assist but the if you want a car that lets like really responsive that's a BMW they have an m2 it's a tiny little car it's like one of their least least expensive M cars but most enthusiasts think it's their best one I don't I don't know I've driven I had you know I had the x6 I drove like three in a row right car I was leasing them they were really big cars and I was like I want I kind of wanted the least a Mercedes are a lot cheaper I've never driven ever selling fucking Mercedes were cheaper this was a much cheaper like much cheaper the BMW is just too big I live in the city I have a Clark's I like to drive it's like for what you I am my addiction of I said I kept that because years ago I would ride around and look at fucking hookers yes that was why I did I might have been doing that now like I'm totally out of that the actual cruising pay paying people yeah yeah I PayPal for dirty videos sometimes in movies of girls who are doing things just you know what I mean but just paying for sex the sex trafficking shit just freaked me out too much oh that's awful it freaked me out too much and I know I'm all for consensual like women like yeah I talked to a woman once who was she's I guess you could say she's an escort she did was she had done porn and she stopped doing porn and she said the way she said it she like she said she had clients yeah and I was like well how does that work and she's like well off the record there's a bunch of guys that I've had sex with in the past and I'd like them and they'd pay me and I'll go over there and it's almost like people I really like and I have sex with them and I said like how many times a week shields only need to do it a few times a week and I pay my bills you know I clown girls like that after I stopped like going on certain sites girls like that who I knew it was important me like I knew their lives like who they were anything real names I knew their Facebook like you know what a person's life is and they're just choosing to do this on the side cuz ade you have a chemistry with them and they like you and B they just some of them are just dirty I've met plenty killer just dirty and enjoy it well I didn't know her too well and I didn't ask too many questions but from what she was saying it's essentially like you know she had done porn she want to do poor anymore and she didn't want to be just a quote-unquote hooker but she had a few guys that wanted to have sex and would be willing to pay her and I guess they had pair like a couple thousand bucks and she would just have sex with these guys a couple times a week different guys and she'd make four or five thousand dollars a week and she wouldn't have to worry about shit she could do whatever she wanted to do yeah for as long as her body holds up sure I mean when I talked to this quite a long time ago I think she was probably like 36 or 37 at the time so it's like maybe she can't do that anymore maybe now she's 46 47 or 50 and maybe dudes like how much they try to find an older sugar daddy I think or a guy that they've said that's where they started that's probably they want to wife up to like when you're yeah that's a hard thing for men like a lot of men do not want to shack up with a chick that had sex for money you know I don't mind it like I don't want them doing what I'm with them but I like somebody with the past I really need it because my past is so fucked up I much prefer yours is too what the fuck is this Jamie the Korean grandmothers are sell sucks how do you pull these up so quick what what do you have on tab like what is wrong with you yeah I saw this story the other day I don't remember as a video about the box it's called Bacchus ladies I believe it's a drink called Bacchus so they walk around selling the Bacchus as an energy drink - OH like they're like 40 and 50 year old women but now they're elderly women are doing it - and so you buy the drink but you're buying sex is what you're into oh my god what Paula prostitute Lupo like you buy this drink and I'll give you sex they're like street vendors with energy drinks but when you buy it from them you're really saying hey come with me somewhere I guess what where is this happening in Korea whoa pretty smart workaround so the guys buy the energy drink knowing that they're gonna get some sex that's what that video described yet but that technically is uh you know yeah but I just I've known too many people women I've known who were like pseudo forced into it by a boyfriend and one girl I was talking to recently was yeah my boyfriend made me kind of do it and she wanted to at one point but then he hit me when I didn't want a missing man there's too many people I don't know their story if I can guarantee that's just consensual I'm fine with it being legal I don't care but it freaked me out that there was too many people that I didn't know enough about like I never go to places I never went to those places because they felt too much like the Russian mob or the Asian whatever was controlling them but then even people I thought I knew I'm like I can't guarantee it right and I can't well that's very ethical of you like you were thinking about them being forced into that life over time it just got to me like because the more like I would talk to different people and at first it was like yeah the feminist of course they're gonna say that but then there was certain people that said certain things that someone just said something yeah but see there's some feminists that think it's empowering for a woman to be able to choose what to do with her body right I know I know a woman who's a very smart woman and when she was younger she had done and she's an artist and she had done some sex work but it was just like she fucks some guys for money and like for her was like easier than working yeah and I'm not saying I I think it should be legalized I think that people should be able to do that I just personally as I was getting older I'm like this is not what I want to do anymore yeah I think worrying to you well it's also you know it's just any time someone's being forced to do something and then there's potential shame attached to it like I don't think there's anything wrong with sex and I know you don't either but when you attach the potential societal shame aspect of it like your behavior your choices could shame you it could be a real problem you know like the same thing with sex right like people having sex who care everybody have sex we love sex people most people love sex right but the idea of you being caught on film having sex is terrifying for a lot of people yeah it is really weird is really weird like we know you love sex but if we see you having sex well shame yeah it's a really we you're right because it's almost like that's why I hate when people break into these hard drives in the cloud for these celebrities because it's a weird privacy thing like even if you're not doing something you're not supposed to we've talked her to your wife you talk to your girlfriend who wants people hearing that right like it's just embarrassing and it's private look I'm very open about most things sexually in my life but I still don't people to read specific things I've said because it just feels like an invasion of privacy and it's it's also like you didn't write it for other people to hear and there's there's things you say to your friends right that if they took out of context people would go well Jim Norton's a fucking asshole yeah piece of shit like like even in jest like this thing that I did with Arie you know our sent in text messages and I put it on Instagram is obvi I thought pretty obvious that it was in jest but so many people thought it was really the context of your friendship and people who don't understand they don't know you and then there's also the comedian factor like the way we talk to each other on a regular basis is so different than the way a lot of folks can because if you're working in a fucking office job not to five every day you're controlled by human resources and the office standards of behavior you have to follow some sort of firing guidelines of what's term what you can get terminated for those people are on the edge and tiptoeing on fucking broken glass every day it's a scary you know it's Sirius XM is a corporate environment yeah and I'm fuck you I'm a fucking dirty comic and I'm more careful around the women there than half of the fucking newscasters you hear about getting shits like if I know that as a fucking dirtbag don't fucking hit on the women at work ask him gently do you guys know okay and fuck off well not even worse but these guys weren't just doing that they were sexually harass elute lee it's crazy it's not that they were hitting on I mean office environments are just Whitney Cummings is a very funny joke about that I don't want to say it because it's one of her new bits about working in an office but there's so much sexual tension when you're stuck in a room with people for eight hours a day and if two people are attracted to each they're working side-by-side on a daily basis occasionally they test the waters and say shut up things and in saying those fucked up things women are allowed to do whatever they want essentially like it's really hard it's very hard for her to get fired yeah yeah a woman says something dirty you it's kind of funny but if a guy says something unwanted and dirty it's really disgusting because why well because men rape and they're more dangerous and they're scarier you know they're physically more scary so a guy intruding on a woman's space and saying creepy unwanted sexual shit has an air of danger to it yeah whereas if a girl is saying some creepy unwanted sexual shit to me I can go hey stop you know like you can't don't talk too much it's never a precursor to her making you do it yeah it's never she's gonna grab my head and force me to eat her pussy yeah great thought though isn't it being made to do it that's why [Laughter] someone do that I have it yeah it was all right not that no I had a girl I didn't go in I tell you this you try to push a fart out and she shot Monistat 7 on my chest it was fucking horrible Monistat 7 is something girls put in their reduced infection oh geez yeah not my best moment what'd it smell like I don't believe it had a smell I don't remember having a smell she had to explain that it was monster I knew exactly what it was we both knew what it was you know it was a bad scene but she was really fucking sexy big fat ass care about that yeah why not my face idea was mine she said I have to I'm like a head what do you know he said you have to I think she said I have to fart oh she said I have to fire you like fire my mouth yeah we had always done that tonight it's to lift our ass and she's a big great at you know I mean we were kind of sick from that no not that I know of somebody must have put your a terrible way to feel like why didn't I just shower her up first I don't like to shower them up first I don't like that I like this I like a scent I literally like you like that you like your sheep I like them and I telling you like I'll tell the girl I'm dating you and I like you I literally have thrown girlfriends deodorants out really I fucking do you want two distinct a little yes yes but I have to like them oh it has to be it's a chemistry thing that's nature telling you who you should fucking who you shouldn't fuck you some people sent repulses me the smell of their mouth or the smell of their skin repulses me unhealthy people probably or even people that I'm just not meant to breed with but then there's some people the underarm smell to smell their feet when they're stinky it like dude it makes me not dirty I don't like dirty feet like I don't want just like little stinky in socks and sneakers because clean there's a whole fucking thing with me you're intense your eyes line yeah no no socks and sneakers because it's clean because you do feel like a creep when you're talking to a girl and you say to her like I want your feet to be a certain way yeah I would say but you want to let her know don't make them dirty like don't come over and flip-flops or I don't want you walking around on a floor without you I mean like I like I'm a hygiene person you just like sweaty yeah but I've been with that with girls and I've told them like don't shower for three days oh it makes me crazy and what do they say great really the good ones great honestly they fucking love it but again if I don't like you if I'm not attracted to your scent I have no desire for that so that's how I know I meant to be with someone you know Chris Ryan dr. Chris Ryan was a friend of mine was telling me that women when they're on birth control pills their ability to smell whether or not a mate is sexually compatible with them gets hindered by the birth control no it fucks it up but when they have women that are not on birth control pills they can literally smell a man's clothes and find out whether or not they're sexually compatible with them just whether or not they're attracted to him yeah like there's a literally a specific scent and that scent they think is not just like whether or not you're sexually attracted to someone smell but whether or not you're biologically compatible with them yeah I do you remember back in the day when people would get married they would do blood test to see if they could have kids do you member that I don't there was a thing that they used to talk about like people would have tests to see I don't even know it was legitimately scientifically valid but they would have tests like a blood test and I remember people talking about this when I was in high school like that married people would have go and have these blood tests to see if they could not not pregnancy no no not pregnancy but whether or not they were compatible like as far as like raising healthy kids there was some weird I mean it might have been some bullshit fake science that they tried to pass off back in the 70s and the 80s but I distinctly remember people talking this is like before I was anywhere near blood typing compatibility yeah blood types are categorized by a B and O and we're reading something here and given the Rh factor of positive or negative ABO and Rh incompatibility happens when a mother's blood type conflicts with that of a newborn child is possible for the mother's red blood cells to cross into the placenta or fetus during pregnancy yeah but that's some incompatibility between a mother and a child I think it's between a man and a woman and the way they have hooves it's probably bullshit but it was something that people used to do a lot I remember like people talking about it I remember people talking about it when I had a very very limited understanding of biology so I was probably in high school right even before that but I was like what blood test they have to take a blood test I'm like what if you love somebody and you want to get married to them you find out that you take a blood test and it doesn't work out how's that work maybe the work or maybe that's such a nature thing like maybe if it's not meant to be it can still work like you know I mean nature may work on this fucking base level but yeah it's still gonna work but that's like letting you know it work like you know I mean it may still work fine if your scent is off right but the clothes thing makes sense there was a girl I had come over she would come over and we'd fuck around and she wouldn't hurt underarms would smell and it made me fucking bonkers man I was so attracted to her scent she left a jacket in my house the fucking armpits I smelled the armpits for six months they're so fucked up it's dude I fuckin sniffed the arm pitch and I'm not a guy who's into toys we're clothing like as far as a woman I don't really want their panties the girl I'm seeing now I do though I do it I wanna I'm trying to figure out a way I've heard of Fed Ex over nightmare panties I've never asked to go do that my life yeah tell her to put them in a ziploc oh of course of course of course that was number one minute so to tape the ziplock so it doesn't open up yes but I mean that's really ultra rare that I actually want that but this girl's jacket hung in my closet my fucking smell that drove me crazy for months I'm having deja vu today's parent says that you should be getting blood test two for genetic screening because they can find out if you're gonna have potential blood diseases oh that kind of stuff yeah yeah but that's today's parent is at a website yeah who's that knows that a common practice that's what I mean it's just this was like an article that says test you need to be getting before pregnancy and there's like pre pregnancy checkup the man and the woman right have prenatal vaccinations and then sexually transmitted diseases you need to check for two and genetic screening it says they just like Prai overall blood tests yeah it's very interesting because you don't hear about that anymore it's not like you know I hope you don't hear about that from doctors you don't hear about that when people are trying to get pregnant you don't hear about that from newlyweds just don't hear about it the blood tests yeah like getting blood test to make sure that your kids would be healthy well I wonder now though if there's so much stress put on diseased shit like AIDS that the I we still say get a blood test and get tested and all this stuff is handled but maybe we just don't talk about the other aspect of it cuz the big one is HIV or whatever well honey like you know I get you had a check to see what diseases your family has like maybe we're still talking about it but it's just not being phrased the same way well this is why I don't think it's true because we went to a very good doctor and you know I have to have kids I never took a fucking test the shot loads in there and made kids here's a way to do it I mean I just don't I don't know I mean maybe I don't know I don't know about the science of all that stuff and I just don't know why it was never discussed but I do remember being a kid where that was a big deal like that apparent these two parents would get a blood test before they got married to make sure they're gonna have kids and I just never hear about that shit anymore yeah I don't even remember hearing about it back then to be honest but it does make sense like let's just see if there's gonna be like if there's an obvious problem that will show up through the blood test well how fucking weird is it that you could have a different kind of blood than me like your blood might be a and mine might be Oh like your blood is in my body I'm fucked yeah I keep my body's it's not even compatible that's so that's so strange like we vary so much biologically that we have different kinds of blood yeah and one is not good in the other yeah I mean there's some Bloods that are universal I believe it's o+ is a universal blood donor anyone can take it yeah that's what I have I believe that my blood can go into other people's body and it's okay they find out that's true I don't know what I am I probably should know yeah he's probably know I don't know 50 Jesus I know I'm busy I'm fucking like I didn't never check that getting pani sent to me I know I know I'm not really big on the undergarments though I mean you know a couple girls have had them I thought there was sexy what is it about women wearing those stockings with the straps that go up to the underwear thighs because you're seeing something you're not supposed to be seen we Universal red cell donor has type o-negative Oh Oh negative I think I'm not positive universal plasma donor has a B blood type Rh hmm in general Rh negative blood is giving to Rh negative patients and Rh positive blood or Rh negative blood may be giving to our H positive patients universal red cell donor has Type O o negative blood type mm-hmm I need to figure out what I'm talking about yeah I don't know much about the blood stuff and all I mean for me it's just a you know what drives me sexually like I know what I you know well it's it is weird how some people can be like really pretty but you don't find them attractive at all and then other people are not nearly as pretty but you think they're so sexy I've dated people who could well this trigger words that we all like so a good trigger word who that goes a long way like it's not the dirty porn words you know what I mean you like that shit oh shut up no for me it's not it's not a series of words or that kind of shit I'm not I don't I guess I'm not as dirty as you but for me it's just a personality thing comfortable like someone who's comfortable in their own skin and fun to be around and and and passionate you know but also like affectionate like affectionate to me is very sexy see you have different thank we all those things I actually yours is better because to me that's a more normal thing to be and then just a healthier thing without needing bells and whistles and fucking jumping and you know and woman was like perfect features and she's cold and she's not not friendly and nice I don't find her attractive at all yeah that's nothing but a woman who's like way less like classically attractive but she's very affectionate and very kind and sweet and fun to be around I find that very attractive that will very for me from person to person I can go with kind and sweet or I can go with there's certain words I like when they say like some people just get it and they know how to talk and they know they know your fucking triggers and it's just it's an ownership you for me yeah yeah you got weird kinks yeah man it's although not as crazy with this again the personnel not crazy I just like her or I love her what are the fucking what is it though what do you ever like tried to examine like what are kinks like where is it coming from like what what is it about like trigger words and weird things and weird stuff that like gets you turned on nothing good and well is it how you're interfacing with the world is it how you're you're choosing to dress all of your issues and that you can escape them with like really like crazy behavior and that like maybe you have all these anxieties and neurosis this and that through this really bizarre dirty talk and freaky behavior you can escape those cuz it's so naughty it's so off the written cuz you're not a normal guy right none of us are if we're working in show business if you're a stand-up comedian right you're getting paid to talk crazy shit on stage right you're not normal right your your world isn't normal you wake up whatever the fuck you want unless you have to do a radio show right so it's a different the whole world you live in is different and then you have all this kinky shit and then you get the added addictions to dirty stuff and so like whatever it is about like a girl saying something like this she's gonna go with me on this crazy dirty shit I'll fart in my mouth yeah yeah it's like you're you're like escaping the the troubles just for a brief moment with all this insane behavior it could be that and I don't know sometimes I wonder like with any it's almost like if you eat too much ice cream there's diabetes that will come with that that could be the diabetes like just too much success and all of a sudden instead of three to make this effect it takes 11 it's just it you can't get the same effect from the same thing like when I was growing up I loved lesbian porn I can love two girls huh oh my god it drove me nuts now please are they related no I'm not interested there's no what killed it from me when I was on Newsradio one of the guys who was a writer on Newsradio is a very nice guy but he was a nebbishy sort of fellow that had problems with women and he was a writer on news radio and in his moonlight time he used a pseudonym and wrote for porn oh and so he took me to a porn set is my first porn set ever and it was Jill Kelley and Janeane I'm sure you know those Kelly I know the name Janina though Janine is the one that used to be married to the Jesse James character the biker guy oh yes yeah and her thing was that she only did lesbian porn that was her thing right so I'm on the set and it was just so like clinical very like it was weird like they were they were doing this scene yeah that's her yeah she was on Blink 182's an album cover it's a beautiful beautiful woman right so she's she's got the scene is lesbian scene I think she was like a cartoon character that came back to life or some ridiculous shit right is that what she looks like now oh Jesus laughter now is that a yeah but is that like a hairdo that's a mugshot she went to jail I forget what she went to jail for but yeah not good anyway things go south yeah right that's what we're talking about earlier some of these gals they get a little older and all that the pressure of the forbidden behavior just the societal pressure and all the things that led them to be that way in the first place come crashing down on them but for for this scene like they're the two of them were on a bed and they were eating each other's pussies and there was like this you know there's a sound guy with the fuzzy mic that's on a stick this hover and then there was a another guy that was over there doing something he was literally eating a sandwich where these girls were eating each other's pussy it's like he was so disinterested and then there was a director and then they were kind of aware that we were there watching so she was sort of putting on this sort of self-conscious show like and in between like takes they would like okay cut and she was like keep eating her pussy and she would say something like I love my job I love my job but it was like convincing herself that she loved her job and it's just like super bummed me out yeah I've been on a bunch of those sets and you're right but there's different energy depending on the set like I've been around when I hosted the award show the AVN with jenna jameson so i got to go on one of her sets and watch she actually was doing a lesbian scene her husband at the time J I guess was directing it and that was like a fucking set there was a wardrobe there was crafts you know what I mean like that was a set it was a high-end sheet at the craft service or we joy yeah I know I thought I just hot dogs and taco no I think I just watched her eat pussy I'm like this is jenna jameson she is the biggest ever in this business you have to watch this happen and then we went on another one I saw another one another day where it was like a lower budget average budget where it was two guys and a girl and like the girl was in between the two guys and what the director was going come on more I mean a little bit more a little bit more of that and they're amazing people that they can function sexually under those conditions yeah totally unsexy the sexiest one I saw was like a very low budget like a guy like one guy with a light and one guy holding a fucking camera and a couple and they were like a couple who was real amateur and so it felt more like sex and I don't think the guy could get hard for a little while he struggled a bit but they were real people right that was the hottest one because it felt the closest to real sex that makes sense that it's like yeah that's actual sex I don't like drama people like those this sounds it too much faking it yeah stop it I dated a couple of girls in porn like minor and one girl would blow me and I could never come from her she could hey but it was a young that's not hey hey settle down easy just a little fucking pack it up and down the gag on purpose hey hey hey hey hey hey there's nothing for me a little gag who likes that there are guys I like that guy named Brandon irons I he's a Canadian guy with a giant dick and he would always he's a fucking nut he's a big porn actor for a while I'm the fucking Joyce of arid you know Joey yeah I know who that guy is Joe he's a good friend of mine and I met him at the award show in 2000 Jane you air of 2004 but he's an older gentleman now right he's gotta be late 50s early 60s maybe does he still do porn oh he's no he shoots it he shoots a lot of trans porn like yeah Joey is a fucking he's a naughty boy he's a great director because he loves it he loves directing because he likes what he's doing so might the first time I did The Tonight Show was it was like September of 2004 I think and I watched it at Joey's house downstairs and I've seen so much porn shot in that house and Brandon irons was upstairs with his girlfriend anyway Brandon Irons is a throat fucker like he's a guy look up Brandon iron some day that guy will teach it Canadian dude he's in Canada now he will fucking rip a throat apart and it's not my thing but don't you ever get your dick bitten like did you seem like such a hard way to have sex right and I don't like you're going to be uncomfortable like you know I mean I spanking or whatever but I don't like to feel like I'm menacing some of them that's just not my energy also problem is like if you get hard if that's like exciting on film like is that exciting to you in regular life or is this just like an act that you're putting on and filming like how do you like how sexually how does it translate what can you do both right he might be a guy who just can get his dick hard anywhere like nacho Vidal could literally fuck during a house fire it's just one of those guys that nothing matters to him you know rocco siffredi these guys or Manuel Ferrara like these guys the men impressed me more than the women just because they have to keep their dick hard mm-hmm and I don't know a lot of the newer guys I just don't really watch as much with big names but the fact that these guys can function under these conditions whereas my dick is very very susceptible to having an issue well pre viagra there were real superstars right there were real guys who were just freaks and now there's like chemically enhanced superstars but even with Viagra of lost hard-ons like I haven't taken Allisyn over a month I think maybe it's been three actually three or four months now I just stopped because my dick was horrible without it I'm like I can't even with it it was like my dick was kind of half-mast I'm like you're training your body wrong right so I stopped taking you should talk to someone to give you that advice um what to stop taking yeah no I just knew I knew myself I was taking it the wrong time and I wasn't even horny I'm like right if you need one take it but I haven't insulted you were relying on it's psychological oh god yeah all the time I thought there might be a chance that night I'd pop one ass I Alice go to the cellar and hope for the best Optimus sitting there with a boner yeah I mean it just and it would make you feel great but I didn't need it so I stuck it was taking I didn't need it it sounds like yeah what's a genius thing that nature's done to make it so that there's all these different factors that keep you from getting erect right nervousness fear anxiety like which makes sense because you really shouldn't be concentrating like is for a human male sex is so overwhelmingly interesting right that you if you could get it up in the face of danger it would probably be terrible for your survival mechanism right right do you a book called the midnight of garden in the minute the good with the midnight in the of good and garden of evil what was that the cabin space was in the film yeah good and evil in the midnight gardener so I'm fucking up I don't know what you're talking about Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil yeah I never really night in the garden I read the more the movie I don't either was one thing in the book I remember well something happened and the guys fucking the girl and like somebody came like they were fucking outdoors and there was a bad guy who was coming with a gun or something and she said what she remembered is that what they couldn't move but she's like I remember he stayed hard while he was inside me like he kept his erection I'll even know if it's fiction or nonfiction something tells me it was nonfiction but I could just be hoping I've always envied guys like that but I'm not like well yeah people who are healthy INDD well necessarily totally healthy right cuz you're really healthy you'd be thinking about your own survival someone's got a gun to you that's true well note he was just in the area he wasn't right but yeah but like what the way you are or the way other guys just like he-man I kind of liked this girl we connected and it feels right like those guys I IND are you ever completely comfortable I'll give you ever like relaxed were you like totally know at peace good question no and I've thought of that recently like I'm not comfortable around my own friends like I love my friends I'm guys comfortable around them right but I'm other times I'm really comfortable yet sometimes on the radio when we're going back and then when there's no time to think when there's like fucking six or seven comics in there and you're just being animals and everybody's moving and punching and shitting on each other I'm very comfortable because there's no time to reflect or think you're just kind of doing what you do comfortably but in that environment I'm I realized it after like wow I felt like just really alive and great in the moment in the moment is exactly it flowing and a flow state doing something and not thinking yeah but when I'm thinking I'm always worrying about this who then that's which is fun to fucks me up in sex yeah but I know I'm not comfortable to often do have you ever tried to be yeah I don't know what to do like I think it's all shame based so I'm trying to like I think if I talk about things that helps but if it doesn't it'll give it it hasn't helped to the point where you're never comfortable now at 49 it's like boy this whatever this pattern is that you've followed your whole life right might not be the way to do it I mean I'm just guessing I think you're not a psychologist no but that's a good point I mean it's like I don't know why I'm never comfortable I'm not sure if I'm not but that's why I'm asked is asking you about yoga and that's what I wanted to ask you about meditation to just a wonder like maybe you can train your mind to relax when it comes to certain things or train your mind to not entertain so many neurotic thoughts or train your mind to concentrate on positive things and eventually build that up the same way you build up endurance like for like we were talking about those guys doing that exercise we're circling a person that body like you burn yourself out unless you did it all the time or like my friend camel runs a marathon a day he's used to it he does it all the time like maybe you can do that also with your point of view like maybe you can do that also with your mindfulness with just thinking about the world itself around you that you could maybe not entertaining those those same thoughts these neurotic thoughts maybe those thoughts maybe it's akin to like an endurance racer giving in to the idea of discomfort and why don't I just quit now like maybe there's the same sort of thing maybe these are mental patterns that you can sort of stray away from keep your mind on a positive track and like come up with some sort of like really good ways of thinking about things because you're obviously a very smart guy and you're in your office Lee a very sensitive guy you think a lot you know but if you let that thinking and that sensitivity sort of run amuck without any control without any discipline right that seems to be the issue and I've had those issues myself in the past just one the reasons why I bring it up I mean I'm not I'm way healthier now at this point in my life and I've ever been before because I've really worked at it and worked at being at peace and being calm and and also I've worked at all the extraneous sort of influences that fuck with that and to sort of eliminate them and then use exercise sort of as a drug in a lot of ways like there's a one of the reasons why exercise so much is because if I don't it's not like a looks thing it's a mind thing like if I don't strain myself if I don't if I don't do something really difficult all the time you do it every day I do something five days a week I don't do it every day I'll have days where I take off but if I take more than one day off my body starts going what are we doing what are we doing it's almost like you have a dog that you don't walk you've ever dog yeah I know nobody I know it when you this is one of the reasons why I thought about it way back in the day this is my dog would be so much calmer if I went and played with him for a few hours so if I took him for a walk and threw the ball and he ran around he'd be chill but if I didn't he'd like mom what's going on it's like do I have a neurotic dog no I have a dog that doesn't get any exercise he has physical requirements for him to be content and I think people have physical requirements for them to be content too but I think unlike people or unlike dogs rather people can go on these sort of downward mental spirals of of self-hate of self-analysis of neurosis neurotic thinking of you can get yourself in these really bad patterns of like shitting on yourself or looking at yourself in a negative way you know and I think you tend to gravitate towards these negative things sometimes and then you you realize it and then you bounce back but it's like what is causing you to gravitate towards them and why can you never achieve just a few moments like an hour or two we just like chill we could just sit at home and and just read a book and have a cup of tea and just do you ever feel like that we're just comfortable and relaxed watch a movie on Netflix and chill out it's always Restless if you know each other at the mental patterns and changing the physical stuff is what I got to do firstly to bring the body in the mind will follow so I have to stop doing certain things and this thing of not cheating on this girl is is a good I've not cheated on girls before when they were here right but she's not here yet and we're still in a relationship and for me to not it's miraculous but I'm not and we had a fight recently and I almost did I started fucking Tech and I'm like no you can't like this is what you do you sabotage things and that's why you're so everyone kind of up and down lately but it's like whenever you're not doing something you it takes a while for you to adjust and garlic all right when you feel something now you got to feel it you can't feel it and then run and go on eros do you ever go to a therapist oh yeah many many where there's one I went to she was very nice but once I start getting familiar with them you know there was one time I forget why I was really fucking suicidal and I called her I don't like calling a therapist but it was a bad day and I was talking to remember what triggered it no it's usually the same stuff around feeling like a failure just the same shit that everybody has the same feeling like I'm worthless so I talked to her and I'm she was being nice but she was not being helpful now I didn't want her to rescue me but I wanted her just simply to give some kind of an answer or trigger me to ask myself a question as a therapist do they they trigger you to go why am i doing it's my fucking that that's what their job is not so she was she just not very good at it no she was like yeah no I nothing Leanne no I know it's just kind of empathizing a little but I mean I don't need you to fucking empathize with me I just need you to just give me a suggestion of like such thing something don't just be okay this is where we're at all right no I'll see you next week you really might not you know I mean say that works I'm not I don't like that you know I'm not a fucking emo girl but I just was like all right whatever but Isis like I can't be in a therapist therapy with her anymore right well I think therapists are probably a lot like comics right there's really good ones and there's really bad ones sure ones that some people think are really good and you might think suck you know I mean there's just I'm got in years I mean a few years but I feel better now that I have in a long long I'm happy now I'm just I'm fucked up lately because I'm kind of going through this huge change but other than that I feel better than I have in a long time like life is good that's good I love the radio show I have fun with Sam everybody really do like you know I enjoy working with Sam he's a fucking goofball and I have fun right I love doing the thing with Matt like I just I have fun doing that stupid fucking chip is the biggest thing in my life and I love doing it but character why is it the biggest item people love it like the podcast they're gonna hate this week so we did it in LA and the women didn't know chip was it was a very ugly experience they were just firm that this Maria Menounos his boyfriend Keven Undergaro he runs this place they do all these after show he's a huge chip fan so he's like hey while you're at it you can use my studio because I have a podcast because that's a different hair every week those are classes the Colin Quinn gave me to fucking wear but it's it's so awful but the last one we released is a live one and it's the people we was get an hour and 20 minutes long we did at the Village Underground and it sold out faster than anything I've sold in years humiliation character it's you know what it is and it was a fun show Colin Anthony fucking Sam was on um uh I lost have fucking Bobby Kelly and it was just so silly and the people I think is it's almost like everybody's greatest fear is to be that unaware like that's a weird like why do people like this because the jokes stink fucking terrible jokes and they're said with conviction she always has people around him who know him doing it this week in LA was me and Sam and xpac was on who's a fun guy but he knows me is Jimmy the wrestler who fucked China in the the important he's extra he's a great guy he uh means more than a guy who fucked China but that chooses the reference people normal no but he knows Jim so he's like hey chip he's trying to go with it but he does know what to do right and these fucking four girls that have no idea because Kevin wanted it to be a train wreck fucking fucking Keven Undergaro he wanted to be a train wreck so he had these girls he didn't tell him otherwise go here Jim Laurens gonna be there it's a huge podcast from New York so I fucking do it and they're trying to go with it and chips just an embrace of content they didn't know what to do I was it's the only time I've ever been humiliated doing chip I was embarrassed and uncomfortable and I also like this is what it's supposed to be this guy stinks really supposed to be disliked people who are in on the joke loved the joke you know and then they get that the jokes are awful so the fun point with people who love it is to at times give one like my ex-girlfriend really new chip and there was times I would do and though it was so bad and she was like oh that's terrible like she loved it don't you think the people that love chip will actually love this episode then because his chip interacting with people have no idea who he is if they really love chip if they understand who chip chip person really is they're going to go fucking bananas I can't go watch it dude I can't watch it I was embarrassed doing it is cos Samko see with me I might do is it dad and he goes it was really uncomfortable there are people who really who didn't videotape it too we videotape every one of my own video and it's on YouTube for free like I was it on iTunes as well all for free yeah I make a little money from the ads and I said I want to charge for the video I want to do something with it someday I don't know where it will go we're going to do it in a few months you know I think this is like I've had 25 episodes we do one a week he does live read fucking slams yeah dad fucking hit him Carl watch this what's the pairing go [Applause] Honolulu hipster yeah what's that say fucking Honolulu hipster fucking upstate New York your pizza garbage Honolulu's in Hawaii I know stupid nonsense now when did you you came up with this character when you were on ona and what what made you do this like what girlfriends hated it I think we talked about this girlfriends drove me they hated it so much because it was humiliating and it got a reaction out of it I just kept doing it so much it was so much fun and a lot of times I Anthony like it first hated it but then Anthony started to love it but then hoping never loved it it was always kind of fun to do because I knew like deep down uncle Paulie hates so I would always don't go Paul just to fuck it and make him sick because he couldn't get with uncle Paul Anthony of course could are you more comfortable now doing it without him the radio show much much yeah yeah we stopped liking each other I mean the reality is we do you know I don't really mean I don't wish the guy bad in his real life like I don't want bad shit to happen to him but we simply stopped liking each other so I'm but he was enjoying his afternoon show much more without me than he was with me I got the morning spot a spot for everybody no I think the company just was anointed him or whatever they like to be in Sam we're hungry but his afternoon show was good I mean you know he him and Sharad and those guys they were having fun so people didn't like it they didn't like it but he sound like he was having fun and he would look on him fired like what happened what the technical reason was was he had filmed Roland Campos or Booker taking a shit now I know I'll be well he filled me doing it in 2009 but he was being a goofball you I don't think he was trying to be degrading just being an ass and then showing it to I think a couple of the comics and I guess I don't know exactly I heard about it after the ball had already been so somehow rollin got nervous that he was going to release it and maybe Opie was teeth I don't know what role be said to him I really don't but I think that it got back to one of Roland's bosses and then the head of the talent department spoke to him and then once Human Resources got involved then things change and I remember there was a clip of it was getting bad and there was another producer in the studio named Paul and he was videotaping it and I think he had been on role inside and he thought up he was being a dick to him he could be a dick to me and he's like yeah cuz you chose Roland in this whole thing like making it a public thing that was really uncomfortable and then Paul goes yeah well I thought it was wrong and then Sherrod goes like he was having fun we all saw the tape he was enjoying it he was laughing and when I heard that I'm like oh no he just said we all saw the tape so uh like that just made it and again maybe they were gonna fire him anyway I don't know like they don't tell me that shit but he thinks that the company was out to get him I don't know and again I don't know what they said to him privately but to me he had two months left on his deal and no company wants to fire you two months out because because the potential lawsuits lawsuit they would much rather let you ride it out and then just not resign you well Sirius is in a weird place because of podcasts yes I mean it's just in a very weird place that the idea of paying money for these talk shows that are gonna get interrupted by commercials and have to listen to them only when they come on and not have them on demand it's such an inferior distribution or the or on demand like now the now they're on demand is on your phone an hour ft it's up you get our hour after yeah yeah yeah but live you could listen live on the phone and get it on it yeah what I'm saying is on your radio like if you're in your car and you you can't just pick I want to listen to Tuesday's Opie and Anthony show or Jim Norton and Sam's show I can't just pick that I don't know if you can unless you have a phone hook there might be a way to do it that I hooked up yeah I think so yeah all right but I don't think you could do that like serious radio is only playing what's playing right now I think so I I mean I don't have a thing where I could just pick at the episode how is a podcast played in a car you just get there's a bunch of different ways one you can do it where you could stream it live through YouTube some people do that and you just play the audio and if you have it set up you can play the video some people do it where you you're on stitcher stitcher is a alright low bitrate version meaning it's the audio quality is not as good because it's compressed but it's way quicker to download so if you have some sort of a plan where you want to get less data per month a lot of people use stitcher or they just get it off of iTunes but the thing about it is that you just if you have your phone bluetooth up you literally all you have to do is press play and then immediately play like whatever episode like you want to scroll through mmm scroll through our stuff if you go to Syria now to on the new operating system oh yes like ask for it yeah you could play it for Siri but if you go through have you ever done do you use it do you use iTunes or iTunes messed up I never look at podcast standing like my most the recent ones of all the ones that I subscribe to and I can just take one click it and boom now it's playing yeah I mean that's just it's done differently unserious yeah the app you have to use but the on demand is pretty good but I think it's an hour after it airs you can get it forever I believe I don't list I don't read listen to the show I mean I never listen to our show I listened to it on drives like wow I kind of like it it's new we finally got Anthony back in the building I was allowed to come on as a guest you know in the building I fought for three years for that and literally right after he got fired they'll ethany back in after hope you got fired yeah and I'm not saying I'll be gifted I don't know to be really honest I don't know I don't think that he actively kept him out no do I know the real numbers like do they ever tell you how many people are actually never never I don't know if they know I mean I don't know how they would track that they may but they don't I've been apart of me is like I really want to know because will give us negotiating power yeah and a part of me is like I really don't want to know but the fact that we're getting raises I think we're doing okay like I that's the only way I can tell is that they I know that they wanted to keep me every time the contracts okay we must be doing okay but no I don't know what the numbers it's just amazing how quickly it became a different thing you know like like I remember when Howard went to Sirius it was like wow hallelujah finally were gonna get uncensored radio and then it became well it still just radio radio still live and now you have to pay for it now it's ten bucks a month and meaning he made out like a bandit I mean he made ridiculous sums of money from it sure but where's the future in that it just seems like that's a but see it's like almost like investing and I mean if you're if you're someone who's got a piece of that it's like where's that going like how how are you gonna keep you can't even use it in a tunnel you know the thing was serious and this is this was scary for job security but they're really Scott is good at getting big-name talent like a Beatles Channel and all this stuff they're there and they're good at getting good good name big-name people doing shows like Ferguson's on their inter channel yeah I'm not a faction where those are all in faction now faction talk yeah I hate the name because it doesn't say comedy but whatever it is what it is it's us and then we know and rich and then Ellis and then Craig and then Nick DiPaolo who was a very funny show he's alert Nick is a fucking savagely funny guy I love that guy I do so he's just a fucking raw fucking bark out a joke funny guy like Nick isn't thing about Nick he's never afraid to try to be funny like I've done a lot of projects with him with a tough crowd for two years I just thought a shit load of stuff back back back back like Nicholas fucking fire lines out and I've always admired him for that because sometimes they work sometimes they don't but he's unafraid he's a funny fucking dude and he's unafraid to bark stuff out and be who he is like I love that he does a great show he's a really surprisingly good radio guy like but going to breaks and all that stuff but yeah Anthony doing it for a long time with already remember that's right yes I was not gonna show but I remember watching the one blowout that they had where Nick was trying to do some read and write and Ari already didn't just wanted to kind of fuck off yeah you can't let it get to you like that we've had two blowouts I've been through them I've seen them me at never had one man one of my fucking I just wrote the foreword to his book I don't supposed to say that but too bad I'm proud of it I fucking love him and he's doing a show with already now write the AAA show the fucking greatest name they had a great billboard for it and it's really funny man it's a nice product so listen I do for the to the compound yeah how much does that cost I honestly don't know I I do pay for it though he offered me a free one but I'll chime it I mean I'll fucking I'll chip in and it's doing well for him that whole compound oh yeah yeah he hasn't skipped a beat his life is fuckin doing great yeah there's a great thing both our mug shot the real legit mug shot yeah they did it yeah compound media I like how he called it compound media too because I look at the a a show a great poster now can you get that on your phone oh yes you can get it on yep I have the food in the car you can listen to it in the car he's uh buddy I love him too he's one of my favorite people ever he's literally somebody who I don't think I'll ever not be close to there's no one create like I love Sam I love all these guys I've worked with but Anthony there was a weird it's a comic thing that happens when you're going back and forth but sometimes it's an energy you're exchanging and with him do it there are Jim Norton laughs compilations I never list my own shit I don't listen to the old show I can't listen to it but those I can listen to because they're all Anthony just making me laugh it's not me saying funny shit it's Anthony saying funny shit that every time fuckin gets me like he would literally make me laugh like that wheeze laugh that an audience member gets yeah I'm like I never get to fuckin feel that way but he's not even crazies he's not a stand-up he's not a stand-up he's done it a little bit but in that roadie yeah he tried it a couple like Whitman without like in Montreal a couple years ago yeah after he's been fired oh my god no no this is what Opie and Anthony were supposed to do a show together to host a comedy show in Montreal I was part of the show but Opie went home for some reason he flew home a day early don't wanna do it so aunt just did it by himself and hosted the show and started shitting on the comedians and he was really funny first time ever on stage he was fucking funny Wow but in a in a comic room Patrice said that about him he said he said Anthony can access funny faster than any person I've ever seen and Patrice didn't hand out he was not been known as the bellboy that guy doling out compliments again like that was not Patrice's reputation but Anthony has that ability to reach in and grab funny from anywhere and he's as fast as any comic we've ever had on there's never been a comedian in there who faster than him but as fast as him guys like Patrice Arbor oh geez but there's no one who's ever been able to go in there and run circles around Anthony right it's staggering how fucking funny I get yeah it's weird it's like he's a comic who never became a comic that's how I've always felt about being around them yeah and even died said that about him when dice was shitting on Opie and Anthony when they had a feel he was saying that that Anthony's actually talented he's actually almost like a comic but he never did it he never did it and Anthony has an ability Brewers an amazing storyteller - an amazing storyteller whereas ant could do that about and like he could literally he would talk about like you don't beat a tin knocker and stuff I have no knowledge of or interest in and he would have me on the edge of my seat listening to him talk about it he just has a gift for explaining things and for walking you through it Louie has that the ability to explain an amazingly interesting fashion and Anthony can just jump in and out of voices and do impressions and I mean I never get sick of rambling about him because I got to work with him for a fucking decade I get to work with the funniest guy in the fucking world for a decade like as much as it sucks that it's over like I'm grateful I do 100% of you thought about doing that and I would love to do it Sam I mean me and I we don't get along anymore but I would love to have Anthony with me and Sam but again he's got his own show it's not gonna happen but I love Sam and I have a very good chemistry in a comfort level like I really I like him and I trust him on the air and with OB just got bad I'm not blaming him it's like hey I always half the problem - but what about you doing a show with Anthony compound meteors you know compound media is he getting a more enclosed environment than Sirius is right and because of gigs and other things I got to promote I just kinda I wanted to stay and also series pays more and I didn't want to negotiate against Anthony I just couldn't I was like I wasn't gonna use him as a negotiation tactic right I didn't want to do I couldn't do it he's too close to him and I always kind of secretly wanted him to come back and when he came back the first day he came back I mean it was seeing that fucking like I got the we went to a Springsteen I know who played a Guns & Roses played at the fucking the Apollo so this was like right after Opie got fired so I saw Scott Greenstein that night our Andrew and like yeah he can come in Anthony came in I'm like really like yeah he can come in I'm like great I texted him come in tomorrow the minute he could come in and that but security hasn't been told so I'm on the show and I know ants coming in it's gonna be a fucking surprise for the audience but he's being held up at security because in fairness they needed an email from Scott they didn't know that had been okayed right it took about an hour 40 minutes but he got up and seeing him walk down that aw fuck it was so good man yeah he was happy very rarely see that on his face it was so good but but you just go right back into that and Sam is so perfect in that moment to you just kind of go back into it and you flow and you know so I miss him a lot but uncensored conversations they're just hard to come by and when you're under the corporate umbrella you're not really uncensored there's always going to be something you can't say something can get you in trouble which is why I was always encouraging you to do a podcast like wait even way back in the day yeah I was like you should branch out you should do something on your own aside I feel like people wouldn't want of always thought people wouldn't want it or they were sick of me or they're not interested but again the closest I've come at this point is fucking dumb chip I made you my own sundae but I'm literally loving doing that it's freedom and it's fun do what you love then but you know I mean I know you love doing the Sam and Jim show too but yeah I really feel like even that show would be bigger if it was just accessible to everybody and not on Sirius it might be and again we have one more year left on the contract and it is something I would do as a podcast it absolutely is something I would do as a podcast but they don't want to get one thing in their favor besides the fact like yeah there's Human Resources and you know you can't go around fucking grabbing klitz they never fuck with us creatively like literally never they say the whole thing with Condoleezza Rice where you guys got kicked off the air that was a homeless guy here's what that was that way you're right - homeless Charlie and he said what about that Bush bitch he was just a funny fucking dude here's how that got pushed that was before seriously accent merged right and what sunk will almost happen was that made it - fucking Breitbart a Breitbart and then got onto Drudge and then became a big deal and I heard later that the people who were making that a story were the people who worked in terrestrial radio who did not want that merger to happen so the only reason the company pulled them off is they were literally scared that it was going to hurt whatever they needed in Congress for fucking to make the merger happens yeah so they were saying his merger in danger like once that got out there and fucking either way we shouldn't have been off the air but as crazy as it was that's where terrestrial radio saved us because k-rock who they wanted me off the fucking show those cunts I fucking hate that they wanted you yeah because the ratings weren't as good as they used to be and they thought I was the problem that's like hey fucking shitheads I was there in the afternoon when we'd be for syndication I was not being anthe before there Everage I love me book like yeah dude you suck I remember Philadelphia before you were on no you don't it didn't happen before I was on there was no Philly show before I was on I was always there in syndication so whatever anyway they won c'mon I know I know I know I know I do that I I literally will do that alone I don't I didn't realize that people don't talk to themselves I didn't realize that and with chip and the characters I and I've talked about this on our show I do it all the time by myself you have conversations by full-blown chip elbow Oh full volume talking a little woman character it once in a while if I think of something he's dead girl I'll say it a lot better you know I said another one he's a bad character he just has dry teeth he that there's not a whole lot to him but I would do him Chris Anthony it touches you as sharp fingernails it's an ugly thing an uncle Paul III do them you do them when you're alone completely alone Wow and I do when I'm alone if I drop something I'll go okay that's about it I walk around and talk to myself and a full blown conversation like this is not naughty I have actually embarrassed admit this I took a shit today and I got up and I was done and I went to the fucking to look at my computer and I had to shit again immediately and I stood up and out loud I said oh that's just jostle it a little more loose and I walked back to the toilet I said those words to myself alone I do it all the time dude I talked and I didn't know I thought everyone did that but Sam's like no I'll think things but I don't say them yeah I would imagine most people think things but a few people talk to themselves I'm sure I've done it on occasion but it's not a normal in the shower I do it out loud just full conversation for me when I'm alone I'm happy to not talk I talk so fucking much talk so much doing a podcast so much doing stand-up so much doing UFC commentary when I cannot talk at all I'm fucking happy yeah I don't know what it is it's like things that just kind of come out or I work through things or I work through this girlfriend's argument you know whatever it is in the moment and I logically talk things through but yeah that's for a lot of character shit comes from is I'll start thinking of it I'm gonna talk in a weird voice and it'll be something that resonates with me you know like yeah I'm stuck in my fucking head man and once it's stuck in my head then I bring it out on the air and that's when I get stuck at everybody else's head like if it's bothering me for a month it's you're gonna hate it you know and I like to bring that stuff out first we have that shit comes from just being single fucking lonely I gotta wrap this up okay bring it single there's so much Joe always a good time brother anytime you're in town man just let me know let's do this more often thank you can i plug my yes yes only all tickets are on sale if you want to go and I'm in Dallas in Austin this weekend the money's going to the hurricane victims I hate saying that it's just cheesy but I feel worse going into prostituting tickets right
