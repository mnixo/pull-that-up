to do eval roads ladies and gentlemen hello sir II see brother what's going on everything and nothing everything and nothing yeah let me tell me your this is a crazy time for you you've your vagabond your traveling around man gypsy I like the term nomad no bad good vagabond makes is that like a boy nomads like a gypsy with money yeah no but gypsies over is that a derogatory term you didn't used to be I think it might be now they can say it like king of the gypsies is Tyson Fury he's allowed to say it he's allowed to say might be one of them things yeah we got a word like that those words are expanding there's more of those words than before who can family get in trouble right now I don't know man I don't know that's a good one that used to be a normal one you know if you know it's really crazy if you look at when kids had were born with Down syndrome the original term was mongoloid idiot that used to be like they would put that on birth certificates like I like when you say the original term any of those people still alive like is that still on somebody who's alive birth certificate that's a good question the people with Down syndrome live less they don't live as long right I think that's the case you know yeah yeah I do only don't see a lot of older people this like we're tightening up the word I just can't wait till we can read minds so this all this nonsense just go out the window I think once we could read minds and then you just see intent and there's no like words like because right now it's just words that convey intent and some of those words are forbidden but some of those words have like bitch perfect but this bitch is crazy like or this bitch is fine you know you could say this bitch is hot this bitch is cool that bitch is so cool or you could say oh my god this girl's a bitch you know yeah the connotation is completely there's so many of them there's so many different ones where it's man where is it a hard thing everyone one time Mickey Joe Mickey Joe Shelly and Mickey call Joe shilling and I were talking about about words and and perceptions and like like your shirt your shirt is green right but if I would be in your consciousness well I see your shirt and what I see it is red but I right I know it is green yeah I mean different colors is the same thing no we don't we have no way of knowing right right I've know and knowing what like some people are into weird shit like yellow cars right that's not weird though that's weird all the colors to paint a car that's why the fuck do you want a yellow car like a nice car like you see like a yellow Corvette look what the fuck are you doing in that Corvette I swear you were going to say something different I swear he's like people listen to people in the weird shit I saw you're gonna say like scatter so the yellow cars that's not so bad yeah but I mean I don't know what they're saying like to me yellow cars like ah it's unfortunate you know like why would you do that coverage it like maybe was us on sale because of the shitty color I think that so yellow car should cost less yeah yeah for sure yeah unless you just give trying to make a point like you do your cars like a bumblebee or something you know like you have black stripes and yellow and see that would be cool yeah or a bug on a Mustang I don't know what else I think those are only two cars it really should be yellow a Mustang like if you got a painted like with um some flames on it I don't even like you don't like Mustangs I'm not a big muscle car guy I do like sports cars I'm not crazy about muscle cars somebody needs a doctrine nature to the world of muscle cars I don't you just haven't seen the right one you know I think I think that comes from where I grew up because like you need a lot of open road for that we don't have that in the Bob like especially where I'm from like I'm not a big fan of like choppers a lot of I don't know those seem silly to me I can't turn yeah I like crotch rockets and and dirt bikes this shit drives me crazy handles and you're holding if you don't know what for people just listen and yeah they have handlebars that are above your fucking head yeah you hang you're driving around like this and you have to turn quick your fuck how can you get away from shit and once it goes bad like you're not gonna recover yeah I would think they would have like a secondary handle yeah just so that you'll have to ride like this I get tired have some shit right over the gas that folds out now maybe we can do that we could patent that make that and probably make millions of dollars come here let's steal that crotch rocket seemed safer because they're more maneuverable yeah like you couldn't handle this motherfuckers like those things move good yeah special I mean it had a design for yeah a new controller the high speed I saw this video of a motocross I don't know what you call one crotch rockets are racing but on these guys were racing this dude was like he was losing it and he got thrown off I saw that but he was on his knees sideways yeah he hung on there man and he looks like you still give it the gas yeah yeah I don't know I don't know what the rules are or like cutting the track right but like if that if he wasn't disqualified that was a ninja move how do you get back on no you have to slow down you have to right yeah you got dude a ninja move you gotta hit the brake real harsh on your slab and then you your body shoots at they ran back up I hit the brake and pop your hips up yeah at the same time like something in Fast and Furious I'm scared of bugs I don't know how to ride a bicycle but I can't ride a motorcycle I can't ride a crab never ridden a crotch rocket I've only ridden scooters you know what they're making them electric now you won't even there's no gears it's just like a Tesla but I don't like I don't know the whole thing about riding a bike is being able to control it isn't it well you can still control the speed but you're not going to be able to shift gears you don't have to do the shit with your left foot where you're going with the clutch and up and down all that jazz you have to learn how to do that you have to do that with one of those things yeah happy fucking ridiculously fast too I feel like I would be like the guy on and you know and I could Dave and I'm on the motorcycle video yeah in the in Europe they're making cars like electric cars have noise you have to have noise like a regular car so that people can hear you that's dumb yeah well yeah I mean you're not riding on the sidewalk okay yeah well yeah I mean I guess it's if people crossing streets and shit um maybe also I don't know the rules in Europe offer riding motorcycles but I don't know do you hear guys when they're riding on them in between lanes you know what I mean I don't hear them all the time there's a lot of times where you don't you have to look in LA that's such when I grew up in Boston and you couldn't do that that's not legal everybody has to stay in the lane really yeah in Texas it's legal oh is splitting lanes yes I wonder how often it's legal versus illegal well there's a lot of states don't even you don't have to wear helmets yeah Texas was one of them I don't know if that changes Louisiana that's crazy you know the last time I was in Miami I was watching dudes fly by me on the highway with no how long oh no though I mean do you do you want to helmet on you hit something in 19,000 hour I don't know I mean yes and no it's like I think sometimes people make it you know yeah but like what about you get all that pain was it California remains the only state to allow lane splitting oh wow so I guess is no longer I think you can just do it whenever you want it's on the motorcyclist to be risk got your take your own risk oh so County in California is legal yeah but in all the other places just you just kind of do it I'm probably I mean hmm that's where it says immediately crossing the state line yes nobody crosses this organ in or out of here - I don't know maybe it's partially legal there or something certain cities areas yeah freeway maybe only or something like traffic laws it's weird traffic laws being different like so different and in every state and I was on in Texas a couple days ago and I'm driving and I'm getting over because the cops pulled somebody over on the highway and a passenger she's like why are you getting over like you don't have to do it but in Texas you're supposed to if you if you can get over you're supposed to get over and give them that Lane birth otherwise you slow down to like ten miles below the speed limit or whatever but like in DC Maryland where she's from it's like you don't have to do that like but it's like if I'm from if I'm from Maryland I'm in Texas and I do that and then another cops behind me I'm getting a ticket yeah if you don't know the law it's not the still not their fault right right it's your fault for not lying don't you see the the Hong Kong protests that are going on no this crazy protest going on in Hong Kong but what's amazing is there was an ambulance and the ambulance was trying to mean this giant crowds on the street I mean fucking thousands if not millions a part like the sea for this for this ambulance it's crazy like if that shit was happening in America yeah block you can blow that horn all you want what is this Jamie we're gonna sit you know hmm why is it's a North Point not like Chinese characters on the street yeah you sure this is the one Hong Kong protesters barklow a way for ambulance I saw an overhead shot of it it was more impressive because it was this giant sea of people and they all just made way and everybody got right the fuck out of the way for ambulances it's like when a predatory fish swims like a small school no here it is this this is what I saw yeah so these people just open up good luck trying that shit in America I mean these people are so polite millions of protesters like 2 to 3 million or so yeah what do you know what they're protesting I can't there's so much outrage worldwide I can't keep track man yeah there's stuff going on everywhere you see that there's this stuff in Sudan right now everywhere you know every part of the world is up in arms Gaza there's a bunch of shit going on everyone off ever if there's a new more recent shit it's exhausting yeah like why can't people just not be assholes right that's impossible that's what we need this mind-reading software got problem with that is like then you just reading the mind of assholes maybe maybe but maybe people can let you know ok man do you don't have to think like that your problem is the way you're thinking cuz it's 90% the problem with people's the way they think and then they act on the way they think I don't know if it 90% of them really not a mathematician just threw that number out there thanks a lot up yesterday I showed you is sort of on the way to what you're talking about how your friends can play a video game together using only your minds okay this is what you were talking about after the show telepathic communication yeah this is this is the future a hundred percent there's going to be a time where we share some sort of I think it's going to be some sort of a universal language they're going to create a language that's based like on images or things that are culturally like you could just cross boundaries like people from other countries gonna be able to understand that you'll be able to understand it like Google Translate in it yes I really think that I think there's gonna be a language I mean like do you ever see someone's tweet I read tweets from people all the time from different countries it's kind of cool that you could like read some Russian see some Russian shit and then just say translate the tweet and you get a chance to try to figure out what this guy's saying yeah I've seen that a couple of times and then especially with some of my teammates friends Brazilian guys mm-hm and um they will have it in Portuguese but they'll also translate have it in English yeah a lot of Brazilian girls do that but then when you translate it it like it moves words that are already in the English translation it makes it like screwed up it makes it like the grammar is all messed up yeah that's really weird I don't know why why it even touches the English if you bring it to that language yeah that's the problem with languages right like the way they say things is different so trying to translate something to English you have to take some sort of editorial license you'd have to move things around what you're trying to say is this you can't just translate it yeah yeah especially because of like where we place like prepositions and like there's some like um there are some languages where they don't have the word off like don't lead oh they don't say turn off the light it's like when they said when they speak in English they say kill the light well that's the way I mean you can still get it but yeah that if they don't have an off word like I would imagine that Asians laying Asian language is gonna be the hardest right because they have characters they don't even have letters you know yeah they're the alphabets so much so much bigger and their characters can mean so many different things this little piece of a character combined with this changes everything the changes each one individually yeah like it's like this one is water and this one is fire and you put them together and it's chocolate when you were fighting what the place that what you how many different times did you travel overseas to fight seven six or seven was there any what was the weirdest place weirdest most different was Japan yeah but um I wouldn't say it was weird just different just different yeah very different it was like being in the future some Tokyo yeah I don't know there's a lot of fun the different things they do there the weirdest thing about being over there was at that pachinko game like what's the pachinko it's like these people they play they it's like a gambling game and they have these buckets of like ball bearings and I put them in the game and I don't I don't even know what the rules are but you see like older and middle-aged Japanese people they just sit there for hours just playing and you win and it's like um like winning a slot it's like a slot machine kind of right so when you win like you get a bunch of these these balls back I swear to you if you I don't know if Jamie pulled up like something but it's I think it's PA chenko oh sorry here's a guy who's yeah hands biggest gaming obsession explained pachinko they're like putting ball bearings in there and they just go there always people wearing masks that's the other weird thing about Asia right yeah a lot of people like to wear those masks so so that's the game that thing that they're this this weird how's it work did you play it no I mean I don't know I don't know what you're trying to do like everything's in Japanese that that's the currency for the game these ball bearings hide I really don't understand can't believe I'm just finding out about this and you'll see you'll see somebody sitting there and they will have buckets like like this big like square boobs rectangular buckets and I'll have like two or three stacks of them next to them they just reach down drop them in the machine and I thought I don't know what they're doing though I don't understand it at all I want to play it but then I'm like it looks stupid I don't want to win ball bearings what am I gonna do put in my car yeah what the fuck look that is so strange a buckets guys just taking fists of ball bearings and throwing them into this machine and then they're bouncing around like a like a pinball machine turned up on its side yeah III don't I don't understand it I don't know like what's the value on those ball bearings do i I don't look every time I go to Vegas every time I go through a casino I freak out I just I just see those people I feel like they're waste in their life playing those goddamn slot machines yeah yeah yeah that's but the first time I went the first time I fought in Vegas I um I played a slot machine that's the only time I the first time I gambled like in the Bahamas mom's growing up also Bohemians couldn't even gamble in the Bahamas but then I came here and I was in Vegas and I was like I want to play slots but I was like against gambling so I played the nickel slots for a while how about 20 bucks our biggest loss I've ever shaken my winnings in people's faces like you got to go to like circus circus or someplace to play the nickel slots yeah do you ever go to that place I bet yeah I've stayed a that's a window into history yes I go to Circus Circus every time I go to Vegas with my kids because my youngest daughter likes going there she likes playing all those stupid carnival games she thinks it's hilarious she's 9 you know yep she likes shooting water at the thing and the bloom pops and all that stuff's we always go there but it's always and then they do like a circus show well then have like a clown and trapeze artist but it's like no disrespect but it's kind of second-rate you know like the trapeze guys got a gut yeah what he's a little thick around the middle his best days of flipping around to the air over he's got yeah the big got the long arms yeah yeah that's I don't know it's especially gone when you compare when you say second-rate especially when you compared to like Blue Man Group or right what's going on like Mandalay or MGM or something yeah yeah yeah yeah but I mean hey it's sure you're still on the strip you're not on Fremont Fremont is like Fremont is like like second-rate Vegas Yeah right yeah it's very different very weird I um I remember and like I know I'm gonna probably catch some flack for this but I got to tell you this story like I was there one time and I'm telling my friends about like I'm like this is weird cuz like I've never really been to Fremont until this time and and I was like man why aren't we on the script this is just so weird being out here what was there for some fights I was like everything is just a little different I mean like everything's really like everything's really different I mean look like even the women like look at that girl she's like she's so like her but she's not great body right it's like so fine that she turned around she's like her face is just like ruined you know like it's not my fault I mean she wasn't attractive to me and I'm sure she's attracted to somebody but it's hard to say that these days you used to be able to say someone's ugly you can still say dudes ugly nobody gives you a hard time you could say dudes fat or dudes ugly everybody's like fine no problem fat all the time no no one has a problem that yeah fat and ugly for a guy is fine but if you say a girl's fat your body shaming if you say she's ugly you're fucking sexist piece of shit and you're objectifying her yeah I I it's it's really hard I mean like there was this there's this lady who's a who's a singer um her name is Liz oh right um big lady a bigger lady plus-size woman right right and um she that woman that was on the Beauty award yes she's fucking talented yes all right and like here's the thing like Jessie she's a plus-size woman um some people think she's that's overweight but I'm like she's not obese so it's like I mean she's like gross grotesquely obese I guess that's why how are you saying right not grossly obese she could lose a few pounds she could if she wanted to if you're like they're so they were they're like there's there's definitely some there's definitely plenty of guys in the world who that suits you know there are some guys my size through that suits there are some guys who were like linebacker or a lineman size who that suits but like then they are they're like nobody nobody complains about the petite woman but like what what about like the big linebacker guy who's into petite women like yeah well you know that dude the mountain from gaming yes his girlfriend or his wife or whatever she is she's like three feet tall I mean he's a fucking giant yeah yeah like you see that sometimes I think the guy that played Chewbacca all right original Chewbacca I think his wife was was a tiny woman like not like a midget or anything but I'm in trouble now yeah there's that's the mouth Wow it's just that guy actually you know what she might be normal size yeah he's all fucking big what she's got heels on there at a gala but uh he's so fucking big like that right there that looks like me with my 9 year old yeah it does it does that's height wise that guy's so goddamn biggest ridicul I give you cut off his body where her head is he would still probably be twice her size twice her weight oh yeah for sure yeah the big fella yeah he's always entering those strongman competitions are these the most ridiculous thing to watch you know whenever I'm like bored flipping through the channels and I catch some dude throwing a beer barrel over over his hand pole you know it's like there's always a suspended pole yeah like a high jump pole so ridiculous yeah I mean but those those kipo type of competitions you talk about like like that there's that and then you have that for the athletic or dynamic people like American Ninja Warrior yeah oh that's that's fucking interesting those ninja warrior warrior shows are crazy watch those guys you know that is some serious fucking athleticism people do that yeah I know that that that's a whole sport now they create gyms based around that like like training for it like people are training for the trials yeah no I imagine there's probably you I wonder I would like to know like who's the best at that weight class wise I bet it's guys that are like a hundred sixty pounds in under yeah cuz you carry yourself easy look sweet we did a stunt on fear factor once where you had to they were suspect they were off a bridge and they had to hold just hold themselves like on a chin-up bar over bridge and the girls all beat the guys wait they were they were just hanging just hanging not just himself nope no just hanging huh just holding on the girls all beat the guys the all three guys fell now it was like part of me was like maybe these guys are just bitches but part of me was like well the thing is like the guys they're pretty big dudes they're all around 200 plus pounds and you know that's a lot of weight in your hands and the girls are like 120 110 105 it's not as much wait there's there's a genetic thing between men and women where there are some things that like we ought we see these in sports we're not there some sports that are just much more fun to watch from madam playing there's some sports playing there's some sports that are both right right but um there's something I forget the test exactly but it's something about leaning over and picking up a cheer there's a certain posture that you're in and man can't do it but women can oh like you can't but it's like a folding chair like very very light cheer um I don't know I don't lean over and picking up it yeah so like you're leaning I think you press your head onto the wall but arch your back in a certain way and you you just have to use like your lats basically pick up the chair and men can't do it really yeah how weird yeah it's like a center of gravity test I remember oh you know my daughter tried to show me this the other day trying to get me to touch my toes with keep my back flat against the wall with the back of my legs against the wall and go down touch your toes you just fall forward yeah see that's that's see I had it all backwards all right put your butt against your head that's not you sticking my butt up against stuff let me see that let me see tricks guys can't do stand three feet away from a wall bend over put your head against the wall now try to stand up while lifting a chair oh no you had it okay that's a couple different dishes so yeah a couple of there on the center gravity though oh yeah that's the one I'm gonna try I feel like I could do that that's that's that's what I said yeah I mean I don't think of being cocky and saying I could do that but what if a guy's got like really good core strength I don't think it has nothing to do with that yeah just all about center of gravity yeah because I think not most guys but like you take a bunch of fit guys they have a good strong core they can't do them they can't do it hmm like it takes our average woman congratulations on your victory ladies you got us on one yeah like I don't want to spectators subjects where I'm like I don't want to say anything smart-assed or anything any kind of way cuz I get myself in trust so much trouble to get into today see so many different things people get mad and upset about they did a test with the way that men and women do a one-legged squat and I guess the way that each of us would go down is completely different when you have when you break it all the way down to that move oh so like the mechanics and yeah I said because the hips muscle structure everything yeah it probably is that both women the the it's so different the way the shape of their hips though the mechanic like women kicking that's that's one like for every Valentina Shevchenko that can knock someone out with one kick yeah you would think that a woman right take a hundred and forty pound woman who is carrying a hundred and forty pounds with her legs all the time going up flights of stairs running doing all these different plyometrics and shit you would think that bitch could be able to kick a fucking hole through you see there's another one use the word bitch that's okay that it's out of respect that's not it that's not derogatory but know like if you see a girl kick a bag like there's a giant difference between 140 pound girl kicking about 140 pound guy big difference and now now is it mostly technique or is it you know by oh I think it's biomechanics I think it's technique I think it's just muscles there's they're just built different there's just different muscles like the hips are like this right well hips especially few minutes wide hips right or their hips go out wide and their legs kind of go in a little bit or is it got wonder if that's responsible for the what they call that the male spread when dudes sit on a sit on a subway and they spread the lay the man spread yeah the man spread and people get real mad because they want to sit next to you yeah and your legs are all splayed out being rude but if a dude has no one next to them that's how they said yeah their legs spread I don't think women sit like that I think I don't think it goes that way I don't like sitting like that that's like as I sitting and like I've sat in coach most of my life you know and like that's that's it's uncomfortable like when you have to sit like that for an extended amount of time yeah it's really uncomfortable with your legs pinned together yeah yeah that's weird yeah and then there sometimes but after a while you just you you just feel uncomfortable inside your pants you got them you had a move stuff around you can't even open your legs to do that but with women I think that's a normal weight sit I think their body naturally with their hips in the shape that there are the legs kind of go towards each other they kind of point towards the knees it's more normal for them to sit with their legs together I think that makes sense it makes sense I just I wonder if it has to do with anything that the equipment down there oh yeah probably us to not wanting to be a ho right I sit like this with your legs spread if I dude sits like that that's a confident man but if a girl sitting there with a legs but like look at this bitch there's another you scientific article of explaining man spreading this is a spinal neurosurgeons explanation thank you spinal neurosurgeon John see overall width of the pelvis is relatively greater in females and the angle of the femoral neck is more acute these factors could play a role in making a position of sitting with the knees close together less comfortable for men exactly so all you manspreading people that are shaming men for sitting in a natural way how dare you you should be ashamed of yourself yeah I'm offended yeah I can't wait to women of all the power so we could just start shitting on them see here's the Sun is a subtlety subtle thing about that they they kind of do right if some you know it's like who's the world champion of your house yeah but that's just happy wife happy life that's how you have to run that shit yeah anytime you otherwise just I've never seen another situation works yo or you have like some some woman who just afraid she can't talk and you know you don't want that either no that's just not healthy it's not healthy it's not like how do you enjoy that I don't know you have to be a sick fuck yeah yeah I don't have my house is zero designed by me there's no decorations of mine this I have one mounted elk head that's it the first elk I've a shot with a bow and arrow I have mounted that's it everything else fucking I don't care it looks good the first time I came through you gave me some alchemy I made spaghetti out of it it was some of the best spaghetti I made a super good for your body man really good you could eat that shit all the time we lived around here I'd hook you up all the time yeah I used to when I get back I'm just gonna start hitting you up asking you failed me how long you in town for I leave in the morning do you have a place to cook tonight yeah I got some food for you okay okay I got some elk sausage that's out of this fucking world hey oh it's good yeah I'm completely down man the first time I was I was a little hesitant because I was like well this didn't come from the store you know but then I took it home I made it up and I was just like oh man it's a flavor so different and like the flavor is different the texture is different I don't know I really I wanted more it's alive I mean in terms of like when you're eating it just feels like it's got energy it's got power yeah I get like it tastes like I had a good life yeah I'm and like - if you're eating some some like a pig that lives in a pen Oh sad it's just sadness yeah eating an elk especially if it didn't know you were there like that elk had no idea you were there until that arrow hit his ribcage and then it's dead in seconds that thing that a noble life yeah you know and that's the best way it's very ver gonna die you know what I mean if you're an elk you don't want to get caught in a valley with some wolves that shit's rough that's a rough way to go I was talking to you buddy Jeff earlier about that um like you got a choice right you get of course hypothetically you had a choice you're gonna you're gonna get mauled by a bear a gorilla or die by wolf or tiger what do you choose I'll take the gorilla all day because I think he's just gonna beat your ass I don't think he's gonna kill you because I don't think I don't think he wants to eat you but like the premise of the question is you're gonna die hmm yeah then the tiger cuz the Tigers gonna get your neck and kill you quick that's that's my choice yeah I think so I've seen the video of the tiger chasing the dudes on the motorbike know in India it's horrific dudes are driving on this road yeah in this wildlife preserve and this tiger comes full clip chasing them out of the jungle and just bails off at the last second I just can't catch up yeah it should it's fucking horrific they're so fast like what do you do right didn't you do like everything you can do plus you have a gun you're so weak it's not my she can do but then when you think about that they're like you think about Africa you think about anything about these places where lions and tigers exist and people have existed since the beginning of time mm-hmm at some point someone had to win that right just just numbers just population numbers here's the video check this shit out you're gonna freak out I don't need to see her Jamie here it is so these guys are on this thing just oh he just tried he tried now the reason why this is significant is because in India Tigers eat people all the fucking time they eat them all the time like there's Tigers that target human beings there's a place in India called the Sunderbans and the Sunderbans is it's near this river that they think that one of the reasons where the Tigers are so irritable is that they're drinking this river water and the river water has a high degree of salt in it high level salt and so they're irritated all the time yeah this is in agony and they're particularly vicious and over the last 200 years Tigers have killed more than 300 thousand human beings in this one part of India why do you still live there like I'm giving work you know I'm giving them I'm giving that place to the Tigers I see that I see that video and I imagine being that guy on that bike and like I you know what a bike seat is like right yeah you could imagine being on a bike seat with like what I'm shitting myself yeah you know if you have any shit in your body it's gonna come out like that's a there's no way you win that no no way you win that no day no you don't win the only win by being on a motorcycle and getting away the fact they got a video of it though yeah how did I hope we had a GoPro he's like right hey they listen they get they get got all the time all the time especially in India India I think is the worst place in the world for Tiger and human interactions I don't get that like are the Tigers in India bigger Tigers yeah I know it doesn't matter the size like they're even like 300 or 500 pounds or something like that I think the biggest Tigers are in Siberia okay but think that's the case usually with mammals what happens is the like the same species when they're in a hotter climate tend to be smaller depends on the animal obviously then they are in the colder climates it's something that has something to do with preserving body temperature like deer for instance I give you get a white-tailed deer from Texas it's much smaller than a white-tailed deer from Saskatchewan yeah it's the same species but way up north if they just it's just colder and they go grow they'll grow like 300 pounds up there whereas like a big whitetail in Texas like half that size yeah yeah the the that's people to certain places with people yeah the mountain guy from Game of Thrones that motherfucker yes they had a controversial moment at the end of last year into this year they had a tiger that was known for killing 13 people or more and so they had a shoot to kill target on it you know and I guess they someone got it and people are mad people were mad it killed 13 people and people are mad that someone killed it people are just fucking weak they just so soft what if you got the wrong Tiger fuck him fuck them all kill whatever anyone that you get a chance to kill that's close enough to kill you kill him man I think I I key I can't get that that video of the tiger chasing that that by I got him alright cuz like like that's another thing those things they're so coordinated that thing at full speed can take a swipe at that rack tire and then you're screwed like what do you do cuz you like what's your first reaction gonna be like get up and try and get back on the bike there's nothing you can do there's nothing you do there's no way you get the bike going at time the tiger will be on you so fast maybe they can run dick probably 140 miles an hour those fuckers yes yeah and it's probably 400 pounds 500 pounds 400 pounds of something an animal that's 400 something pounds and runs at twice the speed of Usain Bolt how is that fair I mean that's why there's not a million deer you know the reason why million deer in that same yeah because of those Tigers they need them you know I was in lanai which is one of the smaller islands in Hawaii huntin access deer an axis deer were given to King Kamehameha of Hawaii like in the 1800s and when we were over there you know you bow hunt these things and I'm telling you you've never seen a deer move this fast yeah the reason why they're so fast is they evolved to get away from Tigers so when they see you there but they make this noise like hey and then they fucking scatter yeah and they're so fast you like it's hilarious to watch like wow they're so fast when you say that like my brain just starts doing the math and I'm like like of course the ones that got caught by the Tigers with a slower one yeah so like the fastest ones are mating yeah like yeah I can only imagine it's it's kind of like Olympic sprinter mm-hmm female Olympic sprinter marries uh running back yeah they have a kid whoo yeah look genetics are real yeah I mean that's one of the reasons why America's becoming softer and softer is because what are you getting you're getting people to sit at a desk all day with fucking herniated disks in a fat belly drinking coffee and eating doughnuts and they marry someone who's just like them and they barely get this shit together and they have a kid who watches video games all day and eats cookies and and he's gross and then he marries another girl who's like that and next thing you know you go through this four or five six generations you get piss-poor genes yeah I um I I just recently went home to the Bahamas and I'm starting to miss it more and more and more because as I get older I'm long for the things that I did as a little kid I learned the places that I was at as a little kid and so my family's from this little place called Pharma ski Exuma that's three-quarters of a mile by 7/8 I think I told you that before and it's tiny and I was there this time and just seeing just just waking up every morning and just looking out the window and just blue ocean only I just I want to go back there the people that people the people that live there like you get a boat at like 14 15 years old because you there's really nothing that you can do an island other than interact with the family and fish right everything everything for everything that you need staple lies you have to go somewhere else to get or has to be brought in so like I have a cousin who he's like he's older than me he's like my grandmother's generation but he's my cousin he's like four years older than me but like this guy he free dives and he will go down and he will hang out on the water for like two or three minutes like with us with a spear he doesn't he doesn't like to scuba he doesn't like to take take a tank with him one time we're fishing off the back of boat he's off the front and he's like he and then on top of that he's in he's in the water and he comes out of the water he reaches up he says hey Julien bring the boat over yeah it's a shock so hey there's like it but and then he goes back down no I mean there's a shock in the water near I'm probably a reef shark and um he's got his spear and he's just like just get closer but I'm still fishing like that's that's the life so he just wants to be able to get out of shit go sideways yeah yeah I'm assuming but I'm like scared would you think that it would be safer to be in the water or on top of the water if there was a shark look if you had goggles you could see the motherfucker wouldn't you want to be in the water rather than on top and not knowing where he's coming from I would think so I would think so but then you like not only is it 360 but it's like universal the view is universal right right but if you're on top of the water and you can see at least is like you got your back to the wall and you can't come from the top that's true so that's true but I don't know but I'm at the same time you're in the water with an animal who's who that's his natural habitat like you can't you can't even turn around nearly as fast as he can he can probably swim around you and come up from the back before you could even turn around yeah probably yeah they swim pretty fucking fast yeah they're like ninjas in the water they just clean the cleanup crew just like that tiger I um so I girlfriend I were there and I was on feeding the turtles right so I try to grab a turtle and literally the turtle is this big it's no bigger than this and I'm about to pick it up I'm trying to pick it up being like explain to people oh I'm sorry yeah I'm probably like trust 16 inches Liana trashcan lid no bigger than a trashcan lid and I am trying to pick it up and this before I can get it out of the water those big fins arms that they have he just he pulls me down into the water like this this little thing he probably weighs 40 50 pounds right and it's just so powerful in the water like if I would have hang on to that turtle I would be moving faster than I would move with fins on whoa like how is that part and I'm like I don't want to talk about my weight but I'm a lot bigger than that I'm not fight weighted you're eating well um you look good man don't worry about it do you think you're gonna move to Bahamas you think he'd live there someday um I like ultimately I'm definitely gonna live back there you know my lifetime you know I am I mean if I want to I want to die there whoa I know I mean I don't necessarily want to die anytime soon but when you do you want to live the end of your life there relaxed life Island life hey man I get it every time I go to Hawaii I start my brain starts spinning I'm like can I live here why don't I just move here like I don't I don't need much you know you did you watch the Steve Jobs movie no I haven't either but just recently it was on television and the opening scene was some guy in like I don't know the 70s or 60s talking about computers when computers are huge when computers were like this big things take up an entire room I mean he's like yeah one day like you can be anywhere in the world and you can work you could be on a remote island and you can be doing your work and you will get emails you're talking about emails like in the 60s you know he's talking about the Internet in the 60s or something it's on the beginning of the jobs movie and someone with Ashton Kutcher no I wasn't asked which one there's no other ones fast Michael Fassbender to that came I think it's the fast bender I don't know what Michael Fassbender looks like I know that name but Michael Fassbender he's uh who's Ian I built was I think he's like Loki and the Avengers I think - oh yeah yeah I think it makes sense I think that's him but yeah that that movie um they were talking about that then and I'm like you know and then 2001 was when Jobs came out with that yeah that's him oh no no it's easy Loki he's someone but I think somebody up but he's from prometheus mr. robot in the Prometheus in Alien series he's the yeah that guy's excellent yeah oh so he played some stuff I asked what Steve Jobs an asshole in the Steve Jobs movie yeah I mean I only saw like the first five minutes on it I want to watch this but in the middle he does look yeah he is in the movie but the claim is that you have to be an asshole to be like a genius hey there a lot of people who get a lot of shit done eventually run into people that don't get shit done the way they want and so the only way they figure out how to get shit done with those people is to dominate them yeah punch to yell at them and to you know like the Apple deal was that you had to work insane hours - that's a weird thing man if you're gonna work for a company you got a good job is it a good job what's so good about it that you get money where's your life you don't have a life you're working 17 hours a day oh okay that sucks that's a shitty job even if you're making a lot of money like a guy who makes less money but it can take the weekend off and go fishing and hang out with his kids and chill that's a better life preach it Joe preach it it's a better life I'm listening hallelujah that Bahamas life is the way to go I'll tell you got me thinking why don't we know when I was at home is it was just nice like mm-hmm a fighters a fighter's life is kind of like that right not not all the time and not everyone but you get to do what you love to do mm-hmm and then you get to do what you wanted if you can handle the highs and the lows with fighters it's handling the highs with the ego and the lows with emotions and just letting everybody down and the depression that both of those things that's like those are the extremes you that the highs of winning big fights and have getting being admired for something that really truly becomes a part of you just just being yourself you know that that feels good but you do put a lot of weight on yourself in in when you lose like I'm gonna lie man um there there has been some things on the internet like when I lost a hominin right I was like oh he threw that fighting and I was like like that that breaks my heart that hurts when someone shows you through yeah you know yeah you just can't read that shit but I know what you mean yeah you can't read this people that they have crazy theories about nonsense there's you know that's crazy that the idea that you threw a fight or the you would get together with hot or make it a bet against yourself or something's to write that says I I just heard I just heard um at some point over the past year or so I heard an argument that like well if a guy doesn't make weight and the other guy gets so much of his purse like and he's going to get his win and show money right if he's guaranteed he's gonna show money anyway then why wouldn't he just throw the fight and get a bonus percentage of the the winners win money not some moron tomorrow well not only that - thank you that's not just a moron but someone who doesn't understand the psychology of a winner yeah like the the thing about a winner is the last thing a winner wants to do is lose on purpose right that and when you have the opportunity the big thing is winning you have the opportunity to win it's right in front of you and you only get a chance to do this three times a year four times a year five is your cowboy right like right like how many times some ways crazy he's crazy but he fights like five times a year right if he could he'd probably fight every week yeah but the the idea that you're gonna throw that the the best feeling that you could ever achieve they're crazy they just don't understand it they but that's just the problem with the internet is reading comments she's too many morons with ideas I used to love the underground man it was great back in the day I was like have like I have the Oh what I don't think I've double those you know yeah like being being from back then you know yeah or maybe even a 90 like they at some point they just gave you the number I was on in the 90 same here yeah so like I don't know if my thing says 99 or double-o I still sign in every once in a while just to check in just to check in there's so much toxic conversation but that's just the Internet in general there's still a lot of good discussions on the Underground I think last time I was I was about a month ago I went and checked I was like mmm like there was some especially there was some good jujitsu talk there was some good technique talk about like leg locks and and you know and whether or not there's going to be a transition from leg locks because everybody's the leg lock game sort of overtook to Jitsu whether or not it was going to switch to choking or when there was someone's like whether it's going to give me a new trend because leg lock defense is so good now and I'm like I appreciate that I appreciate when people are like devoted practitioners and they're really discussing technique and disco but when it's like this guy's a pussy and he fucking sucks and you know Ronda Rousey's a fucking bitch and like there's so much that it's hard to UM to filter through that to find some good conversation sometimes yeah it's like in your life you would avoid people like that like the plague like if there was a guy in your life that wanted your phone number and all he does is complain about things and have stupid theories but get this guy the fuck away from me alright yeah but you can't avoid them online yeah I know I like that's the thing that and that you know being anonymous on the Internet that's some power for some people man sure man that's crazy well it's also you got to realize that the people that are executing that power the people that want and need that power they're all either young or they're losers those are the two that they don't get it you know they're fourteen someone let's mom I just want to say mean shit because it's fun like you got a you got a rock there's a window yeah yeah I was looking I'm gonna throw this rock yeah that's what people do it's normal but I don't want to hang out with young kids and I don't want to hang out with losers but see that's the problem I think there's something with that too that on I mean well I mean we know there's something with that we're that being anonymous you that's a protection you know like you see sometimes that bleeds into their real life I mean I saw this this video this kid he's like he's just like making fun of this older man he was being rude to this woman he's making fun of this older man man so the man started making fun of him to he's like me man and so the kid starts punching him in the arm guys like he just turns away he's kids punch swinging at him and this is not like a little kid he's he's a little kid you shouldn't he's not a kid that you would smack because if he started talking smack to you right you wouldn't fight him because of that but then this kid starts punching him and he's like he's that he tells the kid to stop and the kid keeps going he grabs my throat he pushes him right and the kid falls down and he's like then he starts crying are you assaulting me it's like like what would reality do you live in man like your parents have failed like I'm sorry you know life failed them they live in a blurry reality it's too much online not enough real world yeah right not enough getting your ass kicked that's the thing fighting solves everything man stops a lot of things everything hey those people that say fight fight what is that gonna solve like everything I'm telling you like my thing is like if you start if I don't like going back and forth you know what I mean like we're not gonna go back and forth you say something disrespectful I'm gonna say something disrespectful I'm gonna up the ante and then if you want to keep going like man we can just stop talking right now and go yeah no I know I'm an old man now but like I think that solves everything like there's no reason to be talking also having a history of that and your life gives you a much better perspective of the consequences of talking shit if you don't have any history like how many times you seen guys talk shit and you know they can't fight no this is crazy this is like someone challenging someone to a race they've never driven a car like they don't even know how to shift gears you don't know a goddamn thing will you watch a Jackie Chan movie thinking to fuck somebody up like but there's a lot of people that are doing there's so many people that believe that like and then just guys who watch fights like they they believe that they could beat they they're legit people that believe they could beat people that are inside the Octagon or inside a professional cage inside the PFL or or right you know somewhere and they're just like I could beat that guy no you can't really believe that just by being to be poly Malignaggi did you see no no he'll fuck you up that was a sad fight man I watched I watched it again I didn't watch I didn't I I don't know I can't I can't bring myself to watch the bare-knuckle boxing I tell you what man changed my opinion I was thinking for a long time that MMA done correctly you'd have bare knuckles because I was like why you got bare shins and bare knees and bare elbows but you have your knuckles padded up that doesn't make any sense but now I see how that cuts like Chris Leben his face was just opened up man I was like that is just I don't want to see people take unnecessarily cuts that way because then that scar tissue opens up and then shortens their career stops fights I don't they also break it hands and I mean like like I mean that's why I don't want to watch it I I'm not a big fan of cuts remember um Marvin Eastman and Vitor Belfort no I don't I don't I don't like I don't like you know their horrific I wa I I want to show you something okay that's like you do when you do see when you see those gory videos that really throw you know okay so I'm gonna show you something and it's horrible right but um oh crap what is it um it's a video it's a video of I don't even know how to explain it I don't want I don't want to tell you what it is until you see it because it is so graphic cuz it a fight video it's not a fight video it's just something gory okay you want to see some more all right show me I keep forgetting how to get through my phone sometimes but I found it okay let's see so you're watching that right okay I don't know if those two things go together oh Jesus Christ oh Jesus Christ hmm yeah whoa you can see that Jamie yeah whoa I don't know if that that part 1 equals part 2 I don't know if that was just edited but still it looks like it took him right in the mug oh that seems like what it would do if a log hit you in the face like that yes whole head is broken he's missing his upper jaw yeah yikes like I don't I don't wanna look yeah yeah how about cyborg when Michael venom page hit him with that knee whoo that's one that makes you you makes you fucking your whole body tightens up you like howdy how do you dead somebody scold like you know much force you have to hit somebody with like that crazy think of all the fights you've seen we've never seen that I've never seen that think about this when something you everybody's been hit on the head or something fell on your head and it's a edge of something and just that pain yeah I can't imagine what that pain is like that's that's bone yeah well I don't want to see it open I'm just like I looked over there like that scream brightened up and well how about yeah with Cosmo how's Andre did - that's crazy - one punch broke like eight bones in his face yeah like it's not this is not for the light-hearted I get a lot of people like I'm not I'm not a sage hater but I'm not a sage lover you know what I mean but like I don't wish that on anybody I don't wish that on anybody either and I don't I don't like that matchup I didn't like that matchup at all I was like what are they doing that is a that's a world champion striker Cosmo is a fucking bad man he's a bad man he lights people on fire yeah you know and in him at 185 pounds with no weight cutting and that's one of things that he said about that fight how good he felt like he didn't have to cut any weight you see how thick fucking full he looked it wasn't depleted and dehydrated and everything like that and that is just not Sage's it was he bring it back to the beginning but look at this look how thick he is - like have you seen cosmos fights before I remember when he fought John Wayne par and lion fight I mean but John Wayne par is a multiple time world champion and a skillful guy and he managed to avoid like the big power shots like this and didn't get hurt but it's also Cosmo having a chance to punch you with MMA gloves right - with the majority of his career mootai boom I mean that is a crazy punch everything's behind that it's and it's like this kid is just not ready for this yeah he's just not ready for this as much as he has experienced in karate and you know he had some good MMA fights against some you know good fighters this is not a good fighter that's an elite world-class striker right and you know you're fighting him with little gloves on in a ring and you're you're mixed martial arts game is primarily a striking mm-hmm yep you have a big disadvantage huge enormous disadvantage I'd like what one is doing though I really do I like what they're doing I thought that's interesting too that they may don't fight in a ring well I don't know how many events one does in a ring versus does in a cage but the dynamics shift radically when you get caught you get cornered you know like that's one of the cool things about the Bellator cage yes it's circular there's no corner on it yeah yeah but that you know and you see a boxing ring like that yeah um that's especially again with Cosmo like yes that's where he spent most of his time like all of his time it's a different environment and cutting that off is so much easier and for a guy who's who knows how to do that it's it's almost like sage was set up I'm not saying they said shut up yeah this is a bad seed iddin have I mean I guess he didn't have to take the fight I don't know I should say I don't know how they do their matchmaking I don't know if it's like like the UFC kind of forces fights on people right they let you know like you take this fight or you know we'll probably call you yeah yeah it's up to you but if you want a career in the UFC you take fights when you get them but like when you see fighters in boxing they get if they have a really good manager they the manager knows who the guy you're gonna fight is and says okay Eve this guy is good but you can beat him and this is what I like about this style he's gonna he's gonna challenge you in a couple of areas but overall you're a better fighter than than him but it'll give you a challenge and we're trying to build your record up to get you a title shot and you know maybe you'd be nine and no 10 and no 11 and no 12 now and then you know you get to a certain level and they go okay we're ready to fight for a title and then it would be this big promotion Eve had words you know 17 and oh you know 16 knockouts and it shows your highlight reel like this is something that big management this is the reason why it's it exists in boxing it's actually smart because it's a part of the development of a fighter for every Jon Jones they could just step in the Octagon it 21 years old and start fucking people up there's so many young fighters that could be world champions but then they run into elite competition early in their career and get fucked up and then the the dream kind of drifts away from them yeah if air gets put in putting them early yep that's that's a problem and unnecessarily in my in my opinion yeah I agree um and that's that's the thing about guys getting into the UFC really early in their career like that's everybody's goal virtually every fighter on the planet that's where they want to be that's the most recognized belt that's that's the belt that everybody considers the highest ranked belt right so that's what everybody wants to get when getting there with two or three fights under your right under your belt it's exciting but like you don't you're you're in the wolf stand now yeah it's not smart everybody wants to say they're a UFC fighter but it really isn't smart the smart way to do it is to fight on the regional circuit training a really good gym and develop yourself get to I Omega yeah yeah I mean there's look look what Marlin mirai's did you know wouldn't he was before pfl when it was the world series of fighting she was fucking everybody up over there and we were watching him going how would this guy fare against world-class competition and then you get him to the UFC okay this guy's the real deal right there he's the real deal but it took all those years in smaller shows and to build up that sort of skill set and that confidence and experience there's a lot a lot of good guys they came through there like gay Chi mm-hmm sure perfect example yeah and it's it's also a good place when you get when when guys got bet one I'm not now of course because it's not along the world series but when guys got you know they got to the UFC and they did their experience show that they weren't ready for it mm-hmm you know having these smaller promotions that that's a good thing because some of those guys their spirit doesn't necessarily break they just know they're not ready for that yeah yeah going back down and working their way back up but then again it's hard it's sometimes it's hard to to earn that second shot mmm what I mean yeah like you can go back and I guess it all depends also on the relationship you had with with with the powers at be bright once you want you're out you know if you you went out on a bad note kind of doesn't really matter yeah there's some bridge burners out there yeah some young guys that get crazy and they're doing interview interviews are so toxic right you start getting crazy and you say something that really could fuck up your entire career you might not even really mean it or if you do mean it you might mean it only for an hour yeah you know and then after you say like why did I say that I really I should look at it from their perspective they're trying to run a business don't be any feeling yeah don't be in your feelings well like you know one of the more interesting things about the PFL this season was Vinny Magalhaes like Vinny Magalhaes has become who I thought he would be earlier in his career because he's such a phenom with grappling I mean he's he's the legitimate world champion I mean I remember watching him through a flying armbar unpaid upon Oh who's a multiple time Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champion himself and Vinny just locks him up and jumps into a flying armbar I'm like that is crazy and finished him off I was like that is insane like that's how good Vinny is and he was catching people and and I thought he was on his way and Shawn what is his last name Sean O'Connell yeah I want to see him Ally but I know that song's name Sean O'Connell I was very impressed man amazed that he was able to beat him man he put he put a real good game plan together he had Jeremy horn in his corner too huh I have been having that knowledge yeah thank behind you you know what I mean but um like Vinny I think his fights lasted like not even around to get into the get to the finals you know so that's four fights and he hasn't even spent five minutes in the cage yet you know and then Shawn takes him to the end but then this season Vinny just fought a couple of weeks ago and man the I guess is kind of like the strategy to be Vinny of course is to keep the fight standing not get taken out not be on bottom don't even let him pull guard but he took he took he took a pounding in that first round he needs he needs a win he needs like he needs to show that that Vinny level jujitsu his next fight to get into the playoffs this year did he win his fight he lost he lost stopped in the second I believe but who emiliana Saudi oh he lit him up man really he just just picked him apart stayed on the outside I think Vinny did get land one takedown but Saudi defended got back to his feet many like he just worked their body head just really good boxing yeah then you might be just that guy that's this elite level jujitsu guy that never quite realizes his full potential in MMA you know and it's also like the amount of time you got to think he was back in the Ultimate Fighter or Ryan Bader stopped him in the finals that's a long time ago like the third or fourth or fifth season something like that so was that 2007 or something like that 12 years ago that's a long career it's a long time but like he still looks good he still has his his striking has gotten better I mean he's not going to be able to go toe-to-toe with the elite level strikers in his weight class but um his wrestling is where I think that's where he really needs to focus now if he still wants to do I or how much long he wants to do this because you know I think Vinny's 30 33 34 35 was close but um but his striking is you have to respect it you have to respect his standing and if he could transition to taking a shot off of that and just chain wrestle like that'll be so much better because on top of course you know you know he's gonna be a monster but if he's pulling guard there's a few guys he's gonna catch but most most of the better guys you're gonna have a problem there what you think - the birthday today 35 oh yeah he's so one of the few guys I mean he didn't get like two Kimora's in a row to come Wars on the same night did it really yeah this one throat fighting the same night that shit's crazy I'm not a fan of that why cuz I think that the problem is say if two guys fight right and one guy knocks the other guy out real quick and then goes into the next round but the other guy who is going to fight he he fights and he has a rough three round war and then he goes into the next fight one guy is super fresh and the other guys bodies beat to shit just doesn't doesn't make sense like one guy's legs are all fucked up he's been leg kicked he might have got dinged he might be like a little dizzy and then he's gonna go and fight an hour later that seems ridiculous to me but what about like does that so that's different for you if it's wrestling or if it's um a submission grappling talk yes because there's no striking yeah because no strike the thing about that is you can always if you're going in banged up right or if you get hurt we saw that last year in the playoffs um I forget who were they I believe it was um mama dog know is not mama Dolph right he won his fight but he I don't remember what the injury was but he pulled out you know and the guy he beat who was not banged up really I mean the fight was a tough fight I mean claimed he was it he was going in at a hundred percent and except for the conditioning mmm yeah but the thing is like there's a difference in being injured like you tear your ACL and you know it and like I can't fight I can't go on and just being beat to shit that's that's that is the difference but you know like I mean what's the difference between fight you you can only fight five rounds right like and no Commission is gonna let you fight five rounds more than five rounds at a night so in the playoffs with the PFL we have two rounds in the quarterfinals you have in the semifinals just three rounds all right it's kind of tricky because should the fight end up in a draw then the fight who won the first round wins the fight what yeah I think it should be the second you know some people think it should be the second first why the fire that won the first round I don't know I mean that seems silly it's yes I wanna like if the the teacher comes and pulls you off a dude you're on top you punch him in the face but that guy was hitting you with a jab for the first two minutes doesn't matter everybody knows you won the fight Street Fighter II yeah if you're on top you punched him in the face when the when they break it up you won yeah he knows it too everyone knows I agree so III do like I do like the second round being weighed weighed more heavily yeah I think also having the second round weighed more heavily where the first round is you're going to press the action and and the guy's not really gonna run because if I mean if you do run you can't be assured that if unless you dominated the first round completely there can't be assured that you're gonna win that I get the strategy though where they want people to fight exciting fights they don't want anybody to hold their energy hold back until the second round I get that that makes sense yeah but at the same time one guy presses the action in the first everybody's good I mean you gotta go yeah that's true I don't know but it's it's see that's the only problem with that is if Commission's would allow three rounds you know yeah I mean what's an extra round yeah like there's there's not a single it's weird how sometimes these people who don't do it and they they say they they're concerned for your safety you know fighting we already agreed to do this like I know that's the worst thing that could happen today is a fight yeah safety yeah it's funny it's I don't know mend its I just think that twice a night when you talk to neurologists in particular they think it's very dangerous yeah because they think repeated concussions like one of the things about footballs they're really concerned with was guys that get head injuries early in the game they sit on the bench for a quarter and then jump back in they're worried about that they're worried about repeated concussions in one day I get that and I also think like where football is concerned again I love football I still like to watch the sport and I have nothing and that you as long as the fact that players have the information and you're making a choice right right this is its freedom now today yeah they have you know Bo Jackson said he wouldn't let his kids play yeah well I just really interesting yeah I didn't know I said no one knew back then yeah no one means well yeah they thought you were in a helmet you're gonna be fun see that's the thing about that's where I think the difference between fighting and and the NFL in football happens is because like if if I gave you a basketball and I stood here and I said throw that at my head as hard as you can as hard as you want right as hard as you can right I don't think you're gonna go you know try to smash me in the head with the basketball right but if I put on a helmet you're gonna be more willing to throw it harder right but it's like that doesn't that that really doesn't change anything is now now that you this perceived defense protection there's just the barrier but I'm still getting that concussive force of the you throw that basketball my head right you know but when you take football you you're not taking just a punch traveling at like 20 30 miles an hour from like two feet away hitting somebody yes it's repeated but like people don't take really more than 60 punches in a fight but um sometimes they do but um football it's like you're slamming into each other and we're talking about 250 pound men at full speed 15 to 20 miles an hour Oh boom you know and then they're both running at each other that's yeah like a head-on collision so that's that's insane that's that's so different but um like I don't I don't I don't say don't don't play the sport just make sure the information is out there that the people make their choice what if there's ever gonna be anything they can do to figure out how to protect the brain inside I mean there's got to be a way that they can figure out how to well maybe not I mean your brain sloshing around inside there yeah like they're that they have a way like give us the information let you decide whether you want to put your brain in risk or not you know what I mean but like what I like the thing about the PFL because when you get when you get to the playoffs that there was two fights in one night mom I fought in tournaments I'm like you know you knew about boxes being punching you know I knew that but um like I don't know there's there's a thing there's a thing about competing there's a passion about competing and having that tournament opportunity that's a lot of fun like a lot of these young guys a lot is young fighter they didn't get the chance to fight in tournaments because 20 was kind of ended recently you know um the Pride tournaments were awesome and then of course back then there was a lot of times at UFC had the tournament originally so that's a whole lot of fun but like with the PFL season what I like about it is is there's a bunch of different storylines that happens you know you you're fighting to gain points to get into the playoffs so the there are two regular season fights and the first regular season fight you are you you know where you're everybody stayed in at zero but then you come in the second of course everybody wants to win their fight everybody wants to win as soon as possible to get the maximum amount of points but then when you come into the second fight then everybody's like okay you're looking at the numbers I need this I need this you're concerned and then you're watching throughout the night to figure out who's who's got to do what well explain that to people that don't understand what we're talking about because there's you guys have a score system we have a scoring system so the professional fighters League a win we you have to win you have to we have a seating for the playoffs so the top eight fighters in in them in the male weight classes and the women are only eight so the top four fighters get into the playoffs right and you get in by point standings so you get a draw that's one point for each fighter you get a win that's three points but you've got to win by stoppage in the third round that's four points win by stoppage in the second five win by stoppage in the first six so you try to crew points so accumulate points so that when we get to the playoffs you're seated in the top eight and I'm talking about the men just remember that the women are four in the playoffs but when you get seated through the top eight and then you fight the quarter-final and semifinal fight on the same night and the winners from those nights so when is in the semifinals go to the championships and that's on New Year's Eve and that's for a million dollars so you get three fights for a million dollars right um that's pretty fucking good that's really good yeah all right so I I wish this tournament was around when I was like I'm like yeah what I do that you know sure I want to win a million dollars so how many fighters got a million I'm six Wow six fighters got a million dollars last year so there it is six champions million dollars each yeah and this year will be six six millionaires again so the way that the season plays out like I said you you fight the first round of the regular season when you come in we're going into the second round of the regular season now so on on the 8th on July 8th I'm sorry July 11th on Thursday night we're gonna be in Atlantic City we have the women and we have the women hundred fifty five pounders and then we have the men welterweights and so this is a fight that I'm really excited about right mega man mega mega Kerimov he won last season but then Chris Curtis came into the PFL and he won his first fight mega man won his first fight got six points Chris Curtis gots four points got third round stoppage and he called out McNamara karimov call out the champion from last year so he wants to go into this next fight fighting the champion I'm like why would you do that because if you lose that you're not making in the playoffs you lose your opportunity million dollars but like that that that that bravado of being a fighter and wantin you know you want it you want to knock the best guy off right you always want the best guy but to call him out in a fashion where where it it it threatened your potato like he has to perform right he has to perform now so like that fight really interests me because Magnum at Karimov is really good he can do everything like he's one of those guys who doesn't look like you know his body type he doesn't look like the kind of guy will smash you but he will do you see Ray Cooper last year mm-hmm like ray goober the second Ray Cooper the second that's me crazy is that Jake Shields fought his dad yeah and him and him and fought him twice that was what was kind of fucked up I watched both those fights I was like damn they're making Jake Shields fight this dude again they didn't make him do it I know they didn't make him do it but he fucked Jake up and then he fucked him up again a couple months later yeah how many months later was only three or five three months yeah the seating that's rough but okay a bad KO like that from the same guy and then you fry to be I mean he didn't have any answers for that dude like to fight a guy like Ray who was a believing state champion Hawaiian wrestler Yeah right and who does he have some fuckin heavy hands he's like the Mike Tyson of like welterweight sin and for welterweight he's fairly short he's like five seven you know he just throws fucking bricks well so does John Howard though John Howard's got some fucking bombs and his yeah I like that fight - yeah very interesting Friday that's a very good fight now with that fight mmm because ray hit so hard John Howard does have some bombs in his hand I think Ray has more power though you know I feel like Howard's going to have to stick and move use those leg kicks and Men slow him down you you you can't you can't go out there trying to take ray Cooper out early well John's been around a long time - John John has had a long career yeah you know I mean how old is John now I think John is probably like 33 now he's at least it may be 35 he was in the UFC a long time ago my 36 oh yeah yeah yeah and he's been in some crazy Wars you know he's been in some Wars he's black he like he's he just got his black belt no and that's the only guy who beat grey Cooper last season you know Mary Mary care him off being my submission mom I think that's that's the best the best option for a lot of guys facing him because he has so much power now all these are on NBC Sports is that what they're doing espn2 ESPNU ESPNEWS okay well that's that's right that's that's new to this year right that's new to this year that's very exciting that's very exciting ESPN Plus which also has the UFC and put it on ESPN as well that's great yeah that's so good man that ESPN is stepping into MMA like this I love it it's huge because I thought this last year when the UFC signed with ESPN I was like like that's a great thing because a lot of times the UFC when fight fans watch the UFC they only only think of the UFC as mixed martial I'm sorry they think of mixed martial arts as the UFC right you know people ask you trained UFC but like ESPN being the worldwide leader in sports I've seen like highlights on ESPN from Rison from you know from Japan from one wall he's different from some small promotions and it's like that helps the sport grow that helps people recognize that this is just there's not only one Avenue for the sport and these these guys do have to cut their tea somewhere and also there are some other organizations where where you can get some quality fights and really good fighters and then money and money yeah like I like there being a lot more options for guys where the money is concerned I'm very happy about that I mean that's how they lured sage over to one Fc and also Eddie Alvarez and Mighty Mouse you know yeah it's a different world when there's no way cutting you know I am such a giant fan of that know what weight cutting deal the way they're doing it over at one Fc it's okay so what exactly are they doing you you you hydration tests and how house how far out before the fight I don't know I don't know how they're doing it but it was explained to me is they essentially say if you were the 170 pound champion they'd bump you up to like 185 they're like look you're gonna fight 185 now there's no weight cutting we're gonna test you we're gonna test your weight we're gonna test your hydration we're gonna we're gonna know what your real weight is so this is your real weight your real weight is 185 pounds you're droppin 15 pounds of water to get to 170 but we both know that when you get into that octagon you're gonna be 185 pounds so let's just cut the shit and have you never drop down to 170 and just say you're 185 pound fighter which is what they're I mean stand next to guys like kymaro you smile you like how are you 170 that doesn't make any sense or yo well who's the craziest way yo well is so big he's so big his fucking neck starts at the top of his head and his shoulders they meet the traps in the middle you know it's like dodge dodge dodge he's just as mammoth of a man and the idea that that guy is 185 pounds is bananas Tim Tebow those those kinds of guys yeah yeah and these guys are still muscular than time I don't know how Glaceon did it all those years glycin was walking around well over 190 and getting down to one for not not even man like I'd see Tebow in the gym and it's like Tebow what are you worried right now he's like oh my friend won 190 195 get on the scale no no no he's not doing that you know he's easy like 205 210 really tools my life 210 you would get down to 155 so big how did he do it I don't know sheer force of will yeah so I've seen him at weight cuts just like laid out like we we fought on a couple cars together also you know and he like laid out Neela he has to be carried out of the room you know of course you have to walk up to the scale on your own but um that's so insane that you let a guy do that and then they fight a day later yeah the next day like but you wouldn't you wouldn't let somebody recover from the flu like say oh I feel better the temperatures down you want to let them fight the next thing right now they're probably healthier yeah it's it's the dumbest thing in all combat sports internally yeah but I could be avoided so you think the one there's no I am because I haven't been in the position I don't know how you work the system right with the one Fc system I would like to talk to Chakri chatri chatri is the one who set it all up I mean that's it's his organization and he I think he's the leader in terms of the safety and it also fairness because I think that what weight cutting is I mean look everybody's doing it so it's not like everybody is ethically compromised but I think it's cheating I think it's legal cheating that's what I think it is if you're pretending you weigh a hundred and twenty-five pounds like Mighty Mouse does he doesn't really weigh 125 140 yeah 140 something you know that's what he really weighs and the thing is when he's fighting over in one Fc those are the guys he's actually fighting he's fighting guys his size yeah so the guys that really did a great job of cutting weight they do have a significant advantage once they get into that octagon but I don't think that's a fair advantage there's some guys that do it really well - yeah really well some guys are excellent at it yeah some guy yo L he's actually missed a couple of times some those guys they just the advantage is so spectacular how does James Vic make 155 that's a good point he's a tall fella yeah yeah there's a lot of those guy help Paul felt her palm folders are fucking gorilla house you talking what 55 he's so thick yeah yeah he's broad man I remember when Dustin was making 145 mm-hmm crazy he looks like he's having a hard time making 55 now but look man the difference between him at 45 and 55 is pretty significant so with Dustin like I I'm kind of biased cuz he's ones friends right but um you see how max max dominated a lot of guys at 45 and then all that you know you talk about Max is like now he now he's the greatest now he's the greatest at 1:45 he may he may be the goat he may be greater than Joe say although like that's an argument people can make well he beat him twice hey although he beat him later in his career right Josie's not fifty years old he was in this early third yeah and he was still he was still the number one guy he was still dominating everybody else meeting everybody else but like the way max beat those guys beat or tag or beat Joe say twice um and then Dustin's having these tough fights he's he's fighting these same guys he's fighting gage he's fighting Eddie he's winning them he's convincingly winning them but um when he fights max like max that the fight is Dustin's fight is the same fight that he had with gaging he's the same as far as competitiveness right max was still in there but Dustin wins these but like I just like this is where my bias kicks in I'm like give that man some credit man like I I mean I know everybody loves dust I mean not everybody but people loved us and they appreciate the way he fights they appreciate his style but I'm like man he's he's taken out like champions mmm taking out Champions Gate she was a champion was in World Series but he's a champion you don't took out Eddie champion you know you know max champion he's like all these guys beating Sergio ped I mean Andre Anthony Pettis champion you know just champion athlete check he also rises to the occasion he fought better against max and any other fighter you ever fought in his career that's the thing about him though like he just he's like he's like the cream you know he's easy Rises that that's that's that's why that's why his nickname is a diamond you know what do you think happens when he farts could be yeah this this is the one that's the fight I'm so far like that's I mean Kobe was the guy Kobe was definitely the guy and now I was talking to him about it I so I'm starting a new podcast I am I am calm sup fan sup fam sup fam with Eve Edwards yeah I know I just just releases two dates on my YouTube just started today yeah well just released the first episode oh alright umm and Dustin's my first guess oh so I was out there with him last week we're just hanging out we talked about some of that but like what do I think happens this is a tough fight this like it's the toughest fight everybody's going to get right um I absolutely understand and agree that kabhi should be going in as the favorite right um I want of course I want Dustin to win this fight the every round starts on the feet Dustin's got to make smart moves every single time because when khabib takes him down it's it's almost virtually impossible to get back to your feet right and that's where Kobe was gonna want this fight to happen Dustin's gonna have his opportunities but like is he going to be able to stop that wrestling consistently enough to make this fight happen where it's best for him and that's the hardest thing he's got a good training camp he's got really good people there with him he's got Mike Brown there you know who I want to get with him Greg Google SP I want Gregory Gillespie to get with Dustin and just get on top in for the next two months just feel that high-level rustling yeah smashing pressure just that pressure pressure pressure and get comfortable working out of it working under there protecting yourself doing that would he be interested in I mean he might fight him down the road though it's possible yeah right um but like Tyrone and Robby train together a long time ago that's true yeah I mean that's how you get better yeah like it's it's it's one of those things where it's like you you got to sometimes you got to trade with a potential rival or you know not an enemy but um but like iron sharpens iron you don't know and sometimes you get it you have to go with somebody that's a possible match up in the future just especially if you're going to fight a guy who has that same style and did I think you nailed it too because Greg or Gillespie is probably when you get past could be the scariest wrestler in the division yeah I mean here's a guy that gets on top of people and just smashes he's relentless with his when he's wrestling also he's a guy who's not gonna get tired he's gonna put that pressure and he's gonna come forward and once he gets a hold of you if you don't use perfect technique to escape and get that distance back he's just gonna chain wrestle and chain wrestle there's there's no there's no stopping until you're down until he scores his - there's that the takedown is still happening yeah he's got some fucking relentless strength and conditioning sessions - that he puts on his Instagram you watching you go oh this is why this guy doesn't get tired fuck that guy doesn't get tired cuz he's he's obsessed yeah I come he he runs he wants like five minute miles I was real like he'll run like six of them straight first like he like he will he will one like he'll run eight miles and he'll keep them all under six minutes so he'll run six miles in a half an hour yeah he can do that he's crazy wow that's crazy that's like that's high-level marathon Hayes right yeah like you people don't people don't know some of the things about about these guys like like there was a point where training with these guys I was just like alright I'm too old to be doing that I can't I just can't keep up with that you know I mean yeah and that was one of them and Gregor like we were on this Nike running app together and um like I I had to delete him off my thing cuz I was getting like this curse like I'm not trying to beat that you know that's hilarious like for real you should go fishing with them I want to go fishing with that dude I want to take up fishing in the Bahamas oh that's a good spy online fishing not not like with rod we fish a lot of line fishing okay just with your hands yeah yeah and um that's why when you feel the fish on the line oh and you just fighting and I love that it's funny I mean they're they're some fishy like I'm not pulling up a grouper like that now why do you why do you prefer a line fishing with your hands just cuz it's the old-school way just just because it's the way I grew up um like when we when we cake like my cousin I told you about who's you know free dives like he'll spear fish so I remember once I was a little kid and um he was out with his daddy's spear fishing and miss the fish and smash the turtle oh no no he sees my hit the his spirit of turtle turtle took off of this beer Oh No so fuck you know yeah I mean it's potentially some turtle out there in the ocean right now the spear stuck at him this is like 30 years ago those things live do live forever its water if it survived calcified over the the spear point yeah I've never been spearfishing but it looks like a hell of a lot of fun I have I've never spare fished like inside I've you know I play with him on land and of course it's with the with the with the what's that the rubber you know like kind of like a slingshot cord yeah the bungee cord so that one was cool but of course they have the guns I would like to use a spear gun but I like um I don't know you kind of have to earn that right I feel you know yeah I got I gotta go freediving like early and do some of that what's the long as you think you can hold your breath underwater um so we used to have this thing as a kid where I was where we'd say we try to blow the pool and like I can I can swim an olympic-level well I have swam an Olympic length pool staying underwater right but how long it take that well it took me like nah I probably took me like 40 45 seconds and then also you're swimming yeah you're exerting so yeah but uh but like he I'm telling you he goes down and he's under the water for easily three minutes you know was supposed to be insane Atanas Egon Egon anyway I heard about that I heard he got six minutes seven minutes yeah I it's like I don't know maybe from sucking up a choke you know I think it's just practice I think you just practice free diamond in Hawaiians they do that crazy work out there was a member one of the countdown shows and PJ was supposed to be fighting George st. Pierre they had him doing his strength conditioning in the water where he would dive under water and pick up a rock and move it and drop it and swim to the surface and drive dive down again and pick up the rock a big-ass rock and move it and that was part of his strength and conditioning so I come the the I I was D I was good with my cardio there were times when i gassed but um like when punches are coming at you a lot of people Blake a lot of people do that so that like that was my I keep my eyes open a long time I mean so that that's my that whole stare can thing that kind of comes from that I just keep my eyes open not blinking those guys who do those underwater things how do how do you think that relates to like I understand you can hold your breath long but how do you think that relates to cardio because you're not you're your muscles not working except to hold the rock well the idea is they doing the rock thing like moving and carrying the rock while you're underwater oh man I don't know enough about it but I know I had Laird Hamilton on recently you know he's a big-time surfer and one of the things that he's doing now with his this whole program where they're doing weights in the water so they're they're doing like heavy dumbbells and they'll bring them to the bottom of the water and you have to take the dumbbell swim with it to top catch a breath air and then to go back down again and there's there's also doing some where they're taking like you know a 70 pound dumbbell you hold it to your chest and you're swimming through the water while you're trying to carry this dumbbell and you know it's extremely difficult to do the thing is how much is that applicable to fighting that's what I don't know cuz I remember when I was like real heavily in did you Jitsu at one point in time I didn't do any striking for like like a whole year I didn't even hit pads and then but I was in really good jujitsu shape I was rolling a lot and then I went to hit pass I was like god dammit why am i gasps and out so quick this is crazy it's a different shape right yeah it's a different shape I don't I always I'm always concerned about that are curious about that anyway because because of all those different aspects of it um you know there are there are times when when you when you're grabbing onto something holding on something and you and then you get back to your feet and all that lactic acid your arms and your arm is slow but like you still feel your conditioning feels good would you just feel heavy yeah but um there's those times also when you're you're grappling and then you get back to your feet and then it's like your arms don't feel tired but it's like it feels it's a I don't know I don't know is it because you're holding your breath and maybe that's what going on the waters for I don't know you know the people that the train BJ for in the prime of his career was a barber in Yvette's do you remember that I remember that name they had these ridiculous plyometric drills they had him doing and their attitude and Nick curse on is one of their protegees and he still sort of has the same philosophy their attitude is that you already know how to fight like you're already a skillful fighter when you get to the UFC if you have eight weeks to get ready for a fight or 12 weeks get ready for a fight the most important thing is your gas tank and that you should concentrate on these fucking preposterous plyometric drills and strength and conditioning drills and just get your body so you have the biggest fucking gas tank possible and then all your skills you just drill like that shouldn't have any any effect like cardio-wise like if you're doing drills as far as like striking grappling combination drills or whatever you're doing like those things should almost be secondary to your strength and conditioning yes their attitude I I kind of agree with that I mean there's a point where yeah you can always improve technique wise but are you gonna do that in an eight week camp right right now like you do that you do that in your downtime right you do that when you're not in camp lab comes it's all about being ready to fight for as long as you need to as hard as you can and I think their attitude also is that this way you're doing way less sparring way less opportunity to get hurt and mostly it's these crazy plyo drills box jumps and all this crazy shit medicine ball stuff all this all this stuff we just exploding smoke smoke smoke smoke everything is just go go go go go so that your body's just used to that so then when you get into a fight your body has this insane gas tank and they might I mean there's something to it because those were BJ's best days the sean sherk fight the diego sanchez fight that was prime BJ Penn when he was the motherfucker of motherfuckers that was what was up I mean he was she was training with the Mirena bitches did you did you see that video him beatin of the bouncer he's obviously having a real tough time man I didn't I just saw the video I don't know how it is inside control with flip-flops on yeah but I'm here's my thing I don't know the situation I led to it I only saw that he's on top of the guy and I'm like and I'm like this isn't a ye like who picks a fight with BJ Penn in Hawaii or who even like steps to BJ Penn in Hawaii I mean I understand it if there was I don't know the situation if it's like DJ you got to leave and he's not listening you try to get BJ's friends to go play talk to your guy man get him out of here but like you know you'll go toe to toe BJ pad right it seems stupid I don't care hey did max Holloway is he the one who started the bottle cap challenge do we know that for a fact I use the first one I saw I'm so tired of seeing people kick bottle caps I saw I was gonna say there's something different about his is that the cap stayed on the bottle everyone else is just kicking the cap off spinning coincidental I know but that that might be to the bottle of Tito's I think that he used but like that's a little more impressive than some of the other people just not going to offer slightly slightly if it's not that big of a listen there's a reason why so many people are doing it it's not that hard it's just not that hard you throw a wheel kick like this you just like get someone to hold it you get someone a hold of tight and the wheel kick goes like this and you have the bottle cap barely on so the bottle cap is like this and just make sure you throw a wheel kicks like that but you don't knock it off that's everyone else knock it off he kept it on well I think people using water bottle caps which have a shallow set of grooves whereas like the bottle that he used has a deeper good it'd be more impressive if they showed the whole bottle and that there's not someone holding it and you like you only I think I've never even thought once about doing it so like I know how to throw a wheel kick it seems silly to me like with Jason Statham's do it and when John Mayer did it the fucking shark was jumped that assassin I think max called him out on it he did it yeah he called out John Mayer why it's like why does Justin Bieber want to fight Tom Cruise there's so many questions I would watch it I think Tom Cruise will and lock him up with all those crazy voodoo superpowers from Scientology and the aliens belief in himself man the fights weekend yeah all right I just I so I didn't want to watch him I was on I was in Texas and I called there's this ice cream and they were in Austin I was like they never have it and they had it one time I was I drove from Houston Austin to get some ice cream really yeah you drove from Houston Austin that's like three hours yeah you drove three hours for ice cream I did oh my god you're embracing the fat [Laughter] people to see you in the later stage James Toney yeah yeah I don't want to be James Toney I want to still be able to take off my shirt but man I had to go get it Wow Wow but I did watch the fight and I watched the main card Francis it's fucking terrifying right he's fucking terrifying like when when JT has missed yeah like you can't you can't make mistakes against him because you take one and that could be it well I felt like JDS was doing pretty good in the beginning with the legs that's what you need to do it Francis you just keep moving and kick those legs yeah it would be interesting to see if well mean obviously Alistair was the most elite strikers for the most decorated striker in the whole division and one of the most decorated strikers ever and France is still nuked him he just nukes guys all he has to do is hit you man crazy you saw um um I can't say his last name champion Dollaz nicknamed loved and fought on the undercard I think he was a Cameroonian also I didn't see the undercard the only thing I saw was the Francis fight this guy looks like if you take tyron woodley and made him bigger stronger faster what what's his name dalla Lou Lou young boo I can't I don't know his last name I can't pronounce it mm-hmm but um is he a new acquired I think this was debut oh and he look honestly I would like to see him in Alonzo mana feel at some point they both look they're both like it would be like watching like two GI Joe figures like just like getting in there and going you know that heavy weight that fights in one Fc they calling the panther he just did the bottle cap challenge - he did like a hook kick and then a wheel kick with a different leg no he he's this dude who is another one of those preposterous looking fellows that just unbelievably jacked and a heavyweight what do you got here here it is we're gonna see the this is the highlight oh yeah oh my god he's fast yeah I see what you're saying and he's just so big mm powerful light anyway whatever way like it oh oh that's well that's interesting because this fucking weight class needs some new blood that's for sure I mean yeah that's a wrap quick damn I'm like I'm like you I'm like man you wanna come make a million dollars how many contracts I mean these contracts how many fights that they put them under um you just for the year so to get to the main is five fights and if you win do you have to stay in the PFL boots not have time you do not have to um I don't actually when it comes to that I don't know the details on champions but I know that the semi-finalists have returned so I haven't read everyone's contract or anyone's contract really but I'm thinking that semifinalist return I don't know if there's a right to first refusal in the contract for the season but um that's a good question I need to know that do you like the whole point scoring format thing do you think just it's a good added element I like it I like it because and not necessarily because it changes how people's fight people fight fighting in this organization I believe you kind of you a little more loose you know I mean you you show up and you know you have to win you try to win and you try to win you don't just try to get the W you know there are there's there's a lot of fights sometimes when it's like you're on the bubble and it's like you're fighting very cautious you know I feel like with this rule set you get to just be yourself out there you ever you always want to win so you're always going to fight to win but you don't necessarily change your style to play again play the rules you just go you're just gonna fight the way you fight hmm the only thing that concerns me is that it's a little complicated like the pay attention to all but for the fans yeah the points and all that just so I understand why you would say that but if you're watching the broadcast like you know you got me Sean Randi behind the desk and we're trying to keep people updated with the points and how that works and and it's it's really not that hard who's Sean Sean O'Connell oh so he's doing competition he's doing commentary he was a radio guy right yeah he was a radio guy for not serious like a sports radio car and he's crazy yeah good for him yeah diverting million and he's diversified his portfolio and he retired he retired from fighting and now he's in the booth resumes and he's I think he's a pretty good play by play guy especially as a former fighter not a lot of play-by-play guys a former fighters yeah that's right it's usually color and he he fought well in the UFC - he's a tough guy yeah I mean and and it's weird I always make fun of him I always tell him like hey you fight like Homer Simpson but you fight like he was higher I said fights like homersim can he take so many shots man he just like stands in front of you and just trades punches but like like he had to use his brain to beat Vinny you know what I mean yeah um this Vinny takes you down gets on top he's got he's gonna grind and grind himself to submission yeah but um with Sean he was you know he backed away from from the because all of his other fights all season were the Homer Simpson fight you know like he got hit sometimes but he just came back and bombed on you and and knocked everybody out he lost every first round that he fought one of them he lost the entire fight but um every other fight that he fought he lost the first round and then came back in and just just bombed on guys even with Vinny he lost the first round you know hmm but um but as far as the points go with that you have us communicating how the points work and it I remember being in your position before the season started thinking all the points things it's gonna be weird it's gonna throw people off but legit you see that play out one time Oh simple it makes sense you know you start watching guys like so this next round of fights coming up on the 11th and on the 25th then August 8th we have the different way to weight classes per show right and um so we start with the women's light weights and the welterweights then we have the feather weights and the men's light weights and then we have the light hair use in the heavies so on those dates but when um when you think about the points right you understand that like these guys are on the bowl you're watching it like like the NFL playoffs when when you know the last two weeks of the playoffs is like this guy needs to beat this guy and this guy has to finish before this time you know if he can get this win in the second round in less than two and a half minutes then he's in the playoffs but if it goes past two and a half he's out you know so easy but like we're we're communicating that we reach fight especially in the this second round of the regular season but um you what you're watching that because these guys know that also right so so some some of that like it's weird because in a fight you're not thinking about anything else but the guy in front of you but you go in there with that mentality that's already on the board you don't have it there's a pin in that you know you don't have to think about it consciously but it's in your subconscious at some point you you play to that but even if you get out of that if you get beyond that then you're still there's a pride thing and this is a format that didn't exist with the PFL or World Series find out rather know there's a new formats and new so that's why they changed the name they changed the name they changed the name just before they introduced this format but uh I believe that names changed going into this format I think they had one event as the professional fighters league without this seasonal format might be too old-school you might be too old you say that like you gotta try it like you're you're a fight fan yeah like and I promise you as a fight fan you're gonna appreciate okay tell me what card to watch what's what's a good upcoming card the next card is a real one because it's because the besides the women you got Kayla Harrison judo two-time well she's a B she's right she's a she's a beast but she she needs to get a finish to guarantee yourself a playoff spot because she fought her last fight she fought her toughest opponent who took her to a decision she you won the fight convincingly but she couldn't get herself a stoppage you know Sarah Kaufman is because there Kaufman sitting at the top of the women's rankings with with the finish there's some some really good women out there too there he's to kickboxers they fought each other last time Bobby Jo DL and Jenna Fabian they're both built like European kick boxers they're tall lanky long women and they're legit good kick boxers they went until they went toe to toe to each other um they're fighting in this week they're not fighting each other but they're fighting the Jenna Fabian needs in W to get into the playoffs so those fights are good and then of course we have the welterweight we're talking about Megaman Megaman karimov and and and Chris Curtis I don't know if you know Chris Curtis he was on he was on so um he was I think he was LFA champion or RF a champion and he was on he was on contenders he won his fight in contenders I don't know why I didn't get a contract but um he's really really good he's one of those guys he's been training with with Henderson and those guys for a long time now he's in Vegas with um with Xtreme Couture there and then the John Howard Ray Cooper fight that's like as a fight fan you I know you excellent for it so when is that that is on July 11th okay next Thursday and - okay and + beautiful yeah I'm around I'm gonna watch that fight I'm good I'm legit gonna when we sit down for the broadcast I'm texting you okay you got it like if you don't wanna if you don't respond and put you on blast this guy doesn't like on ESPN plus we are we're on ESPN plus and Joe rogue is nowhere to be found I can't have that happen I'll be paying attention all right so that's a so all the fights are gonna be on ESPN Plus all this sometimes when the espn2 fights you can't get them on ESPN Plus unless you have it set up okay so a lot of times so we bounced between ESPN plus and - I don't know the format for the first fight I can't remember which section of the card is on espn2 and then on Plus oh there it is so we're on Plus at 5:30 to 8:30 East Coast time and then on - from 8:30 to 10:30 that's a great thing about ESPN including with the UFC is that so any sports fans just have ESPN on automatic absolutely like I was at a pool hall on Saturday night I did a show in Baltimore and then we went to a pool hall we got there right when junior was entering into the Octagon it was perfect yeah it's perfect timing and I was like don't blink coz this fucking probably ain't gonna make it out of the first round yeah that was that was a fight I was telling my grandmother about that fight now like I'm not I'm not pushing you she was a it's interesting like Francis wants another shot at the title and you know it's it's uh I mean I don't know why they wouldn't give him another shot Stowe I've in my opinion it's like what you got now is steep a versus DC that that irons out who's the champ right and thank God they made that fight instead of the Brock Lesnar fight I mean I think the Brock Lesnar fight would have been fun and I want I love DC I want him to get paid I think he sends Brock Lesnar into another dimension that's what I think happens in that fight and I think he gets a big payday and that's all great but the reality is the real fight steep a steep a is the most successful UFC heavyweight champion of all time the only guy to ever defend the title four times and the only guy to survived the fucking hurricane that is Francis and gone yeah the only guy yeah he figured it out he figured it out just weather the storm you know just roll with the punches kick the legs jab move usually wrestling and wrestle I mean anybody had to stop he had to avoid the punches at first yeah and he's got you know that was an interesting team to I was thinking the fight with just IPE with Francis how much did that take out a steep a cuz even though he won that fight when DC knocked him out with one punch like wow that's crazy you don't see steep a getting knocked out like that I wonder if he was still suffering from the in Ghana fight which is only like a few months before that I don't know if he was still suffering from that versus um it's perfect punch - yeah that's that's the thing um and DC talked about it he talked about we saw this being an option in this fight this being an opportunity to get this tool and this shot this and um he did it you know that that's the thing if Francis anybody probably anybody with any power of course if Francis lands at shots night lights out also yeah but um he didn't see and he didn't he didn't have the skillset to provide that opportunity right you know I think that's yeah that that might be more telling this sort of perfect punch to him you know he he gets rid of the arm on the left side then boom the right hand comes over you got like that that kind of thing that makes me appreciate like fight IQ of a guy like Cormier no I mean because like again and got a bigger puncher like but like he just doesn't have the skillset that DC has and seeing that like you remember him talking about that in the post fight you know like that was something they saw and to to know that that's there and find that opportunity to make that opportunity happen you know that's um that's high level stuff man that was tough that's what the best guys do I heard that DC looks fantastic and camp already looks so good but I'm really interested to see what a motivated hungry you know out for revenge deep a can do and like he mean he knows to take that away yeah you know what I mean is DC he kind of got into it he explained exactly what they saw and how they figured to use that against him so like Steve pays also like you said he's the most decorated everyway champion he's the most successful that success didn't come from like not only his skillset but also his mentality he has to go back into the gym break that down take that out of his game you know make that not not a thing and also now he knows that the it's the title is everything you lose the title people don't even talk about yeah they stop talking about him yeah you know I felt obliged I felt like I had an obligation to talk about steep a I'm like no one's talking about him like how you not talking about the most successful heavyweight champion of all time yeah the guy who I understand him having to have one fight before you didn't rematch or he could he could have legitimately just got the rematch because of his resume as champion you know I don't know III I don't like that part of fighting where you only as good as your last fight ya know I don't like it either I don't I just feel like I get the business aspect of it I get that but I feel like when a fighter like that you gotta give him a rematch you have to deserves it he's a champion of like a legit champion the guy says he wants a rematch set it up so quick question where that's concerned when you say that right um Woodley like of course like you had GSP you had Matt Hughes they had long title runs also but um the fight with Kumar Kumar was so dominating that yeah like what does Woodley need to do to get a rematch that's an interesting question because it's a different thing right yeah I guess it's a different thing but is it really I mean is it real is it really different to dominate a guy than to hit him with one punch I mean kind of is but it's also you're dealing with a guy who is like a long time champion who dominated the division a guy who you know just blew Darren tills title shot hopes up into smithereens you know that was that was the big one right yeah the Dare until one because that one was confusing to me I'm like how how is he the betting favorite I don't understand it I get a he beat cowboy and I get he dropped Wonder Boy but this is tyron woodley is a guy who's battle-tested man he's been in there with everybody that I felt that was one of the weirder believing the hype things in terms of like the bookmakers and it worked out well for photographer fans that you know knew yeah but yeah dump Camaro was so dominant and then you got colby covington who still has the the you know the claim to the interim they took it away from him but he's fighting robbie yeah that's that's so that's a fight as a fight i'm interested in because like we all used to train together mm-hm you know there was a win when when Robbie was getting ready for Johny Hendricks remember call me the wrestler yeah and he's a southpaw right you know it was years ago and Colby's grown a lot since then but I mean those guys spent a lot of time on the mat together a couple years ago you know how do those training sessions go I can't tell you that yes you can yeah but but like one of them is acquaintance oh no that's a good friend link twice if Robbie fuck toom up stair care I like you know what I like about it Robbie looked physically fantastic in his last fight yeah and I know he lost to Ben Askren it was a huge in a controversial situation I don't know man I went over with herb Dean we watched the fight again when herb was in here I kind of believe him I kind of go the way his arm just dropped like that I'm like that seems like he was out I believe that herb felt he was out I don't think Robbie was out I think he was out for a second think so yeah I think he was out for a second and I think when herb came over then Ben let let the show I'll try that again in slow motion but like you don't come back from a choke instantly well you do if he was letting the choke up while you were fighting so if herbs coming over and he thinks Robbie's out and he starts to let up and then the blood rush to the brain and then herb stops the fighting he lets it go and then he's up like nothing happened depends on how long you been out if you're out for only a second it depends it depends on how tight the choke is is the blood kind of getting in there and then not getting in there i'ma leave it alone because now we're getting any conjecture I guess guessing now yeah I was disappointing but also if he just put him to sleep that would have been definitive but it's just it was so confusing we thought he was out and then he wasn't out we were like what and then with the most people thought they had to run it back most people yeah I thought so too yeah I'm surprised they're not but I like that I'm down for him and Mozgov yes I like that fight yes I like that fight a lot cuz maza doll can wrestle maza doll can wrestle and he's super crafty and he's mean as fuck he's a mean man you know I was I'm not gonna lie man I'm telling you of all the people I've trained with I think overall when you put the entirety of the mixed martial arts to is together while it all might be the best real like he liked his boxing is some of the best in the sport of mixed martial arts he he's not a kickboxer but he's confident and comfortable with all the kicks wrestling his wrestling is way be on a guy who never wrestled like you know it's like he's like Division one level you know at the very least and then his jiu-jitsu people sleep on his jiu-jitsu madmaz Vidal isn't the JIT on the ground the first day I went into American Talton we'd fought each other before and I figured not this guy's horrible on the ground we just go but like I was like I was surprised and this was like 12 years ago ten years ago you know and yeah and he's day in day out he's a worker like he's constantly working on his crap he's costly working to get better um Ben Askren you know he's got the ground he's you know he's got the wrestling but but Maz Woodall defensive wrestling is asking to be able to you know Maul him like he'd done to everybody else and he's got to close that distance he's got it close there's I mean and on the feet Maz Woodall has a giant advantage just giant footwork yeah great hands but oscar has this crazy way of getting a hold of people even Robbie even after Robbie was blasting his brains into another dimension he still got up and was grabbing Robbie it's like he has this ability to grab people and hold onto people like if she watches the Douglas Lima fight or the chorus cop fight in in Bellator like Jesus Christ like he he bragged all's people it's weird any hole yeah he's hard to get away from mm-hmm very hard from I remember when I first met Ben he um I watched he went to this torn he used to do tournaments and in college just to get more pins so you could have like the pin record so he got the pin record for um for Missouri for the University of Missouri I'm used to but he would also with other high level wrestlers he would just like let people take him now Jay or I'd let people in on his legs so he can get into these scrambles with that funk stuff that he does yeah this he has Dean Thomas one time he's wrestling on that same trip he's wrestling with Dean and he just stopped everything like do you not a sprawl like like like Dean and didn't even know what a sprawl was cuz his wrestling is so good he just touched he was touching us and we've fallen over and I mean wow his wrestling is that good well it makes it even more impressive with Jordan Burroughs to do him when Jordan Burroughs doesn't have that wrestling match like there's and he said it afterwards you put it on Instagram there's levels to this and there is because he just ran him over right through him power doesn't isn't it crazy just when you think about that a guy who's the elite of the elite in wrestling is so much better than the elite of the elite of in wrestling and MMA yeah this is so much better but what he have still been able to do that the same way if Ben was only wrestling got something it's hard to say because Jordans so good yeah he's so dominant it's hard to say are you talking about what a two-time Olympic champion yeah it was unbelievably explosive to any work that you ever seen his workouts all plyos drills explosive drills and he's just all about closing that distance with just ferocious energy boo crosses that disk he's not even there goddamn teleports I was hoping he was gonna get an MMA but it doesn't seem like he wants to know I am honestly when he was still in school so one of my buddies Lin OD'ing he was reaching out this sound like my tyrant he was reaching out so it's a Division one wrestlers for me to help me with my wrestling after the job Stephenson fight because I was like I can't wrestle right and um Jordan burrows is one of the guys he reached out to and he was just not interested in MMA at that point he was like I'm going to Olympics I'm gonna wrestle he had no interest I don't know where that stands now because the sport is bigger there's more money in it yeah but he's still having so much success wrestling right and who knows how much time if any he's put into striking yeah but like that IQ of his as far as wrestling that athleticism you know he's a hard worker oh yeah it will apply if he dedicates himself to it but if he hasn't at all he's so far behind the eight-ball like if he jumps in now with zero striking you know how long would it take before he gets to a comfortable level of striking where he can hang in there you know like remember tomorrow tomorrow when he first started fighting was really just a wrestling yeah but then you really saw in the tyrant fight when he almost stopped tyrant on the feet he's is striking is legit now his fight with Maria Mariah's yeah surge omurice that was where I started to recognize his striking is improving oh yeah and you could see it if you watch his fights from men you can see each time a vast improvement in his striking but what I like about that is his wrestling didn't really fade the best things still stayed sharp yeah and that's that's where I like I'm like how do you do that because there's only so much hours in a day well it's also crazy with him is he can't run his knees are so fucked up I didn't know that he talked about he doesn't even care to talk he doesn't mind talking about it he's like Joe my knees were so fucked up I have to walk on the grass because I couldn't walk on the concrete cuz it hurt too much how do you fight at that level I give you care Rock I don't understand well he just does like airdyne bike and what I mean how do you even how do they even work inside the Octagon if you can't run off tough just tough unbelievable mental toughness I mean I think he gets in there he just forced his body to do whatever he wants it to do the drastic feels any pain when he doesn't when he fighting he's in pain all time yeah well but you never see it well you know you had a broken foot in that fight yeah but that's the kind of there's like a mindset that some people have the champion mindset with all that stuff means nothing and he had hernias he had hernia surgery after the fight I mean what the fuck that's yeah that's that's some different that's some different shit bro says there's levels there's levels of the mental game to this like some guys can just push through everything and some guys will find a reason why they have to get out yeah you know yeah there's there's that being in that moment and like now now means everything you know there is no tomorrow you know you know it's like I liked I I try to keep that mentality also in some of the things that I try to do now because it gives like I'm just kidding the Bahamas you know there's no reason that somebody in Japan should know of my name but because of mixed martial arts because of my dedication to the sport because I wanted to be something in that that happened so it's like you just have to have that mentality of if I'm on a boat out if I'm in the Bahamas I'm gonna boat in my boat sinks and I'm out in the I'm 20 miles from land like if I don't get to land it's not because I failed I mean it's not cuz I quit it's cuz I failed right no so like that that mentality that's how I look at guys like that guys we just have no quit in them I feel like your eye is like favors like that yeah the Mike Brown fur like perfect example and and was still throwing elbows kicks trying to take him down doing anything could two broken hands Tony Ferguson Tony Perkins is a nano an animal like that he's the scariest guy 155 my in my word I agree in my world because he don't get tired it that cowboy fight freak me out he what cowboyed looked like Tony had bricks in his gloves yeah his face was all busted up Tony didn't look like you had a scratch on him and Tony wasn't even tired Tony posted a meme I feel like a couple days ago he showed like his last 7 yes they're all fucked up like they they're all fell off a train yeah yeah it's crazy man he has insane power man he it's like it's a weird thing because Tony does stuff to people and doesn't he doesn't get tired he doesn't get to eat like he's legit crazy yes like he does it like I don't know if he feels pain that kind of crazy you know I mean like he will do things in there that I remember when we fought I'm southpaw he's Orthodox right he throws that inside kick and I'm turning my leg over to check it and like it was never at my knee he was throwing that at my shin like if you're throwing that calf kick with that open stance you're throwing it at the Shannon right you know I mean so like I checked it and um I was like I was about to check and then we Bank shin to shin like the middle of the shin to the middle of his shin mm-hmm and I remember thinking myself why the fuck would you do that now with both her and like I seriously hated that feeling but he did like there was no reaction on his face there was nothing he was just like still on just on to the next thing and I feel like I'm glad I fought it men because I look at him now he's psychotic you know yeah look at 20 versus last seven opponents Jesus crows get all bloody masses even like his to what the things he posts like you get an insight to how crazy is mine did you see his post his press conference after um after um surgery after Anthony Pettis no yeah he was taught he's talking about he was gonna be a doctor he said we I think he said something like he said what did he say he said um he said oh you say you know what they call me cuz he's like yeah he's GQ guy he's talking about Anthony's like GQ guy but you know what they call me they call me the GQ Killa you know what that is it's an awesome nickname I would like to see what his conditioning workout is cuz Eddie goes with him up to Big Bear you know and he trains them and he says you never seen anything like it I said everybody else in camp can't keep up with them who works out he goes I've never seen anybody have this kind of dedication in gas-tank city works out a legitimate six hours a day he says he's running hills they do these hill sprints and he said he laps everybody he goes all the way to the top before they do goes down and then beats them on the way up I said it just doesn't get tired yeah I don't noticed it what does someone doing when they're their cardio is so much better than everybody else's because the cowboy fight I'm telling you man I watched him from the moment they stopped the fight after the second round I'm watching him and he goes back to his corner Cowboys face is a mess he's just beating the shit out of cowboy he goes back to his corner his stomach isn't even heaving yeah he's not breathing heavy I'm not gonna lie to you as I don't want to see this fight because I like both those guys but as a fight fan I want to see this fight and that's him and Dustin oh him and don't be insane cuz like that those are two guys who don't know how to quit well if Dustin beats could be that's the fight yeah and if Dustin doesn't beat could be Tony and khabib the fight yeah they'll fight eventually I'm sure yeah I mean that is a crazy-ass fight but the thing is like Tony's pace is so disturbing it's so disturbing because I watched him fight guys and I'm like how do you keep up with that nobody keeps up with it like you got to crack him you got to catch like Anthony caught him but he broke his hand but pedis had him hurt and he and Lando had him hurt Lando venado cracked I've never hurt yeah yeah yeah but like knows how to survive though yeah exactly and also it's weird because he doesn't survive like most people do he doesn't tie you up and try to get it try to recollect itself like he's just still fights yeah and he like he and stay like it scramble you hurt him he puts it on you he's like okay I need a break meaning I'm coming after you now hey you're gonna have to stop me from killing you so that I can really take a break yeah I've just I'm always stunned at his pace in his cardio it's it's me I really like I just want to know is this scientifically planned like are they monitoring his heart rate or is this just psychotic I guess it's scientific or is a psychotic I think it's the latter I think it might be I think I do like Tony first if if there's a scary movie Tony Ferguson would be that guy he's out Kukui yeah he's the boogie man they need they meet the heat they need to make a movie out like somebody needs to do some kind of like I don't know mashup of his fight huh that make him seem like like the Jason the guy that just never goes away and as soon as you turn around he's ready to kill you well you just think about Luke Thomas posted some tweet where the last time Tony Ferguson won like who was champion and what was going on the world's like 2013 is the last time he lost and he lost to Michael Johnson yeah also be Dustin yeah yeah those Dustin's last loss as well that much more recent though yeah much more recent I was dosed here in LA was it the forum was it yeah um but that fight also where Dustin's concern now like he we propped up Tony so I gotta get Dustin some props because like that's the thing about about mixed martial arts first of all there's not a lot of guys who who have some successes successes then they get stopped then success is success in they get stopped and success is success then they get stopped and then since that like but every time he got stopped or every time he lost he he made adjustments made improvements and got better sure and that was that was the last one and then he had the debacle with Eddie where the disqualification the the knock on him going into that was you know when he hurts somebody he doesn't necessarily know how to finish he gets too aggressive you know he goes crazy that fight then he got sketchy where it's like if you hurt him and you go crazy you're putting yourself at risk so that was the perfect fight to demonstrate that he learned the lesson mm and he did you know you know so like I don't know where I don't know really what the knock on him is now I remember this is something that um I didn't want to say this to him because he doesn't watch a lot of his opponents and their their their press stuff but I remember a long time ago DC had had khabib on the Fox desk and he was talking to him he's asked him about opponents he was like what do you think of this guy what do you think of this guy and he said just give me one word answers and he said Dustin Poirier and he goes easy fight whoa and um I I'm like yeah I don't I don't want to see this fight now I want everything's done after the hallway fight though that was an eye-opener for a lot of folks yeah but Holloway fought dust in the way Holloway would the way Dustin would look the best he stood in front of him Holloway doesn't have the same knockout power that Dustin has Dustin has like real legit one punch power max beats you up he just beats puts a pace on you beats your ass and takes you takes you out but also I don't think max has the same kind of power at 155 he just had 145 he's just so much bigger than everybody and 155 he's their size and Dustin's a big 55 er yeah i dustin is a big 55 I know I can't say I agree about the power only because dust yeah Dustin's been knocked out but he does have a chin you know he can take a shot no but I'm not just saying Dino I know you know did you know this has never knocked anybody out with one shot he beats guys up yeah takes him apart yeah no you're right you're right Dustin's capable of flat line yeah yeah he can flat line people with one shot yeah you don't really see that that much with max max it's he just he shot super sharp super-high fide IQ and just makes you fight wars with them but he was fighting a war with a guy who had higher caliber weapons that's what it seemed like in that fight and Dustin just fought real smart great boxing and capitalize on these openings and really stung Matt and Max in a way that we haven't seen before and good footwork too if you remember max was max was using his footwork early in that fight but everywhere he went Dustin was there too mmm you know yeah and it's there are sometimes it's not not it made me not even a conscious decision where it's like well it doesn't matter like wherever I go he's gonna be there anyway so then this is what we're doing right you know I'm not just gonna keep running around now you know so he might he might have made max decide to stay in front of him like he did towards this team was the second and third fourth the difference is with khabib obviously is the grappling that's cubes bread and butter he's so fucking terrifyingly good when he clenches you it's like you see these guys that you have this look on their face like what is this this is a new experience this is a different kind of grappling and he mobilizes people yeah like he gets you in positions that like you literally you can't go left you can't go right you know he's got that wrist wrap on the backside and a half guard on the front side so you can't turn turn to your right but you also can't turn to your left it's like and he straps you down man like that like howdy like that's what I hope Dustin works on right now like just sealing off not allowing could be to get those under hooks on the ground not allowing could be to get around his body and just just get back to his feet if he gets taken down and I mean you we saw some of the we know that could be not the greatest striker you know we saw I like went to do some do some damage on the feet and I think the third or fourth round that he definitely showed where khabib if he has any vulnerability it's gonna be in the striking but he didn't really hurt him never hurt him once and the only person to ding him is Michael Michael Johnson dinged him once yeah but he recovered from that quickly and beat the shit out of Michael hey listen I also think Dustin is more of a predator like he's like I think I like when tis good on his feet he's boxing solid he hits hard but I think just Dustin's boxing IQ like if he hurts you especially now I think if he hurts you he's smarter about being able to finish on what the power that he carries he's more selective with his weapons mmm so like that that's definitely a big option if he if he can show that he could hurt khabib standing then he has a very good shot of stopping him there but what does that mean to stop could be like you know I mean like not is it possible I think but you know what I think you have to because like how do you beat that wrestling over 25 minutes right how do you keep him from taking you down over and over and over again just getting back up is not good enough yeah cuz he's gonna keep taking you down that's a real good point cuz he's been able to do that to every single person he's fought inside the Octagon I mean even when Connor stopped a little bit of it early on I mean it's just it was a matter of time yeah that's that's that's that whole Gregor thing man I want ya like I hope Gregor's watching this and he's like man I should do that I should do that cuz Yves Yves call him yeah is Eve in I mean it's dusted rather in Florida yeah he just he just so I was in Texas last week I went up to I drove down to to New Orleans to Lafayette Youngsville to UM to talk to him to record that podcast we train some he made me his I I'm like I'm like - I'm like an hour away and he's like alright you're running practice I'm like I'm fat I don't know what to do I haven't trained like weeks but I came in we did that and then um and then he was he was leaving for Florida like Friday so he's been there for about a week now almost a week now and the fight is what's the date the fight the fight is September 7th Abu Dhabi doctor you're not going to that nope so if if you do if you do fight companion I'd love to come in for that because if I could burn I'll have you in because dust because dust is my boy man find out if I'm even in town I might be on the road you're gonna be an AC very soon huh I was just there okay that's what she's there this past weekend okay oh yeah no I'm home if I if if I'm still home I'm as of right now I'm home but if I'm still home we have a fight companion you're in fella hi that would be fun I'm down to be there especially if I don't go to AA but I would love to be there for that but that's Abu Dhabi they'll be interesting to you you know him so well you know to get your insight on that he's the only he's only I reppin thug Jitsu right now I love like he's like I'm telling Bruce could make walk me down as a thug Jitsu fighter that's like he came up unto Tim crater who's that's right you know yeah crazy Tim crazy Tim I remember Tim from the John Jacques Machado days like way back in the day I saw I first saw crazy Tim I never got to train with him but he came down in like he started when Tim started trading with me I was coaching him we went to some fights in Boston I'm sitting next to the Commission and Tim's fighting this guy and he want he's working on a standard with me and they're trading and the guy takes him down and when the guy takes him down I look at the commissioner and I grabbed like all this stuff and I'm like well that's the end of that I start putting everything in the bucket like I don't know before I even got my head up like Tim tapped him and the Commissioner was like you call that one didn't you this shit that you just know yeah right especially at a certain level of fights there's some shit that you just know yeah that's one of the more interesting things about the high level fights in high level fighters is you don't know anymore no it's so like because now everybody everybody knows the same thing unless you have that checkmate card like Francis like no disrespect to jr. but I did not think that that fight was gonna get out of the first round I had a feeling it was gonna go that way yeah and that's why it said to all my friends I said if I had to bet my money anything could happen it's crazy sport but if I had my bet my money I bet the house on the big fella yeah because he just does shit to people yeah I I said with that guy man those those only takes one guys there they're scary mm-hmm Mike and jr. style it wasn't necessarily the style to to avoid encounter that right no I mean yeah like that that for me like the Jeremy Stephens fight was like that Jeremy Stephens those one he's that that that one punch kind of thing and you just have to you have to make sure that they miss and just pick your shots and he was fortunate that like I had hit I caught him running into something to Ryan I'm not I do have one punch power but I don't pack power like Dustin this you know I'm I would say my power is more if we're talking about the best today yeah more about precision more closer to like maxes in the sense of like I would pick you apart but like all the knockouts they came from like volume or catching you slipping you know I'm catching you coming in or something like that and um but like so I don't know who's that heavyweight who fights like that nobody you'd have to get a Rico Verhoeven you have to get someone who's like a world-class striker who Rico's had some MMA fights and he's you know he's still the glory heavyweight champion and he's also a big giant dude but then again man he's been fighting with those big gloves and you know he's been stopped before could he handle it I mean if he stands in front of Francis could he handle it yeah I don't I don't think any human handles yeah that you gotta get a guy like steep a that just knows how to get the fuck out of there I think I think Francis could knock out an elephant [Laughter] probably good I'm serious at least the baby elephant yeah a little elephant that's fucked up though yeah I don't think there's anybody he can't knock out which is really interesting if he decided to go to boxing he's one of those guys where you go if he really decided to go to boxing it's harder him aboah Deonte hit all right Deonte hit so goddamn hard it's hard to tell because he's Deonte has fought the cream of the crop in boxing and he's knocked out 39 dudes he's 40 and what is he like 40 and 140 and oh well how's he four do you know that the the the fight was a draw Flicka 40 oh and one yeah and 39 knockouts stiverne was the only one the first fight the where it went the distance and then he nuked them I fight yeah the first time they fought I went to I believe that's the case is that who did who was he who did he have a decision with does it say there and is looking at Wikipedia that some he hits harder than anybody I've ever seen in the heavyweight division in this modern era outside of Tyson I feel like I should call him CTE like for real remember they did that study of NFL bodies and they did like a hundred eleven bodies and 110 of them had CTE yeah 39 out of 40 yeah he's given people some real problems yes areas remain stubborn yes fight against him stubborn was the only one who went to distance everybody else gets nuked and he hits guys they just go flying you know like the fact that Tyson Fury got up after that 12th round like Jesus Christ yeah that that was that was crazy yeah I was like gypsy King stuff crazy yeah voodoo look you had like a extra chicken bone and his fucking shorts because you see like like I don't know for me I watch I noticed those things like when we were watching that thing with sage and Cosmo right when sage went down um and then after Cosmo hit him like his body I didn't give up like his they got shut off on him but like he was trying to get up yeah like he was getting up to fight back um cuz if you if you're not getting up the fight like you're covering up right but he's trying to get up um the same thing where we're Tyson Fury goes down the referees in his face and he's counting him out and you see his head you see his head go right I need just gets up just like you it like like it was over I thought it was over I did too I was watching it at home I was celebrating yeah I was like I want a mix of money I was watching at home and my thought was god damn he knocked a mountain at 12th round how the fuck does that guy carry that power liked out of the 12th fret and boy Tyson's back up and then he wins the rest of the round that was even crazy Deonte bombs on them he hears him with some hard shots and then Tyson comes back dings him you know and you see he catches him yeah he did he wobbled him for it yeah I'm like this is unbelievable what a fight without that that was probably the best heavyweight boxing fight I've seen I can't look at this he said Tyson Fury says put it this way he hits four times harder than Vitali Klitschko he hits five times harder than Vladimir Klitschko he hit six times harder than Anthony Joshua and he hits eight times harder than Tyson Fury well who said that oh okay he's a sparring partner for him oh I thought that was Tyson Fury's coat that yeah well that's probably accurate it says the is Deontay Wilder a stronger puncher than a prime George Foreman the thing about Deonte is he knocks everyone out and he's not winning any decisions except one I mean there's nobody like that you even go back to Tyson Tyson when he fought I mean he fought a lot of dudes that went the decision and he beat their asses but they went to decision I honestly I wouldn't mind um Tyson getting into his camp and just even just kind of mentoring him a bit like Mike Tyson um I feel like somebody like that would really help a guy like I mean it's not like he needs a lot of help right but like somebody like Mike Tyson being being up being around just having him to like call on talk to you sometimes Tyson doesn't really want to have anything to do with boxing anymore though it seems and and maybe maybe not even in the gym maybe just somebody to talk to once in a while he's promoting some strategy maybe even about strategy sometimes you know because I feel I don't know that I forget exactly what it was but there was a moment when I was watching Deontay Wilder and then there was something I think when Mike was in here something he was talking about I know I was just like and those two should get connected mmm this is interesting I was I was a long time ago I was living in Texas well I got a phone call it like like 2:00 a.m. I might was mono my buddy's my buddy Leno ting and I was um I don't answer that man I'm trying on bed and my wife I'm sleeping these calls and then next morning I listen my voicemail and he's like Eve Eve if you get this call me back I'm like you got a club he said somebody wants to talk to you and he has it phones like Eve had what if it was I was so pissed god I was like man I missed the phone call from Mike Tyson he ran a name in the club or something I was like Mike Tyson knows my name dude I met him at the the UFC and he's like you lad we got he was in the weed back then but it was like that's what he goes I like you man funny like thank you so glad you like me and I'm having him in here was so surreal because when I was a kid he was the fucking man yeah I mean he was the you would go to put you pay to see his fights just to watch him fuck somebody up it wasn't a fight it was an execution you would watch him execute guys he was the man he was mad he changed heavyweight boxing people don't realize that heavyweight boxing in the early 80s was dead nobody cared because Larry Holmes after he beat Muhammad Ali everybody was sad it was like a sad thing like there's the changing of the guard Larry Holmes beat the shit out of Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes never got his due he never got his due he was so good man yeah Larry was so good he had one of the best jabs of all time he was so good but people were still upset at him because he fucked up Muhammad Ali he came he was the champ after the greatest you know and act Muhammad Ali wasn't just the greatest as to in terms of like the greatest fighter he was a culver city icon yeah he meant something to people it was something I mean everyone knew the guy was out for three years because he protested the Vietnam War everybody fucking hated the Vietnam War especially people who went to Vietnam hate the Vietnam War and they you know they got it man and he just he meant a lot he meant a lot so when Larry Holmes came around it's like man Larry's never got his due never do that on that era of boxing I remember going back watching tape and doing that and that's one thing I appreciate about Tyson you know yeah he he was a student yeah thank God he knew Jim Jacobs who have that crazy library that he could get all that Jacobs was the guy who curated like he has every old-time fight all of he would watch Sugar Ray Robinson and Jack Dempsey and he's watching like Willie Papp and he's not only watching like the heavyweights yeah he watched it every oh yeah hairy crab he watched all those guys all his old-school all in weird obscure fighters you know and I said most people don't remember anymore yeah that that that era of boxing was very different sandy Sadler and you know all those guys who watch all those guys yeah that era boxing before him was terrible's like he had champs like Pinklon Thomas and Tony Tubbs no one cared about the heavyweight division and then he came along and just started blasting people and you know like finally I remember I was I was like seven or eight years old I met Trevor Berbick he was down in the Bahamas first and that's that's what Tyson took his belt for yep got his first both 20 years old yeah crazy like 20 20 now you're the heavyweight champion and then so that was the thing talking to him about it like what was that like and it's just there's no way he could manage no-one can manage that you're gonna go crazy I feel like his career and his life would have been very different if cus didn't die when he did I think so too yeah I think so too it's a critic tragic story but it's also like there's so many lessons in that story it's like for all of us it's like there's a lot to learn you know what happened when it got all the way to Buster Douglas when it was like he thought felt like he can't lose and he was in this rare state yeah yeah like his life like he's he's had so many ups and downs and you know as as the heavy Reacher I'd like to be somebody that's the heavyweight champion well somebody with so many eyes on them you know the Robin Givens all that hope you got holes in his life you know I remember they were I forget whose was the Oprah when they were being interviewed and I'm they were they were on the show and he just he just look like I feel like Mike Tyson and that interview was like those Tigers that people walk with that they drug yes you know what I mean yeah perfect perfect way to describe it man they probably medicated him yeah because he did he do not look he just didn't seem like the Mike Tyson who I was a fan of right like I didn't dislike him in that moment I just like what's wrong meanwhile what who the fuck mean it had to be her idea if I was his friend why would you get why you gotta talk to Barbara Streisand yeah that's what wall times whoever it was get the fuck out of here the same thing Barbra Streisand Barbara thank you turning some old lady you're the fucking heavyweight champ of the world kid out of here with that talk no no no no no no this is nonsense and you gonna bring your wife what what are you doing what benefit is there yeah as deaf as well I can't say definitely but mice is my assumption is it was Robin give ask you later him yeah she emasculated him in front of the world and you know and I think afterwards he realized what happened he was furious yeah but it's like that life is unmanageable his the life that he lived back then was unmanageable he was the fucking king of the world he was in his 20s he was buck wild just going crazy flatlining people everywhere he went people throw rose petals at his feet and screaming cheering fans it's unmanageable yeah young imagine Meena poor adopted black kid with no love in your life I was 13 until yeah and tell your 13 and then you come into all this money because you're the best fighter in the world like there's what could he possibly be afraid of them - nothing Hey Pet Tigers bro wrestle with them I mean that was the crazy thing to him talking about what he found out that he could get a tiger yeah why I could get a tiger but he's so humble now it's so interesting and one of the more interesting things that he said that he doesn't train because he doesn't wanna it doesn't want to fire his ego up you know he's like I don't like that part of me I don't want that part of me to come out again I don't it wasn't that video of him like I understand he doesn't training wasn't that video I think last year just before he came in here and spoke to you where he's hitting a heavy bag I think it was a little bit longer than that but yeah he was doing it for something he still can crack mad yeah still scared how is the last thing you'll see that see he's doing a movie and there's a scene in a bar they're doing something and he just shows them a combination he just punches in the air no warm-up lightning-fast jab hook uppercut right hand it's like hikes it's all still there and 50 years old still fuck you up and that was that was like he was the heavyweight champion of my childhood yes to Muhammad Ali came before I you know but but again Larry Holmes just doesn't get the credit it's like for whatever reason it's just like in the first round when when Tyson fought Larry Holmes it made me think like damn what would have been like if Larry was in his fucking prime because when they fought Larry was like 36 or something like that somewhere around there it was already kind of over for him you know and Mike was Mike I mean Mike was black shoes no socks there it is right here see then the weave yeah I mean he just can't help I mean that was like built into his system you know he was he was such an interesting guy too because he was only like five he's probably like 510 511 I think it's like five ten and a half something like that but to be a heavyweight and just solo and bobbing and weaving and moving in and everybody was like Jesus yeah you see it heads right in your chest he's ripping your body and then uppercut that right hook to the body that uppercut behind it that he used on everybody use it on Frank Bruno use it on everybody boom right up the middle it's hard to him what Francis Francis really Francis it's harder yeah he it's harder I think so I think I think Mike Tyson it was a way better boxer yeah but I think if Mike Tyson can hit like Francis does just Francis just has to clip you he just like what would he did a junior he just raised them obviously they're different gloves obviously I just think Francis is such a way bigger man you know my kid his prime was like 209 to 15 around them I remember on punch-out I never beat him well you know Deonte when he fought Tyson Fury only told me only weighed 209 that's what he weighed he's how tall is he yeah he's like six six at least yeah it's crazy but I still I mean I wouldn't want it I want to see Deontay Wilder punched that that thing that the UFC has though I have one of those out here does uh what is it again the the punch o meter the punch o meter that's how I found that thing I was looking for someone talking about his punching power somewhere if there's any gauge of it well thing is I would never let him punch it if I was his trainer but what if you break your hand you know like what if you fuck yourself up trying to just hit something as hard as you can I mean he's the goose that lays the billion-dollar egg yeah Deonte if he keeps going right like where he's at right now he has become the motherfucking man you know especially with that last fight with Dominic Brazil yeah he sent him into orbit after the Tyson Fury fight you realizing like okay this guy is the fucking man right you want to see him fight Andy Ruiz you want to see him fight Tyson Fury again you want to see him fight Joshua if Joshua comes back he's worth so much money now yeah I'd like don't be punching things so I guess on that it's the Fox thing where they test punching but I think it's Fox mm-hmm it tested punching power and they actually do have wilder on this and I guess Andy Ruiz recently just broke it really yeah oh but see what and Ruiz can fuck you he's got food and what's he got something Plus and I think Wilders was at 9:27 okay but I'm telling you I don't mean shit it's it's a matter of how you punch it it just slams up in there is he trying to get a development deal sponsorship with the Snickers that's hilarious love anyways he's coming here we got him we got him for the end of the month I'm fucked I'm very excited man that fight was crazy yeah Anthony Joshua like come see that punching power record that shit ain't real you gotta hit that thing like I have out there what you really can tell even that you gotta hit perfectly to kind of go you have a different thing I have the one that Frances hit oh the UFC Performance Institute has where Frances broke the record for the hardest punch yeah yeah how many lightweights have yet hit that none the only important it bhai Frances is uh Joe shilling and you yeah yeah it's three o'clock let's wrap this up so one more time PFL is next the 11th Thursday the 11th Thursday the 11th
