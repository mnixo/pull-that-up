the girag and experience hey like we described Brennen shop Oh the lips cookies haha I described his big brown that's yummy him got on it on Twitter try to get his name I'm trying to get his nickname change from hybrid to big brand new this guy starts with big brother big brown he's big brown he's just big and brown that's why everybody calls him big brown back it's weird when you see someone come home your stepdad Gus it's got a black eye huh like if I was Brendan Schaub but be like for sure keep your hands up next time for sure don't let him get that close to you bro I shit yourself why they're gonna fight when I was 12 I'm not making this up with whatever fucking cars right my dad pulls in front of him he pulls it from my dad he gets out my dad goes you wanna fucking go my dad's like oh no like an old-school Irish like sir oh no I even remember being like 10 or 11 me like ah fuck man see the problem with that is Nick Diaz can actually fight like that oh my dad beers garrix off this dude it is on it was about to throw him off the side of the highway I don't leather jack oh no I did not fuck around when a guy stands out like that so that's doing the old-school boxing one of two things can happen he's trying to scare you off or he's so good with his hands yeah you just kind of roll out you like what's up dude you want some back yeah yeah what you do now is weird yeah situation I'll tell you why for reals man I met my daddy on the car like god dammit and then my brother gets out kicks guy in the balls from behind but I was probably 12 at the time Jesus Christ you not brother kicked a grown man and girl man in the balls but that's when it gets really dangerous when that kid gets involved I don't know the father becomes like super violent know what Little Brown was doing what was a little crying in the backseat how old were you probably 10 or 11 crying in the backseat ah can't be trusted if she goes down nine cuz you got to remember my daycare was Shane Carwin on taught me all right I wasn't getting a lot of takedowns I was on my back all the time that's a crazy way to start your training in MMA it was horrible poor soak what is it like every day just beat me up that Trevor Whitman seems like a crazy dude man he's a good dude I mean I'm like a very good dude good guy been there in years but a maniac like he had Shane Carwin um like what they wanted to have Shane Carwin sport spar with GSP and GSP was like what yeah why would I what yeah why would I spar him like what are you talking about you and I think that like Trevor's a genius we come to straighten stuff like that but I think back on it and there's this thing where I felt like I had to prove to everyone I could hang with Shane Carwin no matter when we were sparring that's how my footwork got so good cuz I'm I'm used to this giant water buffalo mad water buffalo chasing me around the Octagon so I was trying to get out the way cuz he landed right hand it was a short him he was not good man his trouble he hit so hard he's got so so I got used to that right I'm moving non-stop and then when the bell go ding ding with 30 seconds left literally no matter what we're doing mean Shane would stop walk to the middle of the cage and just does it Rock'em Sock'em robots yeah Dan I did that for three years and then finally a part of me was like uh how about no and I shot a double back on him and we've never done that again yeah that's I'm tired but I think back on my training I'm like god that was stupid even taking him down I mean he's so strong he's a big guys guy Evert is a big fucking guy man strong a lot stronger than you and you're strong Shane is 100% stronger than me not even close he's ridiculously strong bones his bone structure is just he's bigger than Carter he's bigger than Lesnar his legs are thick thick ass huge shoulders his hands man went before they did they redid the UFC glove to fit over his hand Shane Shane's the reason why they changed the club Shane had a five XL glow I had to cut the glove just to get over to his hands are so ridiculous yeah when you shake him it's like holding on to a ham so what was frustrating to me is you know I've always been in love with Jiu Jitsu I would spend Shane would get injured or he'd have to work at a regular job I'll just train full-time and I think I was being so good at Jiu Jitsu then Shane would come in off a nine to five you know shift walk-in by jujitsu huh let's do it I'm like I'm gonna roll this big dude you just shut shut it all down when I was training at amals he came by and trained one day and I didn't get to roll with him but I watched people roll with him and it was it was like a child yeah playing with bear daddy bear with a dislike never dad he's just like rolling over and I go with the guys I ever be guys all the time but none like Shane well he doesn't even look real when he walked in the door if I didn't know I was like what's up Shane liked it but if I didn't know him I would be like a nappy look at this motherfucker dude my god he's got legs growing out of his shoulders this is how it happened I was like oh I want to be a fighter I knew Nate Marquardt I looked him up online found out where his Academy was in a roar in my hometown I show up there Nate's a great guy rise again man what we can do we can do this we'll figure it out come tomorrow there's another big guy he just he only has like one fight he just started fighting and he played football to like go cool I show up it's sparring right I show up and in walks Shankar at the time is 315 pounds fighting the WC just jacked look like a silverback gorilla that just found the weight room and does nothing else just remember I want to he's really that big there's a picture of him that doesn't even look read it's insane and Makos Nate goes oh hey here's the guy won the issue dude introduced you to and since then mean Shane sparred and just stood toe-to-toe neither once knew what we were doing blast each other yeah you rolled with God I mean you had the biggest in the baddest as a training partner forever the best man well he was one of our brother well I couldn't afford private training with Trevor Whitman and Shane believed in me so much he paid for my training with Trevor fuck I like Shane having a guy like you around and valuable you know you're trying to find a giant pictures ain't him in or me Emilia I think one or two fights a time at zero let Machida fight he was it was close fight that was a close fight I thought Machida won what do you think was about was just Rumble just - he's a monster it's just too much my mom's a monster and rumbles a scary guy yeah you should you'll be like yup Arlovski - heavyweight got it so crazy I almost stopped him in the first round broke his jaw in half in the first round like Arlovski fought the last two rounds with a jaw that was shifting up and down because it was shattered in the side nobody's fighting Orlowski I'm just got some good stories when we talk about how guys are hyping fights mm-hmm it came back funny like yeah you with the Mitrione fight me and Matt uh you know we're buddies where we can both talk a little smack so it was good to hype the fight talking smack right it was great when you fight legends like Marc crow cop Andrei Arlovski Big Nog with our loss keep fans or hit me up on Twitter like oh we're I can't wait to see what your smack talk is there's no smack talk I don't need to talk smack to Andrei Arlovski to hype this fight he's a legend you're not gonna win any fans over what are you gonna say are you gonna say oh man you fought the very best fighters in the world you're a heavyweight champ you know I mean what are you gonna do at it you got to be super respectful yeah man otherwise they fucking attack like wolves like Woodhams it did you fuck the fight sells itself but tell them tellin story about how how you right you were training with arlovski uh after after training where he's he goes come here yeah yeah so uh Andrei Arlovski and I used to train together Jackson's camp and I was getting ready for a fight this over Shu almost four years ago the two fighters that I when I first got in the game that I admired and loved were Mirko Cro Cop and Andrei Arlovski by two very favorites that's who I wanted to be like so I walked in the gym and it was our Las keys first day at Jackson's too and you know when you see a guy in TV fighting all the time then he run into me like damn all right so I see him like oh shit that's Andrei Arlovski so then that guy shop or last year in the ring first day spine right fresh off the plane I'm sparring with them so me and him are going and it's it's a closed round he's a badass right here we're going back and forth people would literally stop and watch a spar were just these dog grounds back and forth five rounds in a row then later that night we grapple and then the next morning I drink coffee every morning right drink coffee about this horrible coffee breath breath smelt like pure coffee shit breath right I go up to Andre and he's not very warm person at all not at all is that very Belarus Russian where it's gonna take a while to be his friend I can tell I'm trying to break these barriers man I go hey bro ah I just won't let you know man I got that coffee breath and yet he didn't say a word to me the night before training us it's okay it's okay much better than yesterday yesterday shit I go what because yesterday breath smelled like shit I oh cool man cool and then just went about our business that was really the only words he ever said to me man we trained together for a while I wasn't even like from what about when you were kicking when you had to kick his body yeah and then we get done train I've never done this he goes up I'm trying to do my best Russian accent you guys are pretty my terrible rush knife horrible right okay sorry I'm not from Russia bring zone the body goes up heels put your hands on top of your head like this I'm like what are we doing and we just got done sparring I'm exhausted right I put my hands up and he just goes brace yourself and starts wailing at my body what with kicks punches wailing is this this make you tough my okay I'm like wow I'm trying to be tough though cuz he's my hero Mike okay Wow Wow and then he goes my turn you do it to me and I'm like dunya snow you hit like girl hit and I'm fucking trying man trying to hurt this guy nothing that was my experience with Andrei Arlovski in the day so a lot of that there's no
