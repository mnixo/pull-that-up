I rarely watch the event live hello skanks what's up Oh live this is sort of hell yeah we recorded could see boys something's happening things got strange some that said we're live everyone oh man we were having a great now people are listening to what I did Mike Tyson weed we really were just having the most natural conversation every was going back and forth night yeah Mike Tyson we were talking when you went to the bathroom Mike Tyson says he smokes $40,000 you know we also sells weed so he just charges himself a lot of money forty thousand dollars worth of weed he may be like his whole crew if this ain't about himself there's no way a month yeah just 40,000 I want to see what it looks like in a room oh yeah man it would be a pile that you could fall into and thinkin that but you could be like beanbag chair and you can fly with confidence oh yeah so how much is I'm you're getting in bulk so it's gonna be probably like a hundred dollars it's getting worse and even less than that but you're gonna spend 40 grand they'll give you more than 40 grands worth do you I mean used to be like here we smoked 10 tons of weed at the ranch a month oh my god this is britain said eben is that is a saison even Evan Evan Britain so 10 tons of weed is $40,000 that doesn't seem right doesn't none of that seems 20,000 pounds of weed that's impossible he obviously could have easily been joking and laughing why said this to we're reading it in print yeah he's like do we smoke 10 tons a month yeah this is what I'm saying this sounds like something I would say more than you could ever possibly imagine I'm gonna throw out a wild number 40 million now 48 million burgers 40,000 there's someone she made them some journalists should do like do just make an image of this is what 40,000 dollars where the weed looks like yeah it's gonna be more than with even Mike Tyson and his crew can smoke wouldn't fill this whole room I think it would be like shipping crates is a grab is it even possible to smoke 40,000 dollars a weed a month 980 not that much but with a crew and I know I think about it if you do two grand blunts that's two blunts per eighth essentially a little bit less this guy's got a broken down baby this guy really could just tell you how much it is in bulk he's giving you the 908 seems a little bit lazy to even write 1,800 blunts between Mike Tyson's crew is not actually that much for a month it's not that much now when I'm looking at how this guy's saying it he's saying it's basically for blunts per hour that's totally possible if you got a large number of people with you I will never question Mike Tyson again ever this is it about 10 tons I think we're being silly I think they were joking around I bet a lot of it they give away too you know they might go through a personal stash of that much weed I don't know he has a ranch all right Tyson's in the weed game son all-in dude he was one of the most fascinating guys at interview because I couldn't believe I was really talking to him yeah so I can't believe that's really Mike Tyson like there's some people like you talking to my god that's really Mike Tyson doesn't make sense what he's been through in his life yet now he's here somehow knowing him as a kid when he was the fucking man and you'd see him on the cover of these magazines like Kid Dynamite when he's 19 years old on Sports Illustrated and just smashing everyone in front of him and then all sudden he's hanging with you yeah it's very strange it's also just as a fall from grace and then a resurgence and still weird resurgence to like nobody ever saw him becoming like you know cartoon character and like a fucking Broadway actor in a one-man show and now a weed rancher that's bananas who saw that nobody said that was gonna be Mike Tyson's trajectory yeah detect the trajectory of when I found out who he was when I was a kid and started getting it was BOTS like very shortly after you saw what a monster he was was that Robin Givens interview where he just sat there like a doofus yeah well she was like eh beats up me and rapes my mom and he's like just knowing like when these cameras go off oh boy wasn't there some talk about them medicating him wasn't that part of what was happening like the momma forgiven to date him maybe I just remember him talking about sorry yeah in the documentary and he was just like he said he was just so he couldn't believe she was saying it so he was just like silent but if you watch it it seems like he's furious and just trying to not say something angry key to Mike Tyson is that he always seemed like he was furious yeah oh and he even talked about it once it goes I'm just mad I'm mad at my dog no matter everything and that's when he was at the top of the heap but for how he's like this peaceful friendly God he had to overcompensate for all that that's what he needs forty thousand Gerald it was all therapy right he had to be in he had like 20 therapists he beat up the first seven of them I mean to be a great fighter you have to be able to look at yourself you have to be able to look at your skills you still doesn't mean you still can't make horrific mistakes but you have to be able to look at yourself it's only get any better the best fighters have an understand even if they have ego problems they still have a pretty good understanding of who they are and that's that can benefit you if you use it today I'm sure he probably went through therapy but he didn't necessarily he could probably have figured it out on his own just cuz he's a smart guy he's a smart guy they grew up in a horrible horrible way where the first love he had was an old boxing trainer that turned him into a murderer and that was the first love that guy experienced his life was horrible man and from him being adopted by custom ATO when he was a little kid and having extreme physical gifts as well it was this perfect storm they said when he was 13 he weighed a hundred and ninety pounds Teddy Atlas used to bring him to boxing the smoker events and they were like yeah he's fucking 13 and they put him in with a 16 year old cuz nobody want to believe that a 13 year old could be jacked like that well g1j with when J 3rd was 13 years old he we like 220 it's truly different was it different built come on fuckers out goddamn tank yeah that's not a 13 year old you want to fight also fun fact he is the reason Mike Tyson solely is the reason why now if you're on TV for even 5 minutes they starts caring about your tattoos being covered or can you get a release for them all because when he came on a was it hangover movie the company that did were the tattoo artists that did its face tattoo sued for like I think one for like millions of dollars that's so possible for doing the use that purchase artwork without then once you put a tattoo once nobody is your know hard yeah you claim part ownership of that yes and it makes tattoo so much gayer this is when I became I guess partners in life with a guy in Montreal who spoke French how many tattoos do we have in common we have the same yes have a bunch of 22 3 thrill yeah we have the Dave's what would it what do you guys have you guys get what's happening here there's a lot of people that can't hear this so what are these things this is a notes half hearts and it says Dave and Smith yeah so you are on their arm yeah to make you uncomfortable I did not consent he's too much of a pussy to get a tattoo so he's did a form very cute he's very Jewish that's real love man you guys have to stay friends for life now I know I was gonna be out the door man this tattoo no girls want to get married guys do that bro you bro I'm fuckin bro I do mine hey you could have as many guys tattooed on you okay I'm not jealous but I want my fucking name on your leg bro there was a world star there's a world star video yesterday of a guy catching a girl cheating in a hotel and the other guys like naked in the hallway and she's looking her underwear and the guys just screaming at her there's a guy there and she just fucking keeps going and he's like I got my fucking your name tattooed on me again she's doing all that I'm sorry calm down so I can when she just decides that she doesn't give a shit anymore she was well no one told you to get my name tattooed on you now you'll see a fucking ass anything for a girl like a tattoo yeah you know so I have three Chinese characters here this is back when I was young enough when a tattoo shop was able to convince you which I think they still do the people that Chinese characters can say or spell anything which is just not true well like what's supposed to be letters so I got when I believed Chinese characters was CMS they're still there they're just blended into something else but it was cherylin maurice leader was a was the name of my girlfriend what's a terrible name yeah yeah Cheryl's leader she sounds like she's got shit teeth infamous now good teeth Cheryl Slayers fucking teeth pointing in every which direct hot chick actually but uh just I mean coming from like a real pack of dummies like real stupid and so stupid in fact was she that I got those tattooed on me thank God in Chinese characters CMS her mom didn't like me and I came I couldn't wait to tell her mom that I got this tattoo I go look what I got for your daughter and she's like what is that a CMS and she goes what's that I go your daughter's initials cherylin Marie sweet her and she goes uh her mom could she was so happy to go that's not your name my girlfriend was so dumb she didn't know her name is not in fact she just made up the Murray part her name is Cheryl Lynn Sleater and it was s so I got a wrong tattoo from and she was a perfect she was with me while I got it and didn't know her own middle name set there confidently like make sure you get the M good yeah tattoo is wild large patches of America okay yeah this that is that tattoo let that tattoo like that that's that fucked up yeah bodies so many lives oh yeah many people something people have made horrendous choices you know I had a my first tattoo it just said Lou dog I gotta cover now the Ludo Lu do GG nobody has ever called me Lou dog okay for afterwards sarcastically to make fun of me like all right Lou dog was there but you were so psyched to go tell your friends hey guys you're calling me Lou dog well it was because I only had $70 and I was like alright dude I have $70 it was I'm 18 I just turned 18 oh so getting the fucking tattoo and I was a guy I'm gonna do it oh go matter what but I got to get like a little design underneath it underneath it it was it was tribal like me almost it won't look like like antlers like tribal antlers but it was because I was poor something you would like scribble on a binder while your boarding class dude it was like there's a tramp stamp it was like a tiny tramp stamp underneath Lou dog you underaged no I was 18 I was under a that's why mine is the word Jay in Old English and it is so high up here just so my mom wouldn't see it immediately we were both fat kids and I had a big fat arm so this little tiny shit my big fat arm and your Jay is so tiny it's so sorry is it still there yeah all that it's bad it's bad yeah it's that yeah and then more Chinese stuff here and then a Pam Anderson barbed wire around my arm but I've just accepted eyes all my tattoos have some shitty dumb stories high school my friend Jimmy was the first one to get tattooed he got this really shitty like Tiger on his arm with his name in case he forgets his name you know I think we're like 18 at a time maybe 17 and he came home and he had like a little band-aid peeking out underneath his shirt Bob started screaming at him and if I'm not I'm fucking this story I hope I'm not but like her I remember thinking that like wow he was the first like everyone's got to get a tattoo eventually like the idea that someone's gonna draw on you permanent Oh forever you got a key like it's a ballsy funny it never really hit me like that Harbor that I I know it's true by the way I wish you know talking about having a time machine if you can go back and just tell your teenage self like just wait till even like you're late 20 you're gonna have a lot of good years with awesome tattoos yeah we're gonna make this decision now and have the rest of your life with some pretty shitty you know money when you're 18 you know there's no money for good tattoos you're probably from some let you live absolutely I have $20 tattoos on me for sure I was if I was offended by the drawing cuz I'm an artist and I was looking I was like this is so bad the guy just I mean the guy was not an artist at all whoever did the tattoo he's fucking just a guy I've got a job doing tattoo who learned how to use the gun exactly that's it yeah on my leg I have a dragon like a another tribal dragon there was 19 and 4 toe in Miami like it we went like on a boardwalk tattoo shop with like Chinese people in the front like don't ever get tight never gonna tell unless you're in China and they're using the old like taffy technique yeah they fucking do that don't go to like a shit bodega tattoo shop because that's what I got it it's all blended together now the guys had no idea it's painful oh shit they don't know what they're doing the other problem with it is it's really painful they go too deeply pull it out well that's another thing about henna ladies if you or guys are in the henna tattoos if you get those Hana tattoos I can Thailand or something like that sometimes it's not really henna it's hair dye then the hair dye can be poisonous to your skin it's not good stone you didn't even die getting a real tattoo well you can die but I think it fucks you up I'm kidding painted on with hair dies out what I think there was like a warning about this that I've read well they're saying don't don't get Han out from places that aren't using real henna because they use cheap hair dye they gonna just stop that don't get henna yeah you can that's a weird one right so I can want to tattoo but not really yeah it looks like it looks like a spray-on tans wearing off yes it just looks disgusting PPD is can in it whatever black can often contains PPD at high levels and when it applied to skin can cause chemical burns and allergic reactions and I don't know what PPD is I'm trying to find that chemical burns yeah you got to be careful out there kids don't use on you Joe Rogan says steer clear of drill holes in your skin and pump some ink in there it's apparently there had to be like some errors made when they were coming up with like tight like the first tattoos people body which is the first tattoos were like an Africa carving shit into your arm or something yeah yeah when sometimes a great tattoo artist I'm always blown it's the most sloppy uncomfortable with the fact that I couldn't do anything near that with like a pencil and art supplies and a set yeah you know flat surface like ones meant to have to do that it's great when someone's amazing at it it makes no sense no it doesn't because they always also they're still just going like just scribbling basically it looks like and then they swipe it away and look like I'm mad at you I found the craziest fucking page Jamie I'm gonna send it to you this is a lady and she does paint on people's face that makes it look like to have extra eyeballs and the the paint is so accurate you're looking at a video of it and you're like what the fuck am I looking at I have this always at the asian chick because she makes herself different doesn't that chick is fucking talented which he does with makeup and she got in trouble cuz she did blackface but she does every Asian do blackface she made herself like an african nubian princess it was the most amazing thing in the world is this her I'm gonna be a princess me me joy this is the shit she does whoa look at that dude that's insane yeah your head she's got eyeballs drawn awesome Joe Rogan's perfectly well yeah I was like a tool video yeah she's a fractal that is something you would see if you were on some serious drugs and this is the kind of shit you got to pretend to enjoy if you want to fuck a hot asian chick her I'm super into me dance look at that oh this is a different chick than I was thinking of but yeah this is a category it's cool it's crazy if you go scroll down and look at some of the eyeball ones where the extra eyeballs or below her face the cops use this price that's the it's a fucking freak out it's a fuckin freak out yeah yeah that's so weird yeah it's wild it's that same sort of level of tattoo art that the really high level tattoo guys have you seen that guy Steve butcher I've showed you that guy before right in fact I walked to doing room I would think that it's a monster and I would kill it yeah you like what the fuck that's you terrifying someone drugged you yeah yeah you would say oh my god Satan is real around arrogant thinking that Satan's not real yeah this is Steve butcher Steve butcher does insane shit man he did one of me somebody got me tattooed on their leg and it's fucking incredible about that Joe so weird don't have that don't do that just stop stop I got Legion of skanks tattooed on his face and like you look at you go that's awesome that you want to do that but man maybe you shouldn't no he's he has a bunch of other face tattoos though it wasn't the first ones true holy that Kobe Bryant scroll up a bit look at that Kobe Bryant t-shirt his mouth get the fuck out of here man that might as well be a photograph that's crazy like look at the resolution look at the sweat if you said to me what's the one thing you can't draw I'd say black people sweat if I was wrong I would just have white drips Dennis feeling like bukkake make that bigger jammy like I did that with needles man that's insane how good that is yes I'm how it doesn't seem nearly as weird to get athlete's tattooed on you as it does comedians no it does for now it's still we show you them I'm sure Kobe's running around going damn dude different people grow up on like I mean that's not true dude because they the connection that people feel with like comics and podcasts it's pretty I got it you know it's like we don't want the responsibility we want to do it but we don't want the response because I don't the responsibility of being your shin i 100% want my fucking face tattooed on people so anybody out there I I'll give you a free lijiang t-shirt it's a good tattoo it loves it says Luda yeah that is crazy it's so that is as accurate as a photograph of my fucking face that's my face that's fucking intense is it mate oh yeah I don't remember what that's from I was probably making a point was you were right problem with me matter you get any one clip of me or my face and you could make decisions that's a that's an incredible test that's the first time Joe saw Ahri's butthole yeah there's no way I can remember that far back I think it's but I think Ari said so many times these and process of getting his butthole folks is he gonna get surgery yeah yeah is it the sir he's been bleeding since I've known him yeah it's bizarre that he lives life like that that would show that's a problem that would shut me off from going out to the world well what what causes those things hemorrhoids what causes hemorrhoids I got hemorrhoids working out because I wasn't breathing when I was lifting weights and I was just just clenching my butt hole made blisters inside your butthole and it's so easy together for a while well this actually won't have we got introduced to Ahri's butthole was I was complaining about me having hemorrhoids and I'm Lee Jinu skanks we opened up my butthole to show that I showed all the guys Louis did it we all open our said that's not a hemorrhoid step aside little ladies let me show you a hemorrhoid and it was like it was like the you know and stranger things the fucking monster the way though the face opens up that's what all his asshole does it looks like our Simpson's mouth yeah my break the blade remember the blade vampire mouth like predator and predator yeah it looks like it's baggy but just cuz it opens a lot how does he get away with what he gets away or did he like he can as he keeps tissues in his asshole at all times and if you're with re at one point he might just throw a bloody tissue at you if it got to I get I get staying away from the doctors I get it but if you're actively bleeding out of your asshole I'd be on an operating table facedown Oh quick quick I think it's a real pain in the ass to get the surgery dealing with it as is yeah oh yeah but I mean it's I'm glad he's gonna get it fixed though it's troublesome when your friendship how many times that guy send you a picture of bloody toilet paper I've seen way too much way too much people the thing to me is that re historically has just crushed ass like hot chicks walking around with confidence I he's confident walking around with napkins weirdly handsome like you don't think you see me like her that's a fucking goofy camel face fucking asshole yeah but then you look at him again he kind of dreamy eyes he's in good shape I don't know man he got in good shape for sober October yeah you got he's a fucking animal I knew that he was gonna be a real problem he was trying to win that goddamn thing yeah that's not right there dude you can't fucking have a athletic competition with all of your out of shape fat friends it's not fair okay good luck look we're gonna work out seven days seven days six hours a day what we're gonna have to do that we're gonna see who drops this is not smart but I'd say because they're sober ari came the closest are I get close he got close he even went hard he went fucking hard if Ari was in shape going into it he would probably would have at least what's this got a lot winning Millie how do you win if you have this this is last year last year was the only time we admitted to competition and I think it's better off not being a competition honestly I think the first we had to do 15 yoga classes over the month 15 90-minute hot yoga classes which is annoying it yeah it's it's annoying like you don't want to do it but you have to do it but can you get in there all right number seven like and you're starting to think how many more days are there I'm gonna have to do a bunch of I want up having to do nine in a row so I did yoga nine fucking days in a row but it was no competition but we just had a requirement right and everybody met the requirement we felt good that we accomplished the goal together but then everybody started talking crazy they wanted to do a competition Tom was like yeah it's where these heart rate monitors okay so what was how did you how would it re of won like what was the it's a point system based on eighty percent of your heart rate right so you're fine to max heart rate and then you know eighty percent of that gets you X amount of points and ninety percent that gets you Y amount of points I forget what it is in a course of time yeah but you can't really maintain 90 percent 90 percent is like these Sprint's the real smart move is to stay at 80 and go long-term so we were doing these cardio workouts it's all just in your head because it's it's not hard to do it's not hard to do an elliptical machine it's an easy motion so it's all in your head and all you do is you wear this fucking heartrate monitor and what I did is I watched the murder scene from John wick where it goes into the Russian for an over and upon a loop for five hours and I just stayed on the fucking elliptical machine for five hours watching that scene I get to the end of it I'd rewind it music fucked up and I just I did it for fucking six six hours a day seven hours six hours a day that's psychotic well we were having a competition was probably not healthy to work at yeah but not help excuse what we were competing yeah we're going to hell we're gonna hell I'm like we're going to hell there's no way perforation was do anything like that but Bert Kreischer was the one who talked to most shit so I would think about him while I was getting tired I was like there's no way bitch there's no way you're gonna there's no sleep is there an advantage to starting off being like one of the fattest guys because you can lose more and stuff no no no no your body's gonna have a hard time recovering but 80% of your max heart rate is different than 80% of my max heart rate so technically I don't have to work as hard as you you know you'd have to run on you know seven on the treadmill I could run at a 4.5 but no I think it's based on your age as well so the max heart rate is different so it might actually be easier because it's just used to doing it it's all about your body being used to do yeah if you're used to working out that MRSA yeah percent there's only like 140 beats a minute you know or maybe a little bit more like 146 beats per minute that's not that bad like you can kind of do that for a long time yes what's like just watch something that's engaging and make sure you keep breathing at that rate and you get you get trapped in whatever you're watching and for me it was fights - that was a big one I just put on some great fights so I got a TV right in front of me and I'm on this fucking elliptical machine watching fights and I would drink gigantic jugs of water with Himalayan salt and all these different keep it up know to keep you hydrated I sweat so much they set off the fire alarm I filled the room up with so much steam that the fire alarm went off I filmed it good fun I put it on YouTube or on Instagram that was ridiculous Dave he make me so mad Dave's never worked out a day in his fucking life just there's got to be a few yeah he looks good he's handsome my point was Ari got close he got close to me he wasn't even working out that's how crazy are Ian's and then you have to deal with the fact that you're doing this publicly and you can't allow Ari to beat you at this thing I was in the Millau and Burt if Ari beat me I would have said wow man I would I would have said wow man that is really really impressive but Burt there was no fucking way to go away Tom if Tom beat me I'd be like dude you did it man wow I wish I won but you won Burt no way there's no way we're going to hell you just leave we never hear from you go into the Darklands I'm wearing that monitor on me all day long I'm just gonna be lifting weights everywhere I go far back was Burton standing he's barely working out talking shit what if he ends he wind was it a marathon he ran or something no no he ran a full marathon that was pretty impressive that's insane Bert's tough all bullshit aside like Bert talks tremendous amounts of shit that's why I didn't want to lose to him but first tough I think he also talked shit to sort of set the expectation for himself because he says it he's gonna fucking have to stick to its very lowest thing we always tell but he speaks very decorative about things yeah and I'm like why do you do this I hold myself to that standard if I say I'm gonna lose weight publicly and then I don't ever longer so call me a fucking phony yeah and if I if I keep it in my head I probably will be more likely to skip the gym or whatever else it is so that's really wise that's really wise that's a good strategy yeah yeah if you fail it works for better podcasting it's also true and it's like public acknowledgement of your failings yeah it comes to like little goals that you set free it's like let's everybody know hey man that's not easy to do we're comics and yeah we live in a social media generation it's all like you need that I need people to tell me dude you're losing weight and when they stop telling me that I get fat again and then they're like oh you're getting fat and then I start losing weight again I and I'm it's almost that the attention is sort of what motivates me I need something beyond just being how much time have you spent researching like different methods of losing weight and how much you looked into intermittent fasting hey I've done animate did I've done I've been obsessed with try that I still don't fully understand what it is it's simple you just have a small feeding window like for me I like to fast I feel at my best when I'm fast in 14 hours so what I'll do is you know if I eat at 8 p.m. then I eat at 10 a.m. the next day it's not hard I was doing 12 years a 7 p.m. I was eating I could be from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. but I wasn't really eating healthy things were minute fasting I was eating shitty what I'm better at is if I just cut out most of the carbs I'll eat fruit and she'll like that but if I cut out all the carbs and the burgers and then the fucking bread and the pie the rice I can manage that because I can get creative and if I'm the mood for pizza I can figure out a you know a low-carb version of pizza you know cauliflower crust or whatever it is okay yeah you know it's really delicious do all those things but also lift weights yeah I have been I just started again like two weeks ago that's that's a big one the lifting weights is huge it burns a shit ton of calories and more importantly when your body has more muscle than your body burns more calories so you could eat the same amount of food and you lose weight you could do all that or Louis I know you just fistfight a comedian you'll lose body fat Joe you eat like tons of meat I eat a lot of meat do you ever hit have you gotten gout workouts from me it's not like a wine disease what do you get gout from me a lot of meat and beer no your feet your toe it hits it's a big your fucking right big toe it sucks cuz I'm sitting in a chair for too long and eating too much meat things all those then get your heel too doesn't fuck your heel maybe I don't know I only had to hit twice ever in my toe it was awful oh you got gelt yeah but I was like and by the way it would hurt so much that when I went to the doctor I was like I'll take because there's a you know you get medicine for it every day you take so you don't get it and I would have absolutely taken that's how much it hurt and they go now you don't like have like a condition you know actually I think I just I went to ago festival of concerts one weekend you go D he shouted up here's a definition gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint causing inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid and the in your blood your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines substances that are found naturally in your body yeah I got this blood that's still didn't answer my question good cause hear this I got people at ease up American foods meat poultry seafood hmm chemical compounds that are high amounts and certain foods like meat poultry and seafood that's interesting I think you also have to be fat hypo uranium dude oh yeah my friend was not fat hyperuricemia it sounds like something that a fat person should only get though dude I lied I was on a flight yesterday and I lied and because we were on the Roma for two and half hours and I was just getting really impatient I was a fucking hungry and I made up that I was hyperglycemic to get the thing and they wouldn't come so eventually I started waving like a madman and Mike finola there's a friend of ours a comic he was a few rows up that's how he knew what was in the plane because I was being a lunatic it was like we've known him forever I'm hyperglycemic I'd be food right now manna like don't get me orange juice it was the most fucking on a plane it's not going anywhere it's I'm blown away by the amount of rules look I believe it at the gate for like two hours before I'm like can I just go back into the airport and they're like now like it doesn't make any sense you you you've and not like take the flight but come on I'm off I'm going I think you can't be left the doors closed it's a big deal if you want to leave that's a big deal but as a Puerto Rican if you do leave Luis you have to twerk on your own if you watch those videos when people leave playing go fine yeah we have to work their way out you will get put on a list for sure of your asshole every time you fly on a plane well it already has that problem am i guessing but do you think that they would probably check you I don't know if I decided I want off the plane right now and if you make a scene you know yeah pull the plane back into this guy I don't think you're not gonna get off unless you make a scene you won't get off ones away from the gate I'm talking about when they stay at the gate and they never actually pull away from like the you're on a plane you're just hoping everyone can keep it together yeah hoping just hoping everyone can keep it what's your craziest plane experience I never I hate flying and I've had plenty of weird ones two dudes did almost get after it once on a plane over overhead space this one guy was claiming the space overhead there's only four or five arguments you could have on a plane over space middle person gets both armrests one I was on this side right but his shit was all filled up so he opens up the bin on the other side and puts his bag in and sits down on the guy who was behind him that was his side he goes hey man that's my storage space he goes no it's not he goes it's storage space I put my bag in there first I wasn't I was ahead of you I put my bag in there he's like no you have yours and I have mine and yours is full and he goes to grab his shit yeah and the guy goes hey man don't touch my fucking bag that guy's right by the way the guy who took the the other source space you fuck off dude it's just storage sorry one first class I wish one of those degenerate fucks from the back would try to put some shit my store one time they almost went after it though the waitress had to cut them off so you cut them up we're in the air the waitress we're in the air and they're going at it again so it's like we they're going at it when they're about the plane was about to take off and then they got through it and then in the air they were going at it again the waitress the stewardess she cuts him off wouldn't let him have alcohol but it was tense so it's like you know you have to keep an eye on I was like the whole tars you know me the lady made me she's like you're gonna help me write a much Jesus Christ lady I think anything's gonna happen well yes sure all right the woman behind me as I was complaining she was I was like I was like yeah you know he's like what what do you guys do I was like smaller juice of coffee maybe a kind bar that'd be nice because I said like loud enough for me she goes just get him some orange juice and I went I turn around I was like mind your business lady shut the fuck up these guys those undercover dudes that are on planes air marshals air marshals right so if you're an Air Marshal and you see these two two guys getting after a little bit just talking shit grabbing bags to shoot them Dickey to each other when do you move in because you don't want everybody to know you're an Air Marshal you're like they don't have a bomb you guys got to work this out you fucking pussies are just gonna push each other like you're not you know you guys aren't terrorists what am I doing here it was just an architect and a fucking if somebody's gonna die before there's a plane and give up their entire fuck it's such a pain in the ass what did you're going to deal with to get into a fistfight on a plane I don't know how many different crimes it is I've done but they have to pull this fucking plane over you are fuck dude you have to really want to fight somebody in order to do that because you'll deal with a lot of shit to that plane you're gonna like want anima arrest you you're fucked you're saw that lady smack her boyfriend in the head the guy gets up he's trying to leave when she throws the laptop and yeah as he's walking down the aisle yeah screaming search throwing laptop yes shit okay she's fired she catch her boyfriend cheating on the plane or something like that was but she got super loud and it became like a huge scene where everybody was listening to her talk and him was like oh my god this is so crazy I mean when they were dragging the asian guy out of the planes one of the funniest he starts chanting I want to go home but it was so sad I would legitimately have to drag man if they were trying to get me to give up my seat they would have to drag me out of the plane do that imagine thinking they could do that we're just gonna grab you physically and take you off the show like come on you're you're you're on the plane the planes about to take off we're gonna grab you and just pull you out of there I think they probably just settled with him they probably just gave him a ton of money and said shut the fuck up here's at what point it is your prize find out what business they do have security I mean what point does somebody wants to leave your private business I'm sure it's within the the contract that you fucking the Terms of Service for the ticket that they can do that so you think so where the guy's already sitting down well he said ya know after they asked him to leave a lot of times so I don't know what the law is I mean but if it's his ticket and he bought the ticket you can just decide Terms of Service exactly you're right Lois just say it's a dumb line they can do anything they want anything they want well what happened is they got destroyed on social media for like weeks afterward and they apologized and we're like we're changing our policy and also like Starbucks that's why yeah don't even get me fucking started jobs American Airlines says officially thank that guy wasn't black fucking I live in Harlem in the Starbucks in Harlem I mean it looks like a bus depot it's crazy it's just lines of people just sitting there charging their cell phones not ordering because they have their new policy is everyone who walks into customers various the fucking all it happened because of one bad PR Philly Philly when these two black dudes were just trying to sit down and chill out at at Starbucks and someone decided to remove them from the premises yeah but look now that Aryan perspective is they might have been dicks Starbucks might have been dicks but what I know is they they asked him to leave they called the cops the cops weren't going to arrest him the cops told him you have to leave and they still refused to leave and then they didn't they let him go they literally just cuffed him took him to the station in the world like they also tried to order four loko so okay but here's what I know I know that we don't know what happened yes no I agree with that completely you don't know it was a human interaction you don't know who the cunt was there right it could have been them it could have been the person work I know I know exactly what how do you think happened these two guys walked in they didn't buy anything they're like oh yeah you guys got to buy something they were like no we don't like well you got to leave them they're like no we don't and it was this weird little Mexican standoff between a fucking dumb idiot Starbucks employee and two dummies that wouldn't leave a Starbucks well here's the dip here's the disparity was a Mexican standoff between blacks do you think that the influx of homeless people is bad for their business do you think it's it's hurting business at all absolutely I mean I've signed imagine like that one move from that one store if the wings of the butterfly from that one little incident creates like a dip in the value of the company I feel like people don't want to hang out there as long and you probably buy more shit if you like stay there there's many people who go up online a couple times if they're there you know right you don't write your script on your laptop all the guys shitting his pants next to you yes I know we're for morons but let's solve this like why are there why there's so many homeless and what could be done I think it's a real tough area yeah that's like the thing what they used to do is just institutionalize them right just fucking grab them and throw them it and there's some problems with that for you sure because who decides who's worthy of being institutionalized you know we could hunt them and night like nutria just go around the thing about a shoe on light yeah didn't it tell do that on a show yeah it's bad out here but you guys got it like here you ain't seen shit until you go downtown downtown LA makes everything if most don't pass every underpass in LA now you're you're subject to see tents yeah they're all over the place all over through the valley all most people in LA and New York are pretty friendly though they're not they're not that aggressive I was in Seattle those fuckers who will come up to you and they will go at you they want like don't give them money they will like give you an attitude about it everywhere else took a Cleveland horrible homeless like every other city besides San Fran like yeah same and it's like aggressive should the Canadian homeless were a kid what not like this this was around when we were kids you would see those boxes in the side of the road and it was usually someone who was so fucked up that you know they just couldn't go anywhere and they'd have a box and they smelled like shit they were covered up but we're seeing like different levels you grow up surviving yeah yeah I mean I grew up in Brooklyn I saw homeless people all the time but I never saw anything and I haven't seen it in person but I've never seen anything like the camps and stuff that I've seen that's insane yeah that's the new thing yeah that's what's new it's like the underpass is - when I when I first started coming here in 94 there was never any tents on the underpasses least I don't remember them being I think now there's like almost some people think it's cool I live in East Village New York and there is so many just kids you're like you're a phone call away from like solving this problem if you kind of want to be out here like yeah yeah just like there it's literally like some scenario like punk rockers 20 year old 19 year old white kids yeah it's like 20 though as I'm saying it I don't think those kids are foam I bet you those kids are from really really fucked up situations at home and drugs and some I think more often than not they're probably dealing with some fucked up shit at home you don't actually on the streets - - you know repel against your mom you're good mom and dad most of the time what happens also watching a guy like you know just looks like as cruddy as homeless can be like charging his phone on one of those stations is pretty where's your address for Billy yeah how's Verizon get you the bill every month no prepaid phones anymore store in New York is on every corner now they have like a big station right and on that station you can do literally free phone calls you could just dial a number do it's a speakerphone phone call you could charge your phone and it has like a Wi-Fi station so everyone on the street has Wi-Fi in New York and you're like this is a great idea except now there's always a homeless person literally plugged into it and that's now their power source for their little homeless thing I don't have the screens they were jerking off outside the screens out of the screens off there was a better week after they came out where you'd see regular people using them and now it's only homeless yeah I felt like nobody else touches them if you had a look at a graph of all the crimes that were committed using burner phones like 7-eleven burner phones like how many 7-eleven burner phones are used by poor people and how many of them are used to commit crimes like serious espionage it ignores know between international spies a fucking giant international crime tool that goes unreported burner phones like 7-eleven burner phones we get it it's in the plastic you pop it open it's got an hour in it fuck who the fuck is using those things some of them are poor people it's getting I think it's getting more and more exclusively criminal it's like leaving an airplane if you buy a 7-eleven phone you're on a list you could go to like Verizon and get a bottom of the line phone that's affordable that's better than anything existed like five years ago like where the where technology is now you don't have to spend like what's a cheat what's a cheap Android phone if you were at your pcs right now get a free Android phone sign up for $40 and now you're out you're out the door and then you never have to pay it again because it's prepaid yeah so you just have a certain amount of minutes right well no it's unlimited I have metro pcs guys and me do the general insurance too you just do everything it's a film everything unlimited I don't understand why I would ever switch besides the fact that my friends make fun of me ah so your phone works in places it works everywhere yeah you're doing some sort of a roaming thing I guess no there's no roaming there's no overt you're over just nothing it's just better there's it really sounds like weird if I can add reader much your PCs right now it's one of the UFC sponsors but people make fun of you like you're hot garbage Jenna not tell people truth cuz you screenshot every time I scream something shot something it says maybe that much better even if they're great they're embarrassing oh yeah right yeah even if they're great it's embarrassing that it's great like I think Hyundai has a problem with these new cars that they're making so they start calling the Genesis they call them Hyundai's cuz people are gonna know Hyundai's that car that cost is real cheap but it runs forever that's a Hyundai there's no no Hyundai's luxury we got this letting it rip nope nope can't have both yeah they got grounded yeah major piece yes even if it's the best service you know like the problem is like anytime anything's a bargain even if it really is a great deal and MetroPCS seems like a great deal it is it does anything with things a bargain people don't want it like some people want the shit that cost a lot is hard to get yeah when I was a kid I remember I would I just wouldn't get sneakers that weren't like Nikes or like yeah even if there were comfortable sneakers even if they were more expensive yeah it didn't matter this loser yeah I felt the fucking idiot you got like a rebel if you wanted Edith yeah now you are grocery store sneakers shit now it's funny how important it is when you're younger though it's very important because anything that could get you just ridiculed when you were young you had to be always conscious of like you had to always be aware of what could fuck up your dog there's not enough of a delineation between shitty stuff and like the mid-range stuff but I think like high-end stuff tends to be like better quality yeah he's always shown that with clothing and stuff or my ex-wife I remember I was talking about per much she spent on a purse which I said is ridiculous that she just put it last forever and to some degree I still think it's ridiculous do that for a purse but my point is paying for the quality like does last long it's better yeah things are made better Smith but the difference between like a knockoff fucking Louis Vuitton bag and like a baggy buy and like a store is like not much difference yes like a fake Ferrari right yeah there's a huge difference between those bags I think I'm just saying like the stitching I mean I did I check it was a fashion check yeah there's definitely a huge difference in those bags yeah yeah yeah oh yeah high-end I'm saying but I'm just saying the difference between like as one you'd buy it like JCPenney versus like a shitty one you buy on the street there's not much difference in quality in that you as was buy the fake Louis Vuitton yeah if you were a kid and you didn't have like a good name brand sneaker you were ashamed all Bobo's yeah they call him the Bobo I had voice I remember when I was in the sixth grade there were voice and it was it was a last shitty sneaker I ever had it was just voi t got him at CH horns which was this I mean as shitty of a department store as you could possibly get and kids would just make fun of your shitty sneakers it was terrible I had whatõs I had lotos that had velcro on the side that you could changed a lot of assemble different colors like a fat fucking cheerleader I was dressed like a cheerleader to change the coverts ago my school spirit if you were a viewer like a runner maybe get away with New Balance yeah there were people wore New Balance when I was in high school I feel like that was just like okay it's okay are alternative you it's a good quality shoe okay Marvin Hagler used to wear them like it's a seashells people thought you had an arch problem or you're a wrestler hey six yeah yeah oh yeah I just love Asics wrestling shoes I'm high school came around I knew well enough to just change my style so I'd so we're in like air walks and like those shitty like skater they were like 45 bucks oh good yeah that was very smart oh so it was a big Jenko gene guy well converse Chuck's never went out of style right they never went out of style oh they love them you think they're comfortable I have them but I love they're not comfortable I don't want smushy I don't like smooshy shoes that much sometimes I do but most of times I like it where it's very it's very little rubber that's all it is it's like you may imagine that those guys played basketball on those things back in the day it's kind of crazy yeah that's weird doesn't seem like a lot of support but maybe that's that they had stronger ankles that way or something my mom tried to convince me that chucks were cool she was right this was when I was in the sixth grade oh it wasn't no this was when chucks had the you know conference was at the absolute bottom they fuckin there's something happened again but it's not I think Chuck Taylors 27 bucks I think Chuck Taylors were always in style a little converse like just as a general breath you gotta just converse sneakers dude you look like a jerk-off where's your family better be poor shit other problems like with your pants and shirt before we even get to those converse sneakers time but that period of time is gone right they have dope leather and suede ones sure they have all kinds of difference who's that guy now look now it's like the look so if someone makes me feel is back somehow like fat tongue feelers in their back for kids yeah like for kids is there one we don't know we're so out of the loop but is there one brand that's like is it still Nike like what is my daughter 17 yeah that's so Georgia yeah yeah Nike advice cake timberlands my kid has sure yeah if it's boat if it's boots at the timberlands there's got to be like the most successful sneaker campaign in the history of the known universe there's nothing that has the kind of cachet as Jordan the only thing I'd say maybe probably that sells more than the Jordan is the Air Force one but their per unit cheaper though right that's no michael jordan nike air asbestos Nike I think Air Force One I think of him now now the Air Force Ones are both are took their basic be my yeah what doesn't the Air Force one have a dude flying through the air Duncan no no okay that's just the Jordans Nikes are fucking uncomfortable every time I wear Nikes they hurt my feet Oh - Vegas - Vegas statement these are what are these you're in the skate shoes right minimalist sort of yeah there we go slightly flexible although the levels kind of shoes yeah yeah and then it were New Balance I wouldn't do Browns a lot yeah like an old white cut so yeah that's a wide foot shoe yeah you taking a bold risk when you were those five finger shoes even though they're good for you yeah to walk around in life though or just at the gym I friend Kyle Kingsbury does it but he wants a wife who's also a gorilla he's an enormous guy so he's daring you to say that or he's not a nice guy but he's a former UFC fighter super nice guy where's uh those fucking my follow shoes Kyle on Instagram he's he's hilarious he's great great great oh yeah is he a white guy yeah I said like there was a thing I saw a clarity ring girl right what's her name Tasha yes smoky there's a clip the other week of two guys two black guys a tow truck company I think it is that start filming this white guy that called them guerrillas and as he said but the white guy backing down Azhar coming at him and it's so funny why this guy would have said this like I almost believe the white guys excuse but he is lost because he I guess he said some I have one of these two gorillas bring it around and he definitely met their big guy so he definitely kind of meant it like that but it just doesn't look good so him to look like you called me and my black friends here go really is like no I'm at least wrong God but he just goes my my dentist is a black fella he starts doing now that's where you're going wrong brothers talking about your dentist being blood man's way too far removed that's not even I have high five Tim several times yeah I don't even believe in ya later just sweet so wheat so I saw the thing where Milo said you guys cooked out on the show the first time that's why we're going hard a few balances this time it was worth it to have re what I already said fuck you to all three of us was the hardest I our national treasure dude arias gank vested it's a big rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane do a show where they hold you bang him and they have like four or five female comedians on stage and then a male comedian comes out and does a set and at the end of it the girls have to decide whether or not they would fuck him based off of you know multitude of things and the set right so Ari does his he just gets naked so literally takes his clothes off so it is a set naked and then he starts chasing the female Korean comedians around the stage with his dick and trying to have to hold on listen listen before you say anything more but just be aware that other people are gonna listen to this yeah admit he's like got it then he held her down against some camera it was all part of the theatrical performance so it was planned and agreed to and consented in advance right so he's just he's chasing these girls around really knows he could catch them if he was really chased Oh obviously he's a man chasing them around this stage with his dick and Louie CK is there watching from the sidelines and he goes I'm the problem Louie no he was in a safe space yes no okay here does it right here a lot of people gather their panties in a bunch when no pun intended when he went on stage oh yeah dude his set was fucking killing I was so happy to see him yeah and I'm not I mean people outside of the people that were there so some people never I mean maybe they feel that the guy didn't do what they wanted him to do how long do you want someone to suffer well the bummer is also the venue saying that like their workers were like afraid to stop it or do anything about it and that they were upset and it's like bullshit they were have to say that they were jumping around they didn't though because a business doesn't need to have an opinion they could just not say anything for two days nobody was going after this venue and going like oh you need to release a statement nobody gave a fuck Keats oratory for businesses you could understand that the the idea of reacting to a journalist is not new but the idea of reacting to thousands and thousands of people who make comments in your Instagram page that is new and for a business that's you know that's a big deal yeah they they're worried about being boycott but that's how it is people but there are people who are pissed off that Louise there those people will not like they will boycott they will tweet everyday they their thing is to try to ruin someone for you know committing a like woke crime or whatever and there so that's what they deal with is that people like us who are like add that sucks that they fuckin wrote that letter we don't do anything we're not boycotting because they wrote that letter we're not like do the the other side isn't putting as much pressure on them and that's why all these companies that's why Gillette's making those razor commercials and shit cuz they're scared of that side yeah you see the Gillette razor commercial where they is it the Gillette one where the two firemen kiss I don't think who are you going for like you know what we want to fight fires now but it was like I get it you're progressive it's like this this goddamnit know what the commercial expensive though isn't it like dude if you buy into that like like oh my god I'm so happy this company is is Woking you're just a market they're just taking advantage of you they're trying to make money off of you sort of but it's also hot there's like hot fireman and efficient and they're making out and they you know the guy comes back from a fire and he's ready to get some dick right now holla it looks fun he's a hero as long as my lesbians so they're trying to sell you insurance or whatever the fuck there who did the commercial but I remember saying okay we're being progressive I love it why not I don't give a shit go for it I just find it weird I find it strange the woke capitalism thing that people that companies will take a position that you think would turn off like 50% of the people who buy from them but don't they do it to prove their there I don't know goodness yeah but it doesn't hurt does it hurt like does anybody go fuck Blue Cross I'm getting my fucking insurance from that people are lazy brought whatever whatever the cheapest option is they're buying that it's like the Equinox thing that just happened nobody's fucking leaving Equinox let me tell you something there's no other option it's convenient you got your fucking gym membership a handful of people or virtue signaling but all the people complaining saying boycott Equinox online they're not fucking Equinox members they're fucking one of the owners was a trump supporter he gave money that's right he held a fundraiser last week for Trump so people were freaking out saying to boycott the brand but it's like where else you're gonna go there's not another high-end gym that's all over the place like no phrase are the exact same political beliefs business it's like if I go if I go to buy a sandwich do I have to go like so where were you on the Iraq war no okay let me say you know it's a company that preys on your laziness is the insurance that you get through like sag-aftra mm-hmm they like it's that you know you get it for free if you qualify and then when you don't qualify for it you're still enrolled in it and it's like the most expensive insurance does that make sense you know I mean like and then kind of praying that kind of got me almost in that way where a year where I it wasn't taking care of I was like well I don't want to switch out and then have any doctors that you know I mean like me to be different so they they kind of get you like that do this Trump thing is that give if you support anything that he does even in just as business practices then you're racist like everything that you support if he supports it you're racist yeah it's crazy you're not see you're racist and when somebody cause you're racist or not see and even people that don't believe that they don't want to stand with you and defend you because then they're being perceived as defending or racist or Nazi and it's a trick and it's very effective juicy so popper I don't know why this guy supports Trump but maybe he could explain it right and he's a real estate guy he's a big real estate guy related properties he is nothing to this Jim okay this has to do with the fact that he probably has real estate deals that for a very very long time with Trump and his gym is inconsequential compared to the billion-dollar company that he runs well that makes sense then that makes sense why he would support Trump especially if he knows Trump but it's uh if you if you can't see that I mean if you have a problem with that and many people would write many people would have a sarong with that like that's a different thing but if you if you if you hear what people are saying they're saying if you support Trump that you support races so you support white nationalists you put and I think you're leaving so many people out of the conversation when you do that oh yeah I mean the guy got was sixty-two million people to vote for him so if you're saying anyone who supports him is some type of Nazi white nationalist then we got bigger problems shouldn't break up no one knows that definition of those things anymore when Miley you stood about Milo when he came on the things he was called that just like yeah on paper couldn't even apply to be right would never be accepted into being a Nazi or white surprised you guys remember when we were kids we read about McCarthyism and the Red Scare we always thought like god we're past that that kind of shit's never gonna happen again but what that is is like a symptom of people worried about people defecting from their tribe or turning on their tribe and we we have this like built-in fear of this kind of shit happening well there's that aspect to it right it's the people who are worried about people defecting and then you have the opportunists who can play off that go instead of having a win an argument or having to you know like convince people I'm just gonna say you're with the other tribe you're in this bad group so you're don't even talk to that person yeah even listen to what they have to say and if you're and subscribe on every issue you're a fuckin dolt I was gonna say why do you have to be so defined by your true well you know I mean like I would love to hear the argument about the the but what it does good for him for his real estate ventures I would love to hear it like an honestly laid out argument of why someone like Trump's better if you're a real estate developer and it might be a significant part of his business yeah not being an apologize any mind people all people also will just like there's this weird thing where people think that business owners and people that make a lot of money are inherently bad but it's like all right dude just cuz somebody is really good and really successful he's got kids he wants to feed he has grandkids he wants to watch grow up and go to college it's like I don't know I don't think this is necessarily just bad people that have a lot of money I think that there's a lot of good people that have a lot of money as well and I think they do a lot of good shit why I've just you know whenever someone gets really upset about an issue you always have to wonder like how much of it going in there was I mean what what is upsetting to you is upsetting to you that anyone who supports Trump the Trump represents all the things that are wrong with America today in terms like white nationalists and terrorist attacks mass shootings and and and and misogyny yeah massage they keeping the immigrants out of being mean and be in America first like fuck it's uh it's one of those things today where if you if you support any part of that any part of even if it's good for your business you're just a magnet for fucking people are angry at all the things though that whole list was a chick-fil-a McDonald's like electricity a lot of big businesses support Trump but it's so weird how people like project their own thing onto the situation because even like that you just said like what everyone hates about Trump but the people who support Trump they're not even on the other side of those issues it's not like they're like no we are pro white nationalists they just see him as a completely different thing they're like making the country great and jobs and draining the swamp and all these other things like they people are looking at the same thing and seeing very different realities yeah yeah they are and people are going in with their preconceived bias and getting them confirmed you know with everything even with the way you looked at the Mueller report like the Republicans looked at as a victory and the Democrats looked at as some sort of like an open door to impeachment yeah but that was I don't know this fucking if the thing starts off with every day you're hearing on the news that the president is colluding with a hostile foreign power he's a Russian puppet he's working with Vladimir Putin and then by the end you're like we have to impeach him because he thought about obstructing the investigation that he was declared not guilty and it's like this is getting weird you guys were gonna be upset no matter what you found hundred percent left Trump aids team trying to say sounds like he does they just Trump I'm going hard not see this time I'm not coming back on the show I'm going hard this time it's the fucked up part is only having really two choices like we're scrambling to see whose choice number two who's going to be the one that opposes Trump and you've seen people starting to crack under pressure like re-entry pressure whoa they try to figure out who's gonna be Ben Gleib maybe imagine we all get doubted them gets through and becomes president will be fucked when you look at the people that are in line though does anybody stand out that you would think that would be able to well I don't I don't know how much of a realistic shot but who I I loved Tulsi Gabbard I sent her money twice already and I disagree with her on like 80% of her shit I was a really interesting person she very she really is and her she's dead on about the war stuff and she's you know yeah about Medicare she's dead on about a lot of things well she's kind of hot fuck yeah didn't agree with something with Medicare no I don't like her Medicare stuff but I do like the most important thing that she leads with is the war stuff and she's she's got a great position where she's like did two tours in Iraq she's still active duty and so you know like the the normal like come back is like oh you're against the wars it's like well you're just kind of a wimp or you're you wouldn't want to protect the country and she's like no asshole I actually went I'm the one who's willing to go die for this and I'm telling you we shouldn't be dying for this and what did she do what was her job over there though oh she was it was serious she was like in a medical unit so she was like dealing with the people who actually were tree though she was an edge of tomorrow Tom Cruise it was her job to clean up the DVDs that's a hot subject right women in combat yeah I got a bunch of shit about saying making jokes about a sing that I understand what a girl I watch the show cops a lot not understand what a girl cop has ever done in a situation that's hostile except for make the the perp get much more hurt shot or tased because she's in the way of it happening and people got really upset about me saying that but it really I don't understand why you'd send like a woman to like you know a major fight happening at the mall get down there ladies it really is like a physical Pro that with some cops the physical aspect of an altercation is like it's gonna be a real problem yeah it doesn't have to be a female thing you can just say you can't have a hundred and ten pound person go and be the physical Authority in the situation I'm gonna call you a chick search is a terrible video of this guy getting pulled over by this lady and his daughter is in the car and the guy was a criminal apparently in the the cop was calling in and the guy punches her and gets her down on the garage he knocks her out clothes an old video yeah and starts punching her face and while she and the daughter scream and stop it daddy stop it daddy and he beats the fuck out of this lady cop yeah any like this is why if you problem this lady cops by herself and she's got a gun but she doesn't have the gun out of the holster pointed out she's it's a routine traffic stop and that guy pummels her man it's horrible yeah it's a really me saying the idea is not like fuck chicks I'm just like don't send them out to get hurt and I don't understand why this is your daughter and you saw your daughter beaten oh my god because someone thought it was okay for her to be by herself amongst you know big giant criminals technically they don't match up female cops though right I'm assuming most of the time they put a girl by herself that's all you could be on patrol by yourself life is like walking around a neighborhood or something sure I've seen videos where it's like a dude and a chick partners and the cop gets in a fight with another guy and it's basically just two men fighting with this woman kind of grabbing an arm here or there it's almost behind yeah she might try to hit the guy with a breakin - you bring the mace it herself part in that job - I've seen but I think any small a permit or a man any person who's you know not a large person who's not physically strong as by themselves as a cop is in danger anyone doesn't matter if you're male or 150 pound absolutely same deal you're in trouble unless you're really good martial artists you can grab a gun quickly know how to respond to pressure like 99% of women I could take a gun right out of their hands I have no I have no training don't give me a check you can point a gun right at my head but that said I'm gonna all the time I'm fucking taking an important writer back at her I should make clear that I myself I'm no word I'm nowhere near as tough as I think you should you should need to be to be a cop oh yeah yeah I mean I would never assume that of myself either so I'm not like saying it dude I've been doing martial arts my whole life I wouldn't want to be a cop I don't want to be a cop it's a crazy situation it's hard it's a hard job it's dangerous you're supposed to have to be brave well not only that man do you know how much PTSD those guys are dealing with that is unrecognized if everyday you're pulling people over that might shoot you every day you're dealing with someone who's robbing something or stealing something or trying to kill somebody or did kill somebody every fucking day I see a lot of cops and shit though some of them work but look you're wearing a uniform that makes you the enemy you're also the person with power and you've got to realize how fucking corrupt that is that you're able to yell at people and force people in these situations and cuff them and fuck with them and you got to know when to a public like nastiness because they can yeah guys guys do walk their way I get a personal way if you're just blocking their path we're a normal person would go excuse me guys because there were walk guys walk but sometimes they don't have typically benefit of the doubt right there they're in Times Square they're dealing with a lot of people there's just not time for the Damona circumstances I'm talking about in just a thing like that the same way they put on their lights to go through a red light just to get because they don't want to yeah have you seen of course that's just it's being human beings don't do well with Authority mixed with impunity so like a cop can say that to you and nothing happens yeah if there's no repercussions and you have power I had a job as a security guard for a brief moment in time when I was like 19 years old and there was an us-versus-them mentality between the security and the people with the concert goers that was clearly evident one of the first days I was working there this guy's name was alley cat security and some dude had stole one of the golf carts so the golf cart mundum electric golf carts were security so they tackle this dude off the golf cart and he smashes him in the head with a fucking walkie-talkie it's like a crazy fight with some drunken asshole who's like violent and stole a golf cart that was like the first day their first or second day there on the job I was like okay so this is what's going on and you it became people trying to sneak booze into great woods and then us and then so is this us versus them mentality and everybody was lying to you and that was a silliest job I'm doing security at a fucking Bill Cosby Show literally I was doing security I was taking people's booze you know what did you let happen asleep on the job hilarious it's such a you know it's such a simple little job it's easy there's no criminals there there's no bank robbers there there's no murders that the women are just that little situation of us versus them with the liquor and them trying to smuggle in pot and liquor just that led to this huge fucking rift between the security people and the way they because it's too much of a human emotion in it that something should be a job because what is even if you don't care if people when you're not working you're trying to get beer and weed into a concert it's just that these are your opponents right now and they're trying to fuck with you even though there's some of you were like you're going I don't care if you guys smoke weed you're like no but I have to say you can't smoke weed and then when they do it anyway like I just fucking said you can't Rookwood it's like testing your manhood all human emotion in that will be unaffected Kanna about that experiment what college was it's like a famous story it's Princeton the best in prison or no Stanford experiments you know I've read something debunking me - yeah they said the methodology was all wrong on it or slightly it's not a legit study they also said that people were doing things just to end the study quickly because I wanted to go home yeah they broke that down they'd they showed that side of it when they were like the then they said I guess the guy who made the experiment said yeah it's it's a wash the end of it was like it wasn't actually good data but it was interesting and I do believe that yeah students pretended to be some pretend to be criminals sometimes they started getting power positions go and the interesting things is that the professor becomes like the warden you know he gets into it - like they cut that they show that they got it on video and something he's like walking around with his chest out and he's all in it's just people get they fall into these roles into these camps and the authority goes to people's head it may it creates a weird dynamic think about how many dickhead cops people have met right yeah but that's just a thing that happens well she's a woman but it also makes it very nice when you run into friendly cops yeah what a good dude it's almost like training the human interaction so they're there when they act like a dick and people act a certain way and they move and they get a little bit nervous it's like oh that's like intoxicating they're like ah that feels good that power about no repercussions for your behavior the way you're talking you could just do that with impunity that's you just nailed it that's exactly what it is that's not a normal situation for people it's well that's I mean just it's state vers business if you ask here we go look if you walk into the Apple Store or you are get they can't do that because you're a voluntary customer so if they treat you the wrong way there's a repercussion right there walk out is course with yes lack dudes yeah how they're homeless camps now not shooting people cellphones has become the great equalizer because now you see cops there they're on it walking on eggshells dude their cell phones now I'm going what up bitch ass pussy cop that's like well I guess I'm a bit chattery reserva shoot you in the stomach dude do you see the the video in New York with her throwing water on the cops that cops just aren't doing shit I don't know I think I was I might have been in Harlem or say isn't like a bad neighborhood in New York they're dumping water on the cops and everyone's got a cell phone camera on them and you know in any other period of time throwing water balloons Ataman shit and they're just sitting there like we know I'm gonna be in the news tomorrow I'm gonna be you know what I mean like they've been doing things a certain way for so long I'm so close to do you guys ever see the 75 yeah yeah excellent is he likeable yeah very nice guy what's his name Michael Dowd is that Mike lowdown Michael Dowd I didn't see it it's a excellent it's doubt it's doubt yeah you know he's great he's a really nice guy I mean super open and honest about what happened and the documentaries fucking compelling shit yeah and you realize that how much of it was true he's never more full always I find that's why I find unlikable he's not remorseful I think he's remorseful yes look boys just doing coke all day long every day as a cop and and and you know making all this money and drive the Corvette he was out of control and he was on the area where he was the 75th precinct I think it's East New York Brooklyn at the height of like the New York this was like the murder yeah neighborhood capital like it was it was a wild thing but they get up in the air a lot of those murders that's what I think is like crazy about like they were all they weren't never they were never convicted of a murder right there was no I think admittedly that he was kind of he's like me of course like there was a talk about doing one right yeah yeah never happened the whole fucking thing is crazy but what it tells you I mean forget about perps are judgments on you know the people that were in it what tells you that this can happen that someone that just becomes a cop to get on the force if it's a bad force worked it was at the time with him and he's seen corruption from day one I mean it was just like he was roped into it like right away when you listen to his story it's pretty fucking compelling yeah I was like the first day on the job like something happened they threw a guy off a building or something like that but take a person I don't remember yeah but it was and then there's that you could take yeah you're like I can just have that no one will know there's 50 G's here I could just take this home and like oh we didn't find it it's very it's very telling of the personality that becomes a cop though because they're not even worried that people are gonna it's amazing today there's no one whistle blows so much earlier than that because one person comes in goes no guys we're supposed to be fuckin believing in this badge and what we do you know I mean no they all go what do we do I'll be good cops or bad cops you ever robbing drug dealers like I'll do that we'll do that so I don't think that honestly to be honest I have almost no problem with cops skimming off the top from drug dealer money just give you to the government why does it governor make it to have the money on these cops you wait a minute not if they're arresting people for drugs yeah look if you're gonna do that you're gonna just ignore everyone else who selling coke okay but if you're gonna do that and arrest people for selling coke then you're a criminal then you're like you should be arrested yeah that that's the repercussion I don't have a a moral issue with it if he found fifty thousand dollars only reported forty thousand put ten thousand dollars in his pocket brought her home to his wife and kids I don't really have a moral issue with what if he brought it home and just fucking pay for his backed up like porn bill or something we just brought him the fuck around no Jay they won't let you go that long yeah look I uh stated there's fees he got arrested I wouldn't go up poor fucking guy oh yeah that's the price you pay you committed a crime that but from like my personal perspective I don't think he's a piece of shit I don't think it's a bad person I think it's probably stupid if he doesn't look the cycle of people and drugs is never-ending it will go on to the end of time the cycle of making drugs illegal and propping up gigantic criminal enterprises because that is also as old as we've had laws as long as we've had laws that people breaking those laws if those laws exist because someone wants to control people's behavior in a way that people don't want folks are gonna find a workaround empowers the Mexican cartels right now and the Mexican cartels are a huge source of fear for people who live in the border towns there's a huge source of fear for people that are forced to be in communities and it's propped up because drugs are illegal nobody seems to want to recognize that it's one of those ugly things about being a human that like people want drugs and you can't tell them they can't have what they want yeah especially since immigration became such a huge thing that everyone's talking about and that's like the biggest part of it that no one talks about is like the violence and it's like well there's people on this side of this line who want the drugs there's people on this out of the one who have the drugs and even with all the shit you're doing they're still trading them to each other so do you really think maybe we should just let him do it we're in but here's the thing we don't want anybody to do it rightly so I mean luckily know what you don't want anybody running around doing heroin yeah nobody gets through that goes it was amazing it was my best one of my best moments in life is what I was addicted to heroin yeah but even if you do it one time I bet it's pretty fucking bail it's amazing just one hard to let it go well it's probably fucking incredible Lenny Bruce had some crazy description of it about something about being hugged by an angel or something yeah Mike just uh Mike Latta who died half years ago in New York comic here to joke he was like he was like you know great heroin is it's like taking a bath in a pool full of kittens I was a mess Kurt Metzger had that joke about it where he says uh when the families of people go I don't understand why he would do heroin he's got a family that loves him and kids who look up to him in love like why would he do heroin when I tell her family like you're just so close to the answer yeah but I mean I don't think people should do it but make it illegal it's not they're not gonna stop doing it the question would be would people do more of it if it was legal if you could just go to a drug store the same way you go to a liquor store and the drug store was actually a drug store we could just go buy coke and they might well look in LA I do think more people are smoking weed for sure since weed became legal like I'd be my rest I don't actually what the date is I'm sure yeah that's fine but uh but even if that's the case I don't know if that's the answer because let's say even slightly more people did heroin hold on wait less people got murdered what's that what your heroin the people smoke weed more since legalization well that was the most hilarious it's gotten cheaper it's easier to get it's better it's more fun it's in candy form it's in fucking yeah yeah it was in eighteen I think 18 year old is more likely to it definitely give it a try versus maybe would have what I got for the first time I was 17 years old I had up my uncle Raymond buy it for us he skimmed off the bag I remember and he was a fucking dime bag and me and my two best friends we smoked a joint before we were going to see System of a Down Incubus and mr. bungle that's no quarter Rican so what your uncle like two years older than you we the night before we want to smoke and it took us we there was no way to get it we were trying to find weed for so long because we weren't in that world the first time you go to get weed if you could just go to a store and pick it up and it's fun and you know it's like a meta mall I mean yeah I guess I mean astronomical but you know I love weed so I'm not hatin it's great well it was hard to get on the East Coast it mean it's just trickier out here no but the 90s once they passed those laws for medical everybody had a medical card it's not hard to get at all the doctors were extremely inscrutable in their prescriptions now so everybody's had weed out here since the fucking 90s yeah like strong strong easy to get Yemen now they don't shit if you smoke like outside you can smell that you're smoking like a cigarette now in the night no I don't think you get smoking outside it's still think you have to be indoors I think smoking outside the problem is other people can smell it and you're not supposed to do that yeah I mean in Denver it's like nine feet from an entrance you could say I smoked vape I mean everywhere inside of a movie theater as I'm walking through a mall I go to the bathroom at the airport and I smoke yes that's what ethnics do they challenged everyone by being big and alpha in a place like Starbucks yeah I'm smoking what next he only keeps me around so he could be racist what do you mean my dentist is black dances be hilarious snoops got diamond lower teeth now Snoop Dogg Ivan started or like them creative dog old grilled diamond earrings that I was he's in this video he's driving around on his Instagram in a Lamborghini with diamond lower teeth 50 years old diamond teeth he's living it man all for sure doesn't give a fuck he spends most of his time getting furious at video games online does he yeah he just yells about mad like for a minute right he was commentating like with your lyric they would drink and watch the fight so he was drinking liked angering smoking joints and these was tough because what it was was there was some commentary that he did just independently on one fight and it was so hilarious because he's so animated screaming and yelling about this fight that everybody thought like wow I wouldn't be great if there was an option to watch the Snoop Dogg commentary yeah that's right and it was probably no watch but I assume it was fucking horrific going north south dis or dismiss yeah they just the I guess the bored with it they got bored doing it or something I don't know it stopped maybe was fuckin busy he doesn't have time to be doing it he's like Mike Tyson too in the sense that I just I remember when he was like scary yeah oh that's right it was a call before it was call be okay he thought it was he thought it was yeah but it was a man from a completely different part of the world yep drop that it was cold holy shit he was getting some booze the other night huh dude that guy hears cha-ching yep when those people are booing charging its emotion did emotion you want to get the emotion I people whether it was good or bad it doesn't fucking matter they want to see him fight and they want to see him lose he's going he'll he went he'll yes and he's a good guy I'm telling you I know that guy I've met him outside of this crazy thing that he's doing and this crazy thing that he's doing came about when he was like on the verge of getting cut and people didn't like his style and so he went hard he'll when he fought Damien mind he went hard yeah well jail did a similar thing she'll wasn't the big mouth guy back in the day no he was not yeah in one day that he's gonna be that dude it wasn't right at the anderson fight fucking great marketing this is smart very smart and kalbi - it's like el Bosso colby he something happened as well he's really exciting dude that last fight that last fight was incredible dude but yeah Colby is definitely it's contrived I appreciate the effort but you know effective see the thing about it being contrived is it makes it obvious that he's putting on a show yeah but the thing is that putting on a show is fucking he's ruthless he fucks with people's heads legitimately like they do not want to lose to him and then when you get inside the Octagon he's really fucking good like really yeah I didn't realize how good he was you see the amount of strikes that they all volume and then he's an unbelievable wrestling it's a really really really tough matchup for anybody and Colby is it is a you know an act and it is pro wrestling he puts on the Trump hat and people I mean people to see that hat and they lose their fuckin mind and heat rolls half the country and it's a similar thing with the other with them when businesses do it I'm going like guys don't be rubes like it's very obvious that it's just an act and if you're a fan of mixed martial arts you have to appreciate the fact that some guys are taking chances and trying to generate interest you can every guy can't just be put on a suit and be straight first and yeah I respect my opponent at some point you want to go a little story yeah yeah I mean he makes juicier but the bottom line is we put all that shit aside and just look at what he's doing you look at who he's doing it that guy is extraordinary yeah like the fact that he could do that to Robbie Lawler completely shut down his offense and just put a beating on just stay on top of them never in minière never give him any air the pace is smothering and if striking looked really very good I mean very very shot takes a shot great and his cardio is off the fucking charts oh yeah yeah it's that that whole 170 right now that whole division is looking crazy right now amazing yeah Nate Diaz being back in the mix and Mazda the Mazda on Nate seems like just like if you're a fan of just like if you're from a poor neighborhood that is like the the superstar match I like a group it's too shitty like environment it's like that was like the perfect who hood rat fucking guys who are gonna talk shit they're gonna go in there and fight god it's so awesome that make so much money that's gonna be so giant well it was cool that Dana White at the post-fight press conference he got asked because you know he had famously said I think once that Nate Diaz doesn't move the needle or something like along those I was doing negotiation yeah I'm sure it was but he basically said he goes I think Nate besides a Conor and Ronda Rousey is like about as big a star as MMA has like they did crazy good numbers everyone the arena was going nuts for him he was he walked out yesterday or Saturday night when he walked out the fucking place roared I mean as loud as anybody as loud as any main event person whether it's Steve a or DC Nate Diaz got the biggest roar and then he had a great performance well even leading up to it people were talking about Nate coming back more than they were talking about the heavyweight title I don't think I don't think some people in the UFC realize how big a star he really is I think they thought that the Conor fight Conor was the big star Nate beat'em the Conor won the second fight Conor still remains the big superstar I think Nate is equally as big a star but I think that Erica is Conor's maybe you know Worldwide's like but in America Nate Diaz is a giant fucking star not as big as Conor but a tier below maybe you have to say he won the two fights I mean if you take who would you rather be in the two fights I mean he choked Conor out facedown in the first one and then had like a razor close unbelievable great fight the second time so I mean he comes out of that looking pretty good yeah but I think it's a testament to how popular Conor is because that's the fucking Conor shine and it was a dance and Nate brought it and Nate has that story the one-on-one fight it's turned him into this star button if he never danced with Conor would he be that big - no I don't know you know that because Nate was awesome four years before the double middle fingers like there's so many moments where you could where you're like I get goosebumps thinking about maybe what's right if that's your favorite part when it's like these are the fingers double fingers and flexed you losing that fight - yeah the Donald Cerrone fight third round they come out they're so fuckin good dude Nate's once again it's just you don't have to be a mixed martial arts man he's gonna be a human and go like that they fucking fighter that is something that everyone wants to watch well I hope he makes an actual belt because he's going to say he's got the baddest motherfucker in the game belt then who wants to defend you know who wants to be next to challenge for the baddest motherfucker in the game belt and I love that I love that that's his marketing strategy he should really legitimately get a belt made up yeah baddest motherfucker in the game I'm sure something like old UFC belt UFC isn't using that old belt anymore come on you have a bet UFC baddest motherfucker in the game belt and just just just change the outside a little bit was he smoking weed for real yeah in the open workouts is he gonna get in trouble no no no it's totally legal in California and when you test you have to literally be high while you're fighting for you to test positive you saw it dropped it all way way down great well so many people use it to sleep so many people use it for pain relief spur ticularly with CBD when it's one to one this like these are these are one to one THC and CBD and they think that it's actually more effective for both it actually comes you down a little bit with the CBD along with the THC so it may it might actually alleviate some anxiety that's associated with getting too high wouldn't that make sense because that's how it comes in the plant right is like both parts well yeah yeah I guess except is I think CBD it doesn't come in as big so to get one in one you know okay you know you smoke a joint how much CBD you're smoking I have no idea I have no clue do you even get CBD when you just smoked it you have never heard of CBD until it wasn't in the joint anymore yeah myself well T THC is one of many many cannabinoids right isn't there like 19 of them or something crazy like that does that what is jam 18 yeah that's I think the plant itself is what's magic it's a crazy goddamn plant that we're finally getting to appreciate and still there's a lot of places where you still have to buy hemp from Canada like large-scale hemp production hasn't really like caught on with a good percentage of his country so I used to be looking to one the major crops that people would grow you can make clothes out of it you could eat it it makes this shit called a hemp creep it's like this is the same ly durable concrete that's made with hemp it's a fuckin nutty plant man it really is like the stock of a hemp tree like my friend Todd McCormick had one sitting on his desk once and you pick it up it's like what is this from another world it's hard like coke hard but light is balsa wood light is styrofoam wait does that have any different than weed no no I mean there's just the difference is hemp is not psychoactive it's like a psychoactive form of the same sort of kind of plants but regular marijuana also is hemp right because what hemp is is the fibers so what we're using to get high is the buds rather stems all the other leaves and shed but the fiber of the plan itself is insanely durable and really light and that's the shit they turn into clothes into string into all this into paper canvas the first canvas was made with hemp all that stuff that's why I was can that then the word cannabis or canvas comes from cannabis that's that's why it's called canvas but they did everything with him but it's just hard to do manly stuff to beat it down like the slave labor most of the time and then the nineteen thirty some dude came up with something called a decor Decatur it is a machine where you could effectively process the hemp fiber and that's when they started going crazy with the reefer madness shed it was all in economics uh-huh jazz everybody was already doing it I mean that was that was something that was a normal thing with people it was it wasn't until they decided to make it illegal but it became this weird fucking thing that nobody could nobody could do something that they've been doing for so long before where they made aren't they making mushrooms and acid legal somewhere in the day and by the way there were a me Oh judge fucking heavyweight champ of the world is called sorrow shit named Robin yeah he looks very good one fuck with a crazy fight wow did I read that somewhere there may be their doughnut maybe I mean that guy who's like a rocky movie just to change yeah the turn and that fight was so crazy look DC's my very good friend I love him to death I love that guy it's hard it's hard watching a friend that you really love his ass kicked and that's what happened he was looking great yeah he was really great he was look he's he's an awesome person man I love that dude and doing commentary with him it's the most hilarious fun time he's such a good guy it's great commentary he's very very articulate and smart he's one of the bests that does it and uh yeah dude it sucks it's just you see that you see the pain on his face when he loses a fight he does not like losing he is not doesn't but needed a steep you know I mean and this is what that's what it's all about those two guys I have deep respect for Steve Bay - I've been I was saying forever that I thought it was fucked up that he was not gonna get a title shot not gonna get a rematch and said they're gonna have him fight Brock Lesnar I'm like the is supposed to be steep a he was the most successful heavyweight ever won four title fights won the title and then defended it three times no one's ever done that before right so that was the Giant in the guys he beat were fucking really good it's not just prime it'd be one thing if you said you know he got knocked out in the first round so we're gonna give the first crack to this number one contender who's like on it on a tear something but to just say Brock Lesnar yeah because this is a big it was it was the most naked example of this is just for pay-per-view buys that kind of sucks for for eBay yeah it sucks for Steve back and I'm glad it didn't didn't happen I'm glad that steep a got his chance because just out of respect for the sport and respect for the the true champions of the sport like doesn't matter what marketability or not that guy is a the best champion that's ever been in the game he's the best heavyweight champion of all time so like did not recognize that and not like that should be a big deal no I agree do people that should be the fight but the money of the Brock Lesnar fight would have been so immense of your company that makes entertainment this is why it's kind of like the UFC in some ways there's a marriage of entertainment and of sport that has to be yeah I mean the people are the ones who are buying the paper who's in shape for it so yeah and what's good for the goose is good for the gander because you get Brock Lesnar to come on a card you get massive massive eyes on it and then you get you know every time you do that there's a percentage of people who stay fans and become hardcore fans and tell people about it and there's there's real value there for everybody so yeah but the heavyweight championship of the world it's supposed to be the most prestigious and you don't see that in any other sport where a guy will you know be coming off a loss before years removed you know test positive for steroids and then just get a title shot yeah and yeah that's a way of putting it yeah that does a good very good point what I want to see more even than the DC thing I want to see Francis and gun or steep a two because Francis and Gahan who just destroyed Kane and Junior dos Santos who if you guys remember just a few years ago those were the guys that's the heavyweight division and he just destroyed both of them he looks like he got his confidence back he looks like you know like I want to see that rematch yeah I'm uh I'm terrified for everybody who gets in the Octagon every time he fights somebody I'm like yeah cuz I remember I remember I still have like shell-shocked for watching Alistair Overeem get hit with that left hook I remember that was the hardest knockout I've ever seen I remember Ken like no one's gonna survive that it looked like the back of Alistair Overeem's had touched his ankles I was like no one everyone's going out from that everyone's going out called that's the heavyweights you have to like have so much respect because it's like holy shit dude like you're getting in there and it's just like at any moment you're just gone you know I mean I'd rather fight a heavyweight then like 135 pounder though just to be a thousand times in the head that's the punch bro there should be a t-shirt like just a silhouette it's interesting you say that with DC where you're like I just know in like in as like as little as we know Mickey Gaul as much like we've been friends with him for a short amount of time even like when he fights there's some different like stakes on it as a buddy you're like and you don't see that ally and you're calling it like you can't like put my chart for me when cowboy fights I root against this bar actually really hard when Brendan was finding I was hard cuz I'm real tight with him mm-hmm we're really good friends and when he wasn't really doing it anymore he was still in it but he wasn't really like a hundred percent end he was thinking about other things he was thinking about when he gets out it wasn't it didn't have the same focus and intensity and training as used to that's hard that's not the sport to do that ya know it's hard whenever you thinking about getting out get out get out because there's people that aren't thinking about get now and you got to think about what we were talking about earlier Mike Tyson is prime angry at everything like if you're thinking about getting out and you run in front of a guy like that you know or a girl like that there's this female kick boxers that are like that too they're just fucking vicious man and they're waiting you think you're half in half out thinking about cheerleading Wham chin to the face you know you gotta be saying at the end Brendon could have been beaten by a woman yes am i following you crap the fucking highest levels of any combat sport you have to be all in I don't think I don't think that's something you could dabble in it's a hard thing that because I think in MMA like you know luckily brendan is a you know podcaster comedian I think a lot of other guys they don't have the same but they could do other stuff like tyron woodley is rapping tyron woodley as businesses I know he's doing something with CBD I know God he did a record with Wiz Khalifa I know he does a lot of TMZ stuff we he's a funny dude I think you have to become the ally look tyrants smart champion though it's like that he has a huge news but he still he's working see he lost his title to Iran but yet he's still doing all these other things of course but I think it's easier when you when you have that name you're a former UFC champion I think that alone will probably sort of set you up as long as you're not officially idiot for the rest of your life but they're guys that never get to that very very top and if they don't sort of set themselves up for afterwards they're gonna you know when you think about get down you're like shit do the reason they take those fights what was that one documentary I saw where the guy was like you've got like crazy brain injuries and his family was just like - don't take another fight and he still had to take it he's had to pay the bills and it was just like there was just no other option he was like barely making money at a gym so that's the thing where it's like is a sport where you're all in and then once the kind of shit hits the fan it reminds with comedy cuz like it takes minimum five to ten years to figure out if you're gonna even be good enough to do it professionally right and then at that point it's your whole life this is why you never see people quitting nobody quits do you see a lot of people with it maybe they start it like 20 and like by 30 they're 10 years in and if it's not working out for you you took the 10 years when you were supposed to be figuring out where the trajectory of like everyone you knew from high school figured out a job got a house got matter what have you age that now because in you could do comedy for six months and have a youtube video that makes you where you can make 25 grand on a Sunday doing it one Sunday show at an improv but have you watched that guy's YouTube channel that doesn't happen to us not that rare I think it's rare that there's you know guys are doing comedy for six months that are made no six much you're sure the extreme example yeah for sure it should mean anything to us no no it doesn't say I'm just making a point that it's not really there's so many alternate now yeah but I'm saying even when Lewis said like I agree technically in like the the the growth of someone like 10 years in they've got their legs under them a good Nick now they can start figuring out what their directions gonna be exactly and find their market that's how you become a go home great comic hopefully you know but like you can get popular and have to work under the pressure of a sold-out theater at three years in the comedy that is crazy that's crazy I couldn't I couldn't Charlie might possibly imagine that doing to you Charlie Murphy did it even more insane way he was famous first yeah and then he became an open mic er that's that's got to be challenged a lot sold out shows all he practices all he's doing giant shows right where everybody's coming to see him and Donnell and all these other Donald's like kill her by the way yeah he's going up with like monsters in the Chappelle show Jeremy Piven hello Jeremy Piven Brendan Brendan was a star when he started doing comedy he was already known very now yes he's already known as a UFC fighter yeah but what Charlie Murphy did was do like these sold-out fucking shows and he was practicing yeah like you mean I don't think I don't know how much time he spent before he went up on stage the first time like knowing that he was gonna do stand-up what was the only it was also famous from the Chappelle show and from two of the greatest comedy sketches ever done that Dave Chappelle was acting out for him and they were so funny and so that his biography any expectation when you go in is like I'm going to see like the greatest comedian in the country and he's doing like his third set that's that's crazy comedy is the only art form that you practice in front of the audience there's nothing else to you hand you have to the only way to do it is to practice your doubts painters apartment and watch them everyone else gets to master their craft by themselves in a fuck whatever it could be mixed martial arts in a gym it could be in a garage or in a band whatever it is everyone else gets to figure it out but we from moment one is this naked thing we're like alright well I mean and it's so douchey I think back to the first time like what fuckers have an asshole would even give it a shot officer Stein it's like going hey I just wrote this song today and they got well fucking sucks we just go at the end of it go yeah you played as long you can make a song in a vacuum I mean you can those guys who have created the most amazing fucking songs and then they like let you play them or let you listen to them and you're like whoa like how long you guys been working on this so you have friends that are in a band you know for months like holy shit yeah they could do it all and put it together from start to finish without anybody else involved other than the producers and now no we can't do that no we can't anybody tries it's crazy did something this mean somebody tried to a studio stand-up album didn't some what no well there was this but Carmichael directed remodels that's right did the no no audience know I show yeah everyone trying to not shit under Michael I was quite confused it was confusing but what do you do you're drew Michael your young comic ten years in HBO okay I gotta do it fuck I gotta do it truck wants to produce it no audience without no way you could feel anything other than weird doing stand-up that you used to doing in front of an audience - no audience you would be fighting feeling weird the entire time you're talking because you know you're there's no one there so you just talk into a camera audiences watching to be honest with you needs a laugh track the reason lap tracks exists on TV shows is because the the audience sometimes it's need to be told that here's the moment Mike Curb Your Enthusiasm doesn't have a laugh track it's when the funny shows ya know if you need the it's not the laugh track it's what's the energy that creates just that you're watching like this before you're part of something everyone's like yours will be laughing along with them yeah like laughing if a guy if if drew Michael came to you in person and started saying those funny things to you like with that tone you'd be like this is uncomfortable a from you dude you feel weird you feel we hit a punch on the go it's like just you and him is too it's too intimate right you're not even but it's not your when you do in stand about you and one person like right who the fuck would ever talk like that the moment works and for the large people so you're taking something that only works in front of groups of comedians store and the guy working there is looking at you like you're not gonna book why are you saying it like I says but stand-up comedy is not just talking it is using the pauses and using the timing using the moments where they're supposed to laugh there's so much more to it than just saying the jokes you know that that's the sign of where you go if like I just don't as an experiment I get it that's like a YouTube video I get it but as your first big special I would want there to be an audience there yeah oh yeah yeah probably upset but I think garage is just a creative guy in the end this idea and just they just ran with it I heard he wants to do one where himself you see is the Aziz one or Spike Jonze on stage and they filmed it where Italy could see like the back people mulling around in the back I found it distracting distracting just I didn't understand why that would be a good idea oh you don't this isn't like you happen to be filming we up in the film Aziz working out here and you see a bunch of people in the background but it doesn't matter the material is good you'll enjoy this well there's no yeah this is a fuck you're intentionally making it with if you want to accommodate if you want have concept to the thing or concept like kind of bookend the show like the show it seems like it's all like hey look over here to be like I really didn't have like a an hour I'm super happy with I'm not even I haven't seen the material of it - no I'm not saying Aziz it's not a good hour I just feel like when you're throwing flow I would want less fluff that's a draw - draw - like hey listen to these jokes like please don't pay attention that like we have the first ever overhead 3d camera flick on the shot Mike Jones so I think you don't get it I think it's one of those things where it's like a man I'd love you if she directed it and he'd be like okay but I want to do something different right and then you're like I trust you you're a master at what you do I'm a master when I do let's collaborate and I get it it was like when uh Steve Jobs he'd the the first Apple logo he just paid two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for and the deal was he didn't get any revisions he got to like have a conversation about what he wanted to feel and then this weird fucking artist went and created the logo and was like here it is that's that okay that's it may or may not use your fuckin successful yet we don't even have a logo for fifty dollars if I like it you create a logo for my company what's it called Apple that in six minutes in thing that divides this country more than right left it might be Android versus iPhone yeah but people aren't like boycotting businesses over it no do not but the people look down on people with Android phones they sure do it's amazing why I tear less than it's just one of those things it's like if you have an iPhone you're in and if you have an Android phone you're on that other fuckin team it's just like the bare minimum if you don't have an iPhone you you're a fucking loser yeah that's what it is like I was an Android guy for years and I used to I used to be different who gives a shit and then I got an iPhone I was like oh the it's the difference is just the way your fingers I don't it's a sleek just from going from one piece one thing to the next if you're opening up attacks you're going to a phone everything is just very seamless and it's smooth and it feels very natural very nice and Android because so many different people use that sort of Android platform it's always clunky and it's not exactly the same so it never feels as smooth once you get used to your iPhone that's that yeah I agree better very successful people that stick by Android yeah most Android phones are pretty fucking smooth if you if you picked up like galaxies whatever yes like a galaxy s10 does a smooth fucking phone man those things are as good as anything there's a bunch of phones now on the side of Android that rival or are better than iPhones you know some of the technologies are 10 the note 10 that just came out is there one that's not Android or iPhone that's like dope that people just don't know about that's like other operating system which is really weird it's like yeah yeah you have three operating systems you have you know iPhones you have Android and there's still a few people that have Windows phones please blackberry I was it I think that's a joke well I don't know that's a gag text him it goes blue he's got a fucking iPhone or he's got multiple phones phony asshole I talked about one time he does have it but he doesn't like use it oh okay yeah he's got it I think it was a joke though okay I think he really did miss those little well if you had a blackberry back in the day the things that people you knew where everything was yeah buttons where you could text pretty quick that little ball would break it was so fucking annoying yeah that thing would break but uh the difference between down an iPhone it's pretty substantial but the difference between iPhones and Android is not substantial anymore but don't you like like nice rating systems pretty fucking alive a phone I can't go back I just know it I don't want to relearn a new phone is now some Steve Jobs is gone that iPhones catching up on the technology to Android androids are getting a lot of things you go look what my iPhone does now some of those Android goes but we've had generations of that would be that they wait until the technology is out and all the bugs are knocked out of it and then they give you a superior version of it yeah that's the hard everything I mean look it's the most successful company in the fucking history of the known universe they have it shit fuck tons of cash I can't believe they didn't get like the folding phone first I don't think that things worth a fuck I could molding I couldn't guess it's weird origami how about just give me this this is a good shape you feel stuff yeah they're just constantly we got to figure out how to consider we really do you're brick yeah roll it up like a little like a fortune cookie worried about is the Elan must think the neuro-link hearing about that I'm not sure what's app to integrating computers with your fucking brain that's yeah it's gonna happen right if it's not this Elon Musk's thing doesn't do that then the next thing will but the the ultimate goal is gonna be we're gonna have pieces in our body what's the name the wording some computers what the word of like merging with the the body's a cyborg yeah well that's true to singularity is in July that's what that's what I was the singularity is what they think would be the ultimate technological innovation that radically transforms mankind and they move that number around and I think the singularity they think for artificial intelligence there was a symposium in New York a few years back that Ari and I and Duncan Trussell went to it was like the 20 I think it was like 2045 that's when they think their thing at 2045 these things are gonna go alive and they'll be robot just like ex machina type people walk it around with us oh for sure I mean I think I heard part of the conversation you over the Elan musk and it was one of the most interesting things because for a while I was going yeah dude if you just put your phone down people don't really give us you got a supermarket people aren't arguing about politics but eventually what's going to happen is the phones are gonna be in our fucking brains and you're never gonna be able to put the phone down and it's gonna be that's the world we live in where we were just at war and that's where it's fucking scary that's what I don't like about we jump in too quick to hasn't already been like a whole bunch of like self-driving car accident terrible things happen but way more human accidents yeah it's better it's more human accidents per amount of cars though do you know I'm saying like self-driving cars really a you're not supposed to just sit there you're supposed to hold on to the wheel I keep a hand on the wheel it makes you do that you can't just drive it it doesn't just you can't just sit back it needs you to be engaged okay so it's a little Duvall who just takes videos of him like taking a nap and smoking joints out the window you're not involved at all so can you get that like blocked for the sensors like to take a more common sensor type something you do that's actually like a iPhone mount like a cell phone mount and it sits on the handle and it keeps pressure on the handle so the handle thinks that you're holding on to the handle and you have your iphone take that robots and iPhone holder so they sell it as an iPhone holder but really what it is is something that squeezes on the handle but they can't sell it is that because that would be illegal it should be illegal goddamn good that thing that but eventually you know drive shit eventually I weigh more trust auto drive I trust them to be able to come up with the technology where they have everything on perfect grids where we all get in our cars and the absolute fastest way for us to get from point A to point B is already mapped out traffic all that shit that that's not that crazy I feel like that that has to be within you know 20 30 years changes lanes and everything oh yeah yeah it changes lanes did it blow your mind the first few are not highway that's coming oh that's probably just give you the experience in a chip 3d hologram lady appears and starts blowing deals like it's real but nothing's this Whitney Houston you celebrities remember have they made the future in 80s movies though where the dick-sucking car would actually be like a hose would come out of the ground that would be the feel look at the my mouth hose did you really trust that mouth well I watched I watched Total Recall recently which is like you know the new one or the old not total recall the one the running man oh wow and it was like when he was holding the girl hostage she was in the house like let's look up what flights around it's just such obviously Qatari graphics on the screen that's at the year 2050 the music really has good ideas of what the features can be even Minority Report when they're moving stuff around the screen like maybe maybe someday but no one's done anything where you go wow that would be amazing if your house that was it for the Apple thing though is that Apple tries to make their stuff live up to what they made like 1950 space movies but everything's like very like metal metallic and sleek looking and the uniform the packaging as well do I Apple's a great company they really are but when you open up an iPhone or an Apple product the packaging they it has a bear thing where it lifts naturally and it's all based off the experience like when you open it you you go I've never opened another product like this and if they do that on purpose and it's this subconscious thing that they fucking put into your mind and that's why you go dude just I don't know what it is dude iPhone I can't put my finger on it's white chicks buy expensive bags yeah same thing that cool yeah lasts forever if you write though if you write a lot and type a lot to the shittiest they're fucking gear cords are dog shit the new ones they're quickly clickety clickety there's no travel there's clickety clickety clickety clickety and shit get stuck in them and they're trying to figure out how to fix that my students part doesn't work on my Apple so I've copied the space so whenever I write after this is not comfortable for typing on like the whole like how much fucking thinner does it have to be Jesus Christ I know you guys are trying to make them thin but make them so they're comfortable to type on yeah just make it thicker like what just make it it doesn't have to be that big old keyboard is the most comfortable thing the old school the thing that we love but I think it's because we learned how to type on that no it's because they're mechanical your fingers feel the tactile sensation of pushing in those Springs so as I click click click your fingers know where the keys are when you don't get into any feedback you make a lot of errors like it's not as easy it takes a long time to get accustomed to that short travel keyboard that you get on those really thin Mac books I have a 2015 MacBook I want it got an old one refurbished because I hate the fucking new keyboard it's like I don't know what I'm touching yeah that's not it's not moving it's so so shallow but I think that do you not have an IBM or a nothing IV I mean the Novo think path that thing is like the old IBM ThinkPads with the lenovo bought the company and now they make them they you feel the keys it's like as you're typing you know each they have like 1.5 millimeters of travel which is like I bet you clickety click next time I'm gonna me and Joe we're gonna have typing competition I think I could I have never make no mistakes with my new Apple it's fine I think once you're used to it you're used to it I think you need to let yourself go to the new technology I'd use both of them but I like the typing way better on the Lenovo it's just there's this is not like just me this is a big thing that people who write a lot say is a you want something that has a lot of key travel because 1.5 you know preferably maybe even 1.8 no I mean or something like that when you're doing that you you get a real good feel of where the keys are you don't you also feel like you've hit the but you know you've hit the button see this feedback and you don't think about what I find is that I'm writing on one of those things I don't think about the keys as much as I just I'm concentrating on writing or like otherwise I'm like oh that that little extra thing we got to look down oh I fucked up and I hit that instead of that that doesn't happen as much I'll be less how offer you guys washing your keyboards I feel bad every time my son touches my computer board cover and they use that doesn't blast thing is great oh yeah I don't use any of that just blow and come right out of your circuit board roast your fucking kitchen tables gross every ass gross I know you think about like homeless people touching guard rails it's like you go and touch that like ah the subway the subway rails must be just oh it's brutal few more times I've done this in New York City like I'll be going to put on my hand on the hand I just don't touch ham rails anymore I make sure that my son does in but I've just been putting my hand down the rail and then I just pick up a booger like a human booger my week the story just ruined my something about other dudes boogers it's there's no way that would that would end my day and your own kids book my son's nose in a heartbeat it's just a random different though yeah that's your own son I mean he's six now you should stop yeah but definitely stop picking his nose how old is it when you'd be really concerned if your son is still sucking their thumb how many years in shit wanted to do wait until you confirm and they go okay well now I know my son never sucked his thumb so yeah like have you got a kid though if you had a boy I have a girl should love sucking thumb you don't have any kids I got a 8 month old oh you didn't know you were out there breeding I am congratulations now you become even more libertarian correct yeah but not my baby I make the decisions there don't let babies call the shots now it'll be just sugar and guns teach a baby how to shoot a gun the baby could actively shoot a gun like you know I'm what much of a fucking giant problem that would be like if a baby was just like - you know I'm feeling like I'm not enough of a libertarian yeah because here's a gun go homestead some land their body can't really hold a gun and shoot it right it would go flying there's no way but if they could do you know how what a great time they would think it would be right they love it the projectiles my son is there's nerve guns that's why I know he's not gay he loves to shoot things get a lot of gay people to chew things no that's all right no he's not good like he kept shooting his friend in the face what do you think about bears and then he was fighting the bullets in his book if you had a bunch of bears that you couldn't take them out to like shotgun range and shoot clay pigeons there's like 50 minutes for this our fucking each other oh my god they're guys they're just guys with like guys they got the wacky the gay kids that I grow I'm sure yes there are gay guys who like to do doodly dude things right oh definitely but but doodly dude you know I mean how many gay friends you have there like we should really go shooting guns right now let's go hunt I bet there's a buddy you wanna shop and that's fine yeah they do they want to go them but isn't it like girls like there's girls that are like woodsy girls girls want to live in the woods and shit yeah I think these are exceptions if you're a gay like mountainy guy and you're another mountainy guy probably in heaven all right life this is it's also pretty hot gay mountainy guys alone just fucking bolting down the door before they but fuck look at this you know yeah sure the neighbors don't know what so are you fellas brothers and sisters yeah what brother and brother what's going on they run a seasonal marina and then they just suck and fuck in the offseason yeah you go down the road where those two homos live yeah there's a couple of whatever a couple of how do you do is living in the old fishing house don't get me wrong great guys all they do is chop wood in but fuck that was a the bagel balls guy I would he said that he goes I got a problem with gay people just don't touch me you know especially in the private area then we have the problem I go is that what your life's worried about you don't wanna hang out and I gave you books our properties gonna start grabbing viciously at your dick do you think that guys he's gonna stick in there he's gonna be like Joe the Plumber or do you things gonna have some legs to him I think this is gonna Lenny Dykstra's gonna knock he's five-ten he's a former I know he's like got alcohol problems and shit but he's got those big hands I see arrested the other day he's gonna hit the bagel boss he was fighting bagel boss yeah it's terribly like she was you know older now but I mean he's Lenny Dykstra he's a lunatic he's only 55 so I'm like that yeah he looks like 70 but he's he's still a fucking stalk he do maybe like four foot eight he's I mean if I was the face for it he's really small there's no chance don't you've seen that guy I see went to one of someone's MMA gym he was hanging out with a bunch of fighters and he's throwing punches and and dancing around the ring I think I want to say Matt Serra was it Matt Serra Chris Weidman yeah the Milan guy yeah so he was out there he's not like he doesn't have a background in martial arts like you could tell no yeah it's over this is really fight he's also a shape it's a shape and he's a tiny little fella quite like a butterfly sting like a butterfly there's no yeah there's no good there's no learning how to fight getting in shape doing it all like yeah he's too small yeah Lenny that sure looks like he's been in a bunch of fistfights er you used to be like that arrested light was Jack datapoint his life I mean like shredded you're losing that strength you're not gonna even if he's out of shape even if he's he's still a strong like bulky guy sure kill them heavy he's a fucking pro there's no way there's no integrity in a celebrity boxing no I don't know if you could bet like a zillion top yeah that's him now so I said he's up he's only 55 that's crazy no he told her that isn't he is maybe a little bit older he's older I just looked it up the other day it's me he's not that old he was a legit wild man yeah but he was that right there he looks like my cab yeah he was fucking that guy was a legit wild man look at that lady die try indicted for drugs threats following arrest in May yeah uber driver he was high on ecstasy and coke and gotta argue mother's uber driver and then threatened is like when the cops come yeah yeah the cops come and they're like yeah this guy's thing is great for his life he's like what play so innocent it's hilarious that's fine and then they start checking his bag and he starts freaking out about them going through his bag 56 yeah Wow wow I thought he was older than that even he's damn living them hard years son ahead of celebrity fight Lenny Dykstra says bagel boss has one inch penis that was outrageous click on that please the world we live in Lenny Dykstra went on Howard Stern and did like uh he said like he had girls come on to say how good eats pussy and they were like swearing then they were staring there was a comics rock comedians from LA and then the comedian's immediately just used it for like a credit and that's just debunked his whole thing so he flew them in for nothing oh that's funny it's crazy that he's gonna hit that little guy cuz it's so so wrong I guess I wonder if he is going down quick yeah I in celebrity boxing it and it doesn't usually get too brutal I think you know I think the I think what's a hunch him once and it might kill Bonaduce used to go for it help you Hecky doesn't help you at all hey you sometimes makes it worse because you got all this extra weight and your head snaps more yeah yeah if you get headgear on that's more shit that you have to control like one of the things about having a strong neck is when you get punched you can kind of control your head from moving around too much some guys can take it better but if you have a headgear on it's like extra weight and your brain sloshes around inside your head I mean it protects you from cuts more than anything you know this is there's an argument that it protect you from cuts but the protecting you from the thud because it's not it's the fucking rocking of your brain you know like it's in some ways it's it's a real mixed bag in some ways it's better to have that gear on cuz it is a little more cushioning but other ways like it's beautiful I was surprised you did that but you're like it's fuck well I didn't want to fight with the head guy try to change it at the end because I started sparring with it and it's fucking sucks dick dude you can't breathe you can't see that you can't see when you start grappling you start feeling like you're being smothered right all right no matter what as soon as they touch your head you feel like the starts moving up in your face so I tried to get them to take it off and they wouldn't and then my headgear broke like in the first minute of the fight and they're like I fucking take it off because it was the shit you know so we both took off our headgear and I was like where's the rule yeah yeah here's a tricky thing you know it's like they think that about football helmets too that they would actually be a safer game if they couldn't clash heads with a helmet on that they wouldn't do it they wouldn't play like that that's just not true but the idea is that the only reason why they play that way is because the helmets in the foot shoulder gear yeah I took that stuff away they wouldn't play like that they had any pads and you know 30s or 40s or whatever when they were done with those little tiny helmets throw that game if you were an outsider like if you didn't know how big it was like if you didn't understand anything about the cultural significance football and they showed you all the brain damage and they showed you what it is you'd be like oh yeah make that illegal yeah probably if anything should be illegal stop doing that kids yes yeah it run into each other don't smash heads that's crazy the defensive offensive line just the idea as a Susie Seco just clunk heads from another you know we don't want it to be illegal and it's a fun thing to watch and it's a great way for some guys to make a fuckload of money and weigh the risks versus the rules yeah but then a bunch of middle schoolers are snapping their necks and my kid will never play football oh yeah I can't stop they could then they could legalize MMA with that it's because we punching and kicking is so inherently violent that's we see it as being this violent act right that it's we go oh shit fighting that's like crazy that's the most violent sport but it's so much less of a dangerous sport than football football these guys are just running headfirst at each other and every one of them every one of them has major major issue also get blindsided in football you know you'll have your eye on someone and then you get head to head taken out from someone else that doesn't happen as much an MMA but I mean when people get like head kick knocked unconscious that's not good for your brain now where's being concussed and then they get up and they just do it again again again well they're a little bit stricter I think unlike if you get a concussion that they they won't put you back in at least the way they used to like when I was a kid but it's still I think fighters are what getting concussed once every if you know once a year if they're getting knocked out once a year I mean you know but this also sub-concussive jaw which seems to be the problem with CTE it's not just those knockouts it's just the thumps over and over again over and over and over and training sparring these guys I think that's the real problem that's why also soccer players are getting it right the players are starting to get CT so waiting what's worse like getting like a Conor McGregor one punch knockout or fighting Nick Diaz and just getting like for five rounds probably you probably better off getting one punch knockout either better than you probably better off getting drop getting beat up by Nick Diaz 4:15 wasn't the initial argument about MMA being safer than boxing is that it's not so much so you know what the gloves being bigger in boxing and all that stuff that's actually worse because you're gonna keep taking too much down as well you can get knocked down and then get up and go right at your beacon costume like right keep on fighting we're gonna have a man stop it if you're not defending yourself so that's probably definitely better yeah the thing about eight counts and ten councillor but people have gotten off the deck and had amazing performances so you'd ever want to stop it like look at Tyson Fury gets off the deck twice against tiant a while in MMA that fight would have been stopped right right so it's like one of those things particularly the last round when he dropped them he would definitely punched him a few times he would have been out cold because he was flat yeah yeah I was back in MMA that would be the end of the fight and we are lucky it wasn't because he got up like a fucking superhero and even won the rest of the round he outbox him for the rest around he survived the initial barrage and then started catching him as he was coming in as Deonte was being reckless he caught him one time like stung him you know like holy shit he's winning this round now that he's winning the rest of the round after getting almost obliterated there's an argument that that's better the crazy thing of value but the crazy thing from the CTE like perspective about boxing to me is that your people will get hit and then they get hit and grab someone cuz that's just everyone's instinct and they grab them and then you have a little referee goes no no no no keep keep punching like don't do anything to avoid from it now I'm gonna step it back again and then they and that in MMA you'll see a lot someone get hit and then you know they get into a clinch and you get a few minutes in a clinch where they're kind of like okay I'm not taking edge right now but the smart thing about that is that's how you're supposed to fight like you're giving people options defend themselves it shouldn't be you can't defend yourself other than punching back that seems kind of crazy like but I could grab them and just stop these punches no no against the rules what kind of rules do we have like you can only beat me up if I let you beat me that was one of the points and dance around for a half hour do you remember the original there's like Gracie videos that they'd make it early you have Swayze in action yeah and what they used to say all the time was and it's so true was so interesting is that if two boxers just have a street fight they're going into a clinch and it's probably gonna end up on the ground at some points I'm late because the ref has to break up a clinch over and over and over again to make boxing happen like even when even when you're a professional boxer and you don't know anything about wrestling your grappling you still end up grabbing the other guy because that's just like the only time that doesn't take place is when one guy knows how to strike and the other guy doesn't and you see a lot of those videos online where two dudes decide to get into some sort of a street altercation and one guy actually is like a boxer hey clap and he catches the guy and the guy falls and bounces his head off a concrete alcohol there's a bunch of those yeah that's bad that's different see the thing about the Gracie jiu-jitsu is like you got to always be aware there's people like that out there there's there's always guys who can punch you in the face and if they know how to wrestle too and they can keep you away and just keep punching you in the face you better know how to take them down you just don't know dude fuck to 2019 you have no shit look at their ears you look a little signs like you look in their eyes skinny necks aren't getting choked they as far as a skill like definitely yeah you don't know weird time for fighting you know it's like and we I like both kinds I like just stand-up only fights I like watching those and I like mixed martial arts fights but I think like Terrance Crawford's coming on next and I think watching someone like him box like when you see the skill level that that guy has switches stances doing all kind of befuddling people getting their range figuring them around and then just teeing them up with perfect timing like that's almost only possible that kind of artistry if there's no wrestling right there's no leg kicks if there's only the boxing that's the only way see that like that that kind of like beautiful accommodate because otherwise you would do other shit too you know you would leg kick you try to take them down and that so like the level of dominance that a real Floyd Mayweather a real world champion boxer has with their hands it's hard to really appreciate until you see it live and you know like what you're seeing like if you're in the building with a guy lights beating somebody up on there sparring it's like yugioh oh look at this you guys are playing two totally different games we have boxing it's like I literally look at boxing as like very much a sport and I think MMA is the closest thing that we have to competitive fighting 100% that's sort of like the difference it's you know all things considered it's still a fighting you can't grab somebody's fucking balls and yank him off their body to bite their nose I know these are be able to enjoy the jousan who got you couldn't bite and you couldn't I couch hit him with a fucking trash can fishhook but you used to be able to punch the balls there was a fucking great video of Keith Hackney fighting Joe song no song got it got him in a headlock and Keith acnes just hammering his dick I mean full blow over and over over and over and you see like Joe sounds like going in shock he takes a few of them and he's like I'm not letting go of this joke North v dick punch it's like this is all over man it's over that was drained was he who was was a chemo he head-butting hoist Gracie yeah that was fucking brutal brutal there was a lot of head-butting back in the days it was an effective weapon and it makes us like oh that's awful but small finger locks but there are these other bones how come you're allowed to hit with these bones but you can't hit with that yeah also I would rather be head-butted by a guy that I don't ever say there's no there's not much technique in head-butting I would rather be head about it then be head kicked by dude who knows how to head kick you think there's no time but there really is there's guys that spar and they fight in less way and let the way is a type of Muay Thai where they put ropes over the knuckles that's the only thing they have and they're allowed headbutt and it's some wild ass shit and they do headbutt combinations on the pad like the tap tap bang they like use their head and train it Wow learn her TV and find that left way weit Lu th you know it does commentary for it is our friend Robin black he does uh he does commentary for less way but this is a brutal form of Muay Thai where you're allowed to headbutt because they already elbow and I think thick you know they're thinking well if I can mean funny yeah I could do all these things watching ahead but it's right there his fucking face is right there remember what uh what Mark Coleman used to do like he got fo you have season before the head boats were illegal dude he was he would smash people with the head butts so here look at this dude with this combination watch this so this is a Robin Robin black breakdown when he got this dude goes off to the side pushes the dudes heads away and then immediately comes in with a perfect headbutt boom just slamming him in the face on purpose with the top of his head so he's trying to hit like his eyes and his nose and the soft tissue he's trying to hit that with the hard part of his forehead well yeah they do a lot more damage than a fist I feel like a headbutt only works one out of every thousand times oh no no no this that guy does it a lot and if you do it this way the way he's doing it you're taking a really hard part of your forehead and you're smashing against a soft part of the eyes and the nose this part of your forehead is hard as fuck man most guys who break their hand and fights break their hands top of the head yeah that was especially boxing the team of tequila reality shows two guys were fighting over and that was the reality oh he broke his chin opened a thing like it separates his teeth he takes a headbutt to the mouth spitting out the Bloods not turning you ever see someone get covered the Bloods not turning red yet black do you like it yeah it's not just to splitting what happens in his jaw splits down the middle where you literally see his teeth separate because it's cracks in half like that it's the most horrific thing I've ever seen this vh1 by the way I saw that video classics a woman's fight really yeah yeah it was a Randy Couture's wife Kim KOTOR oh yeah she fought she got her jaw broken and it was separated and she went out and fought the next round Wow the jaw separate predator inside was moving around and then she had to get it wired up and and fixed after the fight was crazy in the sixth grade he was getting to a fist fight with his other kid and this other kid had brass knuckles and breath and was erected by him at like the mall when I was a kid martial arts I give it like butterfly knives nunchucks yeah flying stars yeah brass not like you could just go any stars that's 12 and by deadly weapons those little stores it would sell nunchucks sigh sighs all the time so this can't have brass knuckles and he fucking drilled this kid in the face and broke his jaw and for the whole school year I have Squier he had a have a wired jaw who should drinking chocolate milk at lunch every day he happen to tell the story Peter punched him he was a kid so it wasn't like juvie I was just like he got in trouble that's it yeah you got arrested no no I didn't get arrested didn't get harassed able to go to school together after that remove the it didn't happen at school it happened at a school I don't think that the kid who did I know the kid who did I don't think he went to the same say man sorry for hitting you with brass knuckles shut the math homework cool that's a B just that's terrifying that's where it's like you just don't want to fuck with people like well kids who get beat up at home - kids kids who get beat up other parents they're ready to beat people up of course it's becomes a part of your everyday life you're mad at people you hit them mad at people that are smaller than you you can get away with it you hit them you know I don't think people talk about that enough they talk about all the violence in the world and nobody's talking about the fact that since kids are toddlers they're being hit by the people that are supposed to protect the most and it fucks them up psychologically and it does something to them it's awful and it's a cycle right you hit your kids because your dad hit you and that's what made you the man you are today that kind of horse sure but it's so weird that it's the only relationship where if you bring up this topic people will justify hey yeah it's the only like no one will publicly justify hitting their chick or hitting their ground personally like you're attacking their parents right they take it like my mom's a good mom she you know I deserved it they'll tell you that I deserved it isn't it so weird that if anyone if you said publicly like you know that you give your girlfriend a slap if she acts the wrong way everyone would universally be like that is just pure evil but if you say the same thing to my two-year-old my three-year-old everyone's just kind of like what and then if you say if you grow if my man talks too much should I smack him in his face girls would be like you go girl yes that's true I'm on the fucking no but that's because the power dynamic is opposite right you know like but you're talking about though that's a serious problem of your dating support yes she's hitting me whatever her hands are the fucking real issue yeah week weekend she's gone huh out of the UFC yeah they fucked up that sucks they made a video where it made it look like Dana White yeah they just dr. you added words that he didn't say that was stupid so dumb do you think it was malicious everything was a legitimate mistake in terms of translating there's no way it could be anything other than stupid what whoever lives on purpose if it was done on purpose it was just a stupid idea that's all it is it's relation whatever it is whoever did it is just that's just a terrible error and it's really bad timing because she was almost uncuttable last year but now Amanda Nunez came and kind of took that juice and now it's like she's damaged goods if she decides to leave the EOC without a Nunez rematch she beats Nunez she gets it all back you know but she's go to one Fc she'd go to Bellator she'd go to a lot of places and she'd still be welcomed with open arms she's a walk down the street and gets a huge pop star like like she shows up with those away in shows and like the crowd flocks there I remember just thinking that about her I saw her one time and there was a garden show and just sat in like the front row of the UFC at the garden and the place was like look I'm so excited for just like turning around waving her she was the first like female terminator Gina Carano watching her beat up Gina Carano gives me nightmares so this is crazy fight in the end of it when there's a photo that we played on this podcast before of her cyborgs hand palming Gina's head with black fingernails and she's punching her in the face at the same time she's holding her head slamming her fist in the face like I want out Janna's Gina was queen when it was like three minute rounds they all fought three-minute rounds back then for women yeah yeah half tops you know she was taking some stuff you know for sure I'm sure yeah yeah sure oh that's part of the issue and Darrell is it positive for some stuff it's you know that's part of what it is that's part of what it is the build-up to the Gina Carano fight was when she choked out the news guy right those are that wasn't kind of viral was her I got a news guy being like to put her in like a rear naked choke and shake choked him unconscious comes back to its extreme weird I want to do it and then he was like you could you could do it's fine and then he just looks on but it was one those bans on gas or you get up into make noises believe that they're really gonna go out like that they don't believe they're gonna go out so quick yeah I learned in the sixth grade we used to do the thing where he would hyperventilate yeah yeah yeah so you bend over okay and then he's breathe really heavy for like a minute as far as hard as you can and come up really fast you're already lightheaded then your friend puts his hands his palms on your carotid arteries and just presses kind of light and then within three seconds you just slide down the wall whoa it was my first time ever got high yeah but your friends will let you fall and hit your fucking head yeah I can head off a curve you gotta catch'em I don't think that's necessarily that bad for you but it's definitely not good for you it's especially when you're yeah 11 Vil opeing developing your own yeah it's probably shouldn't do it yeah don't be choking out but it's it happens all the time in the gym and no one no one stops I think it choked unconscious they wake up and they go back to rollin again and they the way they talk about it like it's a garden hose the garden hose shuts off the power to the brain and everything's fine but I'm like man you ain't a doctor show me some long-term Studies on dudes who've been choked unconscious mobile talk show me a doctor making garden hose analogy call me a bitch I'll tap quick I'm not going unconscious man yeah stop that's silly I don't want ya going unconscious thing who knows what that's doing you going to the Netherlands you might come back a totally different person a totally different you come back with a false memory of the past since then since I was knocked out that happens to guys because when they get hit and knocked out when they come to they do not know what happened and they have to be reminded over and over and over again ax I mean it must feel like you woke up or ever mentioned like it must feel surreal well this spring told me a story after the Danny Anderson fight he literally had no idea what happened it was like he had no idea where he was he didn't even thought he thought his fight was a few weeks out still yeah that's was scary shit he said uh Ben Askren was saying he has no memory of like anything in the arena after that so slow it was one of the worst knockouts of all time that amount of power that your flying knee has when you're ducking into it is accentuated because he's going in for the takedown and he's got a strong takedown right so he's going in with everything he has faced first and smashing into it running at him oh my god it's the hole that's the biggest impact I think I've ever seen as we're talking about football players crashing each other that's the moment of impact we're the dangerous thing about two football players crashing their bodies into each other is exactly that yeah and they super athletes creating that momentum I mean yes it's nuts how crazy is it to be undefeated never to lose to anybody and then that's your one like your one blemish is like the biggest not so much shit that it's suck because I like bow I'm a big fan he's really funny and then too he talked so much when you talk shit like that and then you fucking lose you got it he got it eat those words so he's marketing himself amazingly and then that's part of the marketing himself was like he has his own down-home version talking shit yeah you know even its bloom roasted things like you could tell it's like he's almost kind of playing a dufus character yeah but he's a very smart guy like I had him on the podcast and he sends me book recommendations and Chevys like a really well-read interesting guy he just that's his character and is in his part of the strategies to annoy the fuck out of you but when you flatline him like that after I know him annoying the fuck out of you you know what's that word schadenfraude house it wasn't word yeah was there just desserts what does that call yeah I don't know something like it's the what the pleasure that you feel from someone else uh-huh obvious demise right is that how they sounds right yeah is that it pleasure derived from another person's misfortune there you go that's what it is technique it's almost like in a weird way that's what he was trying to get mouths but all to do like go crazy so the takedowns are there yes but if it doesn't work out it goes very bad well Moskva doll just took that chance with that flying knee entry and he practiced it over and over and over again and he kind of knew with the way he circled see the way he circled he circled off to the side and then came out on that way well so he knew he would go at him with right eating into him that way and so it perfectly taught because he was coming out from the side he knew his gonna lean in that way but he also mouse was all said he was like I was I was real confident if he took me down I was gonna get back up and that does kind of demonstrate that like if you're real concerned about the takedown you're probably not gonna open with sprinting into a flying name which is funny cuz Maas Vidal's not even a dude who is known for being this unbelievable wrestler but first time I saw Maas Badal was an old-school Kimbo Slice Miami backyard fighting video oh yeah dude it's he came out and he fought this guy I think it was big ray it was a guy was like 230 pounds and it was George and it was like a hundred and eighty pounds and he came out he just boxes dude up and it was so bad like all the kids were follows like chickens running around a backyard it was so hardcore and then he ends up being so much I think Strikeforce a few years laters when I saw him in MMA and he's had a pretty crazy trajectory to be where he's at right now he is right on the cusp of being you know maybe if he were human the title he'd be one of the biggest stars in the sport he's one of the best motherfuckers in the sport for sure there's no doubt about it with everything he's super well-rounded he could do everything his takedown defense is amazing he's got some of the best hands in the division period I mean you look at him knock him out dare until with that leap in left hook the way the way he did it though he set it up he landed it earlier and then he landed again he figured it out he figured out a spot where this guy's open there's like this dip in what he does and he found that opening he's gotten better Riley he's definitely he's decimal something hated he's more dedicated you know and now he wants a big payday and so they're probably talking about doing that Nate Diaz he'll get a big payday out of that one that's a that's a big fight that fight will be you isn't it fucked up that who's mod is the one that almost out of all of the guys were talking about I'm least intrigued to watch fight next oh man I'm not I fuckin love watch that guy fight because he's got this marauding relentless style that's very similar to Colby's except he hits harder and he'll try to take people out or Kobe Kobe just keeps that heat on you yeah but Kobe's striking technique might be a little bit better doesn't hit quite as hard but the stuff he was shown against Robbie Lawler those jabs and body kicks and stuff I mean that was pretty impressed you know he's friends with my buddy cam hands and they they train together and can't cams description of him he said listen the guy talks all this crazy shit right he's doing it but he'd never stops training he's just constantly training that's why he's got that insane cardio he knows that's his biggest weapon his biggest weapon is he's like he's like ready keep up and you gotta try to keep up and he's fucking going and gonna go I go and everybody wilts that's why I'm so interested to see you spawn fight because he's gonna fight him and Guzman does the same thing to people that's what he did I think Tyron I think there was issues with Tyra go into that fight he lives like a shell of himself he wasn't firing back but some of that you got to give credit to Vaughn that fucking pressure that relentless pressure is striking which is just he knows how to fight long he's got an incredible fucking ground-and-pound game he's got real knockout power yeah and Kobe did a similar thing to Robbie Lawler where it kind of looked like why isn't he firing back wiesen hit because he's kind of backs on the cage getting taken down he's getting jabbed consular and never has a moment to just reset and take a deep breath because like you're just on you the whole fight guys didn't used to fight that way and what I I talked to Colby about this we were talking about the principle of like I'm like how hard do you you when you punch in how hard he punch and it's like 70% so you just hit them with a steady stream of 70% you never see him bite down you never see that those what DC always likes to call big actions those big actions those cost a lot of energy and you got to figure out when to do those maybe you're Francis and Ghana and those big actions lead to ouster over him getting knocked into the Netherlands but if not then you're gonna blow out your gas like we saw him with Stevie Miocic lifting them over his head in the first round and how cool does that look that you're holding this huge guy over your and dropping him but then after that you kind of just get a takedown he gets back up to his feet and then by the fourth round you're kind of wondering is that really good strategy to be lifting these guys over the steep a when steep a fought Francis and Ghana oh that was yes I managed to avoid the big actions of in Ghana and then wear him out and the ticket out and beat him up and retain the title the only guy that's been able to survive in Ghana the DC fight is a hard one to watch man cuz he's the best guy in the world he's so nice I love that guy to death so watching him get his body destroyed because he kept digging those left hooks in the body I was like whew part of me was like damn that's a pretty pie how loud were those fucking loud but it's it's it wasn't like it was the crispness of it he was he was standing in front of on top of them and then slide in back and he would just stick that fucking the left hook into the liver and he is kept hitting it part of me was like man that is a beautiful left hook nasty body shots but part of me is like damn DC you got to get away from that you got to get out of there you got to take this guy down it's hard when you're when you really love a guy and you watch them fight it's hard it's very very difficult to do commentary you just what's the pain on that on the liver punches what could that what's the damage that can do this shoes that makes you like I've seen people crumble or show me a little don't want it it's a horrible feeling wear it like like shocks your body let me say John feels like it's or show how about this show gave wording right here it's right there I was getting shocked lower if you if if someone is standing in front of you and you they hit you with a left hook most likely they'd be hitting you in the liver and it's like right where these floating ribs are tucked in there and when you slam someone hard like right around the look you know some one of the Masters of it is Canelo Alvarez say show Canelo Alvarez body shots like maybe there's a video we could look he's got a beautiful one we steps in and just fucking rips that left hook to the liver and your body just goes deep it's the weirdest feeling man it's like your legs stop working everything stops working your whole body just see [Music] it looks like it didn't happen to him until that last one I think he was playing poker face I think he was playing poker face they see Canelo is a fucking master at this shit he would just dig this thing look at this that one's going to the side but most the time he's going to the liver most the time well he's going to anything that's open right that's the liver she's going for the liver against golovkin but golovkin got that lower that low guard with his right arm he's blocking it from happening the guy was coming up next talking so it's so it's so much fun like it's a fun sport to do well when these kind of guys are fighting when triple G and Canelo are fighting like fuck it's like if you're a fan of the sport you've seen the highest level two champions in their prime going after it's amazing to watch but that punches a ted-like and getting hit there's a terrible feeling and DC got hit there multiple times and he was from like the second round on he was at you were talking about it when he was it but he was just putting his hands down and kind of listen steep a hit him his heart that's a dangerous way to fight ste paimio judge like I think he just wanted to put pressure on them and makes deep a feel like he didn't deserve to be in there with him I think maybe in that approach he was trying to wear him out which keep the pressure on him and make him discouraged or maybe he had genuine disdain for his abilities maybe he really didn't think too steep it could hurt him and he's just eventually gonna catch him and then there was a lot of people that thought because of the way he knocks D pay out maybe ste pays and his durable is used to be right because steep a I used to take tremendous shots from everybody but then he got knocked out with one punch by DC after taking tremendous shots in the in Ghana fight so the question would be like how much damage is he taking that in Ghana fight but then he came back and he ate everything that DC had to offer him he just kept beating and he could take it on the chin and eating it and eventually he started taking over the fight and when he started ripping the body in the fourth round it was like whoa he it was perfect I mean I've never seen anybody have better body punches in a championship what was that was think that was like a corner call or you think he just like improvised and saw that that was open and he knows how to fight yeah I saw an opening everybody everybody know I mean that's such a standard technique that's like a corner call someone's throwing a leg kick it's those Lincoln's it was working yeah you never guns loft once he didn't have an answer he didn't have an answer to it he didn't duck it he didn't block it he didn't he didn't try to take him down he just kind of got stuck Stan the problem with those liver shots too is they SAP your energy so bad and you you can't make a big move anymore so you have to kind of pretend like everything's okay and then BAM he hits you again you're like oh shit we're in trouble here but still you're looking like nothing's wrong but your gas tank is fucked everything's on empty and you're fucked you really can't fire back that's why DC didn't fire back and he kept getting shot to that body bang and every time bang he gets shot to that body you see this and then steep a got him against the cage started uncorking punches and DC just didn't have anything to his body was shutting down didn't have anything in him to stop that onslaught I mean it's amazing that guys thought this deep a is the most successful heavyweight in the history that's Merritt and Daniel Cormier whether he fights again or not he'll good that he's one of the best ever you know but he also is lazy 42 it's 40 40 okay 40 is that true Oh 40 a DC that might be could be 42 yeah you lost 42 when you look at like you know DC what he's done it's incredible I mean nobody else has ever done that it's just it's kind of it's probably hard to convince him of that the big fights the steep a fight honestly because beating guys for the vacated crown with in light heavyweight is not the same as beating Shawn Jones but beating steep a is like being the heavyweight version of John Jones yeah yeah that's that's the biggest accomplishment ever and I'd liked him at heavyweight because he wasn't getting drained but I just don't think that was I don't think I don't know maybe he couldn't have fought him any other way but I don't think that was the best strategy the dropping of the hands and the moving toward him with disdain but I mean maybe that would have worked on some guys and maybe that has worked on other guys like Rumble Johnson it worked on him right you know he mean he eventually puts that heat on you and so many guys crack under that heat do you want to see as a friend do you want to see him fight a third fight that is entirely dependent upon where his head's at I mean if he first of all I'm sure he's a very intelligent guy with a lot of years of competition under spell whether it's Olympics you know wrestling at the highest level whether it's UFC Strikeforce before that he's fought for a long time nobody needs to tell him when to make decisions when not he's emotional right now I'm sure he's gonna take some time off and he'll probably consult with his family and probably figure out what he wants to do but I bet if I had to guess his competitive instincts are going to tell him that he could have at least one more fight and that it would be a rematch with Steve Bay because he was dominating the first round and he'd let it get away from him and he wasn't listening to his corner you know crazy Bob Cook was yelling in his corner keep your damn hands up you know he didn't like it Bob cook didn't like it he respected Steve Steve a he's a giant man he's a fucking big motherfucker big long tall Croatian and he's tough as shit and I think because Daniel knocked him out in the first round in the first fight you know he he believed he could knock him out again but Steve a could take a goddamn shot this time you know I mean yeah it's you never know why a guy gets knocked out that way with one punch mean it was a perfect punch for sure I mean the way he threw it was beautiful the way he threw it from inside the clinch it comes over the top of the shoulder plan and lands that perfect punch that Kos deep amy was amazing yeah but it was also such a competitive fight that I'm super intrigued to see a third fight you know it's not like it's not a foregone conclusion the CP is gonna be able to do that again Daniel he just can come back with a better game plan one person he could win that fight and it's in my opinion the best fighter heavyweight though I don't think ain't gon will be a good fight but I think the CP went said again I I'm not convinced I mean I think in gone who might be the next guy oh say you know I think he might be the champ row well he's definitely got what it takes because he's got one thing that 100% one punch knockout power 100% not a fucking human's gonna be there if he full-on connects and smashes one through your guard everyone goes night-night everyone a hundred percent of the humans that have ever walked in here if that guy punches you full blast but it's whether or not he's gonna be able to do that too steep back we all thought he had a chance of doing it the first time but stipa shut it down and you know maybe maybe he's better now but maybe steep a is gonna come into this fight even more energized ever after beating DC and winning his title back I mean maybe he's gonna maybe he saw something from that fight that if you had to do it again he would have implemented really quickly you know the baby dude he did not want to take another fight he was whatever place he was in he was fucking in his firehouse listed of his boots I think if I get in that title back he does not want to lose that title again people were ignoring a man was weird every I'm so concentrated on the Brock lesner idea that they were ignoring him it was it's weird because when somebody said that the other day whatever publication was talking about see Bay being the greatest heavyweight of all time this is before the fight I remember going like Izzy and then you start listing off his credentials and you realize that he has the most defenses he's also fought the most competitive title defensive settle defenses as well then you see it becomes a little more apparent but I kind of under I almost understand it because even as and I'm a pretty big fan of the sport but I remember just I wasn't like chomping at the bit for the rematch for him it wasn't like I was like I really want to see that steep ad on Corey mentioned I can't even put my finger on why oh I did I wanted to see it bad I wanted to see a real bad guy I wanted to see I liked the fact it was 13 months later so I think it gave his body some time to heal up I think you fighting gone it's like getting hit by a train I mean you might live fucking tree what happened they hit just like when DJ Jazzy Jeff will get thrown out but I think he's if he keeps it together he's the next guy I mean he's the next guy in line to be the champion I mean he has everything to lose is he has the championship to lose if it's deep a retires when Steve Bates done Francis is the fucking man and maybe maybe Francis beats him in a rematch who knows again all he has to do is connect he would be a different guy in the rematch he would understand what it's like to go five hard rounds the guy who could take you down and beat you up he would understand that his wrestling has to be on point his cardio has to be on point and there's not gonna be times where he's getting a hundred percent unload and know for sure the guy's not going to be there because the guy survived he didn't have the gas tank for the remaining four rounds and so this is gonna be a new guy that steep a fights and he might very well just play it smooth and just stay on the outside and pick his shots and then when he gets him hurt then uncork I mean we don't know but we don't know Stevie might take him down quicker this time yeah maybe pea might say fuck all this stand-up dude let's just wrestle you know he just like come out I'm a couple pump a few jabs and shoot a fucking double on him and take him down dude he took down DC steep a took down DC that's giant the only other guy has ever done that was John Jones and steep I did it more emphatically you know I mean it was pretty goddamn impressive that's the other one at UH at heavyweight I want to say I don Jones retires I want to see him play heavyweight yes Jones at 235 pounds Locke yeah steroids to the gills monster dude I would love to see if he could handle steep a or if Cormier wanted that fight I if Daniel Cormier and John Jones wanted to fight again I'd want to see that fight in heavyweight well I guarantee you if John Jones fights at heavyweight he'll probably be at which is what he walks around that because the word around Jackson's was that he wrestled with heavy weights and just ragdoll him that he would throw people around the gym I mean when I talked to tape Fletcher when he was down there and other guys who trained with John when John was uh down at Jacksons as a light heavyweight champion was just ranked Donnellan heavyweights he's a phenomenally powerful guy and you really saw them the Cormier fight like I think Cormier was shocked in that first fight of how fucking strong John is I mean he's a long thin guy but he is redic felis least wrong and I think as a heavyweight he be a fuckload to handle for a lot of guy yeah I want to say and I think he actually he has the star power to I think that puts the UFC on the map in a weird way because they haven't really had the major star as a heavyweight champion like that fucking dude who is like best in the world pound for pound best as a heavyweight champ as a heavyweight champion but if John could be steep a that would be that yeah he's he's definitely the best pound-for-pound fighter in the in the UFC right now definitely you look at his accomplishments it's arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter ever because he's really never lost that one matt hamill fighter trying to reverse that because it was a bad decision it was a bad decision through a bad decision this is a bad decision to disqualified no contest yeah making a no contest so he's still undefeated that's what it really should have got my only problem with it is it really should be crushed him oh yeah it was ridiculous doesn't feel like it that's the thing it's like the guy's never really lost so if you look at his career like who the fuck can say that who the fuck has fought like lyoto machida Rashad Evans Rampage Jackson the top of the food chain over and over new generation through generation three or four different generations of the best guys Hansen everybody you look at that there's actually a number like there that one loss on his record if you could really break it down there was some sort of like statistic could come in and really look at it there's a number an amount of money that he's lost yeah because he has that loss on his record whether or whatever is the mark of marketability maybe who knows there's something definitely there has to be some of this other have I says I have to go share to wrap this bitch up alright gentlemen thank you as always you cooked out again so just talk to that so
