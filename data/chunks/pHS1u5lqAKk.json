the Joe Rogan experience says remember the adage regarding conspiracy theories never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence or chance true surely you shouldn't do that it is possible but what what are the odds there's something this this is where he stinks so bad because he's in so many circles and touched so many super-powerful people it's different for powerful people know that it's he's not just a pedophile like he's saying gave him a seventy million dollar house in New York City gave him one of his clients gave him he's saying he was the power of attorney at the time so he signed over to himself the guy let him do that that's the question is whether or not he wouldn't new was happening oh come on like you just stole the house from the guy who's in control of a lot of stuff that's worth a million Wow so that's what's coming out but how would the guy who he signed it off on how would the guy not know this guy stole his house and not sue him he was in control of all of his finances right but the guy was he was living in the house who the guy Wexner no a bottie he bought the house for him basically that's what I'm saying when the guy bought it for Epstein right right yeah but he who fucking buys you a seventy million dollar hey I don't know no one's bought me nuttin there's there's so many questions ya ask guys about where his wealth was and then the the color of his house didn't he own didn't eat the eyeballs on the entrance and set the shit about the house is crazy oh there's like oh yeah murres inside the house and shit but the other thing was the house it's on the island that is the same color it's painted in the same way these rarely flag is uh-huh and this there was an idea people are wondering like how far this guy's influence goes where it comes from and look at this house bro that was his house as his house on this fucking Island the island was like a building there it's a tent we here at on his Island brothers a dope temple by the way everything looks awesome J's I would love that if I was my house come on in how'd he get so much money exactly no one really knows didn't he have something to do with Victoria's Secret yeah he um he managed some military secrets Katya correct the guy who gave him the house oh yeah you know Bill Clinton flew on his private jet no less than 26 times well whatever no big deal he was hung out of our Lago yeah but I mean I flew with him 26 times I've never flown with it would it be have to be my very best friends at at or with all the time have I flown with you 26 times maybe four or five I mean I barely ever and maybe if we flew together it might be a little more than four or five it might be ten it might be tended I mean I've known you for years yeah has not been 26 times so Bill Clinton blood with his one guy why he's the president United States I think was he still president then and it was afterwards Jerry probably 20 times I'm making money I like fly with Jeffery I'm off to pay I mean that's a lot of times be partying with the dude you would think that you would find out about how that guy fucks yeah cuz you're Alex Jones and like you know like so well I've known Alex for like more than 20 years so it's just easy yeah I've hung out with that guy we've been hammered together so many times it's like it's that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet he just needs somebody next to him that's what he needs someone to go Alex let's slow down like you had a really good point there but you see the manager he even agreed with me we talked about I said you just need like a rational journalist who's next to you to like study goes you're right you're right you're right I do need that and I go just you need someone who's just analysis it out look he was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein shit that is a fucking fact Alex Jones called this years ago years ago he was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with he was talking about this years ago now it is mainstream news and this human-hybrid did experiments on yes sounds like a complete joke when he brought it up we were like we were like what now it's fucking mainstream news this is a fact man like people want to write that guy off because he'll tell you he's crazy he'll let you know he's crazy I mean on my show there was one of them was a favorite the finest things he ever said he's like look I wanna be honest with you I'm kind of retarded I fell to the ground laughs but that's who he really is men people just have him lumped in you know it's like some people they don't represent the best aspects of themselves right to people and then other people try to define them like people try to define you it's really one of the things that it's really kind of weird about the more famous you get the more people try to define you in a way that's detrimental or a way that's dismissive and limited no-bid contracts happen often that's what I've heard how can you chew another one of those my heart is pounding on my chest because I'm a real man I'm more manly than you you know like I'm a real like I get up I do what are those bells that you kind of sandal bells kettle bells I you know what I eat a bowl of us for cereal nice when you're a man like me that's what I do I put CBD oil on my knees and then I just lift lift bulldozers that's what I do for breakfast then I jog up mountains and just yell and then I just come home and I just eat elk meat but you know unlike you I don't cook it I just eat the elk when it's a lot sometimes it's better to cook though what does elk meat taste like you want some not really in here if I take it and I cook some would you eat some we're at this compound you you have this huge place you got a horse track in the back you don't have a kitchen here it's like yeah that thing like ideas are strange man I entertained for a while the idea that ideas were life-forms that because we don't think of them like look there's a lot of different life forms right I mean there's squids and there's chimps and there's barracudas and there's hawks there's a lot of different life forms there's insects I mean there's a lot of different ones what if that's what ideas were and that what they're doing is just making their way and the more you nourish them the more they grow the more you pay attention to them the more they they propagate you're out your head with new ideas and and then you take action on those ideas and it creates everything the world's ever seen that humans have created all that stuff comes from ideas everything from cars to buildings to planes all that comes from ideas a hundred percent of it but yet we don't even think about what the ideas are like what the fuck is that you just get some random new way of looking at things what is happening is this is just pure calculation or are you interacting with some sneaky little influence or that wants to give you credit for it the god Dan Hardy you're so smart with these ideas you should you know what you should do should build that builder and then you're like I'm gonna build this fucking building all right Hardy right on the side of it god damn it and you do it all in gold like where is that coming from ago the ego oh you know men and the toxic masculinity and their desire for building things maybe or maybe ideas made that dude build that thing maybe maybe ideas were so clever the way they got you and talked to you like a siren pulling you into the rocks come on hardy build that fucking building [Applause]
