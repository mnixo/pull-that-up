hello freak bitches I mean this this process of biofeedback was discovered in the late 60s on cats cats a notoriously bad instruction followers right fuckers right so you're never gonna this is not a cognitive process cats didn't try to make in this case cat's got a dropper of milk whenever their brain waves it up in one direction milk came out of a dropper and they learned over time to produce more of this brain wave that gave them a milk dropper ah and then six months this one experiment that dr. Barry Sterman did in the late 60s six months later he pulled a bunch of cats out of his subject pool to do a rocket fuel exposure experiment NASA had said hey look our astronauts are gangly sick they're getting nauseous how dangerous is this you know hydrazine stuff we're using as rocket fuel could you please expose a bunch of animals to it and see you know how much it takes to kill them or what the dose response curve is and so dr. Sturman at UCLA in the late 60s was exposing cats to increasing levels of rocket fuel vapors and found that a little bit you know they panted a little more they stumbled a little more they cried and then like seizure coma death this nice linear you know with increasing dose except of the cats he was using a certain subset like six of 30 or something refused to have seizures and the whole curve of unstable brain was pushed to the right I couldn't figure out why until he realized oh wait a minute I used these same six cats in a previous experiment to increase their brain waves in this one brain wave that I thought was a nice target to go after it turns out that brain wave is the anti seizure brain wave when you train it up you have decrease dramatically decreased seizure activity in the brain and so he found this you know this brain wave was sort of metastable in encouraging brain activity and his lab manager at the time was a medication uncontrolled epileptic having like tens of seizures a month which is basically a death sentence your brain won't you know Swiss cheese over time and you'll have major major long-term problems and she demanded he built her a biofeedback machine to train up this brain wave and over the next year or two they did some training and after a couple of years she went off all meds I'm a seizure free that's crazy and about that time Barry sermons funding was all pulled really keep out he submitted a paper to epilepsia the journal and suddenly his government funding all vanished so the conspiracy theorist you know ideas start to mount when you think about you know the late sixties and big drug companies not wanting a non drug intervention for epilepsy out there their pockets are loaded with so much fuckin dough and they have been so conditioned by a game that dehumanizes people to the point where they no longer see giant swaths of humans in other countries as people it is important to realize that these wolves that you're talking about we're talking about a different species here friend if you look at like what's going on in the UK with these organized pedophile rings that seemed to consist of people in the highest level of governments I can't remember who it was one of the investigators said it seems to be built into the system in some way but yeah look it up it's scary fucking shit man that's insane so when you look I had avoided that stuff because it bums me out when I saw those those stories but that's what they're saying that's what they're saying but here's the difference here's the difference and that's horrifying to imagine because you know this we hear it's so funny to of here with the UK government and people are like what but now you hear about a priest doing it and people are like yeah that just happens it's like you're looking at on you know an organized system that has as part of the destructive result that it reaps on the planet also psychically wounding children in the worst way possible so this is a I think that that the the reason that that isn't as grim and horrible as it sounds is because the difference today as opposed to thirty years ago is that we get to say it in front of however many zillions of people listen to your podcast and it that info instantly travels around the world thirty years ago if you think that if there truly is an organized group of pedophiles that have as their membership high-ranking government officials not just probably in the UK but in the United States too if that really does exist it didn't just start today or last week or two years ago that's been around for a long long time so the difference between back then and now is that shit is getting everywhere it's everyone on planet Earth is aware of this investigation you can't get that genie back in the bottle even though I think a lot of people are trying they're saying that the whistleblowers for it for this are not going to have immunity that's one thing that the government is said if you're a whistleblower for this weird ring of pedophiles no immunity you're going to jail too so they're like squelching there seems to be an element that is trying to push this shit down of course because if it's true that there that some speculate that even members of the royal family could be involved in this shit so yeah look it up how you should it's a deep dark David Lynch level Twin Peaks shit coaster but the David Lynch level shit coaster this is but but the positive thing is they're getting exposed what do you think about us tie steal cups for grappling competition so yeah sure they're getting outlawed in a lot of grappling competitions because they provide that extra leverage they're like a fulcrum point like a leverage point okay and then everybody's got a free ball free ball you know you just gotta use that third hook wrap your dingus around there and I'm just like you see a bring Brian on these podcasts everything goes in the fucking well here's a thing no I mean I'm here I'm barely eleven and a half so I would naively don't train with a cup you don't know because my legs are so big that it's it rubs what's bruising in the inside of my thighs mmm I personally I have a thing I like to call combat cock where everything just pulls ensign yeah remember those kinds it knows better than to get fucking hanging out there hey how you doing what's up high five you're educated my dick is smart just like the Shaolin monks I've known guys have lost a ball from that yeah not me yeah well there's Brian Foster ZFC yo is in training and he got kicked in the balls lost why those balls yeah I can be able to find it dick yes I've seen like pictures you've been in the room you know you just want to take like a whole like a bottle of paint thinner really you need to just dip in this real quick
