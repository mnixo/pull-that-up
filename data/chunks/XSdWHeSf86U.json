live without locking on a young brick road yeah that's some good song oh yeah dude the bitch is back oh and with live ladies gentlemen shrimp raid powerful Duncan Trussell is in the house back dr. Chris Ryan looking like you're fresh off of a vacation like we just endless vacation we were talking about Elton John right before we start and I think there's some Elton John songs that are just all-time classics you know yeah what are your favorites top three boy um man do you like Daniel that's the best a great song of a Rocket Man is one of my favorites great I don't know I never I never thought about that let me let me go over the lyrics you know that's one of those songs you just the lyrics almost become inconsequential because the lyrics are oh this is the sound that song makes I remember that song that song has this feels like listen to a song in a different language right right always just an it's weird when you find out what a song is about and it's the opposite Oh what does it say what it is now this is just the lyrics yeah it's it's it's about an astronaut there are yeah I don't think it is I think it's about snort and ketamine so it is it's a space I miss my wife I miss the earth so much yeah are you just guessing Duncan well I mean I we all get to interpret music in our own way but for sure that's Elton John he's in some hotel room he's laid out some lines Academy and he's here it says during the druggy or given that it was penned during the nineteen seventies drug era people can still see that it serves as an extended metaphor comparing fame to space travel Wow that makes that makes a ton of sense but it also I bet it also was about rocket travel because Bernie Taupin wrote it right yeah he wrote it he wrote him on yeah what a great combination yeah to those guys it's like you and young Jamie very similar nobody ever hears about young Jamie last time I was here I tried to get him on my podcast he's eluding me yeah really smart doesn't want to be on you crazy podcasts out Woods can't come in the van Saturday night that's a great ones all right for fight yeah that's a good one yeah that's a great workout that's real kind of like no yeah yeah it's like a punk British yeah Saturday night Daniels the first time I really thought about Spain it's about Daniel my brother he's heading out on a plane I can see the red taillights heading for Spain that's about it's friend dying he's blind no it's about his blind brother I'm misinterpreting all the you must have I like him less I like what his songs are about you know what's interesting about this conversation is trying to interpret what songs are is the very actual thing that happened when people were trying to interpret the stories from the Bible it's basically the same thing we're trying to figure out no he meant this nothing like that these parables are the stories that are in the Bible yeah you know if you go to the John Marco Allegro definition was it's a song was written from his younger brother's perspective got a story about a guy who went back to a small town in Texas returning from the Vietnam War Wow okay that's Daniel and he was blind right your eyes have died but you see more than I oh wow huh do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal oh if you guys heard you know that song summer of 69 Jamie maybe you can Brian Adams one and that's about like actually sixth and sixty-nining oh really yeah that's right now getting like every single summer of 69 like one interpretation is that's like a summer is that true yes is it true and my first real six-string Bryan Adams fourth album reckless summer 69 in many meanings although one of them including life in 1969 while another includes making love with someone hence using the number 16 on as a reference boy that's not accurate the way they said that this was like the internet interpretation sorry um what I meant was it's like you'd never say that there wouldn't be how you convey your feelings it's like if you're writing that song like the summer of 69 and this same oh they go back to that please it says while another includes making love with someone that is just that's not an accurate way I don't know man I'm talking about sixty-nining I mean yeah you're making love but you're getting crazy it's like there's more to it than that that was like the same thing is like trying to interpret stories from a Bible or something like that like you're boiling them down like you're trying to figure out what was this guy actually saying yeah you know like literary interpretation yeah yeah it's all poetry right my favorite example of a song that sort of misleads you I mean I really like songs were the covers better than the original because the person doing the cover gets what the songs about better than the original artist does I mean all along the watchtower Hendrix's version is way better than Dylan's right Dylan actually said that but my favorite example in recent music is hey ya by Outkast okay now shake it like a Polaroid picture hey ya my baby don't mess around because she loves me so you know it's real upbeat that it uh listen to the words but does she really want to but can't stand to see me walk out the door don't try to stop the feeling because the thought alone is killing me right now thank God for mom and dad for sticking two together cuz we don't know how it's all about how we don't know how to love each other wow yeah hey fellas what's cooler than being cool ice cold if what they say is nothing lasts forever than what makes love the exception oh why oh why are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here wow it's a really sad song super sad yeah there's a dude who did a cover of it Oh Ovadia Parker see the thing that I really like about he gets it he gets the sadness over play some of that walk out the door I can't seem to fight the feeling cuz the thought alone is killing me right now hold depressing calm and dad force to get you together cookie don't know how Wow this is great hey there's people right now screaming at their music case I get more tweets about how bad my taste is in music and movies and television blame it on me and that cut Chris Ryan yeah I was I was looking at something the other day some something on some video years of comments or something it occurred to me how you have your audience is first of all so large and also so mixed because you've got your fingers in all these different worlds that you must get a lot more hostility than someone like Duncan or me because our audience is more sort of homogeneous I would think I'm the bridge between the meatheads and the potheads exactly so there's conflict and then you go there's a little but the meatheads kind of get that look the likes but if you want to go the far end of the extremes like the UFC fans but the UFC fans know like I'm I'm a representative like I'm doing my best like they know I'm a hundred percent into this it's not like I'm not like some actor that they hired right to promote this so I but then you got all the way to the far left which is the psychedelic people and I got a ton of vegan followers and people that are really into yoga and it's like all of them together it's like the weirdest  house party we've seen sometimes in the comments this Ram Dass retreat that I just went to one of the one of the people who run the runs the retreat wanted me to tell it to thank you because he's like you know your podcast brings a lot of people to these ramadasa retreats which is to me it was such a strange thing to think man that you're like magnetizing people and bringing them down a slippery slope where they land in Maui hanging out with like Buddhists and like teachers it's really crazy man it's a very odd thing how many out like how many tentacles you have Burning Man Jesus Christ Burning Man everybody wants you to go man you you got it go when is it again it's like elk hunting season it's late August early you can't bring some Alex to Burning Man I can't interact with that many people do that anymore those days are done but you know what what has changed like a big one of the biggest thing that's ever changed because of this podcast the float industry yeah float industry has taken off I get like residual gratitude from float places like I know you know Joe Rogan you can float for free well that's amazing well the thing is it just didn't make any sense to me that before I was talking about it no one was talking about it this was something that was invented by Lillian Boyer 1960 something where you were vertical you know he had one where you would wear a helmet and you had a harness and the helmet would float you you know and then he figured out the salt thing and I mean the fact that this was not a popular thing was blowing me away well it was but then it died because of the AIDS thing yeah he was ever this popular no no but it was much he was higher then it dropped a lot it's been killed it yeah I mean we sort of brought it back in yeah but with John Lilly you know what's interesting when people leave out about him a lot is that he was talking to aliens and it's an interesting thing that people just kind of push all that aside they know him as the float guy invented floating with dolphin gun and the dolphin guy but also they completely leave out that he was going into those tanks and claiming some kind of communication with something called the ECC or something ecco you know about that yeah the earth coincidence control office or something you know about that zen center of the cyclone yes yeah but he was going way out talking about some kind of like invisible I guess network that produces coincidences I don't understand it at all but people just completely leave that out that the guy who created float tanks was using them to communicate with entities and he was using a lot of ketamine a lot of ketamine yeah or maybe they're leaving out that the guy who invented float tanks lost his there toward the end well maybe but I think that I don't know what's happening when you're doing psychedelics but there are certain psychedelics where it absolutely feels like you're experiencing another life form communicating with you for sure for sure right now if that's the case of ketamine as well ketamine seems to be like me personally my personal bias I sort of dismiss it because I think of it as some sort of chemical compound thing some sort of a synthetic thing that man's create like a demean and what it's reliable but I think that's just my own ignorance I think really it we're just talking about chemicals right and how chemicals that exist in nature it's like when someone says it's an artificial chemical well that's not real because everything is natural everything's here like it may have been concocted and put together and baked and cooked and synthesized by a person but of course it's all natural everything that's Romantics though because it isn't it isn't in there these chemicals most likely have some sort of a corresponding receptor in the human brain right or something similar to the molecule yeah yeah and it's some natural thing like that's the craziest thing about the most potent drugs whether it's psilocybin or whether it's dimethyltryptamine they have like really similar composition to normal human neuro chemistry right they're like keys like their keys that a certain lock that's how they put it yeah but I do think that there is a distinction between natural and unnatural in the sense that something because I get this argument all the time right oh people created it so it's natural but there are things that exist in the natural system like plastics don't exist in the natural ecosystem and therefore they don't break down they don't become part of the food chain in a beneficial way whereas things that have existed in that system for a long time do they fit into it and I think in terms of drugs there are drugs like GHB that exist naturally in the body that we metabolize absolutely cleanly because the liver knows exactly what it is it's prepared to deal with it and it doesn't cause any organic toxicity no neurotoxicity but then there are other things like alcohol which are natural in a sense that fruits ferment and all that but the body doesn't metabolize it cleanly so it damages us in particularly if you're from a very specific part of the world right where it's a if it's not a part of your custom which is why it was such a giant issue when Europeans came here yeah they didn't they didn't have any history with alcohol well well you know Hamilton Morris the vice guy he tweeted this thing I thought was pretty smart probably a little controversial forgive me if I miss quote it but it's something on the lines of it's true it's drugs and that word is a controversial word somehow people like to use the term plant medicine which is okay you can call it plant medicine or you can call it whatever you want but to create a hierarchy based on synthesis I think is to sort of miss the point which is that all of these things are tools and some of them we have more of a history with humanity and some of them we don't the ones we don't which is my god there's so many I don't there's so many new drugs that are just popping up all the time different derivatives of LSD things you can like right now apparently you can order sheets of this stuff that is like LSD but it's in the gray area it's still kind of legal it's like a different version of LSD but we don't know yet the effects it's gonna have because it's not like anyone's really testing it out did I say the name because Jeff Sessions is listening one hand as your mother had a giant dick yeah yeah but anyway I think it's talking to a woman who had sex with a little person and she said he had a normal-sized dick mm-hm that big heads so Jeff sessions with a normal-sized dick would be interesting proportionally yeah I don't know I mean just scary to think about it like Jeff Sessions having like some kind of like cuz you know he's such a you know he's just such the quintessential Pig you know and it's like you want the quintessential pig to have some kind of like to be almost like a eunuch or something but it's terrifying to imagine the Jeff Sessions when he takes his clothes off probably has like six nipples you know right down the middle a chest listen ease laser blues they usually get sweat when he's like arresting people they use a little trick a little goat knobs it is to fall file prisons he visits private prisons and just pulls out his massive throbbing in front of people have been sentenced there for life what's right on that screen that you put your hand on mr. sessions I was standing up for you I just want you to know that doing after medical marijuana again it's trying to it's almost like he can't help himself he knows what the laws are and some yeah sure grab them I know though I know what science says but I've got my personal opinions on the thing and that's what matters yeah just any time there's one person as authority over another person and they've lived an entire life in that position that's their ecosystem their ecosystem is they have authority they enforce laws they'd lock people up they put in it's the game it gets the game they play and very successful yeah not just that it's like there's an objective it's literally like almost like a Monopoly game like you see what the thing is to arrest people you're you're the guy who arrests people you arrest people and convict people that's your game that's what you do you plugged into the machine yeah do you know an interesting thing about Monopoly it was invented by an anarchist who was invented it to teach kids the evils of capitalism Wow goofy anarchists are what they do was it supposed to be fun it was supposed to demonstrate that when you accumulate capital you end up taking it all right you know yeah wait what do you think anarchists are well I think that anarchists are people who want to diminish this system that we have have far less rules have far less government right and usually they're kind of spastic and they're there the way they express themselves is always like very awkward Aryans well but you know you know you know like I've just been reading this book anarcho-syndicalism it's like this I goddamn this is really interesting to look at the history of and our kids I'm like what it comes from versus what it gets into our member when I was like in high school or do you remember drawing the anarchy symbol and you'd be like yeah you'd even know what it made you're just assuming you know but but I think one part of it that's really beautiful is the idea that we don't need withered old prunes like Jeff Sessions telling us what we can put in our bodies we don't need that that's true and and and in that how many Jeff Sessions are there and the power structure and then where it gets really  cool man check out David Graeber you should have him on the podcast my God he's brilliant what'd you do he's an author and he a philosopher I guess you could say but he is incredible and he wrote a book called I think it's called the Utopia of rules that I've been reading which is pretty badass and it's just sort of breaking down like the the bureaucracy that we're in right now bureaucracy all the forms you got to fill out to do just about anything these days like all these  forms it's insanity right right but then where it gets really interesting is he's right now so like in like communists states the this the corporations in the state are kind of the same thing so there's these like Ministry of Labor the stores are all national stores you know and so we think that that's not what's happening right now but actually because the people who are running a lot of the corporations used to be in government and the people who are in government used to be running these big corporations one of the cool points he makes and also because the government is making the rules that the corporations are working by but the corporations are putting their own agents into the state he's saying that actually the line between the state and private companies is really blurry right now they're kind of merging together together but we like to pretend that they're separate for example what's happening right now with the FCC trying to take away the internet with Verizon having one of their pig drones in a super position of power right now is trying to take away the freedom of the internet the state can be like we the corporation complained on the state's clarify what you mean by that because you they're not trying to take away the freedom of the internet trying to they're gonna trying to get rid of net neutrality exactly yeah so what would it just mean is that you will have to probably pay more yeah to access things that require more bandwidth and what's gonna be it's not it's gonna be what it is now where every website has open access that's its use you two versions right you get the capitalist version I think it's a good idea and then you get the tech version which thinks this is a terrible idea I almost always go towards the tech version have to yeah but that's the anaconda you know the way in anaconda kills somebody every time you exhale what squeezes in a little bit that's all right now it's the squeeze in it's okay this internet it sucks if you're somebody like Jeff that's not that's not where the money's coming from I think you're misinterpreting the whole idea it's all just a business thing it's like being able to throttle the the data and being able to decide like like if Netflix wants you on there if you want to have Netflix on the network they want to be able to work out some sort of a deal they don't want to treat Netflix like it's any other sort of streaming service like you looking at the the the the there's business transactions they're looking at in a business sense they're not saying the internet sucks no one is trying to like squeeze the internet and stop it what they try to do is make more money well okay great they're trying you know saying yeah I do here I dunno what you're saying but I think it's a slippery slope and it's the idea of the internet being treated like I don't know water the internet being treated like just a thing that no corporation should have any kind of say that to me it has to stay like that because the moment some corporation whoever it may be gets to start deciding yeah you guys need to pay a little bit more right and if we establish that corporations in the state aren't as separate as we like to think then suddenly there's all kinds of back channels there's suddenly there becomes a new way to begin to filter out content and you could say it's for money you start building financial walls around things you start making things vanish into the background because they aren't in some big conglomerate that's paying off the corporation's more or whatever you just mess up the whole thing which as far as I can tell it's doing great the Internet's great this compound right now you know a lot of it came from the internet this thing we're doing right now it's the way the Internet's been working oh dude no one's a bigger proponent of the internet than I am I just think when we're talking about these issues you gotta be you gotta be really like objective criticize what's trying to happen here they're not trying to silence dissent they're just trying to they're trying to make as much money as possible and this is a weird tricky time when it comes to information we we do have to be very careful because it could wind up being like hey you get your internet from Comcast what Comcast is no longer allow you know blah blah the laugh at ya how's your podcast featured on it or you know some new streaming service that's yet to be discovered that will be in the future challenging YouTube so YouTube gets together with Google you know they're owned by Google and they get together with Verizon and they make it exclusive for the Verizon network if you want to get on YouTube you have to be on the Verizon and that's that's this is all inside the realm of hospitals the deeper level though anybody who thinks that government has not been totally captured by corporations isn't paying attention I mean that's not news in this car see you come from Europe where this is one of the things the problems I have with anarchists and libertarians I think they're very naive about what the world would look like if there were no government regulation yeah I agree every poison every river would be too poisoned to swim in it you know the air would be because corporations it makes sense for them to dump their as near to the factory as possible they don't give a about birth defects and dead people that it doesn't matter that's that's true but a lot of good things come from from look from a lot of anarchist theorists and and and some of those things you're well I think a lot of it relates back to my with the hunter-gatherers because hunter-gatherers are essentially anarchists functioning anarchist oh yeah the problem is when you scale up and you've got corporations there you know I've talked about this on this podcast before what my idea that my belief that corporations are living things institutions are living things and their agendas conflict with us like you're like superorganisms or something right yeah that's spooky I think that every time you get large groups of people together and they operate under one window or one umbrella rather they just tend to act like an organism just what countries do ya mean listen it's a natural thing that human beings do for some strange reason not only human beings right think about flocks of birds and schools and fish and yeah and Hills sure there are all sorts of examples and then you go the other direction our microbiome you know I mean that's all functioning according to its own systems you know and yeah and that's happening within us all sorts of scalable stuff going on I think you'd be insane to not think there needs to be some kind of structure to help things function smoothly but I think we all agree we don't need as much structure as we've got right now and a lot but the problem is sorry in a row look good just to finish the point I think what happens is a lot of people get in their heads and they start thinking that the state is responsible in some way or another for their well-being and that's what happens as you start forgetting that if what's really important is communities what's really important is finding a group of people that you love and deciding in this group of people Loosli it's not a comm units not like a cult but just deciding with a group of people that you love making this really intense decision which is none of us are ever going to be homeless you could start there that used to be what the family was but a lot of people don't have that anymore so groups of people agreeing very loosely to take care of each other in a way that the state is currently functioning with welfare and all that that's to me is like it's not Anarchy but it's a it's a sense of sort of like shrugging off the idea that the state is really gonna take care of you but what if this state is an expression of that sense of community as it is in a country like Denmark for example sure where Danish people and Dutch people and Swedish people and you know lots of northern European countries said you know we're not going to let anyone be homeless and suffering we're not going to let any children be malnourished in this country we're gonna take care of each other it depends on how if you're if there was a pure expression for one if the people are unified enough to create a pure expression of what they what they're like central goals were that would be pretty startling to me but we we pay lip service to in America all the time you know thanks for your service and we're all in this together we're all Americans you know route around the flag yeah yeah yeah that's what we're doing we're trying to create this sense of community we're all in it together but when it comes to actually taking care of each other then we don't do it well I mean that's to me I mean listen let me say the most naively stupid thing I was just thinking about this in the way I mean this is so dumb but I was really thinking this cuz you know that the prisoners are fighting the fires right now you know that yes that really there were prisoners they're getting paid $1 an hour to fight these fires there there were there it's insane but I was just leaking to myself with a dollar though one dollar an hour but I was thinking to myself man what what if like everybody in California was like there's fires and we all were going to help fight the fires would the would we all be able to put the fires out like if like as many just people just started flooding to actually go help or if like all these homes are burnt down and I was just thinking like man it's like everybody in California is like all right let's just go help them build their houses back I mean it's so insane who else would fall apart if you were building sandwiches yeah I make sandwiches which is another cool thing that I like about I'm not by the way I'm not a anarchist but one cool thing I like about the idea is like right now we have this hierarchy of you know of you like careers right so doctors are valued more than somebody Homer Plummer right or plumbers or plumbers are valued more than like I don't know a house clean or something so like you know it's considered a low status thing if you're somebody who works in a fast-food joint or something like that but when you get together with a group of people who are cool some people are good at some things and some people are gonna other things but nobody is valued more than the other person because everybody loves each other and you've got this like who you know the person who's the most like somebody digging trenches to like put electrical wires down a pretty unskilled job is super appreciated because who the wants to dig the trenches man it's when you add money to the equation which is what we're doing right now and I get it I'm not saying get rid of money or whatever when you add money to it everything gets weird so what I'm saying is it's just right now when we hear about the fires we think okay I'll donate some money I'll donate some money that'll do that'll do it I'll donate some money but this is AI night like I said before it's crazy naive idea I just had this image of like what if just huge groups of people started going towards the fires like white blood cells yeah because right now we're using prisoners well do you understand the terrain like this is not something that most people can traverse you're talking about like extremely hilly areas that are also yeah you you'd have to be not just fit but you'd have to understand which way the winds blowing you could get shoehorned in and surrounded by fire there's a lot of like serious dangers with there's a it's a beautiful idea on paper we need trained there'd have to be it would never I know it never happen it's just I just think that here you would need a lot of stuff someone would have to organize it we're supposed to be it's bigger than this than the city of Washington DC no I know it's how big the  back I mean it's it's insane how big it is it's terrible it's terrible you'd have to get a lot of people to circle that bitch but we're just so used to it we're so brave right we're so broken apart we're so disconnected like whenever you hear about something going down it's just a thing that's going down if someone's house is burnt down you know that house burnt down mm-hmm that's it you don't really think much more than that and we think this state is gonna come in and like take care of everything and I think that's what the state wants I love using the term this state but does the state want that or is just how its structured no it wants it but what do you think the state wants that because in the same reason anyone who's like in an abusive relationship wants to be in control it's like if you think that I'm the one who's gonna help you then you're dependent on me when do you think of that if there was a really effective massive volunteer firefighter force the state would resist that no I don't that's what's beautiful about it is I don't know how the state would resist that I mean we do see the state resisting things like groups of people getting together and trying to feed the homeless and stuff like that yeah laws pop up saying you can't feed them like that there's Lani and licenses yeah licenses to feed but is that would that be a good idea to prevent people from poisoning people or people giving them you know yeah but I mean I don't know for sure man but when was the last time you heard about like an organized group like Food Not Bombs poisoning homeless well it wouldn't have to be that it would be Duncan's food delivery service you just start more oh yeah you might might have a good intentions but not really be qualified to prepare food these people are eating hamburgers out of trash cans definitely better than what they're eating for sure yeah the real issue with homeless people is not just an economic issue though the one of the big ones needs to be addressed as mental health and when they change the standards during the Reagan administration they essentially just set people out on the street yeah and they were using Duncan the argument you're making basically which is that the state is providing for people they should be there should be private church communities religious based families that was the argument they made I think it was disingenuous I think it was just about taking money you know it's about money giving it yeah the whole Reagan thing what we're seeing now is the the fruit the bitter fruit of the Reagan Revolution they're still using the same economic arguments this trickle-down  yeah that was started by most listeners probably under old enough to remember this but I remember in the 80s David Stockman was the the economic advisor to Ronald Reagan who came up with all this stuff four or five years later he left the administration and he came out and said that was all we knew it was it was just a story we made up it has makes no economic sense it's ruining the country I'm so sorry you know but they're still using it because it's a narrative that's effective I'm getting into this a lot recently like how narratives are popular and powerful not because they make sense but because they create a story that justifies the power structure that's that's in control at the time right yeah well I this is I this why I think it's like hype important right now for people to find groups of people that they love and do more than just like play board games like get together with people and like make stuff like face the facts man  California is on fire right now I mean everyone thinks this just stays the way it is it's not just on fire it's on fire in a way that you realize like oh they could be twice as bad as this and we would literally have to everyone would have to flee the state it likes December yeah this is the rainy season yeah yeah and it easily could be twice as bad as it is now we're just mean we're in a weird place and there's no rain you know the rain isn't coming yeah and and you know and like it sucks that people have to you have to like create in your mind the reality of what's happening took my friend you know he was sending me pics he was right by the fires and he's saying people just can't understand how bad this is people just can't comprehend it people because this is this is this is like this is real life right now do you guys feel like this for example and other things that are happening do you feel like this is the hitting the fan in a way that always seemed hypothetical you know like this is to me that we're living through a moment that's almost like aliens arriving and you're like something that you always thought well that would be weird right it's happening mm-hmm it's happening right now yeah like there are things happening now that seemed inconceivable even five years ago ten years ago I don't know what but it's specific well I mean like evacuate Santa Barbara you know that happen a few times from feature esident and like oh no these these national monuments we're selling them to this mining company yeah now you know they're lobbyists works for the you know heads the Department of the Interior and just like it's over like they're this we're reaching this is an end stage but you know I know what you mean and like God knows like depending on how much how high I am my brain will get really shrill about this is it man this the end stage this is if  apocalypse has happened man man but then then when you go and look gonna take some ketamine well no like I had bolelli on my podcast recently he's a historian the first question I asked miss is is this the end of the world and he's like I don't think so he's like you know like they go in the Black Plague wiped out like what 30% of the people on earth got one year it's certainly times that are filled with adversity and we're there's a restructuring yeah it's the I don't mean it's the end of the world per se but it's the end of the American Empire it's the end of America as a country that other other people around the world looked up to as a model to be emulated well we have a pop song contest to see who controls the nukes and this is the first time that a popular guy that's what it is this is the first time a popular guy entered the popularity contest right who knows how to be popular and there's a bunch of people out there that are pro wrestling fans and they bought right in hook line and sinker yeah and that's and it's not that's a very simplistic version of it there's a lot of other people that wanted to throw a monkey wrench in the system because they thought Hillary Clinton was a crook and she probably is because they're all crooks there's the most most those people at the top are at least in some way up yes whoo Al Franken I know al Frank is just a butt grabber did you read the last like the straw that broke the camel's back the last one where the they all said enough is enough who's in the Atlantic this woman he put that she asked for a photo uh-huh he put his arm around his hand was on her waist he squirrels are fat he squeezed her he's she said he grabbed a handful of flesh which is a weird thing to say but he squeezed her at least twice his her quote at least twice he had his hand on her waist and she said I don't even let my husband touch me that way in public because it demeans me as a professional woman are you kidding me yeah let's I'd like to interview her husband like you now are allowed to put your arm around your wife in public disc Weezer my wife would love to be squeezed the more the more the merrier the idea of it is it's very strange because that that one doesn't make sense the LeAnn tweeting one was the only one that made sense he there's a photo she's unconscious it's demeaning I get the whole thing he apologized for that and rightly so and apparently he tried to kiss her but then the butt grab and is like well he definitely shouldn't be grabbing people's butts but I mean it's a big deal is it what else also do have we stopped I mean Chelsea Handler was on Bill Maher the other night and she said I have to believe these women because I'm a woman and I thought wait a minute does that mean I have to believe all men because I'm a man isn't there any discussion about whether these things are true or not the Akoo Mia said this best he said he put it on Twitter he goes saying all women are liars is just as crazy as saying all women tell the truth right well yeah I think a lot Franken I don't know enough about Franken but a lot of these people it's like like Weinstein wasn't like 40 people or something like that like 40 at least I think when it starts getting up and also what he's accused of is different we're not talking about taking pictures with people they were they like you they want to take a picture with you can you grab their waist we're talking about I mean he's been accused of rape yeah by more than one woman like actual rape rape not just like getting someone drunk and having sex with them but like holding them down type rape yeah there's a lot of he's there's a lot of crazy see here's what's kind of if prostitution was legal would that exist or is it a power thing is it always a power thing like does he want to like have sex with the star of his films because that's I think it's worth question of if if there weren't so many teenage boys who never got laid what would the society look like and by this I don't mean to excuse anyone and I don't mean to say teenage girls should be more promiscuous or anything I'm saying that guys like Harvey Weinstein that dude didn't get laid in high school right most of you you look at these mass shootings a lot of these guys in their in their suicide notes say I'm doing this because I can't get laid I'm gonna die a virgin that's that one begins actually there's this a massive amount of fresh raishin that builds up because biologically most boys are horny little monsters at 13 or 14 they're not getting laid and so it gets to the point so they're there maybe five six years between when a boy is totally obsessed with not just sex but with being acceptable to women being loved by women being touched being caressed you know being it and they can't think about anything else and they're not getting it and so I think a lot of boys grow up with extreme frustration that either kernels into misogyny where you get these like mass killers who do they kill hookers right sexually liberated free women in in their perspective and you get guys that just chase money their whole lives because they think the money and the power is gonna get them those women and so when they get to that place and they're still disgusting and they they sense that the women don't even want to them or they only them because they're gonna get something from them then there's all this self-hatred and shame I think that's what's being expressed here so I think it is power and I do think that it have it's an it's an expression or a manifestation of a deeply sex negative pathological culture but conversely how do you feel about like women that weren't attractive in high school how come they don't lash out in the same way they're not out there rape and do one because I'm down women are much better at accepting their sexual situation you see women have accepted a lot of that men aren't able to accept for you know millennia that's partly biological and probably partly cultural but also because I mean women can have sex even women who aren't particularly attractive because the the the whole market is so skewed in the other direction even women who aren't particularly attractive probably don't have much trouble getting laid in high school I don't think it's just that I think you're boiling it down to getting laid that's a reductionist thing I think it's as much but an unattractive woman who has a hard time finding a boyfriend you know someone who loves her someone who wants to be emotionally connected that probably is just as feeling full to a woman as a guy who can't find maybe more painful yeah then a guy who can't find sex partner in psychology they say that men express their their these feelings through anger and women through depression and sadness so you probably don't see women lashing out and killing a bunch of dudes you see them being depressed and feeling like  and when you do they have high testosterone that's why another point to be made here is is that like you know people do say the thing oh well like people like Harvey Weinstein they wanted all this money to get laid but I don't I do not think that's it I think what people like Harvey Weinstein probably enjoy is power it's not like oh I want to get late I'm gonna become this massive it's like I like to dominate I'm a dominating force that's what I am I'm going to I enjoy like having people around me who worship me and as part of that I'm going to dominate my interns I'm gonna dominate my employees and when I'm around women I'm gonna use my I'm gonna jerk off in house plants in front I mean it's like really a ficus but you know you got it you got it really think about that it's like I don't I don't I know what you're saying how poor Harvey Weinstein when he was in front of the guy does not what does onii-san well I the thing of they do he's not getting touched enough well no no but it's like this is that there's a lot of frustration that's inherently connected to this suppressive sexual culture that we find ourselves embroiled in that we don't necessarily agree with right now why are these little boys why right you know because one that's the only access they have to they're less likely to tell on them and three there's self-hatred I just recidivism I like to do a little thought experiment which is I like to imagine what where my heads got to be if I jerk off into a house plant in front of somebody if you do if you have tried that just just think about it like where which what's going on with you Christmas tree yeah I might be like you just celebrating if you jerk off in the plant the plants can absorb but he's just leave it as DNA all over the place it's probably good for the plant it's terrible for plant not my juice Weinstein is great for plants bro plants alive it's running for Senate alpha come coming soon from on it you can really sell your right I don't want anybody don't you think that all these things it's I think it's certainly this sex is it's not just a power thing because he's not just exercising power he's exercising power in a sexual way yeah it's not just power I think it's a game like we were talking about like corporations and even police officers and guys like Jeff Sessions who have the game to arrest people that is the game they play they get really good at it that's what the game is the game with a guy like him is I can't believe I get to what's her name you know name famous actress and that famous actress is on her stomach and your mouth her like whoa really yeah it's really happening and it why is it really happening it's happening because you're gonna let her be Catwoman or whatever the the movie is right yeah there's there's some nuttiness to it there is some craziness there's some forbidden thing to it there's some there's a bunch of a bunch of things in play Powers one of the dynamics it's just the most foul one because they're all the other ones like the sexual frustration and stuff doesn't seem so gross it's like when you when you you're you're imposing your will on someone then it's unquestionably it's an expression of power like once you were raping once you're coercing once you're imposing your will and you're saying yeah I'm gonna take away your career if you don't let me have sexual intercourse with you well then it's a hundred percent power thing yeah like how did it get there there's a lot of things and I think you know to go along I just power I mean I I guess I have an exercise sufficient power in my life to know the answer to this question but does does dominance feel good directly or is it is it something that comes to you indirectly so in other words does it feel good to dominate someone else or only because then you can get something that you want from them I think it's something that you want from them and I think there's there's also there's I think human beings are connected to each other in an undeniable way and I think that if you are exercising power over someone like say if you hate to paint the scenario but just save you rape someone you were sexually attractive someone you're along with you and you rape them and if you have any conscience at all if you you know they're screaming no and you're still having sex with them and you come and then after what you have to think about it like you would be horrified at yourself the level of self-hatred would be almost unimaginable you've imposed yourself and your twisted sickness that in the heart of that moment you know the the the power dynamic trying to impose the power it can't possibly feel good I think it's just a thing I think it's just a almost like a creepy leftover reptilian instinct that that creatures have because if you look at rape in nature and this is not to exonerate rapist is not to normalize rape but it's insanely common in the animal kingdom right it's all it's in common and ducks it's in common in all sorts of different animals yeah orangutan ruthless and it's tough because there a lot of primatologists are women and they learned the hard way from what I've heard that you always wear jeans if you're working with orangutans oh Jesus Christ arepa tanks awful but this that this thing we're supposed to be evolved past that and for the most part by far and above we are right if you think about all these sexual harassment interactions now imagine if they were chimps you know I mean imagine if they were orangutans the rape is the common thing you could never have a bunch of Ranga tangs in some sort of a building and people will go oh of course we're better than a rank tanks we are that's why we don't rape as much but it is problematic to use the word rape when you're talking about animals because part of it is the way you described it that there's no knowledge on some level that this female is not into what's happening right now whereas presumably an orangutan doesn't have that knowledge and also there are animals where the female is triggered to ovulate by aggressive male behavior that we might call raping right right like rabbits you bite the back of their neck and that's what makes the female ovulate well that's there's a lot of weird stuff when it comes to women's what what is sexually attractive to certain women and what arouses them great fantasies is the number one yeah yeah a lot of women like to be choked you know like what's happening there like why why do you like to be choked why do you like to get your arms pinned behind your back and why do you like to fight back like you actually like it you want me to do that I'm gonna hold both your wrists okay you're sure like there's a lot of tying up going on out there really but when it comes to like S&M or bondage that one I think one of the big misconceptions when it comes to that is that if you're being tied up or if you're tying somebody up that there's like anger happening situation it's one of the most sweet loving trusting things that you can beautiful yeah it's really like I don't think thankful easily celibate I've spent I spent a lot of time in dungeons actually [Laughter] it's like it's a healing sweet beautiful thing there's a difference between that rough so like I mean I personally find it not to try to not it doesn't turn me on at all largely because it's so choreographed hmm you know there's all the outfits and the this and now we're gonna do that and you know there's a for Addison right yeah but I mean I have been in those environments and as Duncan says it's like the opposite of out of control it's totally in control totally worth it's the difference between a gun range and a war right yeah oh the last time I was a gun range I ended up bleeding from a head what happened I was with my buddy Justin and we were shooting this is up in Washington State weird I was shooting his uh I don't remember what a 30-30 or something and scoped he had he was had this big elk gun that he was trying to scope in and he was like man I'm not you're shooting really well can you just take a shot at few shots on this and see if your and I I just grabbed it and didn't think that it was a totally different gun yeah and I just want the poom in the scope went right into my forehead all these like macho dudes you know I'm exposed as the idiot hey I think the range we went to shoot at burnt down did you hear about that no I would imagine it did I would imagine now well recently yeah yeah was there's definitely fires in that area I mean the fires are so out of control especially that out towards Santa Barbara and Ventura yeah that's no that's the worst you know what I keep thinking what if the big one hits like shit's gonna catch on fire on the big one heads and all the roads are gonna be up the infrastructure is gonna be messed up it's get that like this is like without a massive earthquake what happens if the what if the big one hit right now right our broken trucks can't get there yeah yeah it could be a giant issue and you have toxic clouds the stuff too because all these warehouses going not only that if the big one hits it's entirely publicly it's not just gonna hit here but it also hits in the ocean in which case we get hit with a tsunami which case all that super expensive real estate in Malibu just gets wiped away yeah yeah I'm good up until panga though yeah probably scavenge if you're not good up in Topanga we're really leave it to me dude to get back to the topic you're talking about it's the what's hat is what the thing that's happening is people are realizing stuff that nobody ever really wanted to talk like if you if you ever watched like Porky's or if you watch any of the movies from the 70s like the make-out scenes like the guys are like come on baby come here what are you doing they're like throwing themselves something they're doing things in movies that we're just considered like yeah that's how that's I guess that's how it's done you're like you they're forcing themselves like scenes I think with like Bill Murray maybe or scenes in the old movies with all those so many of them Pepe LePew you know what I mean yes see when you when you're seeing like this like you're see much yeah it's crazy when you go back and look and you realize like man what's happening is like 50 moves from the 50s where the guy will just grab the woman yes sir things are changing is what's happening and and yes and and as things change like the two things we need to figure out number one we have to admit like yeah I get it man like you know for me like hanging out with you doing the podcast with you I know here's one thing I know man I'm pretty sure at least you don't want to me didn't look at me when he said I was just totally left out for just a chapter in your next book like but you know research Duncan with with like with with what's happening with women is because a lot of dudes and I'm sorry this is a shocking thing to say a lot of dudes are in positions of power and what's happening with women is like who want to be actors you're one it whatever you want to like do it do stuff when they're getting around these guys they don't have that assurance they're not like this guy doesn't want to they're probably thinking this guy wants to me when these are women who most guys wanna yes yeah so it's especially if you talking about Harvey Weinstein these hot actresses and the the real strange thing is you have that unquestionably yeah and then you have women that want have to have nothing to do with that part of the business they don't they're not trying to be seductive they just want to work yeah they want to act and then they have to deal with all this that's it but then you got women who sneak into that mix and they're willing not only they willing they're manipulative and they're seductive and they they're trying to make their way up the ladder that way they exist there it's a much smaller percentage but they exist - well sure their whole society is set up to make women think that the only thing they have to trade is their sexuality don't think there's anything wrong with these women agreeing to do a film with not even Harvey Weinstein anyone and then he says I'll give you more parts if you  me and the girl wants to do it and she does it like I think it's gross but it's not gross if it's not gross to her do you know I'm saying write it so it's a weird thing it's only gross if it's grossed like look it's gross being around a guy like Harvey Weinstein right if he's yelling at people and he's fat and sweating all over the place it's gross yeah unless it's not gross unless you like that kind of guy right like you might bears yeah guys are into bears yeah but might you might like that yeah right so at what point er we are we taking away women's agency right when we say that that should never you shouldn't be able to give a guy a blowjob and get a part in a movie yeah it's weird right it's like you should be able to pay for things but you shouldn't be able to pay for things with sex why not right let's George Carlin's things you can buy things and you can have sex but you can't buy sex like yeah well it's it's strange it's strange because I don't think it's necessarily illegal in a barter sense like say it review dinner yeah like say if you had some woman and she wanted to paint your house but and it was a bad example oh you wanted to paint her house how about this she wants you to paint that yeah she says I'm not gonna pay you but it will suck your dick and you're like okay yeah like that's a deal yeah seems like a good deal like you want to do that she's like yeah I want to do I want to suck your dick big I also want you to pay my house I mean look at some girl depends on who it is it's Angelina Jolie and she's 25 roller take a long time to finish though like you're both into it and this is nigga ghin I have to be super clear about this but I'm not exonerate and rape or sexual harassment or predatory behavior what I am saying is we have a weird it's weird that we separate commerce from intimacy when it comes to sex and it's the only type of intimacy you can get massaged in your underwear I do it all the time where women will be talking to me about you know well my kids going to school at this place and he really likes wrestling but the problem is they're discontinuing the program and while they're doing that she's digging her elbow in my back and I'm in pain but I'm I'm in my underwear alone in a room with this lady and I'm having a nice conversation with her while she's being intimate with me I mean that's essentially what's going on there's oil involved they're massaging neck and it feels really good as long as you don't shoot any fluid out of your body we allow that you get a woody when you're getting a massage it definitely moves I try to stay calm and Zen though I put myself in a peaceful place worse when your dick starts getting more you're getting a platonic massage and you're like what you're like preparing your apology yeah but it's because being touch we're also touched starved yeah you know in in this society that I think people have a hard time distinguishing between Pleasant touch and eroticism yeah or between good sex and love you know we mix it all together because we're so unfamiliar with it you know so those would be levels - prostitution - right like what wouldn't be good you have to tell us what would be the problem with someone who say was a woman who just did not have a desire to have a family liked her freedom didn't want to work a regular job but she likes having sex with men that she likes so she picks a few men maybe she's got a small roster of like 10 guys who her and they rotate no you can't do Tuesday Mike's doing Tuesday yeah okay um Wednesday yeah Wednesday at work this is happening there's a lot of this I just was visiting with a friend of mine who does this really yeah there's a website forget what it's called it's not friends with benefits but it's their websites and there's a whole like name for these sugar daddies and you know sugar daddy sites well the guys know it's like okay look we're gonna and the way she described it was there's no it's no set price it's not like a thousand bucks to  me or whatever it's it's like we get together if I like you waved in or whatever and yeah and then you want to get together again next weekend okay you want to take me to Malibu okay we'll go to Malibu and then he's money showing up in my account or not yeah and if it's not then I'm deciding do I want to keep seeing this dude for nothing you know or it was 150 bucks you know and then it's like and she's like different guys depending how much money they have they give her more or less and so she can just decide at any time as she wants to continue the relationship and she doesn't consider herself a prostitute and he go to someplace like Thailand it's it's I met this dude in Nepal years ago who explained to me the whole dude the whole deal because I've spent a lot of time in Thailand but I've never been able to wrap my head around and I was horny as hell but I couldn't wrap my head around the thing how it worked because you know getting back to your rape thing to me the most demeaning experience in the world would be to find myself in a sexual situation and realize that the woman doesn't want to be there right you know it's like oh my god that's just like I feel so ugly yeah so to be with a Thai woman and there's all this confusion and she doesn't she's acting like she wants to do this man anyway this guy explained to me he goes to to Thailand there's a woman he knows there if she's not around she look him up with a friend of hers but basically he'll travel with her for a month or two take her all over Thailand she translates she gets them better deals on rooms and food and everything she knows what to order and tie lines very cool about prostitution it's Buddhist that doesn't have this anti sex thing that we have so it's no big deal right as far as the Thai people are concerned and and at some point on that trip they'll go to the village where she grew up and they'll meet her family and he'll be like yeah your mother's refrigerators looking kind of old does she need a new refrigerator oh that would be great and they go buy a refrigerator and give it to the mother and the mother super happy and that's the yeah that's it mmm there's no money changing hands it's a gift so it's very much like what you're describing it's insects it's not for the sex there's sex there's friendship there's translation there's you know saving me money and telling me the best places to go but it's like a guide right and sex is just part of that it's a very it's it's it's hard to conceive from our cultural perspective that it actually works that way I don't think there would be anything wrong with a woman deciding to have sex with a bunch of men for money I don't think there's anything wrong with it I think the real dangers comes in to having sex with someone you don't know you know if you're a streetwalker and some guy picks you up and wants to kill you that's the real danger the real danger is not in like clientele unless of course one of them is a  psycho but I think that can happen on a tender day yeah I think we are we're operating under the echoes of the Puritans and I think as grown adults deep into art I mean I mean I'm 50 now how old do you 55 the idea that we're still under and you're 43 imagine being under this the whims of some people who died you know hundreds of years ago had a complete ignorance to human psychology physiology to sexual urges to genetics their what they knew then is literally flavoring the way we behave today and so insanely suppressive it's good point I also have a point about all this sexual harassment stuff that's uncomfortable and this is those environments become your world if you are in an office eight hours a day that is most of your day yeah most of your waking conscious day you're spending in this one area and people they start behaving like that's the world and you start becoming sexually attracted to the people that are in your world and some people reciprocate and some do not some people are frustrated and some are not and some people are gross and they're in a position of power in that weird and I think maybe that guy wouldn't sexually harass in the big world but in this little world where everything's like jammed in together and you have these clearly defined things like this guy's got a plaque on his desk that says the boss right and you got to come in he's got the desk come on shut the door shut the door or if you like now Lauer you got a button where you lock the door click come on inside we've got to discuss we've got to review your progress this month click this is the world I mean if he I'm not exonerating Matt Lauer can't believe I have to say this again but if you're in that guy's world and I don't even know what he did I didn't pay attention met him once he was quite a gentleman but he's in this he's got to be working 10 12 hours a day you're doing the Today Show yeah it's insanely competitive that morning TV thing you have to be on the ball you you have meetings you have stuff to review you have guest are you there gonna review your performance and your conversations and people and well Matt you know whenever you start talking about sex people drop off look we've got the numbers we have the chart in the directory relation to what you were saying earlier is what I read about Matt Lauer was that he couldn't have sex with just normal people because he's famous and he's you know get in trouble he's married so he had to maintain the facade of that he and he couldn't have sex with other famous people because that would come out into the press so he had to have sex with people who weren't famous who weren't just normal people and that left their office and that was it yeah so imagine if we lived in a world where we said who gives a if Matt Lauer's someone other than his wife that's between them the 60s again back when Dustin Hoffman was grabbing titties you guys ever seen by the way I started the last word on this for me anyway the people who are acting shocked and outraged around Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose are full of that's what that's what kills me the hypocrisy of the people who've been working with them for years and going I had no idea I heard about Charlie Rose being a creep 15 years ago and I don't even work in media you know right it's like the Bill Cosby thing if you see if you guys seen this is like one of one of the grossest things you can witness in a workplace is when the boss starts giving neck rubs you ever seen that a neck rub and boss though it is it is so creepy to watch a big married secretary do so how are you doing today Carol rubbing her neck just and she we could see the look on her face frozen she's got kids she's if she says to him hey do you mind I don't really want you to touch me right now he's gonna go oh I'm sorry but then she doesn't know down the line down the line when he's doing employer reviews and he's thinking you know what ruin that time I just wanted to rub her back man but I'm not rubbing any of the dudes backs in the office now that man that is up and that is one of the sleaziest slimy as things and to imagine when you're the boss to imagine that these bosses they're oblivious they just don't know there's one of given neck rubs they're not aware like come on they can feel it as he's rubbing their back if you can't feel their Adams trying to escape your sweaty goddamn male dominators how many guys become friends with women half air tag friends just so they just creeping closer almost like you're stalking big game and you want to just move yes yes what they're doing one of the classics that's how I hunt elk I walk real slow here with a neck rope I try not to make my intentions known that is what's happening in these environments I think when people work in offices together they get attracted to each other Whitney Cummings has a hilarious bit about it I won't I won't do it justice I'm not gonna say it but she talks about working in an office because she's she works on Roseann you know she's on she's on the staff like she's in an office all the time she's like this is what people do it's this weird environment and office romances are her they're so common they're so common the sample together there and if you're if you're married to some guy and he said he's the big boss and says that on his brass plate the big boss and the big boss has a secretary with a big ass and big tits and she's friendly and he's alone with her all day all day all day every day every week and she's calling at home because she's on top of the appointments and she's made as his planes oh I I have Mike's flight arrangements I just wanted to call it in the wife I still listen listen this bitch all day slowly taking her power away sucking away her influence till one day can't take it anymore he's like you know it's things at home I mean if carol was like you Carol doesn't understand me I was just such a bitch to me sometimes it's it's crazy because you give her so much you provide her so much I mean she's like she doesn't know any woman gonna be in Carol's place you know me you work with Carol doesn't understand me yeah unless you've got the sexual novelty kick in in right where he's been banging in Carol's for 15 years they got kids they got a mortgage they got stress yeah Denise Denise with a ruby red lipstick and her long nails well it's the whole thing is just like I've office and all that just like the whole thing is kind of unsavory but like the the and yeah for sure office romances I hope they do have a nope everyone in offices is happily them all day long that's glory but like man when you think about that much work done when you think about  being Denise right right and who's this dude's name Mike to run like Maury money when you're denier Denise and you got this job right and there's Mike and Mike's a asshole man mike is not you're not a different story than my story yeah yeah I know Mike just had a lot of responsibility but I thought Mike's a big burly guy maybe eats a little too much and I drink a lot of work responsible man Mike smells like onions is farts or like is mine it's farts are just hell and even potentially Denise's ex-husband man Denise has a kid yeah no nice has a kid with a guy whose real piece of neck I'm saying what's happening right now right now what's happening is there's been a lot of  slimy massages that have been going on yep I'm gonna guess for about five thousand years there's been like 20,000 years of slimey massages has been building up like the Yellowstone super caldera and in the like epigenetic DNA of women there is probably somewhere encoded in there just millennia of creepy massages that don't stop with the massage depending on what time period you're in you know and so I think that what we're feeling right now is the result of generations of creepy massages and much much worse happening and women are like this this sucks were sick of it we're sick of your creepy massages and that's what it is and some women I mean imagine man I've met there's one time at a Blockbuster Video used to work at a Blockbuster Video and my boss was this like just a sleazy like just a slimy gay dude I didn't like him he made us clean the videotapes and they didn't need to be clean it's like come on man these tapes are clean spray and  videotapes down I remember late at night he we that we there's like the area where the cash register is is this closed-off cubical place I'm down I'm down on my knees man having to getting something from underneath there and this dude like hops up on the  counter and he stretches his legs out in front of me he's like spread-eagle 'he's his legs out it's like Blockbuster khaki pants on curling up but you can see the outline of his boss balls in there and in like and he's like you I mean he's hey you never there's nothing more unappealing than boss balls accentuated by khaki no and you're looking up there and he's looking down at you the Power has been accentuated he's looking down at you and he's just saying you did a good job today you did a good job today Duncan and I'm like thinking like this is this is truly got to be one of the circles of hell right now because like this dude quit is hitting on me right now I'm getting paid minimum he's hitting on you for sure dude his legs are spread I don't know no can I'm under than just doing you can I prove it Yeah right I don't even think people were doing yoga in North Carolina this time if he was a woman you would assume that those actions would indicate that she would want sexual intercourse I'm saying there was a feeling now whether I could prove it or whether it was just me or whatever Oh I mean what up 20s I don't know but there was a feeling that this sucks man there's like more going on here right this sucks that's is it a legal is it like could I is it even sexual harassment no no but it sucks it's like it's sucks dude and that that that is the is what a lot of women have been dealing with for a long time and they they're pissed yeah and they're rightfully they're rightfully pissed because it's like who wants to be dominated like that if I'm getting dominated I want to be paying for it you know what I mean I don't want it ya know no doubt man I really do think there's something to this idea that humans aren't meant to be in these small areas totally enclosed in together with each other all day I don't think we're designed for it and I just don't I think that's an intimate environment as weird as it sounds and this is not saying that men and women can't work together and be totally you know plutonic and they absolutely can yeah but it's it's a super unnatural behavior natural environment to be in these cubicles these small little boxed in offices working day in day out with people smelling them and you know I think we should outlaw offices yes yeah we'll get you done we could fix the roads we'll figure it out yeah and figured out we were talking about something earlier that I wrote down cuz I wanted to remember it you were saying about Bob Dylan's version of all along the watchtower versus Jimi Hendrix yeah I think Jimi Hendrix was amazing but Bob Dylan's was his and he wrote it and there was something cool about listen those words even it wasn't like as pleasing orally but there's a if you go to Cat Power official you know Cat Power is saying she has a video up today that she put on her Instagram she's got a great Instagram and a video up today of Bob Dylan in like the 1960s in Paris getting all these really dumb questions thrown at him and he's doing like this press conference he sitting there smoking cigarettes he looks like he's like 25 years old and they're they're yelling things at them and asking them questions like what like see did you find it yeah pull it listen to this listen it's kind of crazy man do you agree that you should be the leader of singers well that's why you probably think the first records are better why is because I feel like singing dusty Naveed something you learn something particularly special to express when you're saying yo you know this is this is a folk song mr. folks are listening folks are how weird huh yeah weird French but how weird is that like seeing this is essentially like the same dumb questions you'd get on Twitter yeah [Laughter] there's some performance artists who hired security for himself and a camera man and he walked through Times Square pretending to be super famous and they they had other people like at the periphery studying the crowd reaction to this staged famous person walking through Times Square no I forget I wouldn't I don't know how to tell Jamie to look for it but it's incredible they interview people right who are like who've seen him and there's two huge black dudes and a guy with a camera and he's like walking around like he's you know some superstar and they interview people around is this damn Jamie you are faster so this is him by himself normally I guess security with a suit on and security and I remember they asked people like he what do you think of whatever name it is and one of the dudes is like well I really liked his early stuff and this was not one of the guys that was payoff this is another person on the street just making it a random video yeah that's so hilarious well I've had that happen to me before will someone come up and ask me for a picture and then another guy will pull out his phone I go who are you man yeah I'm like them nobody get a picture with you two I know who you are yeah you don't know who I am so why would you want a picture winner that's crazy just don't grab his waist yeah if you if you double pinched my fat I will call yeah yeah double pinched my fat I mean you've done tens of thousands of photos yeah after your shows you always go out there and you take a photo there anymore oh really weird shows got too big no yeah like the Belko theater I just didn't know are you doing really big yeah it's too bad news I'll do it still the Icehouse and stuff like that but sometimes people they they have an agenda it's not just to say hi you know and they just want to monopolise not monopolize your time they don't care for people around you and you run into those people and you don't know what it's just too much work yeah it's crazy you did that man that was crazy you did that that was put that's crazy I remember thinking man it's a lot of times Shanon out there did it for 3,700 people didn't have like an extra couple of hours to you're there for two hours yeah a second show immune system cuz when you think of all this like when you think like it's like we could take your hand after shaking 3,000 people's hands there's never that many people with the 3700 it might have been a thought let's take your hand and if we could put it under like a scanning microscope you know much do you think is on your hand after one of those nights probably like a pretty lots of lots of stuff lots of come-come what is false what ya pickin stuff's gotta be some period blood on my hands some fightin you knows man maybe like pizza put pizzas and polonium a lot of weed some weed yeah you never know yeah people slip weed into your pocket or something hand it to me they put it in my hand I was telling I can't first of all I get too much weed you saw anybody trying to give me weed please don't give me any weed I get too much weed yeah and then second of all I can't I don't know you right now just take your weed I just can't and I can't I wish I could I wish I could I'm sure you cool you know sure you are but I have kids somebody gave me somebody gave me ayahuasca after a show I'll just drink it right there on this boat it's like it was a with black no murky water he's like it's ayahuasca I remember taking it back to my hotel looking at it and for a second thinking like you know what would happen if I drank ayahuasca and a Holiday Inn like good one how bad would that trip be be wonderful then ceiling would open up you'll be propelled right through it yeah it's the same stuff that William Hurt drank in altered states bro this is the real I got saved in the Tupperware just shake it first dude once once once I got I was I got home after a show that I've flown and someone had given me this framed picture and I have this framed picture I don't know what the art was is like a skull or something I wasn't somehow like I ended up like pulling the thing open and inside the picture was a joint the guide shoved a joint into the picture and I had flown with it yeah so if they had if they had like seen if they'd open that  up right they would have seen a joint and I would have had to been like nah man somebody gave that to me at a show this happy yeah yeah sure dumbass trying to smuggle one joint yeah so it's dangerous it's like tricky man you can really get in try had an interesting experience recently and he throw I don't know if did you want to talk about this in New York anyway I was flying through Heathrow and I had a connecting flight missed the connecting flight but whatever there's another one two hours later so I'm going through security because you have to like go again through security at Heathrow when you're coming from outside Europe and I'm standing there waiting they take my bag for a secondary check and and I see the woman talk to like the boss and he says we'll use the other one over there so she takes my bag over to this other security line that's not functioning and she runs it through the machine there she comes back and they talked for a minute and he comes over to me and he says you and I have to have a conversation Wow I said I'm okay he said what'd he do I'm like a writer psychologist and he's like yeah but what do you do what hobbies do you have I was like hobbies like and I literally I said dude I'm 55 I jerk off and go to bed I don't any hobbies and he didn't smile and he's like you have a garden oh you work with animals no like I don't know like fertilizer something fertilizer residue got on use that for bombs yeah so he's nitrogen right he's like well you haven't told me a story that makes sense so I have to call the police it's like what are you talking about he's like well night-night nitrates mm-hmm I set off the machines shut off the other machine they're never wrong you're gonna have to sit down right there and wait and he tells this other guy watch him don't let him go anywhere like yeah I'm gonna make a run for it in Heathrow and these cops show up dude and there were like nine cops and body armor like surrounded me mm-hmm you know it was like wow this is what it feels like to go down right but you are also a 55 year old white guy who's obviously well-educated and you know you're not speaking with a weird accent exactly yeah that's what I'm thinking so if I were black or whatever forget I would have been terrified did you see the video that I posted to the guy that got gunned down so horrific unbelievable it's murder it was murder and also why do you have to crawl across the floor house they put your hands over your head and we come over and cuff you because they wanted to clear the room he's near the room they didn't want him to be too close to the room the room was slightly around the corner but the way the guy escalated it was playing a game of Simon Says with them and yeah yeah I will  shoot you and did shoot him for just reaching back to grab his pants as his pants were falling down as he was crawling I mean it was he will in no way looked like he was doing something dangerous but the most disturbing thing was how many people in the comments after I posted that video on Twitter were saying you know that he didn't comply they were like saying clean kill he didn't comply it's a clean clean shooting clean kill come on Joe come on Joe that's a clean kill and only that the guy was drunk yeah he's young yeah you know it's an open carry state by the way he was white yeah he was white yeah this is not like sake of the guy who killed him yeah monster scary-looking dude man Jaime keep your eye that demon he said your form you're and then I should say I'm and then the other thing was they didn't let the jury look at the video they thought it would taint them like it would taint their opinion like what are you talking about really need to see that video that video is there's the guy what the  yeah Jesus Christ man yeah you know what to go get beat up a lot in high school and there's that old expression if you give someone a hammer everything looks like a nail yeah if that's the only tool you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail and you given this young guy who's obviously psycho and the way he gun that guy down I mean that that was insane just insane and the idea that this represents two human beings in an interaction and that one human being has that much power of the other one that he can yell at I'm screaming I'm totally escalate the situation not deescalate you know and that he's got his gun out by the way which you're in an open carry state so if the guy did have a toy gun or whatever they they said he had and he's holding his toy gun and someone calls the police you are allowed to have a toy gun you're allowed to have a gun gun in Arizona I carry state he was an exterminator and he had like 22s or something that he used for extermination in the room and somebody saw through the window him holy oh right yeah yeah but you know what man those are legal yeah things like unless someone just got completely hysterical and called and said hey the guy's pointing the gun out the window at people and this is the message they got and the cops don't know when they show up but when you see that guy and that woman and you should see their body language as they're walking down the hallway super casual they're not walking like people that are about to kill people right they comply immediately the guy's begging for his life please don't shoot me the whole thing was horrific yeah yeah and so I mean this gets back to we're talking about the women this moment in history where women are tired of the sleazy hand robbers I think we're also at the moment where non-white people are tired of being gunned down everybody is everybody well but it doesn't show it's everyone it shows it happens to white people sometimes but imagine the black guys I mean you're right I got a sucker key homeless dude yeah and they throw those grenades and he starts running yeah there was this happened like two years ago there was a home this guy sleeping right out in the the bush somewhere near Albuquerque and the cops come out and they throw a flash a flash grenade scares the out of him he jumps up starts running away they got him down from the back they shoot him in the back as he's running away and it's like and they're acquitted I mean it's it's nuts there isn't there's no accountability and so but the thing that I you know though what's the line that I think is Benjamin Franklin or one of the founding fathers said that the police the revolution kidding the revolution occasionally has to be like fed with the blood of sometimes be watered with the blood of patriots and martyrs don't you think there's like a cleansing revolution that has to happen every once in awhile I think what we're experiencing now is people well what we're getting from information right and where we're getting from this use of the Internet is the ability to spread information instantaneously this video could have existed decades ago and we have never seen it you know and there would be no need for potty cameras back then either they didn't have the technology so now they do everyone has to have a body camera this guy did this knowing he was filming it which is even more insane like imagine this guy completely unfiltered right oh yeah he might have just done that guy down for the of it as soon as he saw him I mean he might be a just a guy looking to shoot people which is real well no this is the thing that we're this is like you're saying oh well you know priests or molesting kids and when why well a lot I don't know why they're all oh as well so like so many are doing it but one thing's for sure sociopaths and people who are trying to do up  wait what was that your tenth saying about what's-her-name asa akira well you were saying that she liked DP No yeah well What did he say she said she was joking on this podcast any other shoes like it you know I think I've gained the system because what I love the most in sex is DP and that's what they pay them up for now that's what you'll be being double double trace people who aren't up yeah what that shows that's a person who figured out truly you figured out how to make money doing what she loves and so in the same way when you have these sociopaths these pedophiles who want to make a career we want to figure out a way to do what they're doing while while like sustaining themselves well they're like oh I'll just become a priest if I become a priest I'm gonna happen it's all power we're all talking power dynamics here because it's like it's not enough that you're an older man and you're it's some helpless kid but on top of that you're a representative of the creative force of the universe you're like the spokesperson for the universe the power dynamic there is a is this almost as skewed as it can get and in the same way that guy that guy no I mean you think when that guy goes home he's like listening to sounds of waterfalls and and taking baths with lavender candles that guy's that guy goes home and he just probably just punches a brick wall he just punches walls he's a that guy is not a happy dude hugger and he likes to dominate people and he wants to be in control and he wants to have power and he got himself into a job where he could be a get paid to be the worst kind of murderous bully there is and that's what's really happening is that we have in our society monsters and the monsters are smart and they're figuring out ways to get in the positions of power and we before the bloody revolution we just need to come up with better ways to scan for these  assholes so that we can keep them out of these positions of power not only not scan for them we encourage them the system is built in such a way that they're encouraged I mean it's no accident that we end up with Psychopaths as president who the else would want to do that right who seeks that's why about Psychopaths I don't either I think Obama and Jimmy Carter or two real exceptions to that well wait well let we have two I don't think psychopathy is the right word for it but we do do you do kind have to come up with like maniacs well you need to come up with a definition of terms right so it's like for example like Obama like you could have to come up with in arguable things like Obama for sure ordered drone strikes that killed people so if you order a drone strike and it kills people are you a murderer that's a question are you a murderer if you order a drone strike and it kills people and the numbers insane the number of innocence is in the high 80s but does that make you a murderer does that make you a murderer 80,000 no percent Oh a percent oh it's like if you have with the number of innocents killed by drone strikes I think it's in somewhere in the 80 range nine percent range that was would that make him a murderer like is it safe to say when you're like using adjectives for him you could say well okay well he has could you say he has murdered people could you say this that we have an infantile view of what the president is because there are so many tasks and so many human beings and so many things that are connected to him that the idea that he is the one giving all the orders for all these different things that are happening all over the world is kind of absurd it's like a monotheistic God or the daddy we really need to go to a more community-based understanding of religion of politics of everything there shouldn't be one person in charge of everything one guy just think about two massive issues geopolitics and and finance these are two things like yeah that the the government is supposed to have their hands on they're after supposed to be able to control the way we interact with world leaders all sorts of weird military dictatorships and the Middle East and in North Korea we have to interact with all of these countries hundreds of countries then on top of that he's responsible for job growth like what yeah who is this guy right what else is he doing he's ordering Jones trikes he's ordering drone strikes - what else is doing he's keeping pot illegal that son of a bitch he's appointment in court judges he's drilling in Alaska he's cutting a new road through the Salmon River like he they're doing he's did one guy who one guy doing any one guy with a full-time job doing any one of those being responsible for the decisions is crazy for any one of those things yeah yes you're the public face of the world do you notice the Trump and I used to think that people are exaggerating but he's losing his he's micro strokes I think he's he's slurring his words now law and he drinks 12 cans of diet coke a day apparently which made me maybe fake news they might be with us I don't know but he watches eight hours of television a day it's the perfect representative of America look at this nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets during one five-month period of operation between January 2012 and February 2013 okay well why did they hate us but why do they hate well let's talk about the psychopaths I'd rhythm let's talk about the Psychopaths idea like what is a psychopath I mean this is a very special kind of murder that's happening here it's like you know okay let's take the classic example God may rest in peace Charles Manson one of the things he always said is I never killed anybody man I never killed anybody and it's true I don't think he ever killed anybody I just Watson did all the killing yes so in with Manson it's like Jesus Christ that guy is truly I mean he really is one of the classics he's amazing he's like one of the most entertaining entertaining psychopaths in America it may be ever he's really great actor he's a great musician but he's but the thing is like okay we know Manson that guy was out of his Gore we ate your garbage yeah yeah you call it a garbage dump I call it a goldmine but like you take somebody like that and it's like okay clearly nuts but then you take someone like Obama or any American president who's killed so many more people or ordered people to kill so many more people many of those people are children and they're dressed in a suit and they're dapper and they're charismatic I mean if Obama walked into the room right now I'd be like wow mom oh wow great to meet you but then you see your boss balls you know well you know how I'm thrown strikes get a proved now lawyers what from the defense of our lawyers lawyers ultimately make the call whether or not drone strikes get approved I dude they get together with lawyers that's the that's the they have a target save the targets an apartment building they have a Geo locator on the target like whatever it is whether it's a metadata from someone's cell phone that indicates the cell phones in this particular area how big of a target is this how much of a risk is it what's the benefits of and they'll literally get together with lawyers this is according to a guy that I know that used to be one of the bigwigs of the CIA he's like this is what happens are they worried about getting sued or what they're worried about the legality of it how it's gonna be perceived whether or not you can be tried as a war criminal for this Wow yeah like it's not just the scary thing is not just that 90% are unintended targets it's that they know going in that they're gonna kill a bunch of unimpressed got him down like you saw that Collateral Murder video which is what put WikiLeaks on the map yeah when they released that video that showed those guys gunning down and there's a minivan and these kids in the van and the guys literal reaction is shouldn't have brought the kids shouldn't have brought the kids we had a gun you down up whoops turns out that wasn't a gun it was a camera my bad I mean they're gunning you down with blurry images from the sky and then when when they killed kids or thought they killed kids I think the kids survived they were like shouldn't have brought the kids yet not and that's what's really wild about it is that freedom we don't yet freedom the tree of Liberty we gotta water it what do you want the thing to wither yeah but this is the this is that to me this is the most interesting thing about living in the United States is the way that you generally don't think about that stuff like you just don't think about it's not a thing that you were like what are you gonna do it's like you know it's happening you know we've been doing it you know we've done it over and over and over and over and over again but really nobody what can we do you vote you're low low be politically active and maybe you can get somebody in power who isn't gonna kill a bunch of people but inevitably they keep killing a bunch of people they keep doing it and we keep ignoring it and that is one of the creepiest things because it's the it's like all right when here in the United States when a cop guns down somebody thank God most people freaked out like that video that that you you tweeted we all look at the video we're like my god how did that guy get off the hook we should look at his picture he's a monster but probably today I don't know for sure but this week certainly this month some people got exploded by the United States right how does that happen I mean that's not the thing about drones is they don't really they don't tell you right we're launching drone strikes and then like like let's talk about Yemen where all the weapons that Saudi Arabia is using to starve and destroy the many population came from the United States hmm so and the pilots are trained by us and so we've got our drones blowing people up but also we've totally armed this country that's destroying this other country and you know they know that it says USA on the bomb fragments that's so up yeah yeah I don't know sorry - I don't know I don't know if this will derail it but you know we were talking about Sam Harris earlier and and the the beef I have it's not a beef but the disagreement that I have with him around his Islam thing is that he totally discounts the role of u.s. foreign policy in creating the toxic environment that gives rise to things like Isis so to ensure that he totally discounts that because I don't think that's true well honestly I don't you know a lot more about Sam than I do but some of my friends and listeners would be like listen it's a convenient talking point I don't think he does I listened to one podcast he did where he was responding to this article in the the the publication of Islamic Jihad or something and he was like look this is what I'm talking about like all you know non-muslims should be killed and blah blah he's going through this whole thing and it's been a year since I listened to it so you know apologies to Sam if I'm misremembering this but what I remember thinking at the time was he he said something like well there are people who think that it's u.s. foreign policy but that's ridiculous this is Islam this is Islam it says it right here this is the the ideology of Islam and I'm like yeah but dude that particular ideology of Islam is taking hold a because of a hundred years of foreign policy of humiliating and destroying these cultures and be because of American support for the the Saudi supported schools I figure out the name of the schools that are all over the Middle East now because of Saudi Arabia putting them into Pakistan and Afghanistan and all that that the last real hobby isn't exactly thank you yeah so I I mean I think this is really important that when you destroy countries and when you do it the way we're doing it we don't even have the balls to go in on the ground you're just blasting people from the clouds it creates blowback and if that's expressed in terms of a religious ideology or whatever it is it's gonna come back you're absolutely right but there's also stuff that's happening to places that has nothing to do with America that's also related to I mean look at what's going on in Iraq when the power vacuum was created because Saddam Hussein was was killed and the Sunnis in the Shia I started a civil war and they're they're starting a war that has nothing to do with America again than the fact that America took out their their dictator but why does Iraq exist right who created Iraq we did sure British and we created it and we created it like we did when I say we are talking about European and you know post-world War two team us from World War one really yeah team us when they created these countries in Africa as well they intentionally created them so that there were opposing tribes or populations within the country so that they could better exercise control over them hmm right so that yeah engineered the Sunni and the Shia they engineered you look at the origins of and I'm not an expert this is I've read this several different places but I know what happened in Africa as well where they would intentionally draw the border so that you have different tribes within that border who are all you have long lasting and many with each other so you can like arm and could you know manipulate one tribe to dominate the others and then when D colonialization happened then we and we have all these unstable structures in place that we've left behind I think what you're outlining is that it's a very complex issue it's not simply just the ideology and I 100% agree I don't think anybody who's reasonable couldn't agree but I also think that there's a problem with human psychology and ideologies and and we have this very bizarre desire to be all in in whatever team that we're on right and when you're on a team that has in arguably in 2017 the most archaic mainstream ideology that's that's Islam right I mean if you you stop and think about how ancient is it how in its practice is the way especially when it's in used in radical ways the way women are forced to dress the way in Saudi Arabia I think up until really recently they weren't allowed to drive right now they're allowed in the last two or three years yeah there's a lot of like stuff in it that we would think of as being a part of a bygone era of human beings up for Alabama Roy Moore's losin apparently his II yeah that's happening right down by 10 points yeah but there's paradise right on that yeah there's definitely parallels there's I think it's like all things we're always looking for one reason why something exists yeah and look the reason why do you have this idea of jihad and jihadism being like involving suicide bombers and sacrifice in war a lot of that is directly directly attributable to what happened to Afghanistan during the Soviet Union's interaction with them when we were training the Mujahideen have you you don't you the way they talked people into going to war and armed them against the Soviet Union these futile attempts yeah there was a lot of like this a lot of encouragement for a lot of these suicidal tactics maybe not necessarily suicide bombing but the the Mujahideen were armed directly by the United States yeah and that is what turned Osama bin Laden against us like he was with us that Charlie Wilson's War you seen that movie no no it's about that it's about the the senator I think he was who went to Pakistan and oversaw the arming of the Mujahideen Tom Hanks the guy everyone says I look like overdosed a while ago Filipov or Seymour Hoffman Seymour Hoffman yeah and also to relate back to what we were talking about earlier think about the role of sexual frustration in getting martyrs you know these are guys who never get laid well a lot of them these kids men a buddy of mine who was over in Afghanistan was telling me how they would put kids in front of tractors because the tractors weren't expensive ah Jesus that was dr. Sean right that doesn't want that dr. Baker it wasn't I was thinking that was um Andy stump but no I think it was Sean Baker was telling me that he was over in Afghanistan as a medic he was saying that these guys had he's always making another son I can't get another tractor Jesus God so now the kids walk in front of the tractors to look for land mines dead what here's the supersoul the donkey's of blown up already just imagine that that could even be something that someone could say and you realize the difference in the world the yield in the harshness of the world that you're you're talking about and the worse things so sorry the worst thing about Afghanistan is I mean I know a lot of old hippies who used to that was on the hippie trail and Afghanistan was the best place yeah everybody loved Afghanistan the people are so nice so welcoming your your bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere people will come from miles away from their village and take you back to the village and feed you and take care of you and like it was the most hospitable place in the world I'll tell you a scary story about that though because one um there's that one of the teachers of these ramadasa retreats they all were on the hippie trail man and one of them her name I think Mirabai Bush I think you're right but she was telling the story how you know the hippie trail they get in a bus they travel through Europe to end up in India the Brotherhood of eternal love was like just just dispensing just acid every list he'll do this trip well no you can't try bringing a rainbow bus through Afghanistan now to get the soldiers to shoot it she was telling the story about how like all these hippies were hanging out I don't know where they were at but these two  dudes wrote up in horses wearing like you know the full garb they had swords one of the hippies said to them something like we're all children of God and he responded my god has no children it was like some kind of heavy-duty Islam there it's like you hippie what are you talking about so it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't necessarily everything wasn't necessarily peaceful and joyful ever there was still fundamentalism happening there but I think all the we're talking about the really creepy thing is that whatever this is whether it's the United States stuck a stick in the ants nest too much and now we've got like these fundamentalist lunatics who will blow themselves up to kill other people whether we've got a viral form of a religion that has infected people's brains and is now like it contained is gonna spread with adversity the real problem is were also dealing with an exponential increase in technological progress and this is when I interviewed this guy Aaron Frank from singularity University and it's a scary thing he said is eventually there's gonna be technology that exists where you can just like you can you know engineer engineer Ebola using some kind of biological 3d printer when that that might be 50 years from now 60 years ago I don't know but it's not that far away and also this Cuban sound beam right yeah there's kind of you know the story popped up about these people in Cuba State there's some weird chirping at the Embassy right at the Embassy US embassy there they're shooting some sort of sound weapon at them and driving them crazy it's in it caused brain damage and so when you consider that already there's apparently some new sonic weapon existing that can make you mentally disabled maybe permanently and we're dealing with people who are mentally disabled in another way which is that they've become infected with some paradigm that makes them think that there is a actual like loony God out there that wants them to put babies in front of tractors and that wants them to explode other people and they can maybe get a hold of this sound beam that goes through walls and just start launching it into people's house through walls I think it went through a while yes they haven't defined what this weapon is specifically right this is a new thing well this is you know of some sound weapons some sonic but this is the thing there was a time when a nuclear bomb did not exist and then it existed right there was a time when a gun didn't exist and then it existed so I think it'd be a safe bet to say in the next 50 years we're gonna get some brand new weapon there's some guy in DARPA right now whipping up some thing I don't know what it is so who knows what it is you know just like a new kind of flashlight that shines through walls and just makes you forget who you are why you saw what Ilana must said about the robots you need a strobe light to see him because they'll be moving so fast yeah yeah sleep tight yeah sleep tight because it's like do you know not only do we have like these weapons are in the hands right now like you said the nuclear weapons are in the hands of somebody you won a popularity contest I don't know who's going to control the  robots but one thing's for sure man there's a lot of crazy people on the planet right now and they're gonna have access to unlike anything we've ever seen in the newer question yes and well how about a weapon that just makes everyone infantile yeah doesn't kill you like the idea of the hydrogen bomb the idea of the hydrogen bomb right the hydrogen bomb kills all the people leaves all the buildings yeah beautiful but what about a Tron bomb neutrons i what it is yeah you're right what about a stupid bomb yeah like a bomb that makes everybody have a 50 IQ there you go well they thought they would drop LSD right they were experimenting with LSD in the sixties and seventies thinking they could use that to make soldiers crazy on the battlefield well they initially wanted to use it as a truth serum they wanted to use it on captured enemy soldiers yeah yeah there's there's some hilarious videos from the 1950s givin soldiers acid World War 2 video yeah post World War 2 they got them all doped up on acid I think there are English troops from the UK and they're wandering around and black and white footage just tripping balls that's right yeah it's true dude dude this is the this is actually why we need LSD right now because the problem is we're facing one of the most beautiful things could ever happen to a society which is we're about to create this beautiful technology that is going to be something unlike anything you've ever seen and it's wonderful it's wonderful humans are mostly wonderful I think but we've got a few of us out there have been infected with this thing you're talking about us or them the team attitude you know it's me and you it's me versus you and this is the problem this is the this is a real problem how do we fix that that had it cuz it's like yeah I don't know who caused it that's the thing like to what there is  Harvey Weinstein or these you know is it because we de teen teen team boys aren't getting jerked off enough I don't know but we do have a problem right now which is that there's a lot of people whose minds are scrambled with crazy ideas and that's okay that's okay back when they were crossbows and but now that we've got these minds scramble with crazy ideas and access to information about how to make fertilizer bombs how to make the ivory I already heard ever happened with that would it would where'd you get the fertilizer yeah so what happened was these cops so so this one cop is standing next to me and he's like are you from the states huh what part do you live in and we're just chatting and then this other cop comes over and he's like he's like I'm gonna press my camera I have to record this you understand that like yes I understand you're recording mean anything you say will be used yeah yeah I understand and he's like real up in my face and like I think you're lying to me and giving me all the and then he goes away and the other guys like yeah don't worry he's like he gets uptight sometimes and I'm like oh so you're the good cop right he's like yeah yeah yeah and I said alright that's fine as long as you're not an American cop alright I'm not worried about it because I knew like I knew like eventually this was gonna be just a good story yeah and so they're like well you know your bag keeps coming back positive and they check my hands and might they wiped my jeans and and they said we got to get the dog and we get the dog so now I'm waiting they're just chatting and they bring this dog Brian was the name of the dog and Brian sniffed my bag and didn't there was nothing and so they were like yeah Brian says you're you're good to go that crazy the equipment let's dog I know and they're telling and I'm like guys there's nothing trust me there's that you can google me like there's I'm not you know and they're like the machines are never wrong they've literally said that and I don't like well they're wrong this time you know let's you know bet 50 bucks 50 pounds you know like yeah we don't bet anyway so but finally I was like when when the dog was like you know that I was free I said can I do a group selfie with you guys like put it on Instagram that would be pretty funny and they're like man I we can't have our faces on right but you can take a picture with Brian so I got the dog like licking my cheek and hey I bought a laptop once from red BAM and he was selling this Windows laptop I wanted to get a second laptop and first time I used it took it through the airport and I know it got screened so they pull you aside we're gonna have to check this again have you been near farm no I didn't know what that meant back then I didn't know about the fertilizer they checked my hands nothing they swab the entire laptop and they're like a test positive for fertilizer and home stains it's probably just red bands jizz computer but they they went over it like with a fine-tooth comb with like they're a swab and they went up and down they had asked me a bunch of questions explain what I do me you know I host fear factor and they okay all right get out of here just give it to me gave me the laptop because they recognized you yeah because they checked the laptop they I said I bought it from a friend they said he work around a farm I go I don't think so and they just tested it and they swab dit and whatever a minimal amount of nitrogen or they found on it which exists in fertilizer but also in bombs somehow or another but it's also by the way nitrogen is the most common thing in the air the air is 80% nitrogen no I don't know how they're like getting what they're getting off of the laptop I don't know why it would test positive or what-have-you but it was apparently a minimal amount in some way shape or form they thought it was okay I thought they were gonna turn it on and you know check the content you're gonna get in trouble for me how am i writing down like the  is wrong with your head but like if you worked on a farm and you got that nitrogen all over you I feel like you were laying down some fertilizer and gotten your clothes and you went straight to the airport you're not flying anywhere bro yeah they check you and they find that on you you know if there's somehow or another it gets detected you know like it's touching your bags or something like that like you're gonna you're gonna be in for some questioning buck yeah that sucks man so what do you think's gonna happen with this democratization of weaponry that you were talking about because sometimes I think it could be a good thing if everybody had the capacity to destroy the planet no way it's not a good thing it's like Jesus Chris that's where we're going well I mean you swear we're gonna we're gonna have to kill the people that we think would possibly destroy the planet and then everyone's gonna be scared it's gonna be like McCarthyism for nuclear catastrophe everyone's gonna think neutral Shores destruction yeah which works when one of the when both people are saying but when you're dealing with someone who wants to die and like and like these shooters when you look at what's happening with these shooters like the guy in Vegas that's an example of a lunatic getting a hold of some technology and using that technology to wipe out a ton of people not caring if he's going to die what if that guy was up there with a  Cuban sonic dum-dum beam just blasting people with this beam that's like making them for the rest of their lives have some kind of neurological impairment what if that person god forbid he was up there like dusting out smallpox that he had printed up in his 3d printer it's like I think the the creepy thing about it is Chris that there is not a solution I don't even know how you like we're looking at like huge chunks of the human population that believe that in at this insane creator force that actually wants them to explode themselves you know they went in and like that that shooting that just happened where the the Isis came in and just executed a bunch of Sufis you know in Egypt yeah yes and Sufi ISM like that's that's that you know it's such a it's like mystical Islam it's beautiful it's a beautiful dancing yes it's dancing and so so we already have this kind of insanity bubbling up in different parts of the planet so and then you have wait the loner person who just for whatever reason decides to go and shoot up a church or whatever this is all like sam harris arguments this is what sam Harris believes and when it comes to like ideologies being incredibly toxic in that form yeah they can be we can be yeah they can be I want to start a fight with Sam Harris but I like him it seems like a fun thing to do I'm gonna get you know but but the yeah man this is this is like a this is a this is you know AI is a big problem mm-hmm but also the fact that the current AI that we're running the human operating system is like already up in this kind of intense way it's it's I don't know what the solution is no one can really even think about it but it's it is going it's a problem in the most intense way well here's how easy the AI is to hack Donald Trump who's never been religious at any point in his life ever now is able to say god Bless America and everybody starts clapping and they believe that he believes that right God is blessing America which has never been a part of his thought process that's right like there's a giant history of Donald Trump interacting with the world never was there any proselytizing right who's never any espousing of any religious doctrines or talking about the greatness of Christianity but now he does it and because he's in this position where you haven't believed it we accept that new variation in his speech that now he brings God into the equation we never brought God into the equation before that's so creepy man the way you just I didn't know what you're talking about cuz I'm like Trump definitely didn't hack any AI but now I hear what you're saying yeah yes he's tapped into this human and quiet yeah and there the requirement to believe in supernatural beings they're looking out for us that's a requirement right in 2017 you cannot like if Chris Ryan wanted to run for president one of the real issues he would be as I can't trust an atheist crazy monkey person you meet my first press conference would be a doozy let me tell you great yeah man that's a dot so that that is the problem is the human AI were getting better at hacking it you know that though and this is I don't think it was Sam Harris who said it though it might have been maybe was Elon Musk he was saying everyone thinks the problem with a with AI is that it's gonna be robots killing people which is one part of it but the real problem is that the AI is going to be able to start hacking the human operating system and we kind of have already witnessed that with the Twitter BOTS so it's like you can produce the you can produce the illusion of a majority opinion using BOTS so in the more advanced you can at least kind of tell what the bots are like you go back and look and you realize the bots been tweeting every like five minutes and it's got like lists of people in it it's usually tweeting memes and it seems to have been up you'd have to chase it down if you just looked at the comments itself after a post like say if you're someone who poses president Trump and they've got Trump bots that they use to go attack someone who says anything bad about Trump you would just see the overwhelming negative response versus positive response yeah well yeah but you could still I'm saying is like right now there's a way you can tell something to bots but as AI gets better you're gonna start seeing I've been thinking about this you're gonna start seeing these like basically social networking farmers so the idea is like I create a teenage bot and I figure out a way to get it to create its own Facebook account and for like I don't know six years it just post  on its own Facebook account giving the illusion that this is a living thing now if I could do that with 7,000 of these team BOTS so now I have a bot swarm of 7,000 a is that all have a Facebook accounts Twitter accounts Instagram accounts that they've been somehow populating with content for like seven years so now no one can really even tell if it's a person or not I've got a really super powerful weapon and so I think that's what's the the real creepy thing with AI is and you know you've seen that that popped up on the internet the ability here's a road in the day look we just made it look like it's winter now we just made it look like it's nighttime now we just made it look like it's whatever any time of year that we want we can make it's going to get to the point where we can make a person look like they said anything and you're not going to be able to tell the difference yeah and then on top of that that's here by the way you see that I think was radio lab or something they did a podcast it's not quite here it's closed it's discernable but it's you're getting close so we're talking about reality do and audio yeah it these are its reality bombs where you're gonna be able to bomb a culture with AI produce the illusion of anything that you want whatever you want but and dumbing and people are gonna believe it but devil's advocate here haven't we been doing that for a long time isn't that what a laugh track is a studio audience yeah but you're creating the illusion of community of a bunch of people that believe a certain thing that react certain ways and that manipulates the hordes right maze wrote about this in the plenties about manipulating and effective it's already been in a rudimentary form for example imagine a super advanced form of that and what you're looking at is like the RIT one of the real problems of AI that maybe is more problematic than robots going so fast you have to use a strobe light to see them we're talking about people no longer if you believe that anything in the media or on the internet is real or if you've been trying to like establish your concept of what the universe is or the world is based on the news based on the internet and people been doing that for a long time with newspapers and then we're going to enter into a phase in human history where that is no longer necessarily a way for us to gauge what reality actually is because we're not even going to know humans or creating the content we're not we're gonna get to a certain point in time where we're not gonna know if someone's human yeah is it Blade Runner is a real thing yeah that's going to happen yeah that's not far away they have some pretty goddamn convincing robot heads now in Japan sex robots yeah looking pretty good they don't look too bad and we're getting real close we're getting within 50 years away from an indiscernible artificial life-form yeah buddy of mine had a wet dream recently he's in his 40s and he had a wet dream where he was having sex with to revision sex robots oh yeah for sure and you watch ex machina that chicken even though you could see right through her legs she was clear should clear arms and check it still this she's nice to you how do you know what is real I mean if it interacts with you if you're talking to a live mirror yeah but here's where it gets really interesting is like there's this mystic named kerchief and he called people spiritual machines and so his thing was like most people already are robots or automatons in the sense that most people when they're doing anything whatever the thing is they're doing it's imitation so when a person like you know does any the way a person a person who's acting cool right usually the person who is acting cool as Emma is learned that from something it's all limitation it's all autopilot already so most human beings they're not even autonomous at all like how most of it most people will spend like three days completely up in their heads not even knowing where they're at I mean I know I've been in that situation where like some time will pass and suddenly I'll be like wait what the I've been in my head for three days straight I'm running on autopilot what's going on here man that's like how many people are they wake up in the morning they get their coffee ting in a car they go and do their thing they come back they go to bed they barely even know what they're doing yeah momentum momentum right so so we're already dealing with a kind of organic robot a meat machine that's barely even aware of what it's doing you know which is why I think and I know you and I talk about Christ a lot I'm gonna bring it up on your show again when Jesus is being crucified I think one of the most poignant things in the New Testament is when Jesus being crucified he looks out and he says Father forgive them they know not what they do yeah and a lot of people interpret that as being like they don't know I'm Jesus but I think what he's really saying is they don't know what they're doing man period period they're just on autopilot they don't know what they're not they're barely sentient that termites in the mound now let's think about what we were talking about earlier when we're talking about 50 year olds he's trying to grab it no no I didn't know if you were passing it has yeah give him some of that when we're talking about 50 year olds or 50 year old movies you know those old movies were men smacked women and grabbed them and and how you're seeing these big changes in the way people behave yeah now let's go 2,000 years ago let's let's let's go way back before written things yes right and let's go back before anybody knew how to write things down or read and let's imagine like what is that 10,000 years ago correct 15 that was about eight for writing a little bit too rewriting it's all it's all insane if you really think about the amount of raw change that's happening in our life just what's going on right now with this hold me to movement to sexual harassment and sexual assault yeah you know outing of all these predators all of this stuff I'm good just put all this stuff that's happening now is it's like accelerated evolution right accelerated cultural compatibility like accelerated understanding of and it almost like a new a new like version of equality because it used to be that like you could your employee because your employee couldn't say anything right right they couldn't do anything well now they can now everybody can't and now other people find out about you and now it becomes an issue yeah it's all forced and so now we're gonna change the way we think about behaving now and our standards gonna change because our standards have radically changed from a thousand years ago radically changed from two thousand years ago and radically changed from the 1950s if you look at the 1950s and we see it in uniquely so in the 1950s is that we can see it in the form of mainstream media films you could read about it in books but seeing it visually in films it's so shocking it's stunning and you see just the way people interacted with each other and you just think about if someone from like 1950 tried to exist today it would be hilarious it would be hilarious just watching them try to interact with everybody with phones and all the study they literally would be like a person from a foreign world right yeah it's gonna be us a hundred years from now 100 years from now this world will be indiscernible it's going to the technology is like literally a yellow stone about to blow up the entire country that's literally about the supervolcano the whole world yes and no one is prepared for the consequences we just assume that the paradigms that exist today are gonna remain and that it's just gonna get better it'll be easier to text people no no no this this paradigm did not exist 2,000 years ago this worry all the world the way we operate and communicate and even get around how about the way we get around how about this hard surface and these metal boxes with rubber tires and now  drive themselves I mean we we're at the we're at were in the middle of it but we're also at the gate to like insanity that's like pure absolute world and sanity from DNA with CRISPR they've just started injecting it into live people now some guy with some incurable disease allowed them to guinea pig on him what if he gets cured right what if people figure out a way to get smarter what if they they develop CRISPR telekinesis modules where they can insert them into your head and you it works off your own body's electricity yes and they never run bad and we all talked to each other through our minds and then in school they have to teach kids a new language a universal language that's not not phonetically based so people stop talking so our heads grow big like aliens our mouths shrivel up just like the aliens that's what the alien that's what that that archetype is that alien archetype is like what we know we're going to look like if we keep going we're all gonna be like a merge of colors because that's like problematic all that dick stuff that just gets in the way dude your dick stuffs now all in your brain sure well I like this is what McKenna talked about how like what do you say octopus like that like all the limbs like the ability it has to communicate with body language is so much more profound than us it's like yeah not only are we not gonna have this forum we're gonna be able to decide any form we want any form any form anything you want to be you want to be a octopus yeah theoretically you could be an octopus if we get if we get to that point if we get to that point also nuclear arsenal without nuking ourselves or without like actual yellow stone or without like sending out maybe we just haven't produced you know we're we always are scanning the skies for radio signals that's what we used to do but maybe we haven't even produced a signal that an advanced civilization would identify as being something that would come from a civilization right and the moment we do it the moment somebody at CERN or somebody DARPA produces some kind of beam that emanates from the planet it just summons just a legion of like crafts that just want to enslave us you know you know what I mean it's just like the first little like Boop and then they're ready harvest them the weirdest thoughts that I've ever had about interacting with other aliens or other life-forms for another planet is not that it's a signal it's not that like you like but you can go to a place that you can transform like whatever your consciousness is into something that can travel to different dimensions and that these things exist in dimensional planes as much as they exist in physical locations so maybe it's got a physical location of a hundred billion light years away or whatever the it is right yeah but it's also right here yeah like in that it's all tied in together like there's this really rudimentary crude physical distance space that we operate in on a daily basis because we're still as advanced as we are for Earth we're still fairly low level in terms of the ability to spring forth an entire universe from something the size of the head of a pen which is what the Big Bang is right so some insanely complex webbing of just insane distance plus potential life forms and different styles of life it could exist in all these different planets hundreds of billions of known galaxies in the universe that's so big Lawrence Krauss tried to explain to me the size of the universe and he changed the way I looked at it because he said it's not that we know for sure that the universe is 13.7 billion years old but that's as far back as we can see with what we have now and he was saying that time that he was trying to make some distinction between the amount of time it would take to go back more than 13.7 billion years and that that time literally moves faster than that and that you it's you can't detect it after what we're not we're we're very limited in our ability to detect things after a certain space so he's not like necessarily the universe is only 13.7 billion years old it might be infinitely old it's like that's as far as we can see with our flashlights we assume that's all there is that's what the OP they have to operate on what they can prove now right so this is what they're saying that what we can prove now is that light is you know the light we're getting is 13.7 billion years old or the radio waves that indicate that there's some sort of an explosion but all of it is like super sketchy man they're all writing things down on little legal notepads they're all agreeing with the math and looking at it and they're way smarter than me so they're probably right about a lot of stuff but it's entirely possible that just we don't have the ability to detect how much further it actually goes back they might have Nev this whole faulty assumption of this initial beginning of the universe might be there might literally not have ever been a beginning because it has always been here right well in my area they've been saying anatomically modern human beings have existed for two hundred thousand years that's what everybody including me writes in the books you know that's right accepted wisdom a couple months ago they found remains in Morocco that seemed to be about three hundred thousand years old that appeared to be from anatomically modern humans so it's like oh well so when you say something goes back well you've had Graham Hancock on the line right well you say something goes back a certain amount of time often what you're saying is that's how far back we we found something yeah or that we can detect it in the case of the space exploration insane and here's what's really insane let's give him the benefit of the doubt let's go half a million that's nothing yeah it's a blink of an eye a half a million years ago we were literally some kind of eight thing half a million years ago right yeah well we Australia Pittacus two million years ago Australopithecus you know I stick with anatomically modern humans which is why that really jumps out at me but yeah I'm not real clear on Australopithecus and cro-magnon and right I know Neanderthals lived up to about 40,000 years ago yeah and interbred with humans how crazy is that one yeah so that means there was some sort of like cultures there was some sort of like villages and back then now stop and think how crazy that is and we're we're talking about like Mesopotamia or sumaré or Iraq we're talking about these incredibly advanced for the time civilizations that are like the oldest known modern style civilizations nearly 6,000 years old yeah I know it's crazy the other thing I actually had idea for a book which that the rate I write I'll never live to write it but the idea is to look at the known unknowns in science right because there are things that are you lucid eight an example earlier where it's like look that's how far we can detect that doesn't mean that's how far it is so we no we don't know that there's a lot of arrogance in the assumption that we have all the data when it comes to the civilizations - like we're going into six out thousand years you're not getting a lot of stuff when you go four thousand years before that you're getting way less stuff hmm you go four thousand years before that you might not have any stuff left right I mean there might be like some shards of metal you can't explain and you can't carbon date those anyway right and I think a rock you can't carbon date you need like physical things later like living right like you need like wood or flow for carbon yeah carbon dating is that how they're doing it still no I think there's a there's some other isotope that they're using that they don't need the carbon but the carbon is accepted and the other ones quite new it's pretty  crazy and they're so smart not ask ously but someone out there so smart they could take a piece of something and tell you roughly how old it is that's enough and apparently it gets a little screwy if in places where there's higher levels of carbon and there's like there's some weirdness to it especially initially when it was first invented but just the fact that exists that someone could say oh the well we found out that the dinosaurs died 65 million years ago yeah you know what and meanwhile probably a hundred years from now they'll have something that'll tell you the day the asteroid hit they'll they'll show you like a model of the Yucatan before and after you'll be able to watch it with HTC vive put it over your head you'll be able to literally watch an accurate representation of that giant was it five miles wide yeah the crater yeah the one the actual asteroid itself dinosaurs yeah I want to say it was five miles wide but I might be making that up five-man job five-mile wide City slamming into the earth going 45,000 miles an hour from space and you could watch it all take place yeah in virtual reality that's gonna happen you gonna be able to see it you're gonna be able literally witness the people coming off the Mayflower and clubbing Native Americans and raping and killing them you will be able to literally see West world yes in West world yeah yeah yeah it's intense but I mean I think that they're gonna be able to recreate things in its computing power gets more and more power the only real problem would be things that really pre-historical in terms of like cultural things maybe not like physical animal things but as far as like things that people did or didn't do because they vary so much yeah should be so hard to pin down without real accurate like images and videos and but from like here on out from here on out there they're gonna be able to have recreations of things that happen that are gonna be indistinguishable they have images of all of us everybody has a Facebook page everybody has a picture of you all right so the 300 billion whatever it'll be in a hundred years 320 million people that exist in this country right now there's a probably a picture of everybody yes that that was not the case 100 years ago right yeah sure in the future there's going to be some sort of a three-dimensional version of you that you use as an avatar in your 3d games and that's gonna look exactly like you they're gonna be able to make something that literally recreates moments in your life well they're gonna be able to like take your social thumbprint they're gonna be able to theoretically they could scan all your Instagram posts your Facebook posts all your tweets even your podcasts analyze your voice get an idea of your personality construct some kind of massive amount of data feed it to an AI say create a personality based on this person here's their picture animate the picture and now you've cloned yourself an AI is like basically imbued all the data that exists in you has been used to imbue an image of you with your personality and now you are living in some kind of simulator which means that you're gonna be able to anyone who has ever had their picture taken and has some kind of data out there to establish some kind of personality you're gonna be able to use that to make to simulate individuals that have lived in the past and dude it's gonna get really interesting ethically cuz it's like all right let me take like I don't know who's somebody out there with like a huge social like let me take Taylor Swift right I'm gonna take her I'm gonna have my AI produce a mini Taylor Swift and I'm gonna drop her and do like a simulated reality filled with fire-breathing scorpions to see what Taylor Swift would do if she was like running through some doom simulator yeah and they're gonna have to come up with laws about this which is like you don't you can't duplicate you can't duplicate without permission you know talked about them on the podcast before with robots we were like what's gonna stop you from making a replica of say Jennifer Lopez for sex robot it looks exactly Jennifer Lopez and is that a violation of her you go over you know you go to the store and you could literally buy a Jennifer Lopez  doll it looks indistinguishable you take it home and you Jennifer Lowe well more like more than likely it's it's gonna be you're gonna have some kind of like what you would have I guess would be some kind of generic looking  doll but you put a eye goggles on or augmented reality goggles on it projects whoever you want onto this thing so it's like you don't have to you know you didn't go buy a doll based on a celebrity you would just have some kind of like basically a screen in the form of an Android that you're augmented reality would project a person on to that so I kinda in love yeah yeah well I mean that's a good that's my ideal person onto someone else that's it's really weird is that's the other thing that you're gonna be able to do is you're gonna be able to sit across from someone and project onto them anyone that you want you know that no longer it's not good you know you could be talking to Western Winston Churchill yeah your girlfriend exactly you and I could could Co project something to do it could be like a game we play together yeah well especially if we all decided to live in virtual reality if we spent most of our time alone in a room but we felt like we're all hanging out together and the feeling is indistinguishable than being in a physical location right there's gonna be a lot of that going on man then you don't need a body anymore we're gonna get super close to the alien thing man we're gonna engineer big giant heads we're all gonna exist in there there's gonna be HTC vive built which is no more atmosphere we're gonna blow out the atmosphere so we have built-in sunglasses that's why the aliens have the big black eyes yeah those are like built-in ray-ban Wayfarers yeah dude I I think it's brought to you by ribbon we have skin that doesn't get cancer it's bulletproof to figure that out don't you think this is like when you when you smoked DMT and I've never smoked DMT and I never would do any illegal psychedelic but let's say that I have no reason let's say that I'd recently done it it like I don't know Burning Man where no one's doing drugs there anymore but let's say that I had done it there but so making up that I had had that I had a crazy experience man where I looked down after drinking this very strong mint tea and I saw this I saw this huh I don't know it looked like it was a look kind of like a cow or something but coming out of it it had this long neck with like a technological lantern hanging off of it and I'm looking at that thing and what's interesting about the emcees you look away and you look back that thing's still there man it's just right there I'm like what the got sucked through this tube into this beautiful beautiful domed structure oh man it was so pretty and it was spinning with potential it's just pure potentiality and I'm looking at this incredible thing it's technology for sure I mean whatever this was the the way my brain was interpreting it is like this is technology like I'm looking at some kind of super-advanced simulator or some kind of machine that is like simulating realities and I'm looking at it's like my god it's just so much potential here but I thought to myself I'm gonna miss my friends if I have to hang out in this place because the interesting thing about DMT is that there's a sense of I've heard other people report this a sense of incredible familiarity or your legs I have been here in fact this is home and then you realize the feeling of coming home is actually this is that is not even close to the feeling of being at home here and I'm looking around at this and thinking yeah but my friends my friends what about all my friends I'm gonna in this space I'm gonna miss them and that thing it doesn't talk to you but it's like might as well be a voice it's like oh oh you can always go back there and then I open my eyes and I'm back at Burning Man hanging out with my friends and that's when I realized oh I get reincarnation man I get it this thing you're talking about the simulator then is going to happen sometimes and after having taken psychedelics you think no no it's already happened and this thing that we're in right now are alive the idea of reincarnation is you die and then you become a goat or something crazy like that a larva a slug but what if it's that you die you pop into that DMT realm and you get to jump back into your life at any frame of your life that you want to you can you can actually repopulate your life or reincarnate your life at any moment so you die you become the universal super intelligence and then you gaze back into what happened and usually it's like in Buddhism they say the cause of suffering is attachment that knit what you're attached to that life this thing you just were this interdimensional temporal worm that burrowed through time with every action that you took and you're like yeah well you're just you you're like I want to go back right I want to go back to this moment right now and I was podcast with my pals doing a shrimp parade and then BOOM there you are you're back back in your life so in any given moment you could be reincarnating a million times you could just be like always coming back to any frame of your life that you want and anyway this is what came to me out there in the desert and I was thinking oh I get it it's not like you reincarnate into other life-forms you keep repeating your life but it's not a circle it's a spiral hopefully because each time you can improve a little bit more you can improve a little bit more make decisions that you normally wouldn't make which is why I like at any given moment you know the big moments that come when you're around somebody and you're about to say some shitty  thing to them you know your enemy your flu ever it may be that moment where you're like about to do the  thing you always do and you can feel it like you're you you feel this gravitational pull to the habituation and in that moment you're like you don't say the shitty thing in that moment you discipline yourself you control you you don't do the thing you've always done whatever it is and in that moment your life spirals up a little bit and now you're existing in like a completely new new like essentially a new universe a higher plan what you hit higher yes exactly I mean that's kind of in a way it replicates what you talk about sometimes on your social media I see on your Instagram like taming the inner bitch yeah the other thing the other day was like you know I really did not want to do this today you know yeah but you know after you did a show of the night before whatever and you did it and at the end of it by doing that thing you didn't want to do yeah or not doing the thing you do want to do conversely you do move to a higher level and feel way better you've been in that so that thing you've that thing you you instagrammed which i think super cool thing that you do because I think it's like a lot of people need to like think yeah man I could it anytime I want I could just start jogging it but it's like and you could like really you could you just start doing it you don't even have to be good at it you know what to do anything could just make sure so make sure you do it if you just do that everything changes for the better and that seems so easy it seems so ridiculous but you need to hear people to say it and you need to hear someone say it who actually does it yes now that you know Rupert Sheldrake I think you might yeah one oh cool okay so you know his idea the runnel in the time-space continue to runnel basically so that feeling when you're like I'm not gonna go running you're not just feeling your own like you know lack of ambition or laziness you're literally feeling now again I don't believe it's just like a thought experiment or whatever but you're literally feeling the gravitational pull of infinite lifetimes where in that moment you decided not to go running you're actually feeling like the track that you've carved deep into the time-space continuum by every time that a moment appears you keep making so when you actually do go I'm gonna go running you're kind of climbing out of this trench that you've dug into time over countless incarnations and when you do that and you're out there running you're liking a new dimension now what the this is the dimension where I decided to go running and then that and that's why everything starts changing a little bit when you make these decisions big life-changing moves yeah yeah those are good for you and for some people going out jogging can be a life-changing move it doesn't have to be some spectacular thing it could be as simple as like taking a yoga class deciding you to take yoga class twice a week or three times a week and let change your life calling someone who you've said some shitty thing to because they're they did something wrong and upon being the bigger person apologizing instead of holding that stupid grudge right calling them up and being like hey I'm sorry I was mad I love you you're great instead of like carrying on with this stupid angry war towel yeah the carousel anytime you make decisions like that things get better so fast and then like I don't know if you've noticed that this I've noticed like synchronicity start happening more like good luck starts happening more like interesting things start happening yeah I think we we fight against ourselves sometimes accidentally like I mean when I was young when I was young I would have an interaction with someone and then I would always imagine what they were gonna say when we talked again and then I would imagine me talking to them yeah and then I would imagine then getting upset at me and having a delusional perspective I was like play out this weird play in my mind and then when I was in my 20s I started to realize how preposterous it was took me that long and I realized like I'm wasting all this time and I didn't realize it was correct I didn't realize other people did so I talked to my friend Brian once and he was saying the same thing I go you have arguments of people that aren't they goes all the  time yeah all the time I have arguments in my head with people that were that that's like sometimes you'll have a conversation with someone about something and then you both immediately are like relieved and start laughing as you're both expecting the other person to be like super mad and come in like an asshole yeah I mean while you're both apologized and then it just goes away and then everybody feels way better a better way better yeah like conflict is stupid what's not stupid is exercising out all the anxiety that your body possesses that it creates conflict in the first place whether it's exercising it through meditation or through taking a yoga class or doing something physical did you gives you some relief of stress because you exert yourself and doesn't have to be anything crazy going on a nice hike you go on a nice hike you get to see things and you feel better like you're walking the Blood starts pumping through your brain you come up with great ideas when you hike you know it's like all these things are just little incremental steps that every one of us can take and you do that and it changes everything then you be nicer nicer to people that changes everything to you and it helps you to be nicer if you have control of your physical body that's it you know and and you know the question that we're talking about earlier is like what the do we do about the lunatics out there well what you do man you I mean if you can you start with the  lunatic that you're sitting in [Laughter] and then and then and in and I mean that's that's exactly what Rhonda says is a we work on ourselves so we can help the people next to us and that's all you can do yeah because you can't do man to make another person you're not really gonna do much to the other people around you they're gonna do their own thing they're gonna decide I mean this is something I've been thinking Jesus because a lot of people talk about miracles and stuff especially like in the camps I hang out it with like Duncan says I've been thinking about Jesus no I will Rican that's it's a freaking no that's a different thing  Jesus yeah I would totally do it it's a different thing that you've already done it if you do DMT but that's part of the experience making whatever cries having intercourse with the Christ it would be an honor through all pours it would be an honor go together like you just merge you just merge you just murder you're on your knees again at the video store this guy it's always dirty with him but never be just psychedelic love that's a psychedelic love about Jesus just behind your knees choking on Christ come you can guarantee that's gonna be a similar sex simulator for sure my life to Christ assures sure when the Virgin Mary yes she was hot these people they talk about miracles Denis guys come on I'm trying to talk about miracles here no these people they talk about miracles a bunch you know and like you know having seen some of these gurus do crazy yeah but they always say it doesn't matter like ultimately these are just like fireworks kind of it's just like tricks it's a firework it does it because like the thing is like you could sit in front of someone and like levitate bottles in front of them like levitate a bunch of bottles teleport across the room come back and then tell the person you know you're gonna be a lot happier if you go jogging like someone could do that to me and tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'm like yeah you levitated bottles you teleport across the room they told me I should go jogging huh I'll probably go tomorrow so you know what I mean it doesn't matter none of it none of that the point is like if so if a person who can levitate bottles probably isn't gonna make you go jogging then certainly you're not gonna be able to talk to a person and be like hey you know you're gonna feel better if you do this right you all you can really do is look at yourself and be like you know what I know jogging this is a really good point what's your take on this in terms of like the miracles in the Bible like some of the weirder ones like walking on water like what do you what do you think that's about what do you think like the even though the interpretation of those is kind of suspect right like well isn't the walking on water as a weird one because I think it has to do with translation and I think that it could be interpreted in other languages as walking by the water like walking near the water could be thought of as levitating and walking on water all in the preposition man yeah it's so hard being going from ancient Hebrew yeah man Romaic and all this different  but do you think that this what you're saying is like that someone would do tricks to get you to listen to them like you levitate things or walk on water or turn water into we read minds for Moses splits the sea yeah like what yeah you know I just have a bit about that where I was like like there'd be like a hundred people standing behind him going how long can you hold that like what the is he doing like why do you split do we have to walk across that yeah yeah that's gonna take days I'm like how's he doing that magic tell that silly to use his magic and make us a boat this is crazy just walking through the middle just dead fish flopping around in the middle walls of water on either side yeah very humid yeah that well I mean your dude that's all you know that's literal interpretations of something that's like way deeper than that but it has a lot of deeper meanings it's probably you know it's right it's a myth they're using these like encoded stories to try to get across something that's a lot bigger and it's isn't about really walking on water maybe no but I think that these showing that the people that had all this knowledge also had magic tricks is very telling like the people that everybody would follow they were they were able to do things yeah right like how about the guy who called upon a bear to kill these kids that were mocking him for being bald that's a story that's in the Bible yeah yeah yeah there was a man find that story he called upon a she-bear and God brought down a she-bear to smite these children that were making fun of his balding ass bear they would they would do coal she bare back then you know today they were I guess we call it a sow sow bare but that this bear killed the kids because they were making fun of him for me for being bald yeah like what like you know there again you have to listen to this guy he's got magic he's able to conjure up Jesus from the forest to kill mocking children yeah they walk on water they turned water into one here why did God kill 42 lads merely for saying Elijah was bald forty-two lads that makes it worse well let's read the verse then he went up from there to bat felony was going up by the way young lads came out from the city and mocked him and said to him go up your bald head go up you bald it to it when he looked behind him and saw them he cursed them in the name of the Lord it doesn't say what he swords in all caps - by the way like a Twitter account in tooth then two feet Lord then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up 42 lads of their number I thought it was too - that's crazy 42 a lot of lad and he knows two bears either one she bear wait what is it so this is like actually exploring this why would God allow two bears to kill 42 and it's written by a guy named max slick yes probably doing porn right now look what it says let's take a look but you ain't taking a look at nothing you're just guessing Elisha was traveling from Jericho to Bethel when a group of young men verbally accosted him 42 is a large number of people they were probably an organized group had gone out to challenge Allah Elijah their mockery implied a militia to a malicious intent especially when the culture of the time insisted on showing respect to their elders furthermore the statement go up you ball head has cultural significance first of all go up in parentheses is probably a reference to Elijah's predecessor Elijah ascending to heaven in other words they're stating that when Elijah gone oh they want Elijah gone it so this is just so ridiculously yeah and since Elijah had gone on to the next world the implication is they wanted Elijah dead also the epitaph bald head was one of contempt in the east in quotes applied to a person who a person even with a bushy head of hair lepers had to shave their heads such a statement could easily been deliberate and malicious insults something dangerous in a month yeah well this is such a weird interpretation of what it does either way you sent bears to kill people for mocking your head because you're saying it's okay if they were being disrespectful that God would just call some bears yeah this is the weirdest sort of a justification for attacked by by wild beasts of the creator of the universe is using a wild beast to attack because someone hurt with words yeah have you read the book of Job since I was like it so it's a whopper man so it's the story of this guy Joe who's like prosperous he's in love he's married he has three children and lots of animals and land everything's going great and so up in heaven or in wherever they are God and the devil are having a conversation and God is saying look at how great I am how everyone loves me and you know look at Joe he loves me he worships all the time and all that and the devil says oh of course he does because his life so good take away his sheep and see what he says and God's like all right so he kills all job sheep and Jobe goes to church and warships and no problem and then the devil's like yeah but if you took away the the cows and the the land there then you'd see so God goes it takes away the cows in the land and it goes on and on until job is totally destitute all of his family is dead he's sitting on an ash heap with boils all over his body that's how far God was willing to go to prove a point to the devil Jesus yeah but remember that part that he continued to love God no but that yeah that's a crazy story sorry so then what so then God wins the bet where's tortured this dude and he gives back twice as much as everything to Jobe to reward him so now he has four hundred sheep and whether or not in six children and it's like so it didn't matter who those children were that you killed and the wife he just gave him another wife and more children you're better maybe had a little time machine spun it all back I mean he did create the universe he could do whatever the you want but that is kind of like the part in job that's mean again literally yeah it's ridiculous but it's not like he's supposed to be these are stories that are meant to like encompass the human predicament and like one of the cool things in there isn't there this great line where job is like questioning why he what job is questioning him - or something he said something oh yeah yeah he they get into an argument but in spots is something like I created yeah where were you when I created the heavens in the earth and in that and this is again man the the  tone in this debt this tribal desert religion is really harsh and patriarchal but the message behind it is pretty similar to the bhagavad-gita which is this a battlefield where Krishna turns into the universal form this is the quote Oppenheimer's quote yeah but hold I have become damned become death the destroyer of worlds and so it's a similar thing both of these are saying listen tiny little human thing all caught up in your life so fixated on everything about you you exist within the infinite span of time a Big Bang that goat we did something like we were saying longer than 13.7 billion years you tiny tiny little thing you exist in something so infinitely gigantic and beautiful what do you think you control what do you think you really control you don't control you don't control anything so that's what it really it's more of like when we experience inevitable catastrophe in our lives and we're looking around and like what the man what what the fuck's wrong with the universe it's like nothing's wrong with the universe nothing's wrong with you nothing's wrong with anything in fact everything's perfect just surrender to it even if you're sitting in the goddamn ash pile covered in boils if you just let go and surrender and drop the bitterness then you can if nothing else not suffer under the terrible weight of the resistance or feeling like a victim that's to me what I get out of job you know from the non-literal level the literal level where it's like gods hanging out with Satan right so they play poker and what does that mean like he just drops by like Satan sometimes just pops by wherever godless BET's they make bets it's ridiculous but it'll suffer for god's bet like fear factor when you think about it now you got paid for the government takes a piece out of someone winning naked and afraid or any of those shows government takes piece that's crazy you're out there choking on bug dicks yeah Meiko a banana hammock out of literal banana leaves for you dick Asians are biting you everywhere it's so ridiculous those shows are so ridiculous it's amazing they haven't killed anybody it is how come nobody's gotten bitten by spiders and died or some some people get super sick on the show oh yeah well they eat up things by the way some of this stuff if you eat things and don't cook them those parasites can stay with you forever this is a toy I don't do sushi Sushi's not bad if you get ocean sushi but I've been told not to eat salmon I've been telling ya someone said that freshwater salmon the problem is salmon is a freshwater fish as well they go they migrate they go to ocean and they go and they're susceptible to some parasites apparently that tuna and a lot of ocean borne fish isn't susceptible to I guess the parasites don't they could just live way easier in freshwater which makes sense right yeah also the salmon stop eating and their metabolism changes once they get back to fresh water and so essentially they're dying from that right on you know so when you see them upstream there they're like zombies it's really gross sushi is a really nutty thing when you stop and think about it right because here we are we're we're like on these little land masses surrounded by a blue like as soon as you get to the edge you realize how much blue there is you're like holy that's all water like yeah yeah yeah we're just so accustomed to it no big deal it's just water so no no it's this thing's mostly water yeah we're on the dirt spots of this thing that's mostly water yeah what we do is we take these metal boxes and we float out there and we grab whatever is living we scoop it up with nets and bring it in bro it's great we serve it with a little bit of jalapeno on the top and some ponzu sauce you're gonna love it and we're just extracting the fish out of the water yeah just pulling them out it's the only thing like it in terms of that fact that we're not dealing with farmed animals we're scooping up wild animals we don't allow that anymore in the United States like the United States you don't use they used to have market hunting for Buffalo and for elk and for deer you're not allowed to do that anymore that's illegal now wild game is wild but not wild fish wild fish you can commercially farm you could commercially cultivate and harvest you go out there with giant  nets and just scoop up wild creatures in the middle of the ocean because we don't have good regulations for the ocean so we weigh 80 percent of what you bring up they've killed oh yes throw it overboard and we're just draining that thing we're draining and it's wild it's a wild thing if like we if anybody try to propose that today with like elk someone said we're just gonna get nets and just run through the forest and gather up all the elk and then we're gonna sell it at the elk store you'd be like the you are the  you are man those things are wild and kill all the raccoons and squirrels well the other thing else so you're decimating the environment and geese they after you know they those nets are super work they work really hard you know I mean pulling through all that water yeah two or three trips they cut them loose they don't pull them back up to the boat and recycle them they cut them loose so oceans are full of drifting nets miles wide yeah just going on and killing more and more no yeah cuz as you say it's this kind of wilderness now where it's unregulated largely and there's no way to look at it and see all that you know holy yeah it's really freaking me out just thinking of the sheer numbers of nets drifting through the water and landing on the ground I know that because a friend of mine was working with a guy who if I remember this correctly it's in Chile I think Kyle who's uh he's a surfer goes around the world and does interesting research and he was in Chile and there was a guy starting a company that was even created a market for those nets to encourage the fishermen to bring them back and then he recycled that that nylon because it's a pretty high quality nylon so the whole idea is he's created a sustainable business selling these things made from the nylon that people know comes from the nylon this is crazy ghost fishing yeah they just go around I had a retargeting about sushi I had a really traumatic experience with that in Alaska that's Everett old you know so I met this dude on the ferry going up really cool guy ad from Oregon somewhere he was camping next to me on the deck of a ferryboat and next to him was this really hot woman Becca and Becca never changed her clothes in like three or four days on the ferry really sexy but never changed her clothes never opened her backpack she had this huge backpack it finally turned out it was full of weed she was smuggling from Hawaii up to Alaska Wow so it sort of fell in love with her we get to this town we get off I bet it's like all into fishing he's so anyway he's super into fishing his dream his whole life has been to go to Alaska and fish Wow he's got this super nice rod carbon rod and all this stuff and I don't know about fishing but we were in Petersburg Alaska and we go out I walk out with him I'm a vegetarian but anyway he casts first cast he catches the salmon big-ass salmon brings it in you know it kills it with a rock and all that and then another he's super happy it's his dream everything's wonderful we go back to this campsite where we are and there's like a maybe ten tents around in this campground and it's central area with a fire and all that and he's so happy cuz he's gonna feed everybody he's got these three fish he's feeling great and he's so he's you know put some onions and inside in the foil and all that and everybody's hanging out everybody's super happy he passes out the fish he's got his own the smaller one is for him everyone else is sharing the other two and I'm sitting up behind him looking over his shoulder and I see movement in this fish and I'm like hi and we've been drinking and it's firelight but I'm pretty sure I see movement and I look closer over his shoulder and there are all these tiny little white worms at the center of the fish that hadn't been cooked out and they're all just moving like cilia right oh my god so how many if you had a bite already no I'm a vegetarian oh that's right at that point right so I didn't need any and it's like the best night of his life oh my god and I'm I gotta tell him yes right he's already eaten half the fish oh yeah oh so I say Edmund and stop look look at this and he sees it and he's just like oh he goes from the top of the world to the bottom grabs this bottle tequila drinks half this bottle of tequila to kill it to try to kill what's in his stomach work what a great idea probably thinking yeah is a good excuse to get up yeah whatever happens what the Gila means cure-all in Spanish yeah that's the worms are  scary man that got the guy who escaped North Korea they found enormous tapeworms in his body they said his body was like I think they described it like as a toy that had been broken like it was just broken like all over the place like legs are broken bones are broken his insides are filled with parasites he got your electrician four times awesome yeah it gets shot four times here the whole thing is horrific man that poor guy man that poor  guy for a dude who's falling apart he gets short shot four times and he keeps running yeah that's how bad he wanted to get free I guess you know the videos in a domain he's you seen it no it's amazing it's amazing yeah I was just making this run for and they jumpin out the car in there shooting him and like really close distance while he's running I mean I didn't realize that they were that close to him they were on the ground like 15 20 feet away from him shooting as he's running has he jumped out of his car you know what's crazy is that video of that dude from North Korea and the airport getting that poison put on him yeah Oh Kim jong-un's brother yeah Kim jong-un's brothers video the assassination yeah is on it yeah yes pretty intense and what was it sarin is that what they put on him I don't know what it was some nerve yeah they they trick someone into doing that for them right wasn't that for the defense of the people who did it they're saying they didn't know but apparently there was footage of them practicing it oh Jesus Christ that's him afterwards that's him after getting zapped but you can watch like a professional assassination guy that's yes yeah right at the airport and apparently he had the antidote in his baggage no Jesus Christ but this is the thing with them having like ICBMs like VX VX that 20 minutes after VX poisoning just how nutty I mean this is this is some old-school that they do in the Soviet Union to write a bunch of people over there been killed with poison yeah in London actually they're right there just VX gas that's it mister like puts a like look like a chloroform on this a rag over his face yeah she just walks over and puts a rag on his head another show another video that watch comes up behind him where it is oh whoa that's all it takes to kill you yeah that's insane and he's tank someone just put something on my face holy yeah that's insane yeah that's not scary can't see that coming so you staying there it just walks right up and jacks oh whoa she was fast - that's intense man that's intense so my buddy had got medevac'd out of petersburg with the worms in his stomach intestinal bleeding Jesus Christ they were trying to burrow their way out yeah ETA's bones me inside wait this is your friend you drank that it's a tequila doesn't work to get rid of didn't kill them all he went to the doctor the next day in town and the doctor was like yeah it's probably no big deal whatever you'll be you doctor and then I left and traveled all around Alaska and then went back home and when I was home I got a letter from him that he had been medevacked out and he'd been in the hospital had four or five surgeries how many others lo up I don't know if you look a fish you don't know if he lived yeah how many other people got sick well be just a story if you just just him the other fish were fine could you go and find out for the story so know how we should feel I don't like these open-ended ed was he lives no country for old men time and I want to say you guys seen that video the cam girl he's like a worm shoots at her asshole everyone we did Jamie squats down and it's like just the very tip of some kind of worm thing like pops out of her ass maybe I dreamed how interesting is it that there's two completely different social media platforms that we all use Twitter and Instagram and one of them allows straight up porn which one twitter twitter a straight up porn that's right sometimes in your feet you see a chick just gagging on a fat dick or taking one right in the ass right there yeah yeah Instagram wanted me to show nipples he throws balloons blurs below yeah you got to put like little acorn that's what it's really interesting is cuz my eyesight's kind of going shitty anyway so if a girl any mildly blurs or nipples to me it looks the same so you're getting around that's good getting around playing the system playing the ankle no for real though how blurry doesn't happen this is the question what to see like a picture of my dick right if you have a picture of get in there and you wanted to go on Instagram you with that Hawaiian shirt on Chris with your hog hanging out and you want to take a picture slightly pixelate your day yeah like really clear where the head of it is where the balls are where the shaft is even the color of your dick would be very easier but it's not totally your dick because it's all pixely yeah right oh there look oh okay wait show it from the beginning this is all I found look watch worm that's parasites internally yeah the pixelation thing is one of them thanks for bringing that to our attention I mean that wasn't the highest quality that could have been like some CGI even more up someone CGI worms and that cam girls assholes or but if it was a worm coming out of her asshole could you really suck it back in like that I mean it's a asshole it's not lips it's like it sucked itself back in yeah but you don't have a lung connected to your asshole like how much are you sucking how much power does she have to get that spaghetti back into my thinking it's so pulled a worm pulled its head back in it was like whoa another universe I know right it's use that steady 96 degrees yeah it's cozy Wow how weird man that we can get those I had a dog once it had worms and when she would go to the bathroom that's how I found it I saw worms in her poop yeah and I saw worms like around her butthole I was like up someone's got a problem yeah and I do that ass drag yes the carpet yeah well dogs sold you know they eat everything you know they'll eat anything they find so they had a dead rat they find it dead rather you start eating it and they get all kinds of  up things inside their body oh  man have you seen that documentary wait goddamn it I can't believe I can't remember his name he's the guy who like only ate McDonald's for Morgan Spurlock have you seen Morgan Spurlock's rats yes yes oh my when they when they dissect the rack and you see what's living in that thing about that botfly that was in its neck it's literally like if you had a football growing out of your side of your neck mmm that's how big this botfly larva was it's gone right it's on Netflix it's called rats it is up it is so good really it's so good it's so good man but it is so dis deeply disturbing yeah the raw numbers that you get hit with you're like what wait a minute is that real like when you when you you hear there's as many rats in New York City as there are human beings and you just go wait wait wait wait wait a minute really yeah there's the whole that's from the botfly larvae they pulled out of that thing's body Jesus yeah and they said that there was so many of them that they tested they'd have like terminal illnesses in them yeah just everywhere two men and in New York they set this camera up while this garbage bags were being put out and you see the rats just dart out of the sewer and then they they stuck cameras down to sewer holes to find them and they learn what poison is and they'll piss on it to warn or they'll send in didn't he say they'll send in like like beta rats to eat the poison yeah they send in beta rats and they get stuck in traps and they get the poison and they'll sit back and they'll watch and you can observe them do this they literally yeah they literally send the Dumber rats for their they're like all things we're talking about earlier they're like a super organism Oh rats rats are all basically the same shape and size they vary and like a little bit of air a little bit smaller but mostly the same thing they look exactly the same and they behave like the same they dude they all do the same and they all move into these crafts and they're they're happy to live where nothing else wants to live like we'll take it well moving in and they move in and breed in a way that's just unprecedented in terms of things that like mammals that live alongside humans there's not a goddamn thing like rats like no other animals figured out how to do it like rats right right they can do it in a way with this as many of them as there was of us you just imagine that they're smart how many cockers father must be a lot of cockroaches probably work hi I would guess more than there are rats yeah right sure cuz they're so small small yeah but those those are like particular things it's really interesting because people don't like to they always want to think that they never they never prejudge they're not prejudiced but we certainly are when it comes to rats and bugs butterflies are awesome butterfly lands on you everybody psyched roach watching it run who wants a stomping mosquito comes in spider walks in ah some people freak out some people want to help the spider right yeah man when you see any kind of rat rats are no bueno like to the core you see that rat you like that a squirrel just rats with bushy dead yeah well they don't eat meat that's the thing about squirrels squirrels or even acorns and and ice that is just a better animal but they do eat meat sometimes there's a  up thing about animals especially if there's you know they're sick or they have some weird nutrition requirement there's a video of a squirrel eating a mouse and it's hard to watch man this squirrel is holding on to this mouse mouse with its hands and just chewing into it a squirrel and you're like whoa really this is a trusted you yeah you're a squirrel man yeah we're supposed to be super cool I could feed you like you could like there it is started with the worm in the asshole it's been downhill from there excited it's insane because he doesn't have any problem eating that rat he's watching a movie it's like he's watching Game of Thrones great yeah quick he's devouring it quick I mean that thing is like it's like you holding onto a ham right I have your little hands cream cone yeah look at that guess it's biting into it it's almost gone Jesus not dropped a big chunk oh oh he drops oh look at these giant chunks of guts it's consuming he was hungry this is amazing man he's bearing what's left of it oh this is a squirrel this is a different kind of squirrel that might be why ground squirrels are a totally different kind of squirrel ground squirrels are actually a real problem on ranches because they make millions yeah they estimate to honed ranch is 270,000 acres and someone there told me I didn't check this true but just listen if it is told me that the biomass of these ground squirrels is bigger than anything else on the ranch because these tiny little things they're so many of them that all the deer all the bear all the mountain lions all the wild pigs all the cattle that roam around there all the elk everything every other bird ground nesting birds turkeys everything the biomass of those  ground squirrels was greater than all of it he's like I just want you to think about that for a second I was like what he's like we got a real problem with these things he goes you can't kill them and they they leave holes and then the cattle step in those holes and break their ankles you can't kill them because they're just too wily you gotta find them yeah sit out there with a pistol and you gonna shoot like poison but this is what he said he said he shot one of them and when he shot it another one grabbed it and dragged in a real hole find out if ground nesting squirrels eat meat if ground nesting squirrels are omnivores I wonder if they have a just a totally different diet because they have those gross tails too they have almost rattling yells they're gross little things you don't feel good when you're around them that's why we need more snakes yeah we don't need more snakes we don't need more snakes you know snakes snakes are one of the only things that all babies are afraid of instinctively yeah show an infant than an image of a snake and they'll just freak well that's because in the Garden of Eden a snake is what made Eve eat the tree of them Jesus truck he's right that's just next fall Eve's a good chick most you know TripIt ground squirrels are omnivorous there you go there you go there you go so they're eating meat ground sex caterpillars crickets mice and maybe each other oh they get in there and eat the eggs right under the nest yeah ground nesting birds eggs of ducks yeah eggs and chicks of songbirds mice smaller ground squirrels oh yeah so squirrels ground squirrels are just little monsters yeah that's what that's why we feel bad about them they're their little evil little meat-eaters so so what kept a coyote's I guess probably get something yeah but the problem is they dig into holes and the Coyotes have a hard time catching them to their digs dart to that hole so quick yeah I don't think it's an effective method I don't think they have a lot of effective methods of eradicating them other than like poison and sure if I had to guess what about those rat terriers in the Spurlock show remember that guy that was amazed you know they actually hunt rat I haven't seen the film though dude they tear these rats apart it's amazed they live for it it's like they live for they are in their glory when they let them move yes these Terriers go great that's like Jack Russell terriers and that's why those little are so hyper because their rat killers it's like it's it's  dawn of the deaths like watching zombies and whip them apart it is the gravity shake so happy right now this is the greatest thing that happens to these dogs is hunting or look at that oh yeah look at the  rat try to get away and they just shaking it whoa that is amazing yeah I guess the guys are helping them they're they're digging them up yeah that's the idea look at that kids laughter of children as you're watching their mother get ripped apart by monsters crazy they're in the dirt here and that these these guys are digging them out of the hole and as they dig them out of the holes the rats explain the dogs know that go to look for it yeah look out the wagon there tails there so happy dude yes so nuts it's great you can almost engineer any animal oh there's one got it got it Jesus Christ his head's moving yeah and then what do they do they're not eating well yeah the Chairman part they were tearing them they eat them they're eating but it seems like they just like killing them well they probably eat so much they're stuffed now they're just I'm sure they eat some of it though and that's a whole that last one it looked like he was bringing it over like maybe their train did like it put him in a bag or something that would be clutch maybe golden retrievers and the Ducks why do you why are you so fascinated with this part of nature like sometimes I got to be careful with your feeds man cuz it's like because I know man if you like it's like you I don't look at it but yeah inevitably if you tweet nature's what do you say nature's bitch no he says nature is what do you say what's the thing you say it depends a scary bitch and something like that if I see that I'm not watching scary bitch she's gonna be awesome let's get but why do you amazing why do you yeah why are you so interested in that aspect of nature well it's super extreme right I mean this is an extreme event happening here one life form is exploding on another life form and it seems like it's it's designed to do that when you see a Jaguar killer came in and grabbed it in the back of its neck and bite into a crocodile and dragged it in between its legs up the beach to eat it you're seeing one of the most extreme things that exists in the world you're seeing a life form consuming another life form with its face killing right like eliminating it from its dimension with its teeth at a very specific part of its body and it seems like it's designed to do that and that's the only way you keep these populations in control the populations have a built-in system and we want to look at it through the guise of our civilization and through what we've accepted this is a pet and this is an animal that you eat and you never eat your pet and we have all these weird little sort of distinctions and cultural ideas that we've attached to animal life but he watched them in their world their world is it's unbelievably ruthless unbelievable ruthless like our ideas of animals have become so strange because we keep some of them right we keep them around us and we feed them so they're like really sweet to us but there's not a animal in all of nature that is it was sweet with the other animals around it like there's as many animals that are sweet with the other animals around them all herd animals for example no that's not what I mean I mean I mean like Jaguars and antelopes aren't buddies well when the Jaguars eaten he can walk right through the middle of the herd and they won't even run away because they know he's not hungry oh that's so crazy I think that's like if a murderer like kills one of your buddies and eats them you'll be cool just wandering around that guy yeah their interactions are incredibly ruthless when they but see I this is something I write about in this book I'm working on still which is the the lack of proportionality in this argument because which you're this nature is ruthless red in tooth and claw thing yeah that's been very popular for a long time but the fat is real well it's real when it's real right but it's also real that we die in agony yeah and often our agony is extended by medicine to last much longer than that mouse that just got eaten by the squad I'm not fascinated by death no no these interactions yeah but what I'm saying is that the the conclusion to draw from those interactions that therefore nature is this battlefield misrepresents what actually happens in nature when predation happens it can be nasty of course right but that's what I'm saying I'm not looking at the entire nature as a whole in making this distinction this is the only thing interesting about nature no no no I'm just saying when is just the depiction of nature is being ruthless well it is in that moment that it's nature and that is in that moment and in that moment exists the only reason where these Predators can exist is because they have to be killing things all over the world I mean every place where there's a wolf it means the wolf is alive because it's eating things which means it's killing things all day long I mean that's not that's not an inaccurate depiction the thing is there's so many things there's so many elk legs in so many wolves most of the time the elk aren't getting killed by wolf but those wolves are killing an almost every sure so it's just no matter how you look at it so it's just incorrect to say diminishing the the ruthless aspect of it because you look into the overall picture ever but but I'm not diminishing it what I'm saying is that that's one perspective on it right and actually in terms of proportion it's a minor perspective on it for example I was watching this nature thing and there are these seals playing in the waves and then the dudududududu two starts and this great white comes up and hits one of the seals and they slow it down to one 40th natural speed an orca right well I think it was a great white it may have been an orca it's same same thing and this the seal lands in its mouth and you see it crunching the seal and the blood running down and the narration is nature is ruthless and there's that never-ending struggle for survival right and so I'm looking at that I'm thinking how long do harbor seals live so I look it up online harbor seals live about 25 to 30 years I've seen a lot of seals lying around on rocks having a good time not stressed out I don't see a lot of high stress seals and so I think it's like okay this seal let's say you live 25 years it's hanging out eating sushi having a good time then boom it's dead so quickly that we have to slow this down to one 40th of normal speed so you can enjoy this death porn right that's a tiny sliver of that seals existence and we're depicting nature as this incredibly ruthless horrible bloody place that's just inaccurate well it's not in that moment not in that moment but you can't ignore that moment no of course that moment but that moment is the reason why this seals population is controlled the moment is the reason why the shark can work oh yeah I just it all has to be there I agree with you but I disagree with you I agree with you I see you're saying that this is way more going on than just this tooth Fang claw I don't I'm not looking at it from a moral perspective I'm looking at it from like a chaotic perspective like it is fascinating these two these schools of tuna that we we scooped up with nets they're doubt they're Jack and little fish that's why they're in schools they operate more efficiently that way they're chasing down sardines and them up and that's oftentimes how you catch fish when I was in when I was tuna fishing in Mexico we're catching amberjack ger skipjack I forget but you would find these pools of bait fish but like going crazy on the surface of the water because the tuna we're all ganging up on and jacking up and then you got the the pelicans on top attack amazing birds and then you would see the the frothing of the water and then these fish would just by they'd go crazy and up these little bait fish and you would literally just cast into this football-field-sized swirling in the ocean and these fish would just bite it and you would just catch them almost instantly so that that is not the whole ocean all the time but that's still real like this is real I'm not denying the reality I'm talking to proportion I agree but the thing that I find the most fascinating for whatever up reason is when the water beat the water buffalo comes out the lion and the lion ducks under the water buffalo grabs it by its neck and rolls it over the game and crushes it saying I just I am fascinated by the idea that all moral judgments aside nature has somehow engineered a Jaguar and a caiman and then this Jaguar looked at that came as like I don't want to figure out how to put that in me yeah and they snuck up swam in the water snuck up on a goddamn crocodile shopped on its back there's a lot of cool I like watching Jaguars as well I like to watch the Jaguars when they get a hold of psychedelic plants have you ever seen that is that there's a type of vine that's rich in DMT that Jaguars will chew on and then they literally just lie on their back and they're just staring up in the space trip and ball so I catnip for jackal yes it is but if they think it's psychedelic they think that might be when you have all these Jaguar dreams when people take ayahuasca it might be that the Jaguar is interfacing with the same dimension that you all have so that's the reason what I mean because we know that these Jaguars do take these psychedelic plants and we know that these psychedelic plants when they were first discovered they were trying to call the harmine is the the the chemical but they were trying to call it telepathy no it was the same as I mean they had to run tests on it and find out that there was it was already an established molecule there was an already established compound so the reason why they called it telepathy was because people were experiencing group states of consciousness while they were taking this stuff so they're thinking that these people that do ayahuasca and have these trips with Jaguars they literally might be interacting with Jaguars who are also tripping like see this thing is just eating these leaves and lion dies back clearly in an altered state just rolling around on its back with its paws up in the air staring at things that aren't there yeah staring at it's like in Brooklyn right now with a bunch of people with some  glass blowers a couple of accountants look at its eyes dilate its minds going back and forth that is so wild I'm going to Peru in a couple of weeks are you gonna get down with the funky funky medicine play medicine yeah yeah if the right situation presents itself that's the thing right the problem the people that say plant medicine they all make guilt mm oh yeah they're like really into like the plant medicine you like okay yeah okay like you might be cool if you use those terms all the time or you might be one of those weirdos you know there's there's there's a bunch of people that are into the psychedelic world that they you know they would have been into the Moonies if the Moonies found them right there are lots of different plants that they use though it's not just ayahuasca so if you just use it as a general term there's San Pedro no I'm fully aware it's just the people love saying it yeah they love saying I mean legally it's probably better to use the term plant medicine is so pretentious that aren't gonna get you stopped at any borders yeah I think it's pretentious like I get it I understand why you're calling it a plant medicine but like when I'm getting stoned I'm not thinking let me take my medicine I'm thinking let me get I want to get  high man I want to I want to like get high play with my synthesizers when I'm like when I'm taking robitussin I'm thinking I'm taking medicine right now it tastes like  it's gonna make me fall asleep I just honestly the reason I don't like the term plant medicine is because I think it and forgive me out there you guys but I feel like it in a some small way diminishes all the other reasons I want to take this plant like when I'm when I'm like you know and this is such a degraded thing to say so I'm sorry the remember one used to be sponsored by flashlights yes and you  a flashlight right yes and it made you come but you aren't thinking as you're  the flashlight for the pure hedonic joy of like experiencing an orgasm with this weird dumb thing this tube you're not thinking to yourself I'm giving myself medicine now you're thinking I don't want to soon this is you for that you for I want to come the same way like with some of these substances that's heat never getting high with you again man high the house plans sometimes it's a plant medicine sometimes it's like get high are you saying that sometimes you get high just cuz it feels good to behind that's why God made nitrous oxide Duncan didn't you get your pot license with me from a black guy with dreadlocks was a doctor was calling it the medicine wasn't it didn't you and I go to that place I don't remember this way sure this was in the early days when it was like sketchy sketchy grow-ops were sketchy didn't want people to know where you grow up was it wasn't legal across the board you had to get a doctor's recommendation I remember we've walked into the doctor's office tell me four remember this it was this cool black guy with dreadlocks and he had one of those volcano vapor bags but it was extra long he made it extra long bag like a normal volcano paper bags like that big he had one that was like three feet it was it was cartoonish and as soon as he saw is like y'all look sick [Music] Hilaire and he was baked out of his  mind he was a legitimate doctor yeah full-on dreadlock now that wasn't me I wasn't with you I would know that was not me but you know again it is healing I think it is a medicine and it can be obviously it's a medicine it is a medicine it heals people for sure I just think it's not just a medicine I think it's much more than that maybe we just don't have the language to describe what it is necessarily yet but people aren't getting aren't taking ayahuasca to feel good it's not like a recreational drug oh yeah you know what I agree with you there but I think that a lot of people are not necessarily taking ayahuasca because they are they want something more out of their life they want to they where they want some novelty they want a heightened experience many people are taking ayahuasca is they're chronically  depressed and they're desperate and they need help and the people who are administering it that are legitimate they they're like dog they're like doctors their understanding of these plants is astounding and deep and I get all that and and i and i'm and i'm so i'm certainly not opposed to that concept I'm just saying the term plant medicine itself it feels like somehow it's less romantic than I picture psychedelics to me psychedelics are a combination hedonic tool a portal a means of communion a spiritual practice and also a medicine but there are all those other things too I just I think it's more than a medicine that's all it's something bigger than medicine though all those things I just mentioned you could call a medicine it's just yeah there's an expansion of healing - that goes beyond the physical and into the psychological and emotional and spiritual you know which out makes me sound like a hippie but I I just got schooled I was using the term hallucinogens reflexively and I had Jim Fadiman on my podcast who's the micro dosing guru and he very quickly said you know that that's got a lot of baggage because you don't actually hallucinate you know and it's like wow you're right psychedelics is is definitely better word for it it's a better term but what is happening when you're closing your eyes when you're doing DMT I think it's it's higher it's entirely likely that we don't know and that you you might be actually interfacing with some other place but you're seeing things that seem like they must be hallucination yeah seems like something is interacting with your visual perception abilities where your eyes are seeing things that are impossible now is that because you're actually there and you actually are experiencing these impossible things or is it a trick that's happening with chemicals in your eyeballs and your brain and neuro chemistry and that's that's a question to be answered by people far smarter than I and what is the difference between those two things to what extent is your experience your reality yeah that's the real question right we want to think that if you can't weigh something on a scale if I can't bang on it with a hammer if I can't draw on it with a marker then it's not a real thing right right but if you only said this like if you had an experience with God where you literally were transported into heaven and you had a communication with God and then God gave you love and wisdom and then you came back down to earth into your body and you did this actually did happen or you took a drug and the exact same experience took place in every way shape or form the exact amount of time the exact feeling the exact message the exact visuals the exact reexamining of your life when you returned they're basically the same thing I mean if less you could get God in one of them tuna Nets and bring them back here so I could prove that you had God and that you weren't just ripping your balls off you're basically telling me a story bro either be pissed yeah yeah I don't know I'm sure that there's like a lot of scientific materialists hearing that and they're like they're there they're assholes squeezing into their body just in horror what you're saying because it's like they're they're like well the difference is like when you have a dream and you have this incredible dream where a unicorn comes out of the clearing in the forest and like a rainbow shoots out of its horn and then it turns into us swarm of fireflies that spell I love you well that's like you know that's a really cool dream right but that's not real that didn't have and it's completely different than if you went into a clearing and saw unicorn because if you can go in a clearing and see a unicorn tell me where the clearing is let's get some Nets but it's another thing to about well here's the thing about mushrooms right mushrooms enough stop and think about the people that wrote the Bible it's time to think about the people that have discovered mushrooms a long time ago by trial and error or whatever the method was and imagine everybody deciding to get together in some field somewhere and you all take these mushrooms and you all literally go to heaven and you have this insane experience and then you all come back and you have to write about it in your ancient tongue you have to write this down in as IRA may occur in you roll these up and put them in clay jars and the caves of Qumran so that someone someday will know this yeah I understand what you've been through well when the drought came the the mushrooms went away and we were left with nothing but stories I mean you have to repeat the craziest thing about psychedelics especially the natural ones that don't kill anybody is that somehow another somebody wound up bribing enough people and putting enough disinformation out that one of the most valuable things ever in for human exploration ever as far as like the exploration of our mind is illegal then one of those valuable things that's ever existed for changing the way you view the world giving you a reset the one that end doesn't kill anybody it's illegal it's illegal in societies that are oriented in a way that that would be corrosive yeah right and that's that's why getting wet is legal what's legal in Peru and they just decriminalized LSD and what is it Sweden where do they do I think it was illegal everything's leave yeah Portugal's got it nailed I think it's Sweden they made it a misdemeanor to I can't remember so it's like so somewhere recently they just made it a misdemeanor to have to get caught with acid you know Muslims are on the books for the 2018 elections for California yeah we have to organize this is something we really should really should go after yes like you want to talk to me people oh god that's true guys going to go after mushrooms don't you really could change the world and this is not if we organized and we got a bunch of people to vote YES on recreational use of mushrooms for adults I literally think we could change the world that would be the best it could change the world because like medical marijuana it will spread to recreational marijuana of recreational mushrooms get passed and if they do medical mushrooms get passed then they can start doing tests on mushrooms yeah it's like the John Hopkins psilocybin studies that they've done you would see literally a change in the world you would see a shift in global consciousness and that's not that's not a ridiculous thing to say yeah right you know it's probably true looks like Tim Scully and his partner made all that orange sunshine acid they weren't I had him on my podcast he's such a sweet guy I'm not interested in money he could have made tons of money doing other things he was this child genius and he just made the acid and went to prison for it because he wanted to change the world he really thought it would do it you know I've been talking to through email who William Leonard Picard that dude who got busted with all that acid who's in jail now for like multiple life sentences like when they busted him he's the guy who looks like the missile silo dead yeah that's the guy that had like the girl that lived with him they were selling ecstasy and someone tried to kill somebody yeah it's a crazy so there's some someone go the other guy got arrested Yeah right that girl rad the guy out yeah nealy shitty there's a great book he wrote if you want to read a really trippy book he wrote this book called the rose of Pericles and it's this really cool book and it's kind of like it's very intense to read and the way it's written is really nuts but it's pretty interesting it's talking about sort of the life of a it's the the set up is the guy's going to talk to an LSD chemist and who is sort of explaining what it's like to have to be a secret as you have to be if you're manufacturing what he calls planetary doses of LSD which is what they want planetary doses and that's what they wanted to do that was the ideas like let's manufacture planetary doses of this substance to upshift the consciousness of the planet and one of the things he says it's all very flowering beautiful but he's talking about the LSD chemist people being like this is a for-profit thing and he's saying no you know for us money is just the ability to move around because when you're in LSD chemists and again it's all very flowery writing but he says something along the lines of when you're standing next to the forge of the Gods you stop thinking about money is meaning anything because you're breathing in the fumes your Brut you're like constantly in contact with this like mind expanding substance and good luck when you're mid you know 200 microgram trip good luck taking money seriously man this stuff's ridiculous yeah you know so so um yeah man there was there still is I hope I don't know if there is but there are people who are manufacturing psychedelics and putting their entire lives at risk not because they want to make money and it could be maybe they started off wanting to make money but now that they're manufacturing it because they know of all the ways to shift human consciousness there's lots of ways theoretically to do it you know to imagine being the person who's responsible for literally like a swimming pool filled with acid that you know will change the world like you know like right in front of you if you could get this there would be such a hiccup and shift of culture I mean I don't know which way it would go I don't know what would happen I don't know how much schizophrenia you would trigger I don't know how many people would blow fuses I don't know but I do know that something would happen anyway know about giant evil times when this happened base forgot right yeah yeah that's what they think happened with the Salem witch trials that literally the ergot in the rod because of an early Frost some new fungus had grown on some of the bread and they were able to run tests on it and they believe that it has LSD like property to it yeah yeah I mean that's the that's certainly one of the potential ways to like upshift consciousness through getting people having access to psychedelics in a consensual way you know like when you're  chomping polluted wheat and suddenly you think your neighbors a you know Satan pretty scary that's that's different than like deciding to take a psychedelic in a responsible way and then understanding a little bit more about how to be compassionate or something like that you know we're just seeing yourself for the first time I mean remember seeing yourself erst time I took mushrooms I saw myself when I was like oh yeah that's who I am and I like you before you do it it's like you have this idea looking in out and then you're separated from all of your life and you're like this entity observing from the outside your life your selves the first time I ever considered myself outside of myself dude that this this is I'm sorry I always bring up around us on your podcast you love them okay but one of the great thing on those beads one of the great stories is one of the great stories is that I you know he gave LSD to neem Karoli Baba his guru Twice first time anything you can find a youtube video of him telling this story it's amazing it gives him like you know owlsley owlsley kid Charlemagne has given him this incredible LSD says it's 300 microgram tablets made by one of the great LSD chemists of our time and he's going to any to give it to people and he gives it to gives a 600 micrograms to neem karoli baba now 600 micrograms is like that that that that's just too much and neem karoli baba eats it but the way he's eating it is he's like doing this throwing it in his mouth and he eats it nothing happens so ramadasa gets back to the united states he's telling one of his scientist friends this story in science friends come on dude he didn't eat it he threw it he palmed it he threw it over his shoulder this story is you got tricked you got hoodwinked by a Bob out in India they're all out there they just want you to worship them they want you to think they're powerful so like Ron das gets back to India the second time with acid again and this guy named Crowley baba says to him when you were here last time what did you give me and ramadasa says Lee well I gave you all SD and he's like did I take it and Ramdas is like I don't know and he's like giving me more give me more so he gives him more and he takes these pills puts him in his mouth chewing them up in front of him and opens his mouth his mouth is coated with tablet acid he's taken according around us now 900 Mike's of this stuff and so he goes under his blanket and starts shaking and I know people now have seen you saw this happen not just him telling the story who saw it happen and they said like the blood rushed out of Ramdas his face he's like oh my god oh my god what have I done what was I thinking I just drove this dude crate I essentially just gave an old man 900 micrograms of acid and the hills of India and he's going to go nuts and it's gonna be my fault right and so like neem Karoli Baba comes out of the blanket this eyes are back in his head he's like no and then he just goes back to completely normal nothing no effect and he says to him was he was he laughing what no he was putting he was playing on a he's playing a joke two-faced  wit good buddy but uh but uh he was just with but what what what he said to him was it's really interesting we said to him was this he said we used to they used to have something like this in the Indus Valley and he said this will bring you into the presence of Christ but you have to leave better to become Christ than to hang out with him this what he said which is yeah yeah yeah that was his because their premise was this is something like this is definitely a thing for sure but there's be that thing yeah yeah that's it that was the time you can live there yeah I think that we're entirely imprisoned by a wall of ideas and of behavior and of momentum and of culture and of conditioning and the way we look at the world is like these pre-programmed trunks that's a car that's a building I don't think necessarily we see it for what it really completely is which is some very strange temporary life that no one has really defined the meaning of it where we're in infinity yeah hurling through space yeah surrounding a giant nuclear explosion rocketing through the universe and all of it trying to make make sense of it all and in between there you got cops killing people in hallways you've got black lives matter you've got you've got every single possible variation from furries to people that it's their job to ticket street vendors who don't have the right yeah but the whole thing is this entire thing that we're experiencing is really psychedelic if you weren't living life and if life made way more sand so I call a you know if the world that we're normally accustomed to is much more controlled and two-dimensional and you could see the world that we live in for the very first time you'd be overwhelmed by how insane it is you'd be overwhelmed by the possibilities we'd be overwhelmed by the Internet you'd be overwhelmed by language you'd be overwhelmed by feelings and emotions and all of it if we weren't used to it all of it will be like wow this is crazy like nonverbal expression the people of strip clubs race cars all of it planes what they have metal tubes they fly them through the air and we're just so used to all of it that life itself is very psychedelic it's just a psychedelic experience that we've grown deeply accustomed to and I think the psychedelic experience that you have when you're on a heavy duty thing like a DMT it's like you venture forth into a dimension that you don't have context for but you feel familiar you feel familiar with it but you don't have context for it it doesn't fit into your normal patterns yeah but the normal patterns are just as bizarre man the normal pounds we're taking liquid how do these clear plastic things that are made out of oil somehow the other they figured out to turn into a clear plastic when we fill it up with liquids and you drink them then you chuck these things and if you follow the the path of this plastic bottle it might eventually wind up in some seagulls gut choking it to death in the middle of the ocean you know I mean it's yeah and but then also add to that that you're melting into time too while you drink from the bottle you're not just just not the insanity this bottle is like you're this bottles mid process it's somewhere from some batch of gooey to being a bottle to being and a seagull's got your mid process too honey you're getting funny your admit process and in light shows the Sun and so is the Sun but you know that a fun thing to do this is something that occurred to me when I was super high recently I was sitting in the this  apartment and then I'm suddenly it dawned I mean like wait a minute how many other people are gonna live here and then I'm thinking like wait how many people have lived here and then I'm thinking how many conversations have happened in this apartment where everybody thought these were really serious conversations oh yeah we're really getting into it man and then you realize oh my god I'm just a little I'm just a little eddy of air spinning around in this apartment I'm gonna leave and there's gonna be other little eddies of air that spin around in this apartment the apartments gonna be around way longer than any of those other eddies of air so really just to add to what you're saying the beauty with the glorious nature of the universe versus our ability to comprehend it is that we are so impermanent we are so impermanent and we are so fluid and we're so melting at the time it's a really amazing thing to let allow you and I and you say you say we're used to it and sometimes I think yeah that must be it but I think also there's a lot of ignant were ignoring it yeah we're numb to it it's too much overwhelmed yes yeah you know you think about hunter-gatherers hunter-gatherers lived in the world that created them yeah the world that they volved in right so it's the same world your father and grandfather and great-grandfather everybody lived in the same world so the skills you're born learning you grow up learning those are the skills that are appropriate to your world we're in a world now where even people who are alive are in a different world than the one they were born into yeah you know where I grew up before the internet right this is all new yeah I was in my 30s when the started yeah some nuts and but people younger people can't imagine what it was like to travel before there was email yeah see you were like 40 when the first iPhone came out right I was born in 62 yeah so the whole thing is it's hard to imagine it being any different than it is but if you really just think of what it is I leave just the discussions that we've had here today about what the potential issues could be with AI with advancing technology that has not been mapped out it's not it's not going to be regulated as far as how far innovation is allowed to continue it's not going they're gonna they're gonna be so far ahead of the people that understand the regulations together the things are gonna be coming out like the Internet itself the internet came out itself before they really understood what the implications were I mean if the government could go back in time and pull the hey hey hey pop let's talk about this first pull that plug right out of the wall before the internet went on AOL and let's just talk about what we're gonna do with this and let's let's manage this because let me show you what it could be and then you see 25 years later people like holding on their phones walking into traffic and getting hit by cars because they're so addicted to checking their Facebook yeah man yeah it's nuts yeah I imagine of a drug could do what cellphones do imagine if a drug came along and the drug made you like stare at your hands all day I mean like praying yeah the only date you know the only difference is you are getting some information but I mean if there was a drug that came along that made you want to stare at your hands like 90 percent of the day yeah like if you're playing video games you're not getting any information that's true yeah well they say the video games in some ways are good for the psyche though good for the they may dream on pilots yeah you know what's not good for my psyche getting my ass kicked at hearthstone with this new expansion nerd but very quickly though the thing you're talking about the the the the concept of like a drug that makes you stare at your hands I think our thoughts at one point like the ability to think the way we do was a new technology it started emerging and so like when you're caught up in your thoughts what's the difference between that and looking at your cell phone like when you get obsessed with your thoughts and like because I've noticed like whenever I get really caught up in a flurry of thoughts and I allow myself to really get lost in the thing you're talking about the simulation the projection into the future your 17 fights ahead with this person because they said this thing they're never going to say I think that's a form of looking at your cell phone only it's the internal simulator inside the neuro computer that your brain is I don't think it's too much different I think both of these things are just different attempts to try to evade the present moment because the present moment is so overwhelmingly heartbreakingly beautiful that we'd rather have our faces buried in our phones or in our thoughts I think that's the problem is the more that we get into the moment it's amazing here it is amazing but I don't think that's what's I don't think it's the fact that it's beautiful that's making people be distracted I think it's overwhelming the amount of data that's coming our way and I don't think we're designed for it I think that's one of the things that gets people at peace if you're on a hike in nature this is all stuff where your brain has a hole for it we're talking about keys like keys slots those keys just fit in there's the tree there's the bird look at that eagle holy Wow look the salmon are jumping that's there's keys for that there's there's receptors for that stuff when you're walking down Santa Monica Boulevard and there's people honking their horn and different music is playing in different cars and there's smells that aren't natural and there's so much data coming your way it's overwhelming and then you're thinking about your work and your job your boss keeps giving you massages you know you just just want to when it gets back to that natural unnatural conversation we began right because you know you're you're describing the metaphor of receptor cells or something for these different inputs but another way to look at it is your body has expectations right your eyes are designed with an expectation of certain wavelengths of light that are relevant to this animal right those are like the reds of the berries are relevant cuz now they're ripe and you know they're different than blood is shocking and all the ears are expectations of certain decibel levels that would be important for this animal to hear rabbits have totally different set up you know so your whole body your lungs are an expectation of oxygen-rich air you know everything and when you take that animal out it's confused because what it's expecting isn't there so it's not just metaphorical it's it's actually physiologically we're living in a world that our bodies don't expect god damn what a great way to end this thing after sitting for five hours this was fun Jesus Christ thank you guys let's do this moron make these easy we can all just will triple cast it you want to do that while three put it out sure put it will do that in whatever time yeah yeah so that way nobody
