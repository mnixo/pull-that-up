doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo 4 3 2 1 my brother and the man who got me in the Instagram if it wasn't for you I would have abandoned that remember you won and I still got like 40,000 followers are you like 4 million that many I don't think I have 2 million got to man whatever you got me into it man hey cilantro cilantro what does that mean you say that all the time cilantro is like the Gaelic Irish salud Wow yeah you know it's that it's Slainte it's like sl8 int II with like one of them crazy marks on it oh that's a it's so Gaelic Gaelic ISM but some real writing language to read or try and pronounce some shit they'll be like somebody's name will be Gary and it'll be spelled with like 6 17 letters scusa versus a shit crucifix what's that what crucifix with the circle yeah this is that I was just I think is among those runes and shit I don't know dude does anyone speak Gaelic can you go have a conversation with Samoa and Ireland people do for sure so would you like like I'm sure it's a dying lost kind of fading away thing but there you'll find pockets that definitely do it's fucking crazy when you stop to think about how many different languages there are like have you done much touring in Asia um really only Japan I haven't hit crime never been to Korea never been like China never been in Indonesia or anything that's not rip yeah yeah Indonesian yes sorta agent I've only been to Japan and only for a few days I love seeing oh it's amazing the people are so nice and polite and it's it's fascinating one of the results your works one of the reasons I love it so much too is it's like you go to Europe you don't feel foreign necessarily you know I mean it's really the foreigner experience when you're there I'm now out the obvious outsider I learned most people and I'm Caucasian you know and there's a lot of places there like I try to go to like I get the lowdown on a sushi spot from somebody that I knew there and then you go there and be like oh no no caching we don't serve them we don't serve y'all here likes those places like that you know you try and get the down-low Anthony Bourdain treatment like three Bourdain you might not have no luck you don't show up at that zero point zero crew yeah man it just they're so different than us in their culture that it's like this crazy immersion into an alternative world like Japanese writing is so different than American writing the sound their languages is so different than the sound of English then when you go that you like wow this is like look I'm literally peering into a coexisting alternative world like whatever look what if there was no different languages it was just language like everybody knew what everybody spoke right in your language was the sounds that they make and the way they interpret things and the way they interpret things shapes the way they look at reality I sure if that's I mean it's a well we're like our cultures in a lot of ways almost like an operating system I think Terence Mckenna described it that way and I think it kind of makes sense it is like an operating system yeah we learn a basic set of parameters and rules that we all kind of about yeah we're all individuals within it but like there's you know hey you know in this society this is what's acceptable and this is what isn't and here's how we peer it and then when you see something like we were talking about this book dear reader Michael milos who is on yesterday who is just amazing podcast guests but it was talking to us about North Korea like that's a different totally different operating system and that shit is going on right now right now there's like a whole country that's in prison yeah what's amazing to me is that that many people can be subdued to me in that manner the wit like where's you know you all read throughout history is like you know people got sick and tired or some shit after a while and just fucked up yeah where are they what what is going on there what mastery - these dudes have that it's crazy I mean look at that there's millions of people they're starving and still except and this dudes living in is whatever Golden Palace whatever kind of lifestyle and nobody's really like trying to revolutionize I start a revolution or buck up and McCool would be a problem cuz I think the old guys around them are even crazier well mouse was telling me why he was saying that the way their society is structured everybody reports on everybody else about what you did wrong like if you and I were hanging out together we'd be forced to report at the end of the day I would have to report on everything you did wrong like maybe you didn't cry long enough when something happened maybe he didn't express enough grief like you have to there's like rules to the way you grieve people who didn't grieve hard enough got six years six months rather of hard labor for not grieving hard enough when kim jong earlier yeah woo so they tell on each other so they have this crazy culture of television that podcast was fascinating man that dude is a really really interesting guy scary that's a world that's happening right now it exists yeah and next door it's South Korea which is thriving and pop culture galore yeah crazy plastic surgery those girls all get are those not those all of them but a high percentage of girls get their eyes changed they get this crazy surgery that makes your eyelids they shrink your eyelid so they don't have the Asian look you know the inner China for a more of a round diet they tried for a more of an anime thing oh the big I have you seen it I think I have I but I don't I think I don't think it was an Asian girl I think I saw some some girl on internet who's trying to look really much no I did it look like and that's that make thirty lady bright the Barbie lady I've made this crazy yeah there's people that go dude like how do you think like that how's your brain working I mean that you're not looking in the mirror and seeing the same thing I know this is your this is giving you satisfied I don't think I'm it's just body dysmorphia it's the same things like a person who's a bodybuilder who just can't get big enough for a woman who can't get fake enough breasts like they keep wanting to get bigger and bigger ones you don't see yourself how everybody else sees you so it's almost like a disease and I think that um always funny because I always don't have a pretty fucking awesome dude yeah well yes your self-esteem should pull those pictures up so check out what they do see if you could see good ones three wiesen zwei won-jin plastic surgery for eyes eyelid surgery show but show some like before and afters just a little one right there kind of crazy some of them are kind of crazy like they look like a totally different human like if you went to high school with her you'd be like what wait what that seems totally normal right there there's been some extreme ones see but her whole face is different shaped at that point the one you just passed yeah what was more than just eyes done there man it's interestingly not younger and younger girls are having that kind of stuff done too whoa damn whoa that one was very successful that was a good decision yeah there's an excellent decision but how do we know these are real you know that's another we could be getting fuck you do it holy shit leave that one this is something I wanted to talk to you about anything how do we know it what it's like how do you know what the fuck is true anymore it's almost impossible to cuz because everybody's mastered the half truth yeah you mean that I got a piece of the truth and then I spin it the way I wanna spin it so a certain amount of people are gonna see it that way that's why it's how they really the whole I trip on this whole system right now I don't give a fuck about Trump Clinton any of that all right fuck all of them they're all lying crooks as far as I'm concerned right but PA Mon how they have blue states red we're like Bloods and Crips here they and they're making it more like that every day like the hatred between this blue and red so what the fuck is this yeah it's like people got along just six months ago are now at each other's throats and there used to be a thing when we were young when the new president was elected and he became president we all kind of sat back and said okay that's our president let's see what right I'm not stay we're not gonna get into dude right we're not right I'm talking as just as a principle right well that's that exchange but we all sat back and said okay let's let's give the guy a shot at least right what and again we're not even I'm not even interested in getting into all individual infection right that doesn't exist anymore it's like the minute this dudes president the next fucking campaign starts and like you gets fucking crazy is it as crazy as I think it is Joe or lies in your home everything's like crazy chant world of taking care of these babies and going on tour and I just turn on the TV and it blows my fucking money it's blowing everybody's mind man I mean there's a weird line that's happening now - and this isn't really even a criticism but Newsweek had an article that they tweeted and the article shows how Molina rejects Trump's hand I mean this is kind of Awesome I saw it it was I understand slapped it away it's cool it is kind of but who knows what's going on maybe she gets public anxiety isn't like holding hands when she walks like he doesn't necessarily have to mean anything the fact that it's a fucking story that Newsweek tweets out is strange Shinx CNN had it on I believe they got a whole article after hand swat let me this is nothing it's like they touch hands for a second back it up again I'm no trump supporter here but look newsweek i'm not don't get me wrong nobody's is anything wrong with what you're doing I don't think there's anything wrong with putting this up I watched it I'm glad you put it up I'm not so I put it I would watch it it's not news though yeah now that he says we are all part of the biggest reality TV show ever created in the universe now yeah Trump is the host yes anis and that's exactly minus E right now like we have all given this guy and again I don't care I'm not even gonna say hate love whatever fuck em all it's fascinating but this dude is like king of the fucking universe in his mind right now yeah there's nobody could fucking touch him and that's the fuckin that's why the show is gonna get so hilarious it's just gonna be great well I think he's he's not that stupid like he's aware that there's been a lot of criticism he's trying to iron things out but what he's doing is he's taking this approach that he's made become this real estate magnate this you know big tycoon big businessman which is like he was always his rambunctious sort of flamboyant personality right he always put his name in gold letters on these buildings and we didn't mind that when he wasn't running the country just when you run the country and you start doing the same stuff like the criticism that he's getting is kind of you can't kind of do the same thing when you're the president you can't like talk about how shows youtuber wants a big like something it's a bigger than yourself thing you just nail in fact you have to let go of self to a certain degree I mean to be a good one I'm not I'm not gonna say you one guy's been better than the other we all know we have our opinions on that shit you know I mean honestly but I I grew up in an age where politics and religion with if it was gonna be bad news you didn't bring it up with people you liked you know I mean and now it's just the hatred I see like even from people I respect the red and white red and blue yeah they do think ripping and blood now here hard and hard for their parties and it's stupid because none of them care about you none of them want anything from you but more of your tax money no matter how much they're going to tell you they're gonna cut your taxes you mean that if they're gonna find a way to fucking get that money they might make it look good to you but hey guess what middle-class family in $36,000 here whatever we there here's to brand you don't have to pay in taxes year which it seems a lot when you're in that level of living I mean yeah I blow that on fucking sneakers I'm ashamed to say I mean but the point is they don't give a fuck because they just stole it out the back end of your health care or they just took it off the top of not rebuilding all the roads this is their game they run the game and so these motherfuckers come up with some shit where money comes out of the politics I don't respect any of it I would like to think that some of them have your best interests in mind that there's just a crazy competitive system and that we maybe you know maybe it's just like what the system makes like the system kind of makes corruption because of lobbyists because of the way it's set up it's almost like you can't pull it out of it I totally agree with you that there's plenty of good ones yeah it's legit just like cops I know a lot of combine they're all good guys I think this mortal would shop when the shit storms but but when the shit storms pop up they don't buck out and say like you know what that was wrong and go against what the group of cops or politicians is saying either one I could be either one they side even in wrong times when they shouldn't where are those voices I want to hear them don't you think there's way more that's gonna get respect yes thank you politician I do but but my point is there's a code oh here's a car noise in that good cop will fucking not shit on a bad cop maybe you're right back in but he's still there's a time when you got a shit on that thing or well that person or that act that I'm and and there's this code in politicians and in in cops where they don't call out the bullshit yeah you know I mean and that's where I lose all the respect for everything it's like oh and I just sit back I'm on some carlin shit man I got a front row seat to the Freak Show watch it go down you're asking them to do the impossible job you're asking them to be around violence and lying and danger and they're the enemy you're ask them to be the professional enemy to professional criminals that's what you ask them to do all this alone and so like there's a reason why they'd bond together like that because there all in the war together and it's us and them and it's we on the outside I don't think we understand what the fuck they go through that's why they have this bond with each other it's no doubt you wouldn't want that you really would want but there comes a time you're right and there's been a ton of them lately in in recent history oh yeah where there should have been an overwhelming common condemnation by a group of a smaller group of that groups actions like I mean perfect um example is that Eric Gardner case in New York where they choked that guy who's just selling cigarettes they didn't have to do that there was no reason to do that that guy didn't even have any cigarettes on him the whole thing was fucked up they were saying he wasn't complying why should he comply he doesn't he wasn't doing anything you can't can't you want a video was he not complying enough to die you know I mean well I think the dude had like an asthma attack or something but obviously really fuck they had to choke us together in the gas choke though it was more like honestly I mean it was a choke hold but it was more like the way he was applying it was like a restraining thing more than it was I want to see it let me see it again maybe I'm remembering it wrong but without a doubt the forearm is under the neck like if I wasn't calling it in a fight I would say this guy's getting choked right well I mean honestly do the time and go down a road but the point of this conversation I believe was just saying like oh that that overwhelming larger number of good folks whether cops politicians soldiers whatever right I do believe that exists that the majority of them are decent good people yeah but when the shit hits the fan they don't collectively say that's wrong and that's fucked up no they all band together and say like alright we'll try and bury this and hide it in or or just deny it I think and that as a group loses you respect when people are saying you know that are interested in justice and interested in fair play and interested in that see these things happen they lose faith yeah I think there's no faith in anything right now the way I see that's the way I see the division in this country on it there's no faith in anything I'm hoping it's just a wave and it's gonna come back it will I mean that's what I'm I'm thinking that we're gonna react I just hope it doesn't come back see it really fucked up ways because sometimes when that wave crashes it breaks shit very well it shouldn't the problem is it's so easy to think that we're against each other it's so easy to dig your heels in and argue one side or argue the other or pick a team and be totally committed to it whether it's red blue or whether it's black white people get on these goddamn teams we do it men and women did you see it it gets real divisive online with people of the separating men and meant women like criticizing men all men in general criticizing women all women in general absolutely it's the same shit it exists whether it's Democrat versus Republican it's it's the same shit vegan versus carnivores it's the same shit people pick a fucking team and they fight for and they think they're right and they have many many good reasons for thinking they're right but I think all of us are way better off if we're taught about these team ideas early and recognized when you see them in yourself and do some like self governing and absolutely avoid those avoid those and we'll fight common ground on a lot more shit than we think it's pretty much we can sum that up but like no think for yourself yeah it's core value especially when you're bombarded the way we are now that's another thing about how we started this conversation so how do you know what the fuck is really true if you really want to know what the fuck is true or at least get a good semblance of it you have to look at more than one fucking thing if you read some story on Facebook that outrages you and fucking makes you so pissed off maybe it was intended to do that maybe you should go look further look down the road look at a paper you would never look at look at I I'd like to look when I when I get interested in the news which isn't as much as it used to be because I have my own things which I'm sure will get into it I try to be like all right I want I see CNN on at my studio a lot without the sound because we'll be making music and whatnot and mostly I just read the tikar because if you know nowadays news is on the ticker opinions are what are coming out the fucking speakers when the when the personalities are talking news is just the facts that rolls scroll along down on the bottom and you know there's some spin on it and whatnot but I try not to listen to the Talking Heads because they you know Fox has to probe Democrat guys that no matter what the Democrats do they're gonna defend it and CNN has a couple of Trump guys and no matter what goes right they have their players it's a game you know I mean they're all it's all a game it's a it's a television show I was watching it but not too long ago when CNN came on after a commercial and the studio was lit up red and Korean stars were everywhere and there was nuclear missile launches like pictures in the background and I was like oh my god what the fuck is going on did they just launch missiles and nothing like it had happened they were just discussing the possibility of the future of if they got a missile that was capable and it's like this is and people are tuned into this shit and as that I like I said it's on in the background because I just got forbid that breaking noon you want to know I mean it's reality TV honestly and again it's what we're talking about people acting as groups and acting above it other groups I watch it I do too it's entertaining to me but my my my deeper self brain whatever you want to call it The Whisky starting to fucking talk to me right now so this is that has a conscious my conscious my soul's you know evaluates why I'm being entertained by it and finds it disturbing a lot like and wants to say like hey man we should all fucking take a step back and I love you because you're the love shit I mean I always have that love in my life I've been a very fortunate man but like coming in here has grown men you have when I first started doing your podcast you would always be preaching love and you know did I mean Joe Rogan is a tough guy kicked the shit out of 90% of the fucking people around he's not interested in it he just lost a lot your life is better if you care about I'm really it started me down a path dude where I was like I've explored almost every religion you know I mean there is and I don't really practice any but I have a philosophy that's taking its own good parts from all right and um lately I've been reading a lot of Buddhist stuff I'm not a Buddhist knitting at all I like this tick not Han guy and a few other things I've been reading but these things are also kind of starter here because connecting with you in a weird way it made me open my mind up with you like like there's a lot of things we don't think alike at all on you know I mean it but doesn't that's that doesn't fucking matter why I know I'm talking to people that I don't necessarily exactly but I respect that's like one of my fit some of my favorite conversations that's the best kind yeah well you can get that and that's the point of what they're trying to keep from happening in this world whether it be just this whole online shit has taken us yeah there's a lot of great things that have happened for this but this social networking shit is anything but social we're working it out you know is anything but social well for a lot of people it's just way too distracting a lot of wicked evil just venom that dude like you know I learned from either very once in a while every once in a while I'll catering or I'll let it do no online like a motherfucker you really don't know you really don't know that's there you know I mean I I whatever you really don't know IP addresses are easy to fear in that kind of shit and you know what nine times out of ten when I do fuck up that rare occasion it's a Joe Rogan fan it's like hey man take the high road dude Joe - Joe yeah and I'll be like oh fuck yeah sure all right you're right and I'll boo that's over yeah kind of thing you know I mean you get a show as being like a real serious not just a show you me and you having a little friendship we have because I'm falling out with you a lot since it's been three years we've talked a lot though that it was we're we're trying to figure it out we're like why does it not feel like through wheels let me three years now since I couldn't come in for a while but and I explained this to you on the phone and when we hung out a couple times my mother was passing from Alzheimer's and then when she did passes like I was emotionally incapable if I wouldn't even have said those words out have been a blubbering idiot on your show sure sure and and you know you know whatever some people might be like hey that would been great ready yeah we you were the one to say hey get your shit together do you hear me cuz I wanted to come here maybe I'd say like that that would be like jokey shit together so your mom's dead no no no ever bro it's less talking you know yeah that's not I said it I know what you mean but it would be more like you know because it was good I went it was the last four years probably started probably last right before I stopped the last time I came on the show there was like a big lawsuit over jump around that I actually wound up winning but like it froze money that I depend on Ryan like mailbox money we call that that's like those checks that just kind of come in your jump around it's been really good to me to jump around is my favorite hip-hop 25th anniversary this year the whole first album so but point being so I got I got a way out when I first started hanging out with you because I was such a fan of that song house I can't believe I know this dude I remember you you were weirded out when I lit a joint in the club in Girgis and you were like what are you doing I was like what do you mean what am i doing I'm lighting to join they tell me splayed out went down Everlast goes he goes you wanna get high I go fuck ya and and I go where you want to go he goes go go yeah we going no happiest lighten up but it looks to me like psy days like go spark shit right in the club and I was like oh this is hilarious yeah that was that night wasn't that that same night that you performed on stage and there was a bunch of musicians that have never worked together on stage Dave Navarro's you know that was a dead camp Freddy they had like a banner they just did a bunch of covers and they i'ma being fucked up and they all and when telling a bunch of English ever glasses and nails right like three or four times before what it's like to what it's like yeah that's my dude that was a fucking high good night that's us oh we're barbecue oh my god I can't see my eyes that's exactly the spot we were smoking the joint into right exactly where it was mad I just never remember you looking at me sideways go and go go fuck up go what we'll hide in the bathroom and smoke a joint fuck out here I took way too good for that bullshit especially in Vegas like I had like done if any place in the world you're gonna be outlandish tipper beat it there because you'll get away with murder almost literally and that the valets will say like alright yo the cops are on their way you better get the fuck out I'm sure they want to keep them a choice coming cops are coming with you like it or not imagine being a cop in Vegas Jesus Christ oh regardless how many people they have done their robbing casinos and shit crazy movie style high meth heads with masks on machine guns and shit taking over casinos but um oh I was talking about so that I was like so much money got frozen bust my ass crazy heart like on the road trying to make up the difference for a while and then my mother started going way downhill kind of fast over two years you know it's like dealing with that that is anybody going through that is is you know gets I mean there's a lot of things that go on in my life don't get my heart sent out to those people watching somebody you love just disappear with it was tough yeah well that was BEC t'v right it changes your perspective you realized that this is this is how it ends I had a lot of guilt involved because with the kid with CF I couldn't have my mom in home with a nurse and any infections that she could she was getting lung infections all the time so I had her in a home a really beautiful home they took magnificent care of my mother but there was a lot of rent I was I was freaking for a while like with a lot of Darkness I thought I was swimming through and that guys just wasn't good for me to come through and then you know and then after she passed and like Leila's just been like learning you know I'm only just me and my wife now it's she's seven years old and I think I'm not saying we got anything licked or cut but like the life we have to live we've been able to figure out with her cystic fibrosis yes with the cystic fibrosis because it's all Emmy it's heavy there's a lot of shit you got to worry about infections and any common cold concentr the hot it's like so much pressure on a person to do that it's it's my wife and I like you know I won't fucking make it funny we we've been very close to the brink a few times but we finally got into a stage where it's like nah none of that's going to break us you know I mean we're good and we're good and we're good in this life and there's and we accept where we are and we're going to make sure this this young lady is is gonna make it that's a little bit as deep in this far into this life as she can you know and it's been some medical innovations too right I mean they're working on some stuff man there's that there's a couple drugs that aren't quite for her yet because this drug has in the in on the DNA level of the chain there's there's mutations Layla has two different mutations one is called the Delta f5 508 I believe it is you got me high and a little drunk here but like I no no no is it people help people who no no it's easy to find out she has the most common that's the most common one like Delta 508 and then she has this other weird kind of offshoot one there's one some people have a double what they call a double Delta there's a drug right now that's really working well for the people with the double Delta they're starting to experiment it on on it for people with the single now does she have to be on some special diet like a the only diet we just need her she needs to do they have a problem gaining waves cystic fibrosis they um they don't process fats properly they have to take enzymes with everything they eat so gaining weights a real serious issue leila actually has a g-tube a feeding tube that she gets six shake protein shakes a day pumped into her stomach uh uh she again if you my daughter very rarely is down about this she'll have her moments don't get me wrong where it's like frustration and angry over her but it's this is life she's never known anything else so it's like at the same time like we post a lot about it we made a decision leila has her own page people are free to try and follow it if my wife will approve you if you can get by the security clearance her thing is Leila la ila Beauty oh nine she wanted her own page because we started I've never posted anything without asking her right even when she was like barely able to understand I tried to be like can I post this picture a lot of people will see it and she would say okay daddy and now she's mine you know she's sharp and about a year or so ago she was like I want my own Instagram page I want to share my life like cystic fibrosis with people and so she's doing that and we this is may actually a cystic fibrosis awareness month so we've been posting and she happened to be in the hospital the last ten day she's home right now recovering um I saw them I sent you an article on cystic fibrosis treatment what was that as a while ago I don't know but my wife and I are I I did it involve CBDs I don't remember because I so rarely send me things and we're investigating some stuff on that level right now because there are a lot of good things going along with this because it's one of them it's one of the best anti-inflammatories there are with no side effects and all kind of stuff we're not using it on my daughter yet but we're investigating like what kind of uses there arm you I forget I might have to go back through my emails or whatnot I remember you did send me something I don't remember if it was CBDs or stem cells or some shit I just levels right now there are a lot of levels they're working on digit on the stem cell level there there's a lot of things going on where it's like if they can create correct things on a cellular level at some point it's going to be yeah there's never going to be a cure it's a genetic disease so you can't say cure in that sense you know I mean like the way it works is my 1 2 Peter 2 people that are that fathered a child have to each have the gene all right so me and my wife are known as what what are known as carriers which we never knew because we've searched our whole history after we found out nobody in my family's ever ever had this nobody and her family's ever ever had this but we're known as what's carriers so when we got together and we had a child there's a 1 in 4 chance that child is going to have cystic fibrosis there's a 2 in 4 chance they're going to be a carrier oh wow there's a 1 in 4 chance they have no nothing at all which is our other daughter Sadie so we kind of represent the whole spectrum like our family know Lila her mom me and Sadie which is another reason I go I'm not having six kids because I love being a dad but it's like two cystic fibrosis children in the same household is even and a lot of people do it it's hard because they pass infections and it's very as you because I can't even imagine how the people with multiple two or three kids with cystic fibrosis pull it off hats off because I know what it's like we just won that's kind of the UM of not just ten that must be changing you as a person like think about like how much more compassionate this is made you and how much more appreciative of hell I've had to also accept and learn how to deal with a lot of anger yeah a lot of anger like I consider myself pretty spiritual person like I said I've explored a lot of religions I find religions confining you know I believe in a greater power greater high or whatever something bigger than us I kind of believe in that you know whether you want to call it God or just our connected collective energy you know whatever it might be somewhere in between their lives something greater than us I felt for another reason the last three years is is I'm what's the captain's name in a in Forrest Gump cat and edges or no captain was again again captain Dan Lieutenant Dan out for the last couple years I'm lieutenant Dan on the top of that fucking sailboat like fuck you that this is what you're gonna do to this little kid you know I'm watching my child suffer you know me and there's greater there's huge in justices in world and and let me tell you another thing having to take my daughter to children's hospitals all the time I see people that have it worse do you know Meehan Gillette do not know yeah I'm a huge fan I don't know him personally but his huge fan he's a great dude but one of the things he said to me I'll never forget he was talking about the secret do you remember when the secret was this big movie the book attraction and people are gonna manifest their own destiny and they were gonna make it happen and everything in your life you created in your mind and he was like fuck you you're telling a young sick kid that she made that herself she made that she made herself have leukemia she made herself have cancer you're telling me that fuck you fuck you and when he said that I was like wow I never thought about it that way but he's totally right that's exactly what it is like you can't that's ridiculous you're dealing with a bunch of people that have become successful and told you why because I saw it happening what about the people that saw it happening it didn't have it I think this is bullshit or a far greater number but yeah it's a part of life it's not the whole key to manufacturing a life it's an excellent like a being a positive person being healthy having a good vision and focused all those things are like contributing factors but kids that are sick are the monkey wrench and any idea that we've created our own reality I don't but you can't make a baby responsible for cancer that's crazy you also can't make a god responsible for like God has a plan you know you know what sometimes there's not a fucking plan sometimes there's a glitch in the goddamn matrix yeah you just got to deal with it you know you got to handle it and and the more important thing for me that second most important thing in my life other than keeping Leila as healthy as possible as making sure she knows that you know she can still achieve in a cup all that she can you know she's out of age now where like she kind of you know I'm not trying to have her hate me in ten years if she ever hears this like giving up her business but like she's in a stage right now where she's very resentful of she expresses it well she'll say I hate this I hate that I have this I just want to be normal I just want to have a normal life and it fucking rips your heart out man but you can't you have to say hey hey you are normal this is your life your life is normal it's like Carly I'm a big Carling guy you know I know you're studied student of it but it's like he had his routine words like about being homemade or all-natural he's like everything's fucking all-natural right no matter what you do with it it's all fucking natural and that's kind of how I try to approach whether it's like you are normal this is your normal life you know you're not any better or worse or you know mean you have to desert there's fights people fight that you don't even see Leila you know I mean that you don't understand yours is obvious yours is right here in front of you to fight some people are gonna fight demons they'll never meet yeah there's just a phrase on that what is it comparison is the enemy of happiness thank you I'm gonna use that Joe thank you that's a no doubt like that I'm gonna look it up and I'm gonna don't work you find out find out whose quote that was comparison is the enemy of happiness I really like that that's a that's a very useful the inspiration sentence you should get inspiration from other people but comparison is not really healthy who is a state or Roosevelt some parison is the thief of joy oh you gar fect so somebody records it probably me I probably fucked it up but that's even better yeah goddamn Theodore Roosevelt you bad motherfucker he was a badass motherfucker motherfucker riding with a charging up the hill and San Juan all that shit man right comparison how about the first rose right Theodore the other one was well this is the guy that made the he set aside the National Park System he set aside like Theodore Roosevelt is the reason why we have the grandeur chart which our current guy is trying to run fucking damn it yeah mantel not the Grand Canyon I know

but it's heart-wrenching but you're but I can stand here like a man and like look here's I've been through it right you didn't want to see me and it's like you didn't it's like you don't want to see me cowering in the foxhole you know that now the battles over it's like yeah coward in the foxhole for a little while but then we got out we won the battle or what you know I mean that's that's where I wanted to be before I came hi and I didn't have anything I know I didn't need anything to promote but all of a sudden like I did this free project and I was like I really just put out my love my fans have found it but the response has been so good behind it it's like I want to get this out there a little further so it gave me an excuse to be like I think it's time for me to be on the podcast yet and if you want to buy a CD they still have the CDs no we don't you don't you can buy these maybe at our shows all right cuz if we bring them there and we've charged basically what they cost us to make them and ship them where we gotta take them and try reading that shit yeah you can't read it that's the book it's fuckin gangster calligraphy shout out sick sick sleeps shout out to Big Sleep so he was shoutout to big sleeps you win yeah there you go shoutout to big sleeves for the calligraphy um that's gangster stuff if you can't read it you weren't built to read it that's all it means I get it now that you've explained it I can read it and it's like just a picture like old school old English calligraphy and then mixed with gangster letters yeah and you can see I struggle with the AR and because it comes back up like it comes down and then ik bang bang that's his artistic that's art man I understand I mean let me explain this much made up a letter let me let me know and seems to me like a made-up letter that's some Gaelic shit this is Oh school data n is actually pretty old school English Old English you know what that is Jamie does Ellery get into you at the air looks cool that looks like an end to you where do you see the end the end here wait a minute that's not the R here's the end but where's the fucking whore head the R is this oh my god is ridiculous that's the R that's there's your loop oh yes okay it just comes down all right here's your P your P is the is the our without the arm down listen it all looks beautiful don't get me wrong first though I don't give out first of all if you can't read it that's why it's art all right okay and it's gangster shit I'm sure yeah okay if you go to Pico Union those guys will read that shit like it ain't it's easy oh yeah this is war porn oh that's fun hilarious but the point is I I was struggling to make my next singer-songwriter ish hip-hop kind of I was kind of revisiting the whitey Ford formula a little bit and expanding on it but I got kind of stuck halfway through because I was just after all of this stuff that I went through I thought it would be smart to decide yeah I kind of another thing about cystic fibrosis is really isolating because you get really protective of your child and other people who are sick I mean I remember but first I used to come and be like everybody's gonna be alright at the studio right nobody's sick I mean you know I trust you now I know it's like if you were sick you tell me um but you still I understand what you live that life and asking your friends every five seconds and so you the invitations to hang out become a little less it's not an intentional thing it's this slow kind of isolation of yourself my friends didn't do it to me I did it to myself right and I'm coming out of that now like I'm hanging out a lot my old friends and seeing things which is great but so like I was stuck in studi was just me and like an engineer kid who I had a guy that worked for me for many years who moved up north and then I had this new guy who uh who's good at his job but it was like there was no but you're kind of your own boss right so how do you decide when you're gonna go into the studio how to decide when you're gonna write just well because I don't know how you think about life because we don't live by the Paycheck rules you know what I mean we so I'm thinking six months out I know I'm good fry right now I could sit on my ass for a year before cash ran out right let alone other stuff so but I'm always thinking six months all right like if I creating something now that's gonna generate like you're writing your next stuff for whatever your next special is gonna be you know what do you get out one of those two of those a year like a solid hour I mean am i when I boil it down after two years it's like a real good hour in ten minutes I'm sorry so that's what I'm saying so you're thinking on kind of that time level you're like I'm working this out to get to this point that's what my schedule is now I'm you know anybody files my career whether it was house painter or ever lasts like I've never been less like some cats are like clockwork with their product they a year every year every year and a half there's an album bang boom boom right me I've had two year intervals three year intervals for your intervals one you never a one year interval never I'm never that guy I have to be inspired I have to but I know if I'm not creating something at some time the show money which is what I live off from now basically besides the mailbox stuff um gets smaller as long as long as you're if you can always just make you don't even have to have a hit at my stage of career you know I mean I'll need hits I just need new material where it's like I got something to promote that gives a promoter and you I do a lot of work in Europe I do more work in Europe than I do here doing really yeah yeah way more I'm Bob way six weeks in Europe why I got leave literally day after tomorrow um whoo that's a long first I go to nap actually I got a festival in Napa and then I come home for a day and then I go to Europe for six weeks nap is a Chum and I mean I do well in pockets in the United States and and there's a lot of places like the south I think I would do great but I've never gone as like promoters don't cut I don't know what it is I don't chase it here's the poem that no time I hope I'm not nervous I've never tasted this I've never ran it down I'm where I am because I just looked at the signs on the road and said oh go that way and I go there I'm not the guy who thinks I'm the worst social media I got 40,000 fuckin Instagram followers you know I've sold millions and millions records I don't put I don't try I don't want it I don't know what it is I I get extreme amounts of joy I think we talked about this on the first podcast I already did that my music is more famous than my face like that I think cuz I did say I like to go to rouse and get it to olive oil and just fucking get olives and nobody knows who the fuck I am and jump around actually playing in the supermarket or something you know right it's fucking hilarious to me I said that Steve Miller was like one of the greatest rock stars of all time cuz nobody knows what the fuck he looks like take the money and run this is so about be the two babassu fuck is that guy look like idea cuz I'm on smoker yeah so much older cowboy I'm a midnight talker yeah the Joker um jungle love I was another great Jam damn he had some great jams so I'm sitting in the studio by myself stuck um a friend of mine asked me to do a feature on his rap record which I really wasn't you know I mean I wasn't I don't do a lot of that anymore how long had it been since he had done it why made the first lococo nostra album I was leaves I was part of the whole album that was a few years back I was oh eight oh wait oh wait and I've done a rap here a rap there for a long time to go between that and war porn yeah yeah your new project war porn when did you guys start that what happened I'm getting to it is is that this cat asked me uh to alum shout him out do ryu um punishes routes on this show jamie muro record like like the fighter from street fighter you know I mean Ryu he has an album out um and I did a song in there some and it came out of made I was so and like in love with what I did like after all these he's like wow I busted a flag and really don't rhyme on that thing that him and I I was like yo we should do a little mixtape thing just to help promote this whatever whatever some happen he just couldn't be involved and then I would immediately thought of my friend and and and and and and and partner now it's got sick jacking from a group called psycho Rome Latin excellent names yeah sick Jagan and psyche he was gonna be he's gonna come next time he I got called him like today and I was like yo I totally spaced if you want to come do this there is the ball guy right there and then device Tyler did all the beats and he rhymes on the project but the way came by was like when dude couldn't do a diviner it he was making the beats a call sick Jack I was like yeah I got this project he came heard all the beats and and we literally made this record in like a week Wow and um a divine styler a short background I would not be in this business I would not be making music if it wasn't for that man he's the first guy to ever told me I could rap I used to want to be a graffiti artist he was an amazing graffiti artists and I was just following him around is like a 16 year old trying to learn like styles and shit and I would bus wraps because they were making music to like make fun of shit like your mom or this or that and they would always be like yo you could rap you should like make a tape when you just was a TDR ya does it get you high no not really I mean not not in the center me maybe a collect after a while you might feel a little different but like you wear mass and shit I'll do they wear masks well now they were real ones we used to just tie bandanas and okay because I would imagine if you're standing there like some of those are not really don't know if you were like in a room like this and tried to paint that whole wall right you know ventilation you probably would but this is mostly outdoor on the wall on the bus on in LA the scene was Mike down we had a yard every crude you'd have a yard somewhere like in an industrial area between buildings where there's like a brick wall and two buildings and you just bomb it we call your yard right yeah I mean your this crews yard or that crew yard and you don't sneak into other crews yards and you'd like bomb over their pieces that's not good right that's like it's a game almost cut except as little more so yes if they caught you for sure kick your ass and steal your pain oh no yeah you know David Cho is you know David that's I love David show man David's got these crazy fucking videos he's putting up on Instagram now it's for him throwing paint all over the place Laura yeah we're doing fumes he's high on paint fumes someone save him he's going crazy he's in like some industrial building just loved dude taking a trailer like running it around like he's so far out there there's no map no one's got what can happen don't leave a toll and I mean he's got a cart and he's just pouring paint on the ground which is a savage he's also super smart he's a great deal is it this is on purpose this is there's purpose to what he does man I believe that no David he's a sweet sweet guy like I really like him as a person I love he still does it I did his podcast I think I get his podcast because he heard me on yours and he was like comet please bring a guitar and you know he doesn't now banks um I take very serious pride in the fact I'm the first guy to ever do music on this thing I don't and I think is it honey honey the only guy other people didn't yeah Gary brought is Gary Clark jr. brought his guitar but never played man dude he's the best he's such a nice guy too man oh man such a we all got to his music man I'm really a big fan of that dude I'm a big fan of him as a person and as a musician and I went to see honey honey played in downtown LA they had like this midnight show on a Wednesday night and Gary Clark joined him on stage and Gary Clark jr. and honey honey god damn it was good and I was like you know 10 feet away and there was hundred people in the room it was Gary Clark jr. just jammin with honey honey it was he's one of the baddest motherfuckers on the guitar everything beautiful sound like he's got such a distinct oh here it is Jamie's got it I put it on my Instagram I think I remember this like you hear this you know it's him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is there a bass player or Micah tops and Micah's not singing anymore well the bass player is that dude in front of us that's Ben he's just play another everything retard he played another guitar oh yeah that's a guitar it's not a big pickup a bass oh well somebody's putting down some nice low end he must sound Gary chewed somebody has a DQ is not it sounded good that's all I was making a point oh yeah man god damn a bass player my keyboard player Brian who comes through here he's got the meanest fucking left hand on the keys like he plays all his keys with the right in the bass is left oh wow that's a mean we're a trio now like me and when I do my band stuff is just means to other guy drummer in him that's amazing and we sound like six guys it's crazy Gary Clark's got his own sound you know I'm saying like you hear his sound like Stevie Ray Vaughan is a perfect example of that like I hear some Stevie Ray Vaughan and I'll hear like 1 or 2 bars and I go that's Stevie Ray Vaughan he's got that sound you know his is like a certain given side yeah yes yes yes yeah and it's played on a album of mine on a couple of songs love born the ghost whitey Ford and he came in with this little crate amp head witch crate is not a fancy company it's like a cheaper banging not cheaper I won't call insult him but like it was like super hot it was like some regular fucking head and this one pedal and live sound I was like how the fuck did you get and it's just something up some guys have a magic man so you guys have a magic about the sound me i play acoustic that's what I'm best at I know how to make that sound good there's I have electric guitars but I can never get my I could have that same fucking guitar as Gary Clark jr. right there and the same equipment and set it the same way and it probably won't sound the same yeah it's out in the neighborhood but I'm saying there's something there's some people who just got a inherent magic about feel on an instrument you know what I mean it's pretty amazing about someone who can play an instrument like that is that that they're making some sound that it syncs up with our brain so well it syncs up with our hearing so well that it just gives you pleasure you know and by the way folks that's with an iPhone can't microphone and camera I mean that is a terrible recording device as far as like getting good audio quality so when you dare you're getting really fucking good there's more computing power on there than there was it when they suppose one sample to the moon you know mean to the moon Alice supposedly do you think they sent people on the moon you know what that's one of the things how do you know the fucking truth but I'll tell you one fucking thing for sure the earth is not flat fuck you see that's where it gets tricky right how do we know look at the scientist could always look at would look at the moon that's brown but wouldn't be interesting if so what is the only one that wasn't and that was the ark that was why everybody was trying to hey I'm just trying to go okay alright sasquatch cool winner cool they make some fun arguments but the moon landings might've a day next a big moon landing suspect to me let me say that there's a lot of things I see on TV they're suspect hey I saw a movie maybe 15 years ago called wag the dog that fucked everything up for me like then when I see the news I want I see wag the dog all day long that was a great movie yeah and then do you member when the CIA they came out the CIA paid a half a million dollars to make the fucking Isis videos what was it how much how much was it was a half a million dollars five hundred thousand dollars yeah to make might have been more than that I might am I like way selling it short was like five hundred million dollars no I think it was a half how much was it I think was half a million to make videos but still like to make homemade looking video it was like half a million dollars that's a lot of money I think it was more than that five hundred and forty maybe was 5 min 5 hundred forty million billion half Oh billion okay okay thank you yeah I was when I said five hundred thousand I was like no that sounds cheap half a billion yeah and so what they first of all stop to think about how many x-men movies you can make for half a billion I mean what kind of a shit return on your investment our firm fake al-qaeda videos know what that is know what that is right there that's two motherfuckers the guy who owns that firm is the buddy of somebody yeah that's that's the thing I was talking about earlier where they figure out how to get the fucking money anyways that's it that's it that attention I'm talking about that is about a clears examples you can get where it's 500 meters back one member that was 20 years ago when they came up the whole thing were like a Pentagon was paying like thousand dollar a hammer you're like your toilet seats were like seven grand you know was like I remember that five hundred forty million dollars is a crazy number too that's like a wait what the fuck Jesus Louis a lot of money man Oh world war is war porn so like I said Devine was he's my mentor he's like back in the day before it used to be if somebody was like if you were the son of somebody that was like your mentor like now it's kind of almost like they treated like an insult if I was Divine's I'm the son of Dumont's Tyler in this game that's how I look at it I learned style from him I learned how to rap from him he encouraged me to do it at first and then I went on my own journey so coming back to do this project with him was funny this was strictly just in my mind an art project like literally we're gonna give this away we're gonna we're just going to make a few CDs and make some fun art to surround it and you know that it'll call it a day and then it came out amazing and I'm not selling myself short the shit is fucking banging hip-hop and it's free and you can get a little industries dot-com and click on the mixtape and download it it's free well I've been enjoying the videos man it looks like it's got a video while you're gonna play a bit less like yourself are good time - it's the been the most fun I've had in forever it's the point like what like I said I was I was stuck in this rut and then these guys came into my studio and brought it alive again and I realized it's communal yeah what I do try even even even when I'm trying to just express my own thought and idea you got its communal you need some people around you that are gonna you need I'm sure guys like Joey Diaz or this for you oh yeah when you have an idea for a routine or a chill joke at ub what do you think should I pursue that there's a guy that you'll turn to and he'll be like fuck yeah that's the move or fuck no don't do that it's better when there's a lot of you you feed off each other you have fun and you you also like it's very important to be happy for other people like you like seeing other people kick ass should make you feel better like and being around bad motherfuckers like this in the studio in the three of us or by whether the official name of the group is war porn industry's more porn is the first record war porn what does that because it's fucking cuz exactly what does it mean because exactly because everything's war porn turn on your TV it's war point I'm reading this script I'm even more confused this script no it's the same thing we just separated it and made a narcotic it's too confusing I well good the logo is badass

with me to the end you should come with me to the me to thee yeah man we've had a blast man we're gonna make many more records like I'm back in the rap game now dog fur it's cool in here and you rap again more science fun I really enjoyed your transition into like more acoustic stuff I'm still doing that too yeah this is this is fun like this is unadulterated for me like you were talking about you need cats to push you our goal in the studio is like when sick jack comes off the mic from saint averse he wants me to look at him and be like fuck you see I gotta go fuck your lyrics are every ending sharp both those dudes that they're that are on either side of me in this are retarded with it man you if you really sit back and analyze device Tyler like speaks in tongues man I don't know that dudes on some super scientific and sick jack is on some street level hood shit but the way he puts it together is so crazy it's almost like we're a representation of like almost like physical like a mental and spiritual like mine's more mental like you guys like see no hear evil hear no almost it was a weird art together and when we get together the shoot all three of us will tell you it's the energy that we create with each other yeah we don't find it anywhere else we were addicted to this right now we that's why I'm telling you it's gonna be way more we're already working on the next one so I think that can't be overlooked man because I think that there's a you get a lot of the people that you're around all the time and I think you're a different person when you're around different people I'm sure I'm sure you experienced that right absolutely and I think that being around a bunch of bad motherfuckers on a regular basis like you are in war porn like everything is probably like everybody's sharpening everybody's now everybody's also aware of the full body of work you're all real hip-hop fans so you aware of like nas is best shit oh yeah and jay-z's best shit and the bar gets so high and so sharp the edge gets sharp so like that riff right there this that's like one of my all-time favorites that I've heard in the last couple of years I feel like like in my opinion you know and I come from a certain era I give that to people you know there's a new era of kids and I don't shit on them or hate them they have this whole thing hating on these kids calling it mumble rap and I don't I don't really got a problem with it you know I mean uh my only problem is like hey there are certain cats that are kind of disrespecting the past and it's like hey B you be new be different that's cool be what you want to be but don't fucking shit on cats like biggie and I'm not gonna call out names and I was right but anybody who's listened to me and is really hip to the game knows there's these youngsters that are kind of almost trying to they're almost trying to make noise by disrespecting and it's like listen the path that was walked before you is the only reason you could fucking wear that fucking cheesy fucking shit jewelry you get and fucking AK so ignorant you know meaning go to the met ball and gala knows when you ain't nobody and next year you're not going to be anybody than met bat Met Gala you know I mean you're just this year's fucking like not a novelty I don't know your business but I know someone in the music game in yellow they music a shit on the older dudes have been around there's a lot of youngsters that are like don't know the history and I don't say you need to know Biggie's every album but don't fucking come out shit on big you can't show come on shit on POC but it'll come on act like they didn't exist or you don't know anything about them that's unfortunate and when and they're few and far between but they've made big headlines and that's why this there seems to be this disrespectful hate for the young right I don't got that cuz listen I always said like I just don't ever want to sound like that old fucking bitter dude I'll tell you I don't like that I'm not a fan of that song or that guy but go do with you I might be old maybe I don't get what you're doing you know I as I've gotten older I give less of a fuck about what other people enjoy and when I was younger I had for some reason I felt like I had to argue what I enjoy versus what you enjoy and that doesn't make any sense anymore it's like we're all so fucking different the idea like Immie people and personalities vary so much today another we're all gonna like to slip shit let me qualify what I was just talking about actually cuz really what I was talking about wasn't young people if you want to be if I want to be perfectly clear what I what I was talking about was people my age that I hear throwing a lot of hate and a lot of dislike they just like all that ain't rapper that hip-hop brain maybe not to you but you really just sound old and bitter I mean let them kids get theirs you know I mean I made the record I wanted to make I didn't try to make a record that designer or future or any of these cats that are doing it now would make because that would look stupid I would look like a thirsty idiot bar because that's not what I do that is what they do to sort of shit on it is shitting on them and I don't know them I don't know anything and honestly I've heard future records and have her designer records and they're not the worst things I've ever heard I'm just not a fan I just don't that's not my thing it's not garbage and I don't like when I hear people just call and shit out for garbage that isn't garbage if it's garbage call it garbage like mr. brainwash or something like that that's garbage yeah I mean you know you know who I'm I don't know any of these people but I do know what you're talking about you know here's a beautiful O'Shea that was that was that was that wasn't even cool but it's not at all no I'll tell you nothing I don't know what the fuck's going on the rap world but what I do know wasn't even on my rap he knows you know these tell me were you talking about he's an artist he's a chancer like fake fucking street artists you'd like stole everything he ever did was anybody sue the bank's the bank's evil Banksy yeah they're busy that fucking like faked it till he made it like that that's who I'm talking about okay he's garbage dude like that's garbage I understand that's garbage yeah I'd like to be offended is there somebody in car you know what for you it's the equivalent of like Carlos Mencia yes mr. brainwash okay okay exact that's a perfectly legitimate correlation is that the ringworm correlation oral it correlate yeah thank you I said Coley I know what you're saying I know I know you're saying I'm talking how many I'm two glasses deep into whiskey Jack Daniels single barrel rye the real shit you owe me a case now Jackie masculine Tennessee send that shit right to the crib all right this is where we got this drink is there I see the commercial y'all can't drink it they're send an extra case this way to the Joe Rogan experience it's an amazing that we were like interested in stuff that like sits and barrels that have been fire brewed like they they take fire they burn the inside of the barrels right and now part of process of making this stuff a lot of the new shit - is the darker versions is like some people you actually get the the whiskey that's soaked into the wood and somehow get that out that's where you get these dark versions of like what Jameson castmates and other stuff like that and then there's a movin there's a new movement I don't know how new it is I'm talking out of my ass a little bit because I've had a few but were they liked by Old Ale like Guinness or like beer ones and then put whiskey and those and like yeah there's like cut like where they kind of cross chases they're crazy these kids today they're cooing I just love the fact that that's how you make this like I'm not I'm not selling this but like when you talk about like like a whiskey taste I'm a James guy but this is nice this is nice look it's it's an acquired experience sick Jackson's Gentleman Jack guy he loves the gentleman Jack so I'm here kool-aid tastes good this is an exotic mouth experience okay it's like there's something going on have you gone to a tasting like a scotch tasting or something like that because I'm glorianne who has other things to do go skills tasting to fight it all tastes like fucking turpentine like some of it tastes okay it's not kool-aid right it's not Gatorade I only like a couple there's a lot of them I don't like I don't like to admit it but I like a cold coke one I know one of those Coke Zero so it is cut I call it coke one I know it's not sometimes that is what I want that tastes good if that could get you drunk oh here's a funny story so my wife gives me a present the other day it's like this keychain with this elongated like metal tube looking thing on it and I open it up and it's just empty and she's like I just thought you know if you smoked a joint you could put it in it wouldn't stink up your car and it was a smart idea and trust me but I'm looking at it I'm looking at it and I'm like babe um I think this is a coke vial actually I think that's really the intention for this she was like you know it's funny cuz they were smaller once - I thought that's really small I wonder where that could be for now - leave exist so I got this bullet looking I put joints in it but it's like it's a coke vial dude you imagine what would happen if they made coke legal like a long time ago like how much would how much would culture change if Coke was like beer if you you could drink yourself to death we all know someone who's drank themselves to death like our obesity problem would probably be kick business jaw right either wait I wanted to be you know I might be closer to the weight I really truly want to be I have a theory and my theory is that much like how will you take sugar out of things and then just have like processed sugar and you eat it's terrible for your body because it doesn't have all the natural fibers it's very dangerous like you're like you get fat it's not dangerous I'm not saying it's like nuclear power but my theory is that I bet those coca leaves are exactly the same way I bet if you just chew those coca leaves like those people do up in the mountains I think it's great for you I think it's just like eating fruit is really good for you right now if you have a bowl of fresh blueberries that's not just because it had some sugar in it that's really good for you rich in antioxidants rich in vitamins strawberries delicious good for you not bad for you good for you but like spoons of sugar inarguably not good for you right I mean not the worst process though there you know what you're talking about right there is something process versus something that's natural yags is exactly the same thing you know I would actually buy with all my heart issues I got a heart valve if you sat two plates on the plate of coke and you said you had to do with these here's some coca leaves I'd go fuck I'm sure those coca leaves are blind I want to experience Friday I want to know what that's like because they things I miss about or like cats that work in those because that's mountainous area they like chew on them all day and work and do shins like this like coffee to them in a way way you know maybe a little you know a I don't think it's stronger than coffee man I don't think it is I think from everybody that describes it they describe it is like just a mild stimulant and it makes you feel good and it also has like what do they call flavonoids are also chewing on it it's giving yourself saliva is dissolving you're processing it through a digestive system instead of just banging it straight to your brain nope our powder form you know nummy I think it's probably I'm speaking way out of line here I don't know how many locally science does it take to make a line that's another thing you don't know like now I might be 400 coca leaf right like how many strawberries does it take to make a cut tablespoon of sugar exactly that's a good that's a good analogy interesting there's whiskey's really nice really good goddamn this California marijuana is also for effective yeah I can't complain when you can complain but there's a deal and we sparked up again there's there's the whole thing right there of this whole new hey I've smoked my fair share of some dabs and whatnot here but like now we're talking about let's see if we're gonna keep it a hundred percent honest we've always kind of sat around smoke joints and be like yeah we don't really do drugs you know what dabs are you do dabs you do drugs that's a drug that's weed being processed into an actual more potent more compact form form to smoke it's it's drugs it's the meth of weed dabs like friends tattoos feel like you went too far fucker which is slow down settle down okay dude don't don't turn your nails had my fair share dabs and I would partake under the right circumstances boom-bap I'll have a little dab but what I'm saying is ice too much not interested good movie here I'm okay I'm you're smoking pens though you're smoking pens though as labs I actually don't smoke too many different ones but I have something organic like it's still adapt no it's oil its oil same fuck steel and say you guys are smoking wax and yes a different people who are interested in soldering irons and fucking verily I'm more into I'm personally a little bit more into what they call the solvent list like ice hash and shit like that a little bit different I mean BHO scares me a little bit sometimes I think and it's a trigger that hits me when someone says you want to dabs like oh no no no because you're one of those people that does dabs like I'm not oh no no no no no no no you're the dude who calls in sick to the country club because you're too fucking high to drive alright no no we're not doing dabs together man get your shit together you'll have to get that on come by the studio that's okay you're doing a damn now thanks come by my studio it's like what make you do at least one mattress the lasas of wine or do you want to drink glasses of whiskey well you can drink glasses of wine and enjoy if you drink glasses of whiskey you'll be fucking dead okay that's like dabs you went too far into the dark land son you want a shiner you how much weed you smoked the orcs you're you're wrong about that some people you're right about it you're right about like the average Joe cat like that doesn't know much what if you wanted address you know how much we you smoke I don't get that fucked up from a DAB cuz you know I have smoked a lot of weed for 20 fucking years interesting yeah I mean but what it will do if you smoke what I don't want to do about that shit from what I understand is why I don't do a ton of it is because it'll you'll stop getting high from actual weed if you do too much of that shave me that'll be good maybe that's what's the best way to be is get high so often that you can be high and not even feel like you're high like maybe that's the best place to be if you need to get high though I want to know that Omaha it's my site no no it's like letting go I don't want to like get well now you're talking about being a junkie smoking some weed and not know you're high but be high that's called getting well you're sick plant man it's a plan man I don't get a buzz right smoke taxes man there's no point to me smoking if I'm not getting a buzz I'm saying man I'm what I'm saying is achieve a perpetual vibration of what's called elevation let's could not call being high to achieve a perpetual state where it's so common and normal that you don't even feel like you're high how do we live isn't that how we live pretty close pretty fucking close I take days off though you take days absolutely I mean honestly more than I like since in the last seven years way more than I used to because my kids I want to pay before my kid I was perpetually high like I was high from the moment I woke up to the moment with sleep and I don't even look at that as a bad thing or like I said we yeah I was perpetually high I know a lot of people that are very productive and very smart who also do that now they enjoy the wife and I at the end of a long day will go out in the backyard and because we don't smoke anywhere near the kids because of cystic fibrosis nah but like we will just like that and you know what fuck anybody doesn't like it but I know let's leader and said are alcoholics and shit you know it's legal now he's no compress from a day of doing fucking nebulizer treatments and fucking IV and yeah shit yo it works for us and it's cool but if I wasn't any as smoking only to get even I wouldn't even do it anymore like if I didn't get a buzz you know it's a happy thing I'm not saying get even I'm saying stay elevated state but God but know you're elevated the entire you know just like you know you're breathing oxygen but do you pay attention to it on a regular basis well then just Excel see I like knowing I like to know that I like the conscious actual like oh I'm in a relieve state of pain right now listen you're right I'm just I'm essentially are maybe a and I'm not mad those cookies or anything but maybe cuz I live in a slightly elevated level of stress than the average person I know the difference I want to feel that cushion it's like the pillow on the bed for mine I want to feel the pillow I don't want to just accept it's there I don't want to go Buddhist like that and watch the dishes just to wash the dishes or I want to get high to get the fuck out of here for fucking five minutes you know what I find that's one of the most beneficial things about being high is that I'm only thinking about a few things but I'm thinking about them very intensely simply and very intently instead of thinking about a whole host of things peripherally where it's almost like there's too much data coming in from all these other things that I don't really care about or need look you care about all sorts of things in your life that you're not going to deal with right now and take to harbor even a chunk of that in your consciousness is it robs the rest of your resources for thinking about other things and that's one of the most apparent things about pot to me because like when I here's a perfect example when I smoked pot and then I play pool I am 20% better like a legitimate 20% better and I really think that it's because I'm not thinking about oh I got to do this and then I got a call that guy and then this guy I got to respond to Sue's text I got to respond to that person's email when I get high I just see balls I see balls and green cloth and you take that one step further is you're also not even thinking about I got a beat this fucking guy you're thinking about your job douche bag no no but you want to make the shot it's more about the shot though I want to make a shot I want to fucking win this game because I want to make the shot I want to do yes see the angle this is end to it for there's a thing that happens with pool that happens the same way in archery and then in archery like when you hit a target there's an it's so foolish like of course it's just a hay bale with a target on it with a little paper target that is a yellow Center and you hit the yellow center whoop-dee-doo nothing changed in the world I understand that like rationally as my difference my heart if I did that though I'd be like oh but the thing about doing that is that I don't know why but when you do something correctly when it all flows in harmony just like with pool it's the same thing when you have a long shot and it goes in if you've ever been at a bar when you watch people play pool and some dude makes or some woman makes the craziest shot ever for the win and everybody goes crazy oh shit because we know how hard it is to do and there's something poetic and beautiful about watching it happen it's that that you just described why golf makes any sense at all mmm I live on a golf course basically I like to hit the balls and fucking I suck but what keeps you coming back is you'll play that 18 hole day and one time you feel you'll hit the shot that you're meant to hit the way you're meant to hit it and it went where you're meant to go and you're like I can do that again I know I can't so I don't Ferguson it's like crack you're chasing that first fucking high forever I'm not disrespecting anybody who plays golf because I know I would get addicted but I don't play golf I know I get because you would know your your hole personally would cuz you'd hit that one shot the first day and you'd be like oh shit it's the same reason I don't do coke the same reason I've never done coke the exact same reason my friend in high school Jimmy lawless good buddy of mine to this day we were back in high school we went to a party and people were doing coke and you know Joe don't do it you'd fucking love it it's like Dewey Cox the movie you don't want this like okay Jim I trust your buddy like I'm fucking done here I'm done with this and I've said this before but this is a real thing that happened where it was on two-lane road and we were driving side this car that had the dome light on and I looked over and there was his chick and I never forget her arms she these big arms like shit like almost like like like she had a sleeveless shirt with like thick arms like it was the kind of girl that would punch you in the face okay that she was doing coke in the backseat and she looked over at me with the dome light on it she just goes fuck you she says it's maybe like I'm just looking at her I've just looking at her you're doing coke you're on the you're on a two-lane road there's only two cars on the road I'm watching you do coke I'm seven feet away from you doing coke you're saying fuck you like whoa fuck coke that's what I was thinking here we used to call it in I had a few experiences with coke in my life but here's the breakdown a coke and why it's evil we used to call it amongst a few people that I actually trusted enough to partake of it in my life we called it the sneaky pouch sneaky pot because what would happen is like you get some coke and it'd be like in a fold you know like a paper fold everybody would put in for some coke and ever you'd go somewhere and every once in a while you need a hey let me get the possum go to bathroom real quick you should shoot whatever right when you went to that bathroom the nature of coke you would take a little piece of that off of yourself and put it in your own little dollar bill yes you're sneaky about sneaky pal skanky pouch but what it says about and everybody did it the whole crew like nobody make cop to it nobody fucking acknowledge it but it's like we all know we took a little piece for ourselves you know I mean off of the coke vial and whatever with a sneaky pouch it's this is it's a deceitful are you writing this down Arion um so it's like kind of just describes the nature of what that what mine state that puts you in it's like well fuck everybody else if this goes if everybody sniffs who's sniffing you know it's just like that's what that drug creates and that's why you know the I think three times in my life I've done it well any drug that radically changes your brain chemistry whether it's whisky or whether it's coke or you know honestly even pot especially pertaining to edibles we should watch it very carefully what happens and people take it you know and I think it's one of the things that I've been guilty of and I know a lot of other people have been guilty of it too just totally come clean I defend pot so much that I never look at the potential negative consequences of people doing pot if they're too young because I didn't do it when I was down I mean did a few times maybe like a handful of times before I was 30 and then when I was 30 I met Eddie Bravo we started getting blazed all the time and really changed the entire website of pot I smoke pot was 14 I definitely smoked it younger than that I smoked it when I was 8 my stepdad gave me some when I was 8 just a puff cuz I was curious I was like what when what happens when you do it is do you want to try it I said how much should I breathing he wasn't breeding in a lot just breathing a little bit this is obviously like sketchy memory I didn't once when I was 8 and then the next time I did I was probably like 14 and then I did it probably maybe again when I was standing about 14 when we cut school and some of the kids a couple of kids that were the cool guys that I you know kind of took a liking to me and I was like cool the cool kids like me I'll hang out with these dudes they smoke weed and I remember I hit it and vari they would tell me like if you're smoking there I'm nothing like happening the first time but I remember vividly hitting this joint with these dudes and literally spending probably an hour and 30 minutes laughing my balls off let nothing and I thought it was the greatest thing uh and from then on I was like I quit baseball no hair with popcorn well no I became an artist started drawing and painting on walls I was like I was a different person that changed my life weed is another thing is probably semi responsible for my path I had a variant for a moment when I was 16 I got only smoked weed a handful of times before I was 30 years old like less than 12 like legitimately and one time when I was 16 was me and my girlfriend and my best friend who went over her house and I had stole some weed from my stepdad and we'd rolled up a joint and we got so high we were teleporting we would like find ourselves in the kitchen after landing times I'll be stared at each other on the couch and then all sudden we'd be in the backyard we were barbecued we were fucking 16 I think my girlfriend at the time was 15 josh is my age he was he was 16 and we were just time traveling all over the fucking building it was we were way too high that's how I described the first and only time I ever smoked dust oh jesus you did that well I hung out with like when I was one of the neighborhood's I moved into how do you this is there a fucking gateway drug to dust and tell yes it's called cholos they go right from Diet Pepsi to done I don't know my god there's ears here's my story as I moved on to this street called Independence Avenue in in the valley it's like West Valley kind of DeSoto Sherman Way ish and it was heavily Latino neighborhood and like we moved in and it was cool I mean like I lived in friends with a lot of people but like I went from like the end of elementary school into junior high right in that era so like once we hit the junior high it's like a lot of the Mexican kids I was hanging out with started hanging out with you a little bit older Mexican kids and a lot of them were dealing in like kind of gang life over there it's just part of the way they get down and then so and a lot of them like to fucking do dips which is like a fucking Sherm cigarette dipped in a motherfuckin angel dawn angel dust sounds like a healthy choice dude's out it's how I wound up with this this little tattoo right here first tattoo I ever had in my life this little three dots normally is supposed to be up here but I wasn't in the gang oh and so it's like for some reason they was so fucked up this is what why don't we this is representing what they call my vida loca it's like little three dots here but it's like that happened because I smoke dust because I'm these dudes pass me the show I didn't really know what I was I was like this bang and the literally the way you just described that time travel and it was like I felt like if I thought of something to do by the time I was finished with the thought of thinking to do it I had already done it I'm gonna call my mom goodbye mom you guys I get that kind of great like it was like fucking nuts I've fucking never experienced anything like I was terrified I was terrified terrified I didn't know what the fuck's going on it was almost like you know what man gave me feel a lot of feelings is if you remember the first Friday movie when Chris Tucker reflects on like somebody snuck him a little piece of dust any fucking line it's I didn't lose my mind naked all that shit but I feel like I was the butt of a joke that night like like somebody gave me some dust it was like less flash blocking the white boy fucking trip on dust on she's nice but it made for a good story on Joe Rogan so now I'm worried that I had an ex boxing coach uh who had his finger bitten off when he was on dust and he had his toe removed and his second toe replaced his index finger and he made it curled so that he could keep throwing right hooks because he did so when you'd shake his hand you'd shake his hand you'd get like such weird he just told oh yeah you get a toe bone so when you shake his hand you get a little of this and he's a big old Irish gorilla you don't want to say shit cuz you'll beat the fucking me and the do doesn't our biggest biggest kid I should be written into a movie now I haven't got that you know that's like something out of snatch I do a lot of savages when I worked in Boston when I worked in South Boston I worked at this place called the Boston Athletic Club that's a little bit you know that you did that to my palm that's like hey man yeah dude I worked at the Boston Athletic Club and then I worked at Nautilus Plus in Revere I medal Revere Massachusetts is like well what's that place in Brooklyn that's like all guineas and it's what is offense and resin right yeah that was like the Bensonhurst of Boston was like Revere and I worked in a gym there so I was around a lot of crazy people I was around a lot of people that I was around a few people that I that got like indicted for murder this one dude it didn't get indicted he got arrested I don't know if they ever even tried him anyway long story short that's where you're leaving that I don't even mean I don't say I don't know how much I can talk about this guy's life oh right now II don't wanna cross any lines all right he was a nice guy but I think you might have fucked a few people up well there's nothing weirder to me not even weird I don't know if that's the right word but strange and uncomfortable as being around and I'm not talking about like ex-marines or guys have been in the war or anything like I'm talking about but like a civilian person and I've been around quite a few of these kind of people whether it be biker gang guys or whatever that you know yeah you know you know have fucking guilty you know you know that you mean and they're you're not feeling threatened by them you don't think they're gonna kill you everybody like you know it's there's a you know I used to train a guy who's in whitey Bulger's gang it was I you know he was like I don't know if he was a hit man but that was like the rumor that we saw what at least but he asked me was teaching him he asked me if I was gonna kill someone what was the best place to hit him and we sat around talking about it me and him we're talking about this when I was a black belt he was a wipeout so was it was like a valid conversation for him to be having with a 20 year old kid and I was like the neck I got I would hit someone in the neck like a you're next very vulnerable and people get knocked out very easily if they get hit in the neck sometimes even more so than the head names like yeah and we looked at each other I'm like okay this is what I want you to work on right now we're gonna work like that's funny because I had a cousin is when I was young like before like anyhow like probably nineteen eighteen that I was in California visiting and and he was a correctional officer in upstate New York and he said the thing they were taught first is because all they walk around there's only like maybe 30 guards at a time on Judy and what six hundred to a thousand prisoners right depending on what the circumstances are and all they have is a big metal keyring and they're taught the first thing you fuckin do is punch a dude right in his fucking throat yeah if you feel like you're any kind of thing that's the and he told me that like that he was like if I was going to give you any advice and you felt like you were fucking it's like the first thing you do and I and he explained it well enough that I noon as even as a young man like you're playing with a person's life punching them in the fucking Adam's apple or something you know you would kill them with my soul like he was that you would with that we even just put your fist if you hit him right you would be amazed you're amazing how much damage people could take actually I'd rather get punched in the Adam's apple then I would get kicked in the side of my head like around here because this is what shuts you off it seems like again many things can shut you off just with the caveat like you can get shut off with a kick even almost like to the top of your chest it snaps your head back so much you get shut off but there's something about neck kicks like button do just go they just crumple do and sometimes they crumple from chin shots but I think it's the same thing I think what the chin shot is doing is somehow another pinching the garden hose that is the spine and shutting the system off it's also if I'm not mistaken your viewing your brain sits in that little bit of fluid and if so your skull moves I've asked enough the brain doesn't move as fast and it touches the once brain touches the skull that's lights-out that's that absolutely - also I think the same principle like rear naked choke and head kick knockouts are not the same in that a rear naked choke is way safer like if you get choked unconscious you're going to be fine if you get head kicked unconscious you got to take some time off or you get just got fucked up but the mechanism behind them is kind of similar in that it's cutting off the circuitry not like specifically because the choke is like stopping the blood but the head kick is just jolting like it's like rebooting your computer head kick I would imagine I've never experienced it nor can I throw one that high but I would imagine why it might be worse is because I got you get punch and it's the motion of the head almost and the brain not moving that is causing the knockout if you get kicked like this it's a shin it's your head doesn't get to move so the brain is actually getting slammed against the other side of the fucking skull I've made this point really recently and even yesterday I think people should have no gloves on when they fight I think fighting with gloves is it makes it easier to punch people which is more uh more unrealistic and getting kicked in the head is way worse than getting punched in the head it's like that argument for Olympic headgear that's why it's going away causes more problems it's actually worth at this point I also think it's unrealistic in terms of like the limitations of your body like there's limitations of your body with punching people and that's that your wrists Bend like anybody's ever punched someone or with you can don't tape or Jenelle raw no no I are that's yeah raw because taped is really what the problem is when you tape this wrist like so well that I can't really fuck it up I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it with abandon well also it's like no abandon you right you can if you can tape here's no offended with no abandon I don't think there's anything wrong with two people agreeing with like a rule set like they agree okay we're going to wear gloves and we're going to wear keep pants like things along those lines but like if you can wear gloves gloves for a striker are the equivalent of ghee pants for a really good jujitsu guard player like if I guy like Eddie Bravo is allowed to wear G pants and he gets you wrapped up if you're like some regular dude you're going to sleep you're going to get fucked up you know unless you're like somehow even like oiler grace he fucks up when he's wearing the ghee pants because he knows that those gay pants provide insane amounts of friction and traction and can clamp a hold of you and he could do some shit to you that you're just going to be super uncomfortable with in a way that's as much of an advantage for him to be able to wear the guy pants as it would be for a striker to wear the gloves but only a striker gets to wear the gloves like the grapplers have to wear shorts like it's really kind of interesting because having your your knuckles taped up and having your knuckles patted up is a real advantage for someone who knows how to hit things because you can you could be like much more relaxed and liberal with your use of punches you don't have to worry about hitting bones but you would never allow that the other way like giving like giving the option of a striker to where our hand pads and then a grappler to wear gear pants it's really it's like we have a very accepted idea of what's civilised one you cover your knuckles it's kind of stupid because you don't have to cover your elbows the people are smashing and slashing people up with their elbows my case against it is that it's not logical it's just historical we're just we're just going by a tradition it's not a logical tradition may still queen's america marksberry kona it is a command up but it's because these are these are limitations that we inherited from a single discipline sites also like that easing back back not not that long ago a seventy five round fight isn't wasn't unheard of yeah they didn't have no CTE there was no Will Smith movie there was no no one knew what the fuck was going on there's no real sports with Bryant Gumbel no nobody had any idea that getting the hit in the head for that long would be that bad for you crazy yeah it's it's kind of fascinating when you think about it but I really do think to the gloves I think we're doing a huge disservice to the art of fighting because I think we have unrealistic expectations based on the idea that you could just punch someone with padded knuckles I think if we didn't have padded knuckles we'd be much more clever and how we use our hands because you might break your hand in any shot and it would be easier to choke people so jiu-jitsu be more effective two of those things are way better for the athletes and way better for the the honest interpretation of what fighting is the problem is no one's going to agree to that because people got it from home they're going to look at it and go oh this is barbaric this is horrible they don't even have gloves on their bare knuckle or the first time a guy catches the tooth and it's fast and it's and it splits open they're gonna catch in your elbow we exactly it fits on your chin or our attention to the choir yeah me but what's the difference between you catching one in your knuckle or catching one on the end of your foot when you kick someone's face sideways you can wheel kick them in the head with your heel but you can't punch them with bare knuckles it's stupid it's a dumb rule the whole 6 to 12 thing that's super to doesn't work but I'll leave that I'll leave that and take no gloves any day I really think there should be no gloves I think even for strikers I think yeah man you pad some dudes up you fucking give a dude like talk about gloves just like protecting your legs in but no tape what if that would you protect your knuckles and skin why what are we looking at we're looking at why have we don't get away although first let me devil's advocate on that okay we're looking at exchange of bodily fluids if I punch you in the teeth you know I mean no silly you're getting that from everything you're getting that from arms we choke people please Lily like people get bitten when they've been choked when you choke like a Rick's like you watch Demian Maia versus Rick story he's going like right over his face and you don't think he's getting a little bit of bite you get bites in your arms you don't even there maybe trying to bite you they're trying to breathe and you're crush okay Barney do you see his arm come away bleeding or something I'm saying like where's the rare occasion of like though but not but far less rare would be if there was no gloves and you're punching a guy in a malakut you're gonna catch them teeth you give me a lot more cutting of the hands - I'm just playing devil's app you don't want too good devil's advocate here the solution double mouth guard you enforce the rule of a double mouth guard which means there's a space and another version - like old yeah it goes all of it no no no no it goes lower teeth and upper teeth and then you have a space in the middle Bernard Hopkins always used to fight with one of those and it covers your lower teeth and your upper teeth and there's a space in the middle and you breathe through that and you breathe through your nose and you get used to doing that and the lower mouth guard the problem with having only an upper mouth guard is most people do that but only an upper mouth guard will work for the most part but there is if you're bare-knuckle there's there's a real argument for using an upper and a lower because you're dealing with other fights Joe well even then you just have it fitted to your face I'm just definitely I understand what you're saying what I'm saying is Bernard Oh Bernard Hopkins my favorite fighter of all time personally I know ever ever my favorite he's my favorite you wonder why about I'll tell you why he's my favorite I'll tell you why in the fair first of all I saw his last fight I was there in the forum and it was it was a bummer to me and I'm you're better than that I'm your fucking career will be forever because here's when I knew Bernard Hopkins was the fucking man all right he was I be real I've always been surrounded by Latin guys alright that's just all the dudes I know or Mexican Cuban these kind of guys you know be real is one of my best friends on earth sick jacket that's another you know these are all that induce we're all Spanish guys Mexicans and whatnot so anytime a fight like that would come up you know they're all taken the Felix Trinidad or the whoever was of course when he was fighting Felix Trinidad we were all watching at B rails house when this motherfucker took the Puerto Rican flag he was in Puerto Rico talking shit on Felix Trinidad at the time the fucking almighty fucking son of all Puerto Rico yeah took the Puerto Rican flag which if you know about Puerto Rican guys and I know plenty of Puerto Rican guys you put that flag on anything they got so much pride they did they're by it they'll wear it they're the flag is everything they get crazy he took this flag in Puerto Rico threw it on the ground and stepped on it Jesus why go back here I'm sure it's on YouTube where he steps on the Puerto Rican for employment remember I literally told my friends if he gets off that Island nobody on earth beating his ass I was like because they should be trying to fucking kill him right now if I know anything about Puerto Rican people yeah me and when he got like when the fight came that day I bet everybody in be real used to throw like barbecues every fight like it would be that's we be that would knows our routine because and there was only any time it was like a black guy versus like a Spanish Spanish guy it could be any kind of Spanish guy I would always like bet against the house and more times than not I want but like yo he stomps on the goddamn flag and got out of that island we threw it took it away from field yeah on the ground then he beat his ass yeah I feel like he killed him in the ninth round am I feel like he killed him right there well he definitely landed a sex party Kayode him right there cuz it's like if you didn't get stabbed before you got off the island of Puerto Rico that's a win he put a lot of pressure on himself though that's how I that's why I always knew I was like the executioner is my man I'm just but just for the ball factor of that that's a big ball factor hey I mean if you would have pulled that New York I would have said you're fucking crazy in Puerto Rico yeah Jesus man that took huge nuts that took the dude who was in jail for most of his life and was living off commissary donations it was a brilliant informants to in that fight he kicked ass yo Bernard and told you it on the last he beat the shit out of Philly like five six fights of his he beat the shit out everybody well you got to realize he's like 51 we is incredible when this fighter I want to say he was 34 35 yeah well he was old when I didn't go with her because yak spent so much time in jail oh my god what a beautiful counterpunch but you know that she was always about as he live like a monk Young is always in training he never fucking party never any smoke no processed foods that's the big thing he was saying he eats very healthy and clean he was one of the early davic 'its of the raw diet yeah thing I know he also was a brilliant boxer I just loved executioner came out with the mask Judy you gotta realize this guy got passed he got passed 12 rounds at Sergey Kovalev without getting knocked out and he got rocked and dinged several times in that fight he fought Kovalev in his prime Kovalev who my opinion is top three or four pound for pound in the world minutes argue that one right now Nomura or if I do he won that first very well could have I feel like I'm buddy double opinion I thought it my humble opinion I agree with you I would have to like go over it with a real legitimate judge and and like I don't I mean I know what I think about boxers a nice last ounce Crawford fight we plan on that Cuban or whatever New Year's yeah what the fucking tennis crawling he's he's in the argument for number one pound for pound the world is I feel like Ito got beat right controversial fight but closer yeah I know those decision see the fight but I heard it was some people disagreed with it but my what I feel is that like Terence Crawford and lomachenko the guys who put it on people to the point where they just run away from it just set the fight right run away from it know if they just set the big fight the fucking triple telephoto Padilla's life I yeah yeah yeah what you think what you think it's a very important fight it's a very important fight because like you look at how good can L looked against who this is a sharpest junior man wonder why come on let's be real respect to pops respect to pops all the way think that guy gets young chatter junior was never ever ever ever anywhere he shouldn't have been in there the only thing he got really got is because his name is Chavez Jr and honestly you're 100% correct other than a few good he's had some good performances or sergio martinez once he got busted for that we should it seemed like after that it was downhill the kid just didn't care anymore he you know what I equated to the person I don't know the guy I'm not assuming I'm my take on it is these got tired of fucking trying to be the fucking his dad what a hundred and some and how many losses of just that was one of the greatest of all time yet if not this right here this Floyd Mayweather nice forty in some Oh didn't dude go like seventy something you know why doesn't that no no I didn't he didn't he didn't am i trippin yeah yeah yeah the the my father for Facebook fake wins what was the what was just Google what was Camilo set up since I sure know the record before he lost did this to me running amateur fights or something before well um and chenko was only had one amateur loss I'm he's got one professional one gotcha line I'd check in boxing because I've become such a UFC Fan I like I'm some cats I have friends like my buddy Vinny pass from from I love any pet he fucking hates MMA fucking hate successes up tapes and fights that's right elevator please Joe don't get me don't come to fights with you know I'm here oh hey Joe I'm there that day when Vinnie Paz comes open invitation open invitation he passed away June July July 8th July 8th no I wasn't at it what I don't think I'll be back but wait if he wants to go go no no no no no no no I want to be there but if you change that opinion out you cuz I can he's a boxing like a fit but he is I tell me aficionado he bar I know he is I nobody likes disrespects the MMA game to a certain degree where I'm like ok with your little like comments dude you know aces real fighting you know in the streets Floyd Mayweather would get his fucking ass busted by Connie Moreau wouldn't even be close but it's a destruction it would be Conor McGregor grating Floyd met with Mayweather's face into the pavement like Parmesan cheese that's what it would be he was just waiting life he was just rip his legs out that's it Floyd didn't tag him with a knockout punch from the first year exactly Conor would be way away from kicking his legs out hands out I read this article I know you can't be shy about like what if it was like a what-if article what if Connor took the fight with Mayweather and just came out picked him up slammed him on the fucking ground and dismantled him and like ripped is a this is the do it he could do it and he really could do it if you wanted to take him down and just like a lost all the money and everything but I still kicked his ass he's that's nothing MMA destroys fuck he would go to jail or something would happen because it would be here's a problem they'd be betting right it'd be all these people that bet against it what do you do there because Floyd wins by disqualification you knew you were gonna do this you didn't go into this with good faith class-action lawsuit against Conor McGregor Wow you're taking a what-if article way to folks I do it every like that would be funny that's what I do with everything it's my problem no I love it I go deep too deep no I'm staying there it's gonna be an interesting fight if they fight I think she's fight with no gloves see what the fuck's really going on hey one other that's real quick since I'm really I'm no Joe started me drinking whiskey before the podcast at 2:00 2:00 in the afternoon his idea I'm mad at you come on don't don't act like you didn't say let's drink some whiskey right yeah you expect every last to say no let's drink some whiskey then you have made the faux pas but what I want to say real quick cuz I've been drinking and I haven't been there in a while either my good friend jason Ellis just won his king of the cage matches she did ago won by submission right yes he won outright by submission and congratulations when do I love you you fucking work hard for that and that that inspires me that kind of shit inspires me when I see Jason dude I'm like fuck I'm making a lot of excuses for shit he did real strength and conditioning with like no constraint deal first of all he beat up a couple MMA guys I mean rape or what it was gay brutal bar whatever he beat that I was there when ya beat him up it was a man i watch the design meet him up yeah alright that's the second action fights whatever you want to say about all the weight cuts he missed on The Ultimate Fighter shit that guy's a professional fighter yeah Jason beat the shit out of him and knocked him out yeah alright when I heard about this fight I was texting him like you're gonna win this fight dude I know you went but yo you fucking won that fight dog real-deal love you Congrats yeah and did everything he had to do like did the real shit to get in shape that that's why I'm saying he's inspired that kind of guy's inspiring to me man because what he does is he chooses something and he says I'm gonna commit to it there's this I was saying I think earlier I'm here because I followed road signs and I just I I consider myself adept reading the signs of life and where I'm put when there's the the forks in the road I happen to be good at making the right choice there are certain guys that don't give a fuck about the fork in the road and determine their own fuckin path and decide you're kind of one of those dudes and I admire that no in a way I mean I admire what I do I know I recognize there's a skill and a talent and a blessing and what I do but there's something about being of decide something and fucking make it so even though maybe it's not supposed to be so hmm and I'm not that is my next chase in life maybe not to it if I even if I don't achieve it to understand it how it's possible how could I be that guy how could it at 20 maybe I have under understood a little bit differently so maybe by the time I'm 70 God willing it's an illusion this is the illusion the illusion is that you're looking at the ultimate results from your perspective and you're saying how how do I tune myself in how do i how do I get totally connected with what I really want to do and not be influenced by the opinions and the ideas of others how do I find my true sweet spot right the problem is we all look at other people's destination again like that crazy quote that comparison is the enemy of joy it's really kind of the same thing going yeah the thief of joy that the whole key I think to anything you do whether you're a guy who makes furniture or a woman who paints or whatever the fuck you do well you're a rapper or a blues singer or a stand-up comedian or an author or whatever the fuck you do the thing is and this is a cliche expression but it's really there's a reason why people keep expressing it over and over again get out of your own way half of the reason why you're not tuning in perfectly good to whatever fucking vibration is available to you in the universe is you get in your own fucking way you get in your own way with insecurity and with ego and with expectation and with pressure and with all the different judgments you cast on different forms of art that you may or may not like like you're wasting time you wasting energy it's clogging up your gear is you only have a certain amount you got to manage your attention the way you would manage oxygen if you're in a spaceship you got to say I can't give away this stuff to bullshit I can't be sitting around wondering if you know what whatever the fuck it is if it's not relevant to your life you wasting way too much time thinking about this okay let me come at you okay this is and this is personal this is personal I accept everything you just said as truth but let me throw a personal angle at you yes sir I want to be in much better shape okay okay we could do that we can get that no here look let me get to the the desert circumstances every I have a life that presents me with a lot of problems that can make emotional confliction 'z yes with what I'm trying to achieve in life right legitimate ones right I mean cause certain I won't call myself ever depressed because I don't like that word I mean I do get depressed but I want to use the word like I had depression I think a lot of people lean on some shit and like try to actually milk it in especially in media do you want to see something right now before you keep talking that's gonna change your life it's gonna like lock into exactly what you're saying I just don't even know what I'm saying but yes I'm gonna show you the way Jamie go to my Twitter page and pull that Jacko good watch this watch this this is very important my friend please this is very important I trusted you enough to be like all the back end from the beginning I wings an offense that you didn't hear the finish of my store bring it to the guinea yeah put it up on the screen and yes beware don't worry at least gonna play one more war porn video cuz I promised my guys give it give us some volume listen to this one of my direct subordinates one of my guys that work for me he would he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problem some issue that was going on and he tape off so we got this and that the other thing and I look at him and I'd say good and finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said I already know what you're gonna say I said well what am I going to say he said you're gonna say good he said that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad you always just look at me and say good and I said well yeah when things are going bad there's going to be some good that's going to come from it didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted good didn't get promoted good no time to get Oh mission got cancelled good we can focus on the other one didn't get funded didn't get the job you wanted got injured sprained my ankle got tapped out good got beat unexpected problems we have the to figure out a solution that's it when things are going bad don't get all bummed out don't get startled don't get frustrated if you can say the word good guess what means you're still alive they means you're still bleeding and if you're still breathing you still got some fight left in you so get up Dustoff reload recalibrate re-engage go out on the attack chuckle willing changing motherfuckers lives right now live in America coming to you from Southern California no Jocko right now goosebumps play Jocko right now my kids got pneumonia and her fucking left London to a degree that nobody fucking knows what to do and fuck and even the doctors are perplexed well you're right about that what he's talking about see this is my question this is why I was saying I'm not asking for anybody right I'm not as all I'm saying I actually came on the show today I say if it's something in this realm if somebody in the Valley area or la greater area my twitter is og Everlast my fucking everything's the same oh gee ever laughs or Eric Schrodinger legitimate I need a little help I need a little help in the sense that I want to be in better shape but I travel so much and then at home is a stress of like I want to go to gym I couldn't go to fucking gym for the last 10 days it was either me or my wife you're the fucking husband you hears no no Joe I don't want to make you feel bad at all I'm gonna say it's like that's that was beautiful whoever who's that guy again Jocko willing Jocko willing that is fucking supremely motivationally on any level except what I'm trying to say is like skating your way around this fucking kind of emotional fucking dilemma of like it's hard of course I'm here saying it's hard that's that's I'm actually bringing it up to say no one's denying failing in certain ways at what I'm trying to achieve right so like that's what I mean when I say I'd see Jason and I know again I got a little extra I got a little extra to deal with I got a little my backpack has a little more weight emotionally and mentally okay but I'm not making that an excuse what I'm saying is like how do I be more like that how can hurt that I want that I'm asking well what he's giving that was a for tuned ease but again she's talking about very specific situations giving you opportunities rehearsal once I got down I'm fucked up it's when it's surprised about other thing this other is this shot is a whole different level of like mental challenged I'm not saying what he's saying is wrong I'm not saying it doesn't work but how do I find that in that that's tough it's is a set what he's proposing the principle if he has the answer please fucking holler if know this invent the principles that he's proposing when he's saying that you can apply them to everything figure out how you can take whatever situation you're in and improve your position do four hundred curls a day and be as buff as Joe Rogan I can't how do I get too many I'm making fucking your layer literal with this literal don't get literal with me all right cuz she drinking whisky you're drinking water that's whiskey I only got to drive a block you got a drive however far interesting someone's comparing oh joy I'll walk thief people joy its crept into our trap I was actually just meant to be like a little stir you know might um I want that I've found that very motivating but what I'm saying is like there's this hurdle I understand of cap or Lieutenant Dan that's got some real fuckin anger issues I'm working them out I'm working on him I'm this is really a the whiskey I'm being more honest than I even thought I would be today okay okay but you're mean they you don't get on a fucking platform like Joe Rogan and say hey I'm failing at this unless you're fucking try to do something about it you know I mean I want to achieve I don't want to be you but I'm like I see the way I've been watching I know you know saying but watching your videos about running you're running a duel another thing that has also gotten to me and gets me to when I do get to work out it's because I hear Joe Rogan tell me don't let the inner bitch fucking get you yeah and I understand and that that's been a big motivator for me is like but there's it's not an inner bitch to be disturbed and upset and your life upheaved by this thing it's dad's absolutely not it's absolutely not do you feel where I'm coming from I think but what he's saying this video what is applicable and you can argue whether or not it's all that's or not but I'm asking some OC level I said on a personal level and I'm not trying to argue with you or be argumentative okay as I'm saying on a personal level that's the level of it with it the level of that that are that that inspirational message is great right I'm struggling of course you are with this part of it like how do i well yeah if I if I got my arm broken and snapped by a guy who tapped me out or or life just kicked my ass and I didn't get the job I or the opportunity I wanted and good I understand that but I am personally struggling with not as an excuse not using this but the truthful emotional fucking agony of like seeing a child tell you like and not just tell you but go through this hospital of the last two weeks these things are like how do I be stronger how do I go and anybody and what I'm saying I'm not being argumented with you again is is saying please if you got a book throw it's tweeted to me if you're the dude who fucking is local and says I know how to help plus I understand I have a heart valve replacement my workouts is a lot of show you I can workout here let me tell you why working out gets weird for me I'll start I'll do good I'll drop fifteen pounds bang boom boom and then I'll start to push myself and I'll I'll get distrustful of my own heart like a pain or a tinge that really might not be anything will come along and fucking scare the shit out of me because there's nothing I never was afraid of anything in my life until I had children and the only thing I'm afraid of on this planet is not being here for my children my life or death I do not care I've died twice literally all right I don't care about that but now there's this fear of like these children these girls not even boys I honestly even feel I would feel differently if I had two boys like they'll be alright I can instill the manly shit into him while I'm here but my girls I'm a the my biggest fear in life is not being here for them and I'm good I'm healthy I except for about 25 pounds of weight I'm actually my blood works all that my doctors are all very happy with me it's the only complaint they ever have and the only complaint I ever have is I have some back pains sometimes I'm gonna sleep let me stop weight-related okay let me stop you with all this talk because you have a lot of reasons why things aren't working physically the way you would like them to no doesn't for hell I'm definitely saying yes I would like help I understand you are but there's too much extra energy spent on things that aren't helping you like you and I know you have these time constraints but the focus on them is counterproductive because you have the time constraints the time constraints rob you of your time and then the focusing on the time constraints and the agony of those time constraints and the fucking frustration of having those time constraints robs you of more time and more energy you just gotta accept it you got to be Zen about it I had a friend working on it he's a comedian from Boston his name is Tony V and he said something to me once it's very important it applied to the rest of my life it was a very simple statement he was driving from Boston to New York several times a week several times for some job II got and I'm like how you do that and he goes you know what I found when I get in the car I just go Zen I say this is what I'm doing I don't I don't concern myself with the dishes to wash the dishes I don't concern myself with the fact that I can't believe I have to do this oh my god what was me he goes I just do it and then I thought about that that day and then I applied that to my life because that's the best advice anybody could ever get mm you anybody who's doing anything they don't like to do of course you don't like to do it but to concentrate on the fact that you don't like to do it compounds the not like to do it aspect of it it makes it worse no actually what you're describing is actually a lot of the stuff I'm reading right now which is like the art of mindfulness which is again when I keep saying wash the dishes to wash the dishes it's it's kind of like saying exactly I like wash your dishes to wash your dishes don't wash your dishes to get to the next thing because you're not living life you're not breathing you're not living in your moment so I'm working on that but at the same time I'm still saying like I also I you know what I found in the last couple years especially through like the little social media that I managed to be successful that that people want to know the real deal a shit ain't fucking perfect over here there's a lot of things about me I'd like to be better right yeah I mean just cuz I make good money and I I ain't hungry I I can eat filet mignon while every night you know MEK live really I do live really nice I'm very fucking grateful for my life but there's a lot of fuckin dark you don't see that if you saw maybe you wouldn't all this fakery there's a lot of thing like as the Instagram talking a little powwow how dare you whatever you to bring him up but um yeah that you know what that is Jimmy's been bringing up a little Bala non-stop that's the cherry on top of fucking fuckery you know me yeah so what he got called out for he was on a flight at least he was in like you know on a plane in first class was even was you seem like business at least I flag business I don't fly first I fly business as long as I can lay down as long as the tape things like this one I fly to Europe I'm cool yeah but you know and the few times I have flown private eye instead good you oh yeah cuz I don't fly private dude I know what it really costs yeah ain't it ain't cheap it's not oh you know when i holler at dana like hey can i catch a lift in flight and i don't get a response I know it ain't cheap

find a place near me I'll find out what I want is privates I want to set up my garage with a little pad system because the here's the deal I know it doesn't happen often but anything like staph or anything like that is so dangerous for Layla that is really scary yeah so like working out in a gym with like 40 guys working out there's two scary there's two frightening things for me working out in a normal jiu-jitsu class the fucking average novice that doesn't realize he's fucking stupid and fucking pulls my left arm out or my right arm out and I can't play guitar for fucking six weeks or a month or six months even you know so I only train with the teachers that's my way I just say hey I'll pay for that whatever little extra of private whatever you know I mean and but obviously brah I Eddie doesn't live out that way so but he told me he was like I got a fucking guy out there he's awesome he's a fucking black belt he's fucking awesome and I just I haven't followed up as much as he hasn't gotten back you know it's not like he's like ignoring me or anything I'm just saying I got a follow through on that and get that going too cuz if I lose and I've lost about 15 pounds honestly with all this talk we're saying in recent it's called the great American worried diet worried yeah that's been a week in hospital lose 15 pounds yeah especially a one that doesn't serve meat or caffeine you know so those you know shoutout to the seventh-day Adventist who don't eat meat or caffeine in like the most stressful situations ever yeah love and ale but you know honestly I won't even say that they took such amazing care of my daughter I love every single one of them that's awesome man their non meeting non coffee drinking asses I love them all maybe try that diet let's keep keep riding it work it now right what do you woody you said so much Kazuma don't worry though I just get the worry part of the worry diet is the hard part you know horse that's the holy reason of what I kind of brought up earlier it's like that's the how do you get around that how do you get around worrying about your own kid you're gonna have to read some books on yeah I'll be trying how to do that I was trying I'm trying but I'm also here I'm feeling myself I've smoked a little I've drank a little right the dough Rogan person and his audience that hey if there's an interesting idea out there go ahead and shoot it I'm sure someone will find me there's gonna a and I know I'm gonna get like 400 fuckin shitty ideas but if there's one good one out there great yeah there's gonna be dudes who recommend video games hey five fucking solved all my problems dead bro jump Ropin virtuality a fish dude ping-pong changed my life man you know what you're you're you've been given a very difficult test by whatever my life itself and you know what for the truth of matter is is up until that man I had an easy ride okay so don't feel bad for me right but if you got a suggestion please shoot it my way cuz I'm I'm at this point in life words like I've understood again the communal I think beyond the music lesson of it being communal right is as a human being we are communal people yeah and though it even hails back to the beginning of what we talked about the blues and the Reds they are trying to separate us because we're communal and if we all actually sat down even the most fucking worst opinion over there and the worst pinion over there if we were all in the room together we could find somewhere over here where we could both at least be the least bit angry at each other I honestly think we should eliminate political parties thank you think what we should have is just a bunch of people with very any out of politics very my ologies pull money here that's your interesting idea here's an interesting idea about England all right England announces their elections there are three months from the announcement of the elections till the election for you to was Eagle II I am pain why is that good it's better because limit because I want to again hailing back to what we said earlier the day after the president selected it seems like they're talking about who's gonna run in 2020 already right all right and in this hey we might be in a particularly weird circumstance now in America again i won't i won't even delve into that what i want to say is the day after our president is elected we shouldn't be talking about who's going to be the next fuckin president until that guy fucks up enough to say who's going to be the next president there should be this there's and again we are in some extremely absurd and weird circumstances at the moment but under normal circumstances I would dissing my argument would just be we're Americans this guy got elected through the process we all agreed to and even now I'll say that but dudes already fucking again that's why I don't want to visit that because that's a whole fucking four hours on its own honestly I don't I don't I just don't want to even go there but give America a fucking chance you know what I mean am I making any sense you make like four whiskey's now brother make me what your idea is of America versus what everybody else's idea we need to come to some sort of clarification my idea is this I don't mean to interrupt you my ideas this is that you could be the furthest away from me you could be and I could be way over there but if we were in the same room somewhere we in here we'd find a place that we'd be like all right I can live with that that's the idea we need to figure out what these things are that we're talking about living with because I don't think there's very many of them that were already agreeing disagreeing rather on between the left and the right I think there's a lot of bullshit and I think it's a lot of what we're talking about really this tribal JB whoever deals in the sand the people who elected this personal president right now personal evident yeah yeah their personal president is a personal president this is a very few amount of people there's really truly very few people that are his base thirty five percent let's keep it right now let's keep it real let's keep it fucking real yeah cuz a lot of bailed on him because they realized what they voted for was not what they fought they voted in protest almost a lot of people what's his approval rate it's pretty low right fucking the lowest in history is it low and again I don't care what I'm saying is like a lot of people said fuck the whole system and for a second they bought into the fact that this guy actually might think the same when this guy spent his entire life fucking over the working-class dude in fact as much as I'm a I would have voted the other direction for whatever you want to say and I again I don't give a fuck about Hillary Clinton I'm not telling you the fucking world would have been saved by Hillary Clinton fuck that shit all right that was an entitled motherfucking person who was only given that fucking position because for some reason the the people the the elite of that party thought it was her turn or something I don't know that was wrong that's just as much their fault for losing as fuck we should be talking about politics for wait it's already there I'm drunk what I'm saying is this is that dude is gonna give me a tax break if he's successful and the guys that actually voted for him the Union guys and the fucking working-class guys are gonna get fucked over and at the end of the day they'll be regretting it as much as like some of the things he's spitting at you and saying to you're appealing he's not that fucking guy just like fuck Hillary Clinton fuck Donald Trump so you can't be mad at me fuck all of them Bernie Sanders was probably our most logical choice but I said fuck him because I read his tax pant plan and he would have fucking raped me so it's like there's got to be I don't know there's got to be a whole new system where the money is there has to be a flat tax kind of thing where every fucking person from corporation the problem is too many corporations are considered we're talking way too much about politics you're freaking me the fuck out I can't do this anymore Jamie I'm here I understand what you're saying I'm just saying this is as a person everybody it's not politics it's like when it's lower the fact that they're separating and dividing you could be a white supremacy you could be a black fucking nationalist whatever you want to be they're fucking playing on that they're playing on that these this is designed Facebook all these algorithms are fucking designed to design what do you want to see on your page well remember that well what is this what you want see this conversation right if everybody will just remember that see or no I just like the fact of the way they set up programs they set up a program to say what's going to be most like the guy who invented Facebook Mark Zuckerberg where will his team whoever's his team wants his his the people who use his product to be the happiest they can be with it right correct I'm assuming here's the direction we're going with this okay right so if they look at the things you click on right and start developing a pattern and an algorithm right and click on these extremely right things or you click on these extremely left things sooner or later that's all that's going to be on your page Instagram even changed their fucking algorithm to it's not like what was just last posted right what was last posted that's most popular and what's appealing to you that you like okay I mean that's where I'm going with this I don't is that these people are they don't understand you're being catered to you're being fed you're being fed ideas you want to be fed you're not being challenged and I've always said this about even personal my art if there's not somebody it goes back to being in a room by yourself and why I got stagnated with making a record if there's not somebody in that room somehow to challenge your idea your idea isn't the best it can be ever I understand what you're saying but I think that I an alternative point of view would not be that you're getting fed would that be these algorithms recognize your interests whether it's golf or South American fishing or fucking skydiving whatever the fuck you're interested in you start searching for that it'll give you things that you cannot just what you're sort of what you're liking and it's at is it's K it's like you're saying the conversations that you've best had in your life are almost alternative opinions and those start getting filtered out of your feed and you know no no no that's only your own choices if you choose to go why don't you just search out things that are alternative to what you are because you're Joe Rogan and you think like that we're talking about the guy who works fucking 40 hours a week who gets on Facebook and sees what comes down is he that guy that he's no different than you or me always listening to you I'm sure I hope he is I hope he's listening to but you hear what I'm saying though right like it's not a fucking dismissed idea that there's guys who got their heads fucking down just trying to get their paycheck for the next week to get their fucking mortgage paid and they look up for a long enough time and maybe Facebook as the one thing they look at a week and then that's where they get their information from yeah but that's not Facebook's fault good Facebook creates an algorithm that reinforces what your injuries are look all right be aware I understand we're saying but you're saying it also in the way of like OMA like these people are victims of this this is just a simple and victims in themselves but it's not even but they don't even even aware of that that are victims of themselves and they are I would I would say viader if they're creating their own universe they are completely creating and this thing is allowing that all right it's fit you can block whatever you want out if you don't want to see something yeah you can create and what do they call it in the fucking and curate your own universe right all right and let me tell you something about resistance what I find interesting like Keith Oberman resistance sort of sort of he's sometimes he okay he can be a propaganda so I'm just kidding he's a propagandist too like Michael Moore everybody there's no true center right now that's why I keep coming back to like how do you know what's truly true right you want to know where I find truth where comedians comedians are the new punk rock comedians truthfully are the people who are challenging the status quo right now whether you're talking about the guy on HBO as the last week Tonight Show or The Daily Show kind of news more Americans and it's as a studied fact trust comedic news as truth than they do fucking Anderson fucking Vanderbilt Cooper Vanderbilt he's a Vanderbilt little name he's a Vanderbilt I'm just throwing it out you know he's amazing it means he comes from a very fucking privileged family dog you know and he represents a very leftist stance it's fakery is what I'm saying he's a Vanderbilt all right that's what I'm saying it's like saying he's a rock a fucking feller alright and if you don't see Rockefeller know Rockefeller not rockefeller oh all right Rockefeller like the fucking evil fuck that just died oh he's a bad guy or a bad guy all right 1% he's a one-percenter all right trust that trust the people you're watching that you trust Fox News CNN or as bullshit and hey I might get a lot I ain't even look at Twitter letters later so fuck all y'all you know mijo hey I don't look at Twitter I don't care so if you hate what I'm saying I don't care I'm gonna say it anyways do you know because what I'm saying is for the greater good it's like I'm not telling you I'm left I'm right I'm saying there's a place in the Middle where we're all fucking people and we all give a fuck about the same shit like our lives and our children and our eating and our fucking having a roof over our head and there's no reason that the richest fucking planet on earth can't figure these fucking problems out and the only reason they're our problem is because they want there to be problems and for you to fucking be fighting with each other your blue or your red choose a Crip or you blow I don't know something what's up chosen you Crippen are you blood and what you're doing you a blood you a Crip in this political fucking environment you blue state are you a red state my man what up that's what they do it that's what they're doing and I know we didn't want to go here and I know I tried to push it off for like hours but I ain't making it personal about a president or a thing I'm saying there's a system in place that's fucking keeping us locked down and it's fucked up and it's money related and if we took money out of it we could get more of an honest politician who would actually give a fuck about your kid and whether there's fucking power lines going over your house or whether you got health care or whether you got this or that until then don't expect me to give a fuck about any and the drug leads on say any long y'all and here y'all that buy into this system and ain't ready to change something and say that something should be different I think everybody thinks I'm no they don't because they're not doing shit about it they're not doing shit about it Joe and I'm not trying to be angry with you I love you you know I love you my brother okay but not even but oh shit should decide what are you doing there is no bush there's no bullshit in this so I put aside what I'm saying is like until people want to realize that there's an answer and the answer is pulling corporate and fucking it if you can't there should be a limit on what you could donate to a fucking politician should be like a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars let's make it $1,000 I think every day should look like whatever there should be some kind of system that says it's not fucking the coke fucking brothers pumping billions into a dude whether it's through into in misdirection or fucking with it let's keep it fucking real man this is this we're getting fucked as a people hey I do well I'm doing myself a disservice by even saying shit you think they're gonna come get you no but I think it they're gonna tax me more if I if I can't reach Icahn if I keep preaching the style of life I believe I will pay more taxes yeah I really think that they come get you I will talk more no come get me you're fucking playing me like I'm dumb they know you're doing them you're doing the entertainment thing right now I'm being so right now Joe is that I'm saying they will fucking tax me more yes if the government and the way of life I think I should pay more yes then the fucking person who makes $36,000 a year but you know what if my accountant smart enough I don't have to that's honesty all right I can fucking figure out a way not to pay as much taxes because I have shit all that legally right even legally wrong legally I'm talking about totally legally okay I'm talking about what your president is pulling right now that he's never shown you his taxes all right he's pulling that it's you can easily skirt a lot of taxes if you have a little bit of omission like a lot of motherfuckers are dumb enough to buy cars all right I don't buy cars I'll keep it fucking real with you I don't buy a fucking car I lease a fucking car you know why cuz it's a fucking basically almost a hundred percent fucking tax write-off a guarantee bill bharata's car bill burr owns his house Bill Nye lovely funny you're one of the finest guys ever play games at you fucking lease cars you can write off the fucking payments as he was in front of you right now you'd be like fuck you I want to own it good good own it and then when you want to new I like new cars so guess what I get a new one every fucking two years Christ you're aggressive with this car thing no but what I'm saying is there's games that are played that you're not even trippin on because they sold you on the opposite angle they got rappers telling you that fucking owning your shit outright is perfect so pay a hundred thousand dollars for that car drive it off like get a dent in it it's worth fucking 40 grand now I understand you're very passionate about this but I don't see both sides I could see that someone would want to lease something because it'd be a nice tax write-off especially if you're incorporated which I'm sure you are and I am but also might see someone who says I who's got money has the games down because I have the guys who give me the information there's a lot of guys yeah I were joking pull this off no you don't have being incorporated doesn't involve being rich I understand that yeah but the fire guy listen his Nissan Sentra doesn't and he could actually incorporate himself and fucking write off his fucking $300 even a month payment like there's ways to get yo there's fucking games that are being played that people don't fucking know about is my point I'm straight this is a deep game it is going to thank you aim to be in play the people don't know about love you and I feel like maybe I'm draw less you're looking at me like I'm talking shit really drunk we draw a little bit but we're bust drunk is way first drunk I'd be trying to fight you Joe well let's not do now we're friends um war porn industries when is it when are people gonna be able to
