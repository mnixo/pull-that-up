boom yes boom we're live what's up brother how are you man how are you Joe you got a little pocket hankie there he'll get the hole squeal well I tell you I tell you I wear a pocket square please because if you don't wear a pocket square you have the appearance that you've been squeezed into a sports jacket or a suit for conventional reasons that your mum put you in there or after church or something or you go into the office right as soon as you put a pocket square in there you own the jacket it's your idea not someone else's idea whoo dude you're thinking several steps ahead I like it we're going to get into this our job we are going to get into this well we were talking before the podcast about these press junkets and about how you entertain yourself by forcing yourself to use a certain word yeah the danger the the worst thing in the film business is press junkets and as you were saying that rather ineffective and that's my suspicion too they're not they're also inefficient and ineffective because you sit in chair someone comes in and they ask you a question why how good an actor is David Beckham when is is an under pencil whatever it is and you answer it in some facile fashion and on the fourth time you ask answer that question you're starting to swat flies that aren't there you start to go mad so what happens is you have to play games yourself so you get someone on the side to throw different words that you like valetudinarian or Marisa Milla tude and then that keeps you occupied because you're thinking when someone asked me about Beckham in his underpants I've somehow got sticking of erisa Milla toot and I'd say it's not easy and your answers become very creative well did you ask someone to be sincere and ask the same questions over and over and over again to them like to have people keep filing in a new person comes in and as I said so tell us about this film and how did this get started and so who whose idea was in so um eyesore film Trumbo made Excalibur about 90 and I was an impressionable young man of 10 and it was the first like knights in shining armour film that ever spoke to me I wasn't particularly interested in Errol Flynn or any incarnation that they did in the 50s in this genre but John Boorman's one was rather good is very aggressive and no one spoke to one another they all shouted at one another so it took some time before you realize that that's why it was so intense it's quite Kemp so it had this sort of weird juxtaposition of being camp yet simultaneously aggressive and you know they had a budget of $25 and the visual effects and lots of very shiny 19th century armor and it made a real impression on me because it was it was a voice it was a creative voice so I made an impression on me and then somewhere in the Attic of my mind I relegated it until the point where I had enough creative ideas in my reservoir to bring it forward to make a film and then someone gave me money & water brothers wanted to make it yadda yadda yadda and then it was the challenge I suppose of trying to take us adjourn into this world the fantasy epic fantasy medieval II Lord of the Rings II kind of a world and it's completely out of my wheelhouse so I find the challenge provocative and exciting as well that's a is a fascinating error like genre you know that fascinating world of the fantasy you know Knights and swords and bows and arrows and that that realm for whatever reason has been like intoxicating to people for a long time here's an archetype so yeah you're interested in farm and you're interested in nurses you're interested in the superheroes obviously I mean arguably Arthur was the first superhero because he's the guy extracts the sword and it's galloping can do all sorts of wonderful dear old and it's as relevant today as it was then but because it's an archetype that somehow kids are the dress up as firemen policemen soldiers or Knights so we is almost like we relived it it's like an outfit that we wore 1200 years ago so you feel familiar in it mmm it's just it's fascinating that that one genre that one sort of archetype is just locked into the psyche of people yeah it's it's there isn't it the other thing about it which is quite fun is you can take these kind of mystical rides into metaphor so you can symbolize things with 304 elephants which you can't do in some version of a realistic world so it becomes you have broad poetic license to take liberties are using CGI in this movie a lot of it yeah Wow what's that like um boring but creative it's three years to make this movie I'm used to making movies that take 30 months to write three three years three years Wow three months to write from beginning to end Southern Lights Nash was three months six weeks to shoot two months to edit so now to us three months to do the whole thing or to write it that to write it and to shoot it the whole thing from the beginning to them we're getting to the end of six months oh wow and then three months safer editing so you're wrapped impact in nine months ten months so this is a totally different kind of commitment as far as your mind and yeah if I really knew what I was getting into I would have asked for double bubble on the salary because you sort of things could be a year and a half it's not it's three years like when you play on a movie like there's a big epic movie do you have an actual schedule of when you think it's going to begin and when it's going to end or do you do but you know we the terrain filmmaking has changed exponentially like everything like with technology so what was pertinent last year is not pertinent this year so release dates are a real dog so we had a release date which was projected a couple of years from when you start the movie so they go right here's a check mate a movie you're coming out in it was we were supposed to come out exactly a year ago but then what happens is if you're not a branded movie you get elbowed off that date in Star Wars or something will come along and then you're not going to compete the Star Wars so you got a move because you can't compete so you've got a very crowded market with lots of brands now this isn't something that we used to have suffer because everyone was equal going into the equation you give yourself the advantage of having a movie star or something but that doesn't exist anymore like this now is the brand is the Big Brother so he comes muscling in bullies his way into a weekend and that's why you can't really get new films breaking through because those occupy those weekends already occupied so trying to break through is a real real struggle we had to wait a year for a day and the date that we're coming out on is one weekend after guardians now guardians will be a fast hit and it's very dangerous being within the parameters of a big movie that's a really interesting thing that only movies have to go through these days right I mean it's one of the rare things where people are getting out and going to see something that's been made together in a group you know that you're you're watching media like it's not a live performance it's something that's been created and it's going to press play at 8:00 p.m. on Friday night and everybody's going to go to see and you got to get as many of those people together as you can it's one of the rare things like that yeah and it's becoming more polarized so it means more now so you're opening weekend everything's about they know what you got to make by Thursday evening right right you're coming you're supposed to be coming out on Friday and everyone knows what you got to make by Sunday night on the Thursday evening there's enough clever people out there tapping into clever little boxes and computer says that they do and they're seldom wrong now that never used to be the case used to come out and films would get discovered you said a platform you start small go big that's all nonsense now you just got come out ball swinging and if you don't come out ball swing and people get very upset and they think that this is a failure it hasn't lived up to expectations even if it's a creative success yeah but he likes it it's well you know there's a bit of that you know there's there is an acceptance if the movies good movies good and movies find their own way usually in the end anyway but the financial aspect has become polarized it's too significant of a component in the equations because you know it's an art form right and the end of the day it's entertainment in an art form and somehow you want to unify reconcile that so because they're essentially different reconcile those put it in a nice little package so you put in a pill with a sweet wrapper around it and then you've got both and then you should be happy you should have the substance and you should have the flavor um but then now the focus is all on the flavor and not in the substance and that's result orientated so your movie comes out they go put it mate right slow down son what's the movie line the question first of all should be what's the movie like rather than what they'd make and it's just it's become too competitive and to comparative financially and I love a dollar bill and I like things are successful but it has to be secondary towards primary and primary is what's it like creatively well a film like not to shit on it but fast and furious all I heard about was how much money it made that's all you hear it's like the big story the big fast the furious opening box-office hundreds of millions of dollars all you see is like it's gonna make a billion dollars why do you give a fuck why does anybody who's watching that give a fuck you're not gonna get any of that money why is it so appealing that this movie is made a billion dollars because it's comparative and it's competitive yeah and it's why two people in the audience because its voice voyeuristic yeah so you can it's like spectator sport who's the winner right you don't do really care about how they won you should care about the fact that they did win or like a Floyd Mayweather you want to find out how much money you made they made 200 million dollars out 5 whoo people get excited about it's an extra element yeah there is a sort of vicarious life that people can have through sports stars and liberties and success if they feel somehow related to or they went on the opening weekend or they are invested in then if it's successful then somehow proliferate am successful yeah that gets weird right does get away idea it's the business of movies is a very very strange business because your your creative business but you're also a business enterprise I mean you're you're a financial business and when it's a guy like you like your movies have a certain flavor you know like you start off with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels like that movie has a flavor to it and then your other films like people want to go to see that kind of flavor from your films you feel like pressure in that regard like to live up to those expectations or to conform to these ideas that people have of your movies yes and no isn't no okay it depends what moves you catch me in right um I like what I do and I'm going to do it anyway I just like it very much when people pay me to do it and give me the money to go and do it so I don't mind the financial aspect of it I don't mind films having to compete on what I'm after is a reconciliation and as I say the primary component should be on the quality of the work that should be what's primary but I don't grudge films being successful I like them to be successful I like the competitive element but sometimes when you're talking with executives you realize mate your priorities are on the wrong thing here in the end it is a creative medium and that is what has to be primary do they get in the way of a guy like you though but I would imagine a guy like you they give you a certain amount of leeway they give you all the leeway oh that's beautiful yeah and my experience with studios will be very positive and they try to encourage your hopefully what is your individual idiosyncrasies they want you to put your imprint upon the work and they've been nothing but encouraging in that sense but you know people betray their agendas whilst you know you're in like conversation or they betray their priorities so you want to trust a man because he's a man of substance and to a degree independence so he's not looking to II to find himself through me so you're not asking me to tell me you who you are and that's the ongoing battle of life right while asking other people to tell us who we are right and independence from that is a man that could be trusted I don't want anything from you and thereby I can be kind to you because I don't need to manipulate you you're no longer a crutch right so it's got to be very difficult when you're in business with someone like that especially getting executive some slick character in a fine suit to find out exactly what his real motives really are they're never in fine suits never know they dress in appalling suits really yeah I mean business there's never encouraged fine suits no pocket squares occasionally you find a token pocket square but you can tell their heart's not in it the wife stuck it in there because she saw someone on TV that had a minute razzle dazzle about them and they call I quite fancy my old man well then they thought stick it any old man's be embarrassed about it for us to squeeze out of the way suits are a thing the death of the suit it was the death of the suit was the prosaic attitude toward I'm going alone and I'm gone where is don't ya put a tie on and I don't want to stick out that's how I feel but that's what's happened we've been brainwashed to not dress like gentlemen but I see a guy like you and I say that's appealing like look how you're dressed and you're in a conservative suit this is a nice like I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted but you chose assert that has a certain look to it yeah I have spent some time asking around with this Joe but a bit like the same reason that we've spent our time asking around with the old pocket square it's I remember thinking how much I found the suit repugnant and I became angry that the suit been robbed from but and so I had to create an alibi a way in to understand why is that I'd like a suit this was the magic of Ralph Lauren the magic of Ralph Lauren nice Jewish boy from New York called Lipschitz created a waspy Empire there's a wonderful expression that you know think Yiddish dressed British and Ralph Ryan created this great Empire and resold the waspy world back to the waspey world are you actually not to the waspey workers in England there was a sort of resentment about Savile Row traditional tailoring because it'd been robbed from the offices that come along the number crunchers had come along and there was no creativity in the suit a suit needs to be creative the person that puts it on can't be putting it on because he's told to put it on he's got a wanna put it on so what Ralph did is he fashioned up this sort of quasi New England world and soul he took on a trope he took on a cliche and he refashion that cliche to give it a new sense of life a new sense of breath he put black people in the suits where traditionally it was just a white man's suit he made it feel new he gave it a take so what he did is he tipped his hat the old world but also tipped his hat the new world and it allowed wasps to find their way back into the world with an eloquent narrative it's clever I'm getting fascinated by the way your brain works because for you it's important that the person want to wear the suit and I have a feeling that that's sort of that's symbolic of how you feel about life itself like the person has to want to be doing what they're doing they have to want to wear that suit it has to be an authentic gesture um did you ever read a book called extreme ownership written by a couple of Navy SEALs that's jock or will ink right no no that's I think it is is it yeah chuckles book yeah yeah yeah that jock want to show a bunch times important book well I've got him on once before what am I talking about a bunch of times right right and once but this book yes now there's lots of books that I've picked up on this thing but they were very eloquent about it if you don't own something you're not the boss you have to take full responsibility for everything that you do why be subservient you must be the master of your own Kingdom I feel you makes a lot of sense you've gotta own that you can't just walk into things with your eyes half open you'll walk into things with your eyes fully open you've got to know what you're getting into you have to take possession of your life this is a thought process that you have to constantly reaffirm what it is exactly that it's exactly that you drift on this point right and it is whatever form of meditation or mantra that you decide to espouse there needs to be some period in your day where you remember that there's a world out there trying to tell you who you are and there's a world in here that's trying to tell you who you are now where do you want to put your X because the world outside is very noisy and very tempting and as all the razzamatazz as all the tinsel and all the glitter it's got the toys but that's because you don't think you're enough in the first place ah you don't think you're enough in the first place the whole idea of the world to sell your stuff is first of all they have to make you feel bad about yourself less than in some way and I don't resent this system by the way it is the system but what's the expression about don't hate don't hate the player hate the game don't hate the game love the game because you're in it mate mmm so own the game accept the rules and move on into the rules so the world will try and tell you who you are and you have to tell yourself who you are and there's this ongoing battle and somehow there needs to be a reconciliation between the two but in the end you've got a ball the eggs in your basket there's also an ongoing internal battle though isn't there there's the you that you want people to think you are and there's you who you are and trying to figure out like how do i how do I figure out who I am like mm do I have a correct assumption of how the people are perceiving me and how I actually am objectively or am i bullshitting the world with this suit and pocket square yeah I would say it's exactly the scenario that we're talking about though there's essentially only two two worlds is the inner world of Gian is the outer world of energy there's two identities ones real ones Falls the external world is I'm asking you to tell me who I am that's what we're all playing and as soon as you start play that again we run into a source trouble calling the ego call it whatever you want to call it but that's the dynamic that we're in and somehow we have to give ourselves enough confidence to reassure ourselves that we are enough however I into the game because I got a move on in the world got crack on in the world and I know there's loads of temptations that come along the way so I will own the suit under the way the suit but I'm going to own the soup now don't mean by paying for it I mean by owning it it's now my suit it's my idea to put on this suit I have to personalize it in some way I have to understand a narrative that allows me to own that suit and thereby I put my suit of armor and I come out into the world and guess what I'm in a good time because I'm owning the suit now this is a very rock-solid philosophies there's some you've ever written down it's what the essence of narrative I'm a storyteller the essence of narrative is only about this dynamic there is nothing else in a story other than this dynamic so the struggle between other people's perceptions in your own wants and desires and who you truly are your your significant real self that's it that's all there is you tell me a story that didn't that we engaged in that's famous that's not about this journey I'll give you an example the prodigal son parable question seems religious didn't really make much sense do you know the story sure but why don't you lay it out so there's a father he has two sons an older son a younger son and he says to them who wants to spend their inheritance the younger says says me dad I can't spend it and the younger son takes all the dough and he runs off and sniffs coke off strippers tits for a number of years until he realizes this is getting pretty boring and I'm in a lot of trouble he ends up feeding throwing food to pigs that's his job and he can't even eat the food that he gives to the pigs at which point he says dad will you take me back dad then goes to they don't meet this somehow happens not through telephones it just happens at which point dad goes to the fatted calves has killed the fatted calves older sons his hold on dad what's going on I've stayed with you since the beginning I've been loyal to you and I hear the stories of my younger brother coming back who's been sniffing coke off strippers tits for the last habit on those how many years and you'll prepare to kill the fatted calf what's the SP dad I want another story this is your eye son don't worry about that you take a look slide a little step to the side you'll always be with me you're a good boy at which point it goes out to me the prodigal son the wasteful son the wasteful son returns and he says you were lost and they have found that's the end of the story it's quite hard to make sense of that in a literal sense you get all dad was a bit unfair you should have been kind to the oldest son because he never ran off and did in a thing but the essence of the story is that you are the father you are enough your older son is your intellect says all Daniel is dangling that he's trying to reconcile make sense of a prosaic and material world the youngest son being the wild feral entity that he is wants to go out the world and find out what it's all about so in his recklessness and sense of adventure he finds that he can't escape himself so he has to return to himself and at which point he has to accept who he is which born the intellect is left out the equation pretty much is the older brother because he can't understand the significance of the journey of the wasteful brother in the end you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself you have to lose stuff before you realize that all the stuff that you using is ephemeral and transitory it's not yours you're enough you're always enough but you've got to somehow prostitute yourself before you realize your own value that is the essence of all stories dad's deep Guy Ritchie is that something you think about all the time or just I mean this is like a cemented philosophy lip so King Arthur story just made a man is a king as a son the son the father is runs into a bit of a grow the son jumps into a little boat a little skillet and he's not skillet that's what you cut your chops on isn't it yeah I'm skiff little skiff the skiff takes off down the river he gets found by prostitutes he's brought up in a brothel he understands the ways of the street he becomes a king on the street he works his way out at different ladders and then he pulls a sword from a stone at a certain point in his life certain point of evolution and then from there he goes on to be the king there's a bit tussle all along the way lots of wrestling matches in the end he fights down his demons and he becomes the king so what's the significance of this narrative that every man in himself is eros the Kratt ik that he is his own king he takes us adjourn into the material world has to climb up all the different runs on the ladder and ultimately has to return to himself the significance of the extraction from the sword from the stone is the stone is the material world the material world which seems will solid because it controls you whilst you're projecting your sense of identity upon it the extraction of the stone is taking back your own authority your own divinity your own authority your own identity whatever it is that you've got to call it your own power you're no longer looking for a sense of self outside of yourself and then you have to face the demons that you've created in your history by facing them and fighting them and owning them you put them in the face of who you are and that's a wrestling match you'd have to take away all these crutches and that's all that we struggle from in life is taking away our crutches oh please tell me who I am oh please give me a bit more money so other people think I'm clever or and then I'll have a nice cut on people think I'm clever you got to take away all these crutches and banned as the man that you are and you're liberated from your whole thing the fact is the story King Arthur but it's not just the story enough it's a story of all narrative do you think that most people that are watching the film are going to get that though they're just going to get an entertaining story they're just going to see a bunch of cool stuff some drama play out but this is fascinating that you're operating so many levels underneath it keep I'm storytellers on business so if I'm in the business of story I might as well understand story and do you need to understand all that I'm not sure if you do depends where you are on the ladder so you can just go along have a nice bit of entertainment good guy bad guy everything is literal there's nothing wrong with literalism it is what it is it's the game you can glean what you can glean when you're ready to glean what you're ready to glean are you a Joseph Campbell fan I am a Joseph Campbell fan yeah yeah that mean that's a reoccurring theme in his work the hero's journey yes the hero's journey this underlying sort of narrative that just really guides all all stories and all ancient tales and that there's something inherently human about them important about these stories and they resonate with our wants and needs and goals and even also maybe the structure that we really truly need in our own life yeah I mean all the stories from whatever period I'm sympathetic to this particular to Joseph Campbell's philosophy on this but he's not the only one right right the weird thing about religion is religion has done to this spiritual significance of narrative what the businessman did to the suit he's literal eyes dit he didn't realize that putting on a suit is putting on a suit of armor he's putting on something that's rather spectacular it's just doing it for convention you're doing for others you're not doing it for you and in our literal mind we look at a narrative and we see the narrative for what we believe it to be the exterior aspect of narrative so we completely we see the world upside down we don't we're not actually interested in the essence of the narrative because we're so busy pandering after the approval of others so everything that we see every narrative that we listen to every film that you see you're not really interested in its soul you're interested in its body because that's what we correspond to it's fascinating that you're comparing it to suits because it resonates like when you think of a guy showing up for work or getting ready for work he doesn't want to go and he's putting on the suit and it's just dredging through it and putting it on and all you think about a guy who was crisply tucking in his collars and putting on his cufflinks and tightening up his tie and it feels empowered by the whole process of it it's very it's very appealing like if you see it in a film - it's very exciting this is a man of purpose they did it in mean streets I don't know you remember Harvey Keitel getting dressed to go up on a Friday getting dressed to go out the Friday night and affected a whole generation of people about the way they dress cuz he owned it oh yeah I never really thought about that until this conversation sad because I just I don't really wear suits occasionally look very very occasional but you've been robbed I've been robbed you've been robbed there are so many aspects of life food for a long time ago robbed from us and we've slowly managed to claw that that's true um but clothes really you're a 45 year old geezer and you're still dressing like an 18 year old mm-hmm house is a lot about well some people like to be comfortable though I get that by the way and they like that look comfortable your seat is comfortable yeah you can get poured into this completely deconstructed on the inside make a chap called Brunello knows what he's doing so these are all handmade um it's what it won't be handmade tailored know you got this off the shelf and I had a really yeah a couple of things tweaked but it's as comfortable as a pair of pajamas really yeah see again you have to broker a deal you can't put on things that are uncomfortable because guess what happens in the morning you're looking through your suits you go oh I like that one but I'm gonna wear it a comfortable one ah so they all have to be comfortable well you're not going to play the game I yeah I have a thing about ties though go on I'd kill someone with a tie on you sure you can kill someone hundred percent if I get a hold that tie you're dead Joe this conversation needs to go on for long gotta go on doesn't take about ties you're wearing a rope around your neck if someone just gets a deep grab Joe what you thinking about twist I'm not gonna have a fight with anyone no Aaron so you're not but it's I mean you would have to in a deep disagreement you'd have to wrestle that sucker loose and take it off to be safe I'm not gonna tell this agent you should that's my own personal problem I just feel like someone with a tie on all you have to do is grab that thing and that's a wrap like if you went to a jujitsu match and you had rope running like your jujitsu practitioner right I am yeah so don't you I'm sure you've been College oak then yeah y'all been fine for 20 years yeah yeah so that's what he is staying around your neck like mmm really by the way my game is I'm all about the gay I mean oh yeah I played a lot of noogie but I've come back to the guy and the reason I've come back to the key is I can quite tasty with Aggie sir very tasty quite Testament a geek I can as a couple moves I like show it's a bit tricky on on your with your t-shirt but I'm all about strangling man with ski which somehow elegantly segues from the tie I mean I'm all about creating what I call the hangman's rope out of the bottom of your key okay turning that into a thing so you're one of those guys that pulls the biology and wraps up on that guy out there and I played this game for a long time which is the wrapping around the wrist mm-hmm or you know that follow that you get that little dinosaur flippy right there say your arms out of action but then I discovered something Joe if you slip that gear in through there so what he's doing for people just listening he's tucking it like towards us on the inside inside crock of his elbow and once it comes in on the inside you can't get that hand out again that's it basically the fights over from there the fights over from there because you from then on you own that arm hmm it's interesting we should have little roll around at the exit this joke how long you been training down 20 years what about 20 years black belt from hens oh oh that's legit man that's seriously legit do you think most people know that you've managed to keep that on the DL a little bit hmm not so much not so much no well I think if you adds the average person the street this guy ritchie a black belt in jujitsu they go no see but does the average man in the street know what black balance you do to is anyway i think they do now more than ever always it's yeah probably more now well that's why when I see a guys experienced as you wearing a tie I go hmm maybe just super confident about no one being able to get to that - Joe I'm not what's going on I'm a ridiculous person that's what's going on I mean you have your own ridiculous ideas about owning suits I have my dear ideas about Jenn talked to death wearing the tie like I said I'll indulge it you fishing navigation I'm honestly I do I really do have an issue with ties okay but it looks wonderful on you thank you very much I mean for real it's very elegant appearance the whole thing from the top to the bottom when did you start training under who where where were you um first of all I did karate for fifteen years I did shotokan karate which I was obsessed with got a second down in that and then ACL went twice on the right leg and I was choked can you remember choke sure and I watched choking that was a it was a revelation because old man was just met holy o le o le o le o o man only I was on the mat 84 in that video I thought well I'm not getting any younger and if I'm going to take up a martial art I love fighting so I'm very happy talked about fighting for a long time yeah um I fancied the idea that I'll because if I stayed with karate I realized I would not be on the mat at 84 so and back then there was no jiu-jitsu in London there was judo and they had what was called Nawaz er which is the ground game and they're pretty tasty we got some good judo players um so I went from Crotty to judo but I was only interested in the ground game and then Roger Gracie came to live in the UK about 20 years ago and Roger Gracie went on to become the world champion eight times and I started taking lessons with him and his dad Mauricio then I ended up in New York for I think we lived in lived in New York for a while Mike's wife and I went to hens own gym when it was a bother methadone clinic hmm and I fell in love with hens oh and I fell in love with jiu-jitsu in a serious way and I became obsessed with it for a number of years hens they gave me on my belt I mean I should have got blackbelt ting well I say it should have got a black belt I was I was I became lazy to a degree so I got a black belt and I should have got a black belt and his you and I know there's some tasty blue belts out there can have a lot of fun with me but I saw drifted a bit came in an hour sustained a few injuries but if I was training hard I think you train hard you get black belt five years gone you you got to be obsessed yeah but the five years kids are there yeah you can I mean I was a brown belt for eight years so we talk together and I know that I'm the same as you I was bringing over eight years I think it's uh if you're a real fanatic you could get it in five years but it's super rare like BJ Penn got in three it's almost unheard of there's a few people that have done that yeah there's some guys in our gym in London in Rogers place that they're there five days a week three hours a day they mean it and within six months their proper pain in the ass yeah yeah well once you become obsessed with the movements and you start studying the various positions and the possibilities it becomes a part of your life becomes a part of your almost like your your operating system and as you see these guys reinforce that operating system you see their their gain becoming more and more complex and be able to chain attack after attack and being able to anticipate the defenses of those attacks and plan two and three steps ahead you see all this play out it's anime I really really enjoy watching someone go from being a beginning student to being a killer it's a fascinating process because you're literally watching someone develop their comprehension of a language of fighting and that language of fighting is analogous to life it helps them in every single aspect of their life because it's one of the most difficult things that a person will do in their day and you walk into a jujitsu school you're you park your car you live in this normal realm of normal people with normal problems and hills and stresses and issues but once you go into that thing you put on that ghee or no gear whatever you're doing and you go into that class once you engage in these sparring sessions these sparring sessions with skilled practitioners you're doing one of the most difficult things any person within a hundred mile radius of you that's not fighting for their life is doing and by doing that on a regular basis and constantly reinforcing this language it enhances that all your possibilities and your potential possibilities as a person very eloquent a comic couldn't agree with you more one of the great things I found about jiu-jitsu is whenever I came to a city we just tap into a computer where the next gym was and we roll down now usually I'm usually with two or three people I've and out there he's also a black belt um I got a chat that I was with called Bobby the tits who was an MP judo player back in you should see the chefs on this gays at least that's wise by with the del visitest so a cross between Ivan a terrible and Bobby the tits we used to hit these gyms and every one there's a complete substructure there if you want to be looked after they'll give you a gaff ello mate as it going in there's the Brotherhood I suppose it's probably the same for people to go to church I don't know but there is blood Brotherhood that I found amongst fighters what everyone's like game and friendly come around at the barbecue do what and everyone's there's a whole substructure there that everyone will look after everyone else and I've never in the 20 years of fighting different gyms have I lost my temper or I had a reason to lose my temper right has anyone ever been a bully you've got people a bit clumsy got bit carried away but there's such a system of Accountancy bright that you can't get away we've been a bully because there's always a bigger bully and you know you're gonna get found out and I like that aspect of it everyone gets found out yeah especially over time right I mean if you're training consistently with really difficult training partners your character is going to be tested there's just no where it's like there's no way around it and sometimes I end up training quite a lot at home right I've got five six mates to come around there it's not the same as going to a new gym with new players right and you've got to get out there I know a few rich guys that have got trainers and they're not bad players you know the Train is good and the fighters are good but because they don't get outside of their comfort zone and go to a feral gym yeah a gym on the street there that it's very hard for them to really evolve right you gotta keep putting yourself in an uncomfortable spot in uncomfortable gyms and like as you said when you do that though you do see that kind of the same thing over and over again the same type of human you know you'll just see them in London or you see them in New York or in Los Angeles you see that same type of human it's the it's the great thing about a sport in general but let's be specific because it's something that you and I can relate to is there are no barriers in jiu-jitsu no one's looking at you right poor you're black you're white it's completely irrelevant you come to the mat and if you get on with the games you fight you get on with the keys that you're fighting yeah and there's a complete clarity of vision when you're fighting some it's just you're fighting them and you rate them on their ability of how they find ya and you carry that social hierarchy liquid that what what's important in that school is that it is like who is proficient who's very good that is that is that's the best currency yet the ultimate currency yeah right yeah it's yeah I had a name when I used to train out here or in New York that they used to call me Hollywood because I was like the only celebrity person that you'd come in South only would you find a little roll around it's nothing but that you know a couple of people initially whoa you're that keys are in there yeah that lasted all of 30 seconds right yeah and then everything gets what I can you have no currency on the mat other than your currency on the mat right there's a wonderful clarity in that yeah for a guy like you or any to any big-time celebrity that's probably one of the only few places where you really truly experience that like there is no bullshit in that role like in someone's going after you and you're going after them it's a hundred percent it is what it is there's there's all the bullshit veil of society has been removed yeah I mean our money the water event now so harking back to what we were talking about previously I'm err that you become less adventurous as your ego grows in jujitsu right particularly for the guy that doesn't tap if your doesn't tap you don't ever want to be the guy that doesn't tap and you hunker up and you become a boring fighter mm and it's an issue you know those guys is a couple of guys that I can think of one in particular that if you get the better of him and by and large is better fighter than me but all of a sudden he realizes in trouble just before I'm about the tapping because ah stop there what a guy if you just moved a little bit towards instruction those guys are it that's their alibi to get out them losing face so what faces it they're losing it's the crutch that they actually think that being a jujitsu player has an identity in itself and it doesn't mmm you cannot use it as a crutch and it's the essence of all martial arts martial arts was about find yourself within that framework and be honest about it and you meet the opponent and is your man Conor will tell ya your finding it's about you fighting you in the ring what your other part of the mind the other bottom line that we were talking about wants to say is about your reputation in the gym and what people think of use here again you're trying to find an identity from outside of yourself by not tapping and you know that feeling and by the way I suffer it myself because I don't like to tap either but it makes my game it inhibits my game it stops me being creative yeah marcelo garcia has always been very adamant about that that you have to open up your game in the gym and it's the only way to really truly progress and don't worry about being tapped and don't have that ego there's a great video of him and Demian Maia rolling and they're rolling but they have like they're putting almost no like kinetic strength no explosive energy nothing no nothing athletic they're just going through the movements and exchanging positions and they're tapping each other left and right and left and right with no ego it's really interesting to watch because you see like Marcelo catch Damien and they roll to a position and Damien taps and then they go through another position and Marcelo does it and it's just it's really fascinating because where they're doing they're truly flowing there's no like real oh here we go right there you can see them do it but like when these guys do it like as they're doing it they're obviously using strength and they're countering with skill but everything is very smooth and controlled and you're looking at two of the very best black belts to ever do it you're looking at Demian Maia who right now is arguably the top contender in the UFC's welterweight division he's going to be fighting Jorge Masvidal next weekend actually which is a really intense fight because mas vittala killer and then marcelo garcia who's probably one of the all-time great strangulation experts has ever walked the face of the planet I mean he's really revolutionized a lot of aspects of the guillotine the rear naked choke and I was in Brazil in são Paulo in 2003 when he burst onto the scene when he choked out Shaolin and to see these two guys rolling together it's really really interesting because this is really kind of how you have to do it you just do it you know there's there's no one is saying I can't tap I can't you know I can't put myself in a bad position they're they're exchanging positions reptilian gets under hooks and these goes for the deep half Marcel's is rolling with it they're just flowing yeah but you need two to tango dude you can't have one with an ego and and who's not going to play the game and bunkers down and screws himself down it makes the whole thing very hard to do it's got a bit you both got to be complicit yep yeah absolutely yeah it's very it's very interesting watching like two really really high level guys like this role or like you know Hydra Gracie and Braulio Estima or something like that England's got a great scene there's so much top level Jiu Jitsu over in England right now yeah it's got some good players yeah it used to be a time just a couple of decades ago where if you wanted to train it was very difficult to find really proficient instruction and grapes for 20 years ago yes impossible I remember because I was first into it when we made snatch which is 18 years ago and that's when haja first came to town and before then it was just you know just no other yeah well I mean you certainly get something out of that but um it seems like the the level of attacking there's some people that have just a one rock-solid attack like Ronda yeah that rock-solid attack with the armbar and she comes from that judo background that's annoying bah oh it's nasty her armbar to this day I believe is one of the best arm bars I have ever seen in MMA not just because she was successful with it but would you watch our transitions you watch how she's able to adjust and change like the cat Zingano fight is a perfect example that cat Zingano just charges out her like a fucking bat out of hell and they have this mad scramble and Ronda realizes a position that she doesn't even utilize but she she understands arm bars so well she knows well I could just throw my hip over this way and kick back here and I'll catch that armbar this is just overall understanding of the position is so high level yeah when someone has a move like that I used to fight a bit with Hickson and pigs and used to that thing where he ties his hands behind his back and you've got to try and do something to him right and you can't do anything to him the the level of sophistication when it's like that he's so him so technical Hickson that it was well I understand about jiu-jitsu is really rather primitive but I'm aware I'm prima t'v I'm aware that my understanding of jiu-jitsu is really quite primitive and then when you see something like that armbar yeah come sneaking out of nowhere always said it's a magnificent thing to behold isn't it yeah yeah that what you're saying is kind of interesting because it was some listen to this and go what how is a black belt primitive like you're not primitive you're an expert but I understand totally is I'm also primitive I know I know what I know like I understand like there's what what Hickson's languages is a series of words that you've never heard before spoken perfectly in the right order with no pauses or ULM's or no filler and the way he flows with it it's just he's got a level proficiency that very few other than Marcelo and Damian I can really appreciate the true beauty of it all because they just don't like I won't I won't see things coming it would be they're too complex as it's completely different yeah yeah but you know enough already good lines on my the other day that someone had enough brains to know that it didn't have any brains so you know enough to know that you're in treacherous and deep waters here yeah otherwise your average geezer that starts starts rolling around with one of these good guys no you know he's alright but all those kids Joe or guy they'll be the same they got the same color belt on it let's have a go with that yeah aids get manhandled now um you said you had your knee fixed you you blue would you blow it ACL you see I've done it twice yeah did you get a cadaver replacement or no hamstring and then patellar hamstring first on patella second the down string blew out right yeah does link plural ah ah yeh eventually gave in I had the first one I was about 21 okay and then the second one was about 31 and it was held together but the OL needs a bit naked do you know about stem cell yeah how are you feeling about straight I I was that close to shoulder surgery and I had some placental stem cells shot into my shoulder and it's amazing and where did you have that done Vegas really yeah there's a guy named dr. Roddy McGee's at the the tip of the spear and comes to the technology that's involved today what was nation had showed him the punch tears just stuff just years and years of abuse my cartilage is gone on the shoulder now my college is gone on the knee and I didn't really know about stem cell about two weeks ago now that's all I'm hearing about yeah well I have a podcast I'll send you and there was myth me and dr. Roddy Magee that we did about a month ago fabulous he's amazing and again he's he's well up-to-date with the latest technology and he's also very conservative in his approach to it but what he's saying is that they are able to regenerate cartilage and meniscus tissue and this is the first time anything has ever come along that actually regenerates these tissue they've been able to trim it and do things to it to mitigate pain but now they can literally regenerate tissue there even injecting it into people's discs now the discs and their spine and they're showing that they can regrow discs tissue yeah but you you've just mailed my three issues disc issue and cartilage yeah that's all my issue is of course meniscus and College and disk what do you got going on with your back but it's got some yes that is the traditional issue with those three see whatever the ankles at the bottom of the bag I'm going to show you something else that you're going to need and you're going to get after we have this conversation I have a machine out back called the reverse hyper and it was created by this mad genius named Lois Simmons and what the reverse hyper is a machine that decompresses your back and also strengthens at the same time it decompresses it on the downswing and then on the upswing it strengthens all those muscles around it but it literally pulls the back apart and the compressed disks which is bad posture load degeneration and you look up at the screen this is this guy's fuckin crazy he's one of the craziest people I've ever interviewed he was hilarious but he's a old-time power lifter has been doing it forever I mean he's got fake shoulders fake knees everything's blown out he has no biceps his biceps are completely severed off of his arm he what was he saying like he was he had his friends are making a maxout bench like five days after his shoulder replacement he's a fucking maniac but they were trying to fuse his discs and so he came up with this machine and you see as it swings down when she's swinging down it's pulling her back apart like go to the the here you go when it's going down it's pulling the back an active decompression and as she's swinging up she's strengthening all those muscles in the spine in a real weird way where you really can't get at them and was that this is the issue ship because you can do the suit superficially I'm strong there but the core underneath the superficial muscles yeah when I had the MRI you could see all the fat in the surrounding mas muscle around the discs and you could see the fat in it and soon as you hit the superficial you went oh that's fine there's nothing wrong with a superficial so it's a need away like this yeah I'm just by one of those man where you have to beast through your superficial muscles to get to your core muscles well it's just it it forces that area of the body to work like you're sustaining a load and you can you lift it up and you hold it in that position and then as you let it go its decompressing and in the decompress side you you you're feeling your muscles relaxed and you get actually feel it pulling like you feel in the lower back in a weird way you feel it kind of pulling and separating and then a couple of seconds later you're strengthening it again and then you're pulling in separated and you're strengthening again and then I have another thing out back that I I bend over from the waist on and it allows my lower back to just completely relax and my upper body pulls down on my lower body and it separates and decompresses the lower spine I mean it's been tremendous a huge huge asset but there's a bunch of things they can do now if you heard of a genican do you know what that is no Regina keen is something that was developed in Germany that a lot of professional athletes like Kobe Bryant ront and Manning they went over there and it's a blood spinning procedure similar to platelet-rich plasma but they take the blood and as theirs they're spinning it they heat it up and when they heat it up the blood has a reaction to the extreme heat like it like it thinks you have a fever so it's produces this very intense anti inflammatory response obviously if you're a scientist or a doctor I'm butchering this but then they take this yellow serum which is this an anti inflammatory response and they can inject it into all these areas that you have massive inflammation like bulging discs and it has a incredible effect had incredible effect for Peyton Manning allowed him to get back to football again I had a bulging disc that was making my hands go numb totally went away through decompression and through this kind of stuff yeah I heard this I did 10 years to Kobe's career and I think yeah that's what he said thanks yeah you know I didn't up until I'm 48 how are you jack 49 almost 50 no so I didn't think about any of these things until this year so I accepted an ACL as a bit of a nuisance except I've got a bit of creaky back but in the last month I went to my something happened to my knee and I went to the doctor a little x-ray and he went well could operate for the 10th time I've had an operation on that knee but you're better off now waiting waiting for what till I give you a new one okay now so he's talking about a replacement so he's talking about replacement now he's saying to just hold on right so you said in 15 years from now or whatever it is but it all changed and then a month after I went had the shoulder x-rayed and he looked at it went well could operate that and I knew where we were going here mmm you're better off wait until I give you a new one arm now that geezer where they're not talking about fix if they talk about giving me new ones right now I hadn't so you know Ivan out there it knows exactly what you're talking about to me the world he wasn't a vessel to receive this information now in the last month I am ready to receive this information so in the next three months I will know of what you talk about I immediately am going to connect you with dr. Riding McGee's soon as we get off the phone or off the podcast here I'm gonna connect you with him and the hill he'll be able to keep you abreast of all the stuff and it changes constantly like when I first went I first got a shot in July of last year and I was that close to surgery I was trying to figure okay I was planning my time I was saying okay if I get the surgery I essentially can't use this arm for at least a few weeks and it's going to be pretty weak for at least three months and I was really accepting that and he said well let's just give this a shot and within a couple of weeks of getting the shot I was like goddamn this thing's feels better than it's ever felt before and so through a series of exercises like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening exercises and bottoms up kettlebells like where you have to stabilize the kettlebells ones those are those those are fantastic for stabilization muscles and then it muscle made me realize that if you're going to do something along the lines of jiu-jitsu something it's very physically demanding you have to strengthen your machine I can't you can't just keep going to jiu-jitsu which is what I was doing for years yeah me too that was my exercise I don't think that's adequate I think you have to strengthen the machine and I think Yoga is also a really big impart important part of strengthening that machine because it's lengthening its decompressing the spine and it's making you strong in these static positions which is very similar to the load that's going to be pushed on those joints and on your back when you're doing jujitsu I tried yoga for a year tried everyday because usually I can get into anything at some point or another you've got to keep throwing enough hours at it the one thing I can get into couldn't do it my approach was wrong I was doing a snuggler my ex-wife and it was incredibly painful incredibly challenging but what I like about a fight is the competitive element of it yes I come but there's my enemy I can have a roll around with my enemy there's a tap as winners a loser and for some reason that keeps me motivated the idea I mean in essence I imagine it's the what I was talking about in the end itself against self yes with yoga I just haven't made it that far to access that struggle and enjoy it I feel like I'm always running on fumes with yoga yeah where you're going to run on fumes but it's it's building a house one layer of paint at a time I mean it's it's not a it's not an easy thing to do and I think that competitive element that you're talking about is an internal struggle and that internal struggle is you and your breath keeping your breath and calm and check and focusing entirely on your breath while managing the positions and then slowly but surely developing more proficiency in those positions more range of motion more dexterity keep going over and over again and then you one day you get to a point for me it was like maybe an a year and a half into doing it pretty regularly while I'm like okay now I can finally hold this position for 30 seconds or as before I literally count to ten and just try to get to ten and then I'd fall down and then I get back up and try again try to get to ten try to get down my feet would buckle my knee wouldn't be locked out and then I'd try again but once you develop a certain amount of proficiency then you can concentrate entirely on the breath and that's where the real struggle is and then keeping the mind on track not thinking about other bullshit not think about the gist of the struggle of life and all the different variables that you have to deal with on a daily basis thinking only of the breath the posture and the breath very difficult to keep on track so that in Varian that's the competitive struggle it's in your own mind see a consistency with a theme though that theme is this that that's all there is is the outside world and the noise and what comes with that and there's the internal self but everything is everything is subject to these rules yeah and yoga in this sense is no different jiu-jitsu is no different narrative is no different it's being aware of what the dynamic is it's being aware of what's actually going on that I think is fundamental yes yes and pattern recognition recognizing that it's the same for yoga it is for the essence of a narrative absolutely yeah and those things become a vehicle for developing your human potential whether it's yoga or whether it's jiu-jitsu and I think pattern recognition it's they take place in both things in yoga you go okay I've been here before I know where this is I know I know what to do and you go right back into that thing of concentrating on controlling the breath these big long deep breaths and these big long exhales and then though the focus is entirely on the breath and those patterns they come up in jiu-jitsu as well I mean that that ability to maintain breath mean I'm sure you recognize that in a person who just starts like one of the things you see about someone who's just started even if they're athletic they don't know what they're doing they start hyperventilating they don't know what to do they start breathing weird and they the breath is like the first thing that you lose control over and Hickson from the movie choke I mean that was the big thing that separated Hickson from all the other Jitsu players is yoga yeah his yoga he made yoga sexy yeah yeah he did well he was the first guy to make it appealing at all to martial artists and we know is with your wife did that's what your mom does it's what the Housewives do it's not something that a man does especially not the top jujitsu killer ever it was a seminal it was a seminal documentary that yeah it changed a lot of people's lives and it sort of turned Hickson into a rock star oh yeah yeah yeah I've had in Minh here he's a he's an amazing guy to talk to I've had him I've talked to him several times but having him in here and sitting down with him and talking to him about jujitsu it's like it's like the it's like sitting down with Michelangelo and talking about art I mean you're talking about in did this there's masters and then there's the master of the Masters and if you talk to any jujitsu master they all just go Hicks is the number one like there's no dispute which is amazing there's there's very few like there's soccer players that are just elite and there's basketball players that are elite but when it comes to like who's the best in jiu-jitsu there was always this one guy and while he was competitive and especially while he was young it was always Hickson which is to me amazing that he was able to maintain and I think one of the things about him was his physicality and his mind I think those two things in many ways were enhanced by yoga I think he's got some disk issues now that isn't it has a quite a few here's quite a few yeah I think he has eight bulging discs which is horrific maybe you should send him to your man oh I'm going to 100% I mean I've talked to Hicks about a bunch of things Hickson knows a bit reluctant for certain kinds of treatment you know I mean he's he's just gonna eat mangoes and fucking meditate and shit I don't know I don't know what he's a what he's a what he's tried or what he's willing to try but I would love to see him I mean I would love to see him rolling again I mean it would it be amazing if they could regenerate this tissue to the point where he would be healthy I mean that's the fear the fear for the first time for me is that I've never felt any version of age on the mat when people are starting to tell me oh we're not gonna fix it we're gonna wait until we give you a new one okay no doughnuts I love this mate and when they're saying that about your knee was the issues at a meniscus issue um it is a meniscus issue but I've lost 75% of the meniscus of the cartilage oh I get confused between two different cartilage a meniscus what is the different cartilage is what covers the outside of the bone meniscus is the padding essentially that's in between the two bones that keeps them from touching each other right okay so they have both so it goes bone meniscus no bone cartilage cartilage - yes right yeah and the meniscus you can cut some of it out but when you didn't I've had that done um mine left knee they they did a you know they go in arthroscopically and they trim some of the torn meniscus yeah it's it's it works but it's less stable there's less tissue in there it's more subject to in nation and swelling it doesn't handle the load as well but I got stem-cell shot into there and I've never had a problem since it's amazing I had a problem with it for I mean I tore it for the first time more than 20 years ago and had an operation I think in 95 somewhere around there and then I had another operation on it in 2001-2002 and it was it's always been an issue since then it's just one of those things that he gets sore I just deal with it whether it's kickboxing or whether it's lifting weights or whether it's jiu-jitsu it gets sore I just deal with it I you know take glucosamine and chondroitin and a lot of fish oil and anti-inflammatories and changing my diet helped quite a bit but it was always that thing until they shot the stem cells in there and then literally within a few months it's non-existent like I don't think I have this knee that acts up anymore now I have a knee that never acts out it just doesn't bother me anymore this is very exciting stuff it's very exciting stuff and tell me how thin on the wedge are we in terms of this being you well they've been doing it and experimenting with it for a couple of decades apparently according to doctor McGee but the understanding of the potentials and the possibilities and then the practical application is over the last ten years has really come to the forefront it's really become something very very viable it's not just theoretical anymore now they're actually seeing people regenerating tissue they're seeing people where you have a tear and like your shoulder something like that and they're going probably gonna have to get surgery no then they shoot it in there and then next thing you know it a couple months later I mean I still got some floating tissue that like pops and crunches and stuff in my shoulder but when it comes to like the actual strength in my shoulder I don't worry about it at all like it doesn't bother me I mean there's there's occasionally some slight soreness but as far as like the functional strength of the shoulder it's like 100% it's crazy so is this the thin end of the wedge then so is this good a is this going to turn into one of those exponential yes it is oh for sure for sure they're already generating they built this woman this is very exciting stuff exciting it's as exciting as it gets yeah the regenerating tissue the regenerating body parts they built this woman a bladder she had a big took skin cells stem cells from her skin and they with a pea in a petri dish they started this off and then built her a but she had bladder cancer and they built her a bladder and then put it in her body and it's functional it's amazing I mean this is all state-of-the-art now and when we're looking at like 10 20 30 years from now I mean you're looking at potentially regenerating all sorts of things regenerating bone for people have bone cancer regenerating lungs and liver and spleen and heart I mean they're going to be able to make body parts they've created an artificial heart that beats like with stem cells they've actually constructed a human heart this is a subject you know something about fascinated by it fascinated by it because what what they're able to do now is just uh you know you're just looking into the future you get a window into this and it seems like it's exponentially exploding I mean all over the world is people experimenting with this stuff and trying to figure out new ways to improve things with just the fact I'm having the conversation and this isn't the first conversation I've had in the last month about this yeah it's part design cos no oh it is now people are understanding it and people know people that have had issues with it you can't get it in America but in in Mexico I know people that go over there and get it done intravenously and you know bas Rutten you know Basra yes bas Rutten the way he discrete Abbas this big character he's like it was like I had energy coming off my fingertips it bosses had some pretty significant problems he's got fused disks in his neck and he had major atrophy in his arm because his disk was you know compressed and they it was pushing on the nerves and so the nerves weren't getting it wasn't they weren't firing correctly so his right arm he called baby arm cuz right arm is kind of shrunk and so he's experimenting with a lot of these things he's kind of been ahead of the curve with this stuff you should get Jason Statham in it I love to you look like you fell out the same tree right yeah it's very similar yeah he's got a couple of tweaks here and there I met him he's a nice guy he had a bunch of stuff going on with his body too I'm sure he's in better condition now he would use to be an Olympic diver used to die for England you know one of those divers right um fabulous athlete and he takes care of himself I believe it he's good Nick but you know he's got tweaks got the old knee that just never quite goes away nothing he does as much and by the way get him on diet and he's off to the races you can't shut him up mmm she's got you know leave him there for three hours come back kind of cut the beers come back he's still banging on about it it's something that he cares profoundly but I can tell you know he was sitting here now there'll be a battle about you you couldn't who was good to say what to who because you talk over one another um you should game in either you relate to a bear list yeah no I'm sure do you watch your diet are you a healthy eater not as healthy as I'd like to be I go up and down I play I oscillate with 30 pounds of extra nonsense sir at the time yeah I'm now I'm weighing 190 now I should weigh about 192 actually today and I should be creeping around a good fighting way about 178 so what is it is it a booze thing that's a boost it's not the booze the booze isn't the issue in terms of the calories itself the booze is the window to the calories itself the pizza Peter I'm not a pizza man but I do love a pub a pub I do love a pub and I like a pack of crisps you don't really have Packer corn chips over here yeah quite the same thing tonight they're not quelle no an English an English crisp is a heavyweight chip and they work particularly well in pubs so it's two parts of Guinness and a cutlet packs crisps and you've belted in a thousand calories as complete nonsense in all of about 22 minutes all right um the salt 2 is very appealing where you're drinking a cold I don't think just work answers each other by didn't take long before there's a heavy price tag that comes with that I train a lot I reckon I train weights three times a week and fighting but another three times a week I love training but I like a pub and it's trying to somehow reconcile that and every now and then I bagged myself a stay at the pub stay off the booze for three months and I think and I get myself down at 178 however it's been five six years since I've been there now I just dropped eight pounds the other day strictly I was strict with myself off the booze because I'm off the booze I don't look at food in the same way the thing that the whole purpose of booze is to relax trouble is what also relaxes the rules right right now when you're you're dealing with all these injuries how are you able to train through other stuff if you've got a shoulder they're thinking one day might need to be replaced the knees that might need to be I just cracked on crack on yeah I found that and I'm sure you've had the same through jujitsu whenever I get an injury I find if you start mincing around with it and paying too much attention to it it can dog on for longer nine ten my injuries I just trained through and there's almost a bluffing game that you have with the injury who's in charge here me or the injury and once the injury noses there you mean it tends to moonwalk out the door but there are more fundamental ones like the shoulder and the knee the necks and well so they actually thinks been give me a bit of aggro recently um so there are a few things that you need to take quite seriously I can see you're on to this Joe I can see you're focused on this yeah yeah I know a lot about this stuff yeah bit you invested yes right and you need to be invested if you mean it its ownership again your investment is ownership well my good friend Eddie Bravo just said his disc replaced he had it replaced with a titanium articulating lower back disc so he had some pretty significant disc decompression or compression issues in deterioration and it got to the point where his lower back was just constantly inflamed you know Eddie's world class black belt yeah he's couldn't go anymore why didn't you send him to your man well it was before they were actually shooting it into the disc he had it done about a year ago wrong about a year bo8 nine months ago someone said this does make me wonder whether you just hang on yeah but I would say with stem cells with a lot of things hang on with some things you can't hang on like ACL tears once the tear once the the ligament is removed uses nothing you can do you have to replace a terrible thing yeah the ACL and it's such a common injury but you know what's interesting is once you get it replaced like for me I had a patellar tendon graft and a left knee and then a cadaver graft on the right knee all right and you know you've said all sorts of things done that I've done it all no I then but neither one of them bother me at all anymore and they're stronger like the the when they do a cadaver graph they use the Achilles tendon which is a hundred fifty plus percent stronger than your original ACL so it actually makes it a stronger joint all right mine's not yeah well the patellar tendon graft is still stronger that when they use a patellar tendon graft it is still strong and your patellar tendon is a very huge tendon and you can like you can operate with a third of it missing which is essentially with the cut Allen a I've note if my right leg which has had the two ACLs I'll notice it's atrophied and there's very little I can do to beef up that quad that's probably because you're favoring your left side oh yeah but then you know I isolate it and I'll beast the thing but I just can't engage it I can't get a flat leg like a can on my left leg get it completely flat you mean they extended it so it bends yes so you can engage all your cords oh that's gotta get some stem cells in that bad boy it's very exciting so yeah it's it's the real deal I mean it's something special just thirty years I've been living with this yeah they could fix you up they can fix you up but diet is huge one of the things about diet is inflammation and I never really wrapped that in my head in to see about three or four years ago I had a pretty significant back injury then just like oh say in my hands were numb and it was because I was ignoring it because I would pinch it in jujitsu and then I was still gonna roll light of schooling their roll light and then after a while it was getting bad to the point my back was locking up that my hand started going numb and I get this pretty significant elbow pain so I started really researching all the options and what's really going on and one of the big ones that I found was diet that when you have too many inflammation causing foods in your diet eating too much sugar and bread and booze all these different things that affects it affects like how your body carries fat but it also affects where your body holds on to inflammation and joints in particular all the injury spots where way sore when I had a shitty die so give me given the evils um let's let Hamilton calls them the three white devils sugar bread what's the other one yeah what is the ailment booze no it's kind of white foam on beers wait what is it you should know what the three white flour pasta sugar I don't know what is the other one dairy I guess berry there yeah I like cheese though so do not drink alcohol yeah I do yeah we'll just try not to drink too much I mean it's like all things in moderation but in moderation yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm not a big drinker I don't like I'm not tricking every night but if I go out you know and I have a drink or have a glass of wine with dinner or a couple glasses I'm cool I think it's just a matter of just controlling your smell good I mean yeah that's really the thing so the three white devils you do you subscribe to three white devils I occasionally will allow myself to dance with the devil but with all three of them yeah with a little bit of sugar a little bit like last night I had some linguini with clams I don't I go on an 80/20 which means 80% of my nights very clean and then 20% I'll fuck off like whether it's Saturday or Friday or whatever how'd you feel about rule milk I'm pasteurized love I love raw milk very exciting anyway taste I'm opening a little raw milk dairy are you really I am I'm having I'm very interested in this whole thing um it's more from a culinary point of view than I am from a nutritional point of view however I suspect I suspect that there's a sweet spot here um opening a brewery I love a beer you're opening a brewery a brewery yeah which how much do you know about making beer yeah quite a lot actually have you been doing it on your own I've done all that sort of asking around underneath the stairs routine for years um which is great fun I like any sort of form of caveman chemistry mm-hmm Francis Melman you know for this big fan of that sort of thing I'm bit of a caveman when it comes to anything to do with food so I do like a nice steak outside right I take my if I say so myself I'm good on a barbecue and I've been I've been doing that barbecuing for 20 years good on a slow cook take that all quite seriously um but so yeah only brewery beer and then one I'm at it I'm opening a butcher's of baker's or candlestick makers - it's got a small hotel place in in England 1,500 acres farm got all that sort of nonsense going on so we're going to do farm-to-table the whole deal I'm a beer yeah raise your own animals serve them yeah the whole thing on my lines gene not into gene Ashley shin yeah I mean jeans traditionally an English drink but I wasn't really into it till I came to America and I found since I've been here in the last when last week it's been quite a few gin and tonics going on yeah and gene apparently is the easiest of the spirits that makes al my own little swing on that - I'm good friends with Maynard Keenan the lead singer of tool and he went essentially for four years just went and developed his own vineyard where is he Arizona I Ryan yeah and did not in a place in Arizona that's known for growing wine so he had I manipulate the soil and I bake seven a lovely time oh he loves it yeah it's probably an expensive lovely time there wasn't it I'm sure he's making money with it now but he's he's a like a legitimate genius and he's one of those guys that lit he cannot be stagnant it's not even an option I mean his mind works a thousand miles an hour and you when you're talking him you just kind of kind of jump on the train and hang on there with him as long as you can jump off and go poof but he's just a very very very intense guy and his his particular brand of intellectual curiosity led him to start experimenting with one his wine is absolutely fantastic and he's a legitimate wine expert like you sit here and talk to him the same way you and I can talk about buchecha or you know Roger Gracie or hens oh he can talk to you about wine he's also a purple belt in jujitsu too so he could talk to that as well he's an intense guy I like the sound of this the one business do fine interesting okay there's something happening with a whole craft movement yes general that's very exciting that we are going back to local stuff and people have been to a degree its ownership again yes it's take ownership of your food to take ownership of everything to do with important components of your life and it got robbed from us yeah you know what happened in the 70s in the UK is all these breweries bought up all the pubs and they brought up all these small breweries and used to have all these breweries with their own little crafty beer going on and then they homogenized it and then it sort of back to us they gave it back to us without character we just bought it because we were stupid right yeah and then what's happening is is we realise that character is important and local character is important and ownership is important so there's this movement and to a degree things like Instagram may have a dark side but also as a light side it's given a voice to the craft movement yes I like a man that makes his own knives and yeah and followed any of that stuff yes I got water handmade knives all the time I mean that's what I used to like cut my food like they feel good I like it's a completely different experience that's exactly the same thing we order a lot of our made knives and when you're cutting your food with a handmade knife it's not what it used to be you realize a knife should be a thing yeah and it got robbed from us do you know Steve Kramer is a number of days a guy who makes knives with meteorites yes I do know I've seen it there's a little thing with Anthony Bourdain yeah yeah see now City Bull dynein it takes a chunk of time and it came from space it's fabulous yeah it's amazing yeah I actually got a feeling that might have been the genesis of my interest in knives with that aunty Bourdain thing there's a guy my mouthy fire arts find that on Instagram but he just made me this Damascus steel cutting knife and on a hunting knife to go with it and it's just I mean I cut with it but it's just I stare at it for minutes before I cut with it I look at the blade and the handles made out of thousand-year-old bog wood like wood that was like preserved a bog like bog maple it's amazing this is amazing but why is it so interesting but the fountain oh this is interesting like look at the pattern in the in the steel this is Damascus steel if you go to his Instagram there's a picture of my knife in there you could see it this guy is I mean that's it right there the far-right fard those two those are the two knives that he made for me oh that's a sexy bit kick oh we thought we'd look at those ancient bog oak that's what it is was it was the book from oh is it an American bug I don't know I'll have to ask him I just took his word for it but look at that thing that's lovely that's what I used to cut up garlic all sold s Calabar we made at Damascus scale ah man really yeah I mean to abandon Mascis stuff did you have a blade Smith fashioned for your movie uh yeah Wow so you had it specifically made for the movie yeah poor ol Charlie Hunnam who plays gang off there is he's been waiting to receive this sword how much is it way I mean this motherfucker had to get in shape for that thing right yeah always in good Nick like you ever do those uh like cash yield casts with a steel club you realize how difficult it is yeah to manipulate even a 15 pound Club yeah but a hard look very hard work cliff those guys like sword fighters must have had intense shoulder strength and core strength yeah but they think these guys are in the UK they every now and then they stumble across a body that's a thousand five hundred years old and they realized the deformity in the shoulders from all of the right whatever you call that when you pull a bow back yeah and they used to be an English law that every Englishman had to practice for eight hours a week to pull back a bow so you've got these skeletons that are deformed from the enormous strength of the soldiers these on the shoulders a foreign household like what is the issue with it it was the shear yeah like I show you know long about this than me but the they had become deformed through the development of the muscle which in some way then changed the the bone structure structure yeah Wow what these massive great right arms there's I don't know if you know the UK you know in this country do this the finger it is the single finger right a new case two fingers right but why is that for bows and arrows right it comes from the English wars and the French wars and the Englishmen were famous for their long bows and famous Battle of Agincourt there was a couple hundred of us and there was ten thousand of them and they're little they are they had crossbows back then and we had this the longbow the longbow was the machine gun yeah in the bow and arrow world and because the Brits that's what they did they were eight hours a week every Englishman had to do that that they were pretty lethal with these things anyway they annihilated the entire French army there was this kind of famous battle the French conveniently forgotten so what the French did thereafter if they ever call an Englishman was they chopped off two of his fingers things about the bow so whenever as as history then made eloquent is that whenever you saw a Frenchman used to wave the two fingers up at him ah and then since then it's now just become you know they are ubiquitous fuck off sign have you seen the way the Mongols did it the Mongols they have these incredibly powerful recurve bows it would take 160 pounds to pull back and they use their thumb they would ever a thumb ring made out of bone have you seen that no I haven't I do laughs singular they third there's a fantastic audio documentary on the history of the Mongols the wrath of the Khan with Dan Carlin yeah listen to that yeah it's amazing yeah Ivan there was a bit of a fan of yours that he keeps me up to date on different things that you're interested in that he's interested in the same things I didn't know about the knives and there's a couple of other things I didn't know that you knew about but he's a big fan he got me onto this see those things but I think he got onto this because you got him on top I'm sure once you hear Dan Carlin I mean it is absolutely addictive but this is the ring that they would put on their thumb and they would pull back like that and then they would wrap their index finger over the thing where the the thumb nail is and then pull it back that way and then release that's how they would release their arrows well it didn't get very far did it well it did for a long time until Genghis Khan died I mean they killed 10% of the population they kill I mean I was kidding all right Joe Quran they killed so many people they changed the carbon footprint of earth there was a New York Times article about how many people died Durin's Genghis Khan's reign that it was so significant you could see it in the carbon data you're kidding no no I'm not kidding see if you can pull that article they killed between 50 and 70 million people during his lifetime were directly attributed to his army and his decisions 50 to 70 million people died the conservative estimate is somewhere around 30 the liberal estimate is somewhere around 70 nobody really knows what they think it's between due to that Mongol invasion in 1200 altered carbon dioxide levels it killed so many fucking people this is a change on earth where there's probably only a million people kicking around on I don't know how many people there were I thought there was a lot more than a million because they killed a million people in Ching China they killed they killed people in numbers that we can even in djenne I think it was Jenna they showed up and this is part of the Dan Carlin series the the shut the quiz me ins Shah sent like an envoy like a party to go search this city in China and as they pulled up they thought what they saw in the distance was a snow-covered mountain as they got closer they realized it was a stack of bones and the roads were so deteriorated from human bodies just rotting human bodies they had abandoned the roads because they couldn't get their cars through there were their wheels rather through because their wheels were getting bogged down their horses were getting bogged down in the muck of deteriorating bodies that so many people the Mongols killed what the fuck I was it just the desire for Empire it's a real good question first of all is the dehumanization of the enemy I mean his idea was that everybody who doesn't live in a tent anybody doesn't live the way they do these fools that live in cities they weren't even human they were sheep like there was a certain disconnect between them and the other which is imperative it's the most important thing in war you have to decide that that person is not you right if decide that they're the other whether it's the Vietnamese or the German the Nazis the Japanese like whatever it is you have to decide that they're less than you and they had this thing about people that did not live like they did that they were pussies these these weak people that lived in these cities with their walls and so they would just find find these cities they'd stroll up and they would just figure out a way to start attacking them they would light bodies on fire and launch them with catapults onto the roofs of these buildings but what was the what was the motivation it was just conquering just conquering I mean they just wanted to expand their empire and take over I mean it's not there's no noble pursuit in there there's no religious pursuit either I mean it's a it was expansion yeah well they just wanted to own it all they they felt like everyone they encountered was subject to their rule and they had they had to establish that it's a very very intense series now remember I remember I going to about five years ago and I remember the bone thing probably the bone thing in King Arthur I've got mountains of bones oh nice no but I do remember some of that look how things drift this is a legitimate samurai sword from the 1500s really yeah that's a real one well that's quite sexy time it was this sharkskin going on up here I don't know I mean I think that the the case is probably a modern case but that blade itself that is uh that as it blade from somewhere around fifteen eleven they think how'd you get your hands on this it was a gift really from my business associate Aubrey Marcus a good buddy of mine and we're in business had on it together and he gave me this that's quite a thing yeah it's quite a thing that's a real thing there's not one of these blades that once you take out these draw blood is it no no no it's frankly we got this military unit in the UK called the Gurkhas that come from the poor that's been in condition for a couple of hundred years they have these funny little knives with hooks on yeah they're weird nice weird knives and once they draw them once they're out of the sheath that can they're not allowed to put back into there's got blood on them so they have to cut themselves with nothing tell anybody Jesus Christ there's like a weird excuse to cut yourself yeah I mean doesn't that that's like a pretty rigid requirement don't draw it once you're gonna draw blood what can I tell you yeah being a soul just tough stuff it is as tough as it gets yeah now that's a something about your your film I'm sure is you're dealing with a different time and that life back then although always precious the the finite aspect of life is more solidified it's more obvious it's more something you're dealing with on a daily basis as opposed to the way we live yeah I think there's all sorts of advantages to that if you're looking down the barrel of a gun nothing Sobers you up quite a lot looking down the barrel of a gun and we've managed to distract ourselves by the comfortable liberal lives that we lead and that the price for that is that we don't really accept the full accountancy of life so we do give ourselves crutches well you look down the barrel of a gun all your crutches are taken away mmm so I suppose in different periods of time you didn't have to you didn't have the indulgence of being able to worry about what people thought of you because there were more important things to worry about yeah yeah there were more important things to worry about than social media you had to worry about arrows swords death yeah instant but the thing is that even come back to the Mongols so what was his desire for gain his desire for gaining with the more people appreciate and respect me than the more I'll be is there anything else that kills people other than that motivation not like that well not even like that I'm just talking about murder and the whole genesis of murder is based on the principle that someone has more power than me so I have to take that power away or my comparative sense of self feels augmented if I can take their life away hmm what comes back to the same thing you're really asking someone to tell you who you are and if you paradoxically and ironically if you kill them that makes you more powerful than them although they can no longer bear witness or they did bear witness for a second but what does bear witness is the story in your mind that somehow you are now more powerful or you just fucking hate them you don't want them around anymore but why do you hate them because they're threatening yes the threatening to some way is threatening in some way that somehow they can diminish your idea of who you are or you find them repugnant their actions repugnant dangerous to their society something then it's not murder then right it's just eliminating an enemy right or eliminating a threat yeah if you could go back I mean I've often thought about this as technology evolves like will there be a will there come a point in time where you could have a window to a certain era like will will time machines ever be a thing where there's a time where you could actually go back and view the past like is there a period yes your period that you really quite a lot because of Google Earth on one of those I like a good porn on Google Earth so where I live in will Champa got a house and English countries are next door to Stonehenge you go on Google Earth where they play out the fields you can see where there have been burial sites for thousands of years Yeah right good Stonehenge is about five and a half thousand years old but all around that area in these plow fields you can see they've still got Mariel bounds and a burial mounds and whatnot and the whole earth is littered with pre historical earthworks and burial sites and there are burial sites that we have this thing called Ordnance Survey which registers I mean but you'll have the same thing here which registers everything on the earth right so everything of any historical value doesn't map and they tell you where the footpaths are and the roads are and everything is highly detailed how high the mountains are and the roads and whatnot and I'm a bit of a anorak for that you know the expression anime no it's like a geek okay you know those guys that watch trains and planes and row they usually wear those jackets called an ER accent that's where they go Russian comes from so I'm a bit of an anorak for typography the history of typography so you go on Google Earth this was a bit of a wet dream as far as I was concerned because I could spend hours and hours poring over landscape and around my house you can find these all these burial sites that no one knows existed and there's only since Google Earth existed I'm confident that still I'm the only person that those these burial these burial sites exist so how do you know they're burial sites like what are you seeing because you don't you can build up a an understanding of pattern recognition again and you can see an established burial site which is seen as a prehistoric burial site Bronze Age or whatever it is and then you step a mile to the right and then you can find one under a plowed field where they've got rid of the mounds but you can still see the depressions which is in exactly the same shape as the depressions a mile to the right and then you can build up a whole pattern so you know this is the area where you get crop circles yeah so and then you can build up a whole picture which is a much bigger picture and then you can start to predict where one burial site is going to be and it's bit like finding treasure and you get all 200 thousand yards that direction 200 yards and it should be about a bang there it is you can see half of these depressions and then it runs into a wood or whatever it is but this staff that exists and you wouldn't have known before Google Earth came along how much work is being done on like trying to study those things well the thing is it I'm Joe quite a lot but the thing is is prehistorical so they're really the only thing that is there is arrowheads right right and burial mountain every now and then they dig one up and then they find a boat buried with a lot of golden yeah that happens every now and then but there isn't much evidence that it was left behind so you know most of these things are just a mound of earth with few bones it but it's kind of crazy because that's an area where people have been living for thousands of years it's not like people went away and then came back and now you're trying to like people consistently lived in that area like and then you see things like that horse that stone horse in the in the countryside yeah the choke horse yeah like with a big man with a big Willy - who's made actual casinos man that chalk you could look him up he's a man with the big white Willy and all in that area that you have these different emblems of what represented tribes or whatever so we now live in the UK which is the United Kingdom but there is a legacy there I mean you'll have the same here there is a legacy there that you can you can trace back step by step for thousands of years and we get my nut around the Romans right that was a couple of thousand years ago and the Romans been kicking around the UK a couple of thousand years then they went and then in cane the Saxons and then after the Saxons then the French came in and then the French basically took over the UK in 1066 and then you have the culture that we have now but you can see you somehow you forget that it goes that your culture goes on for thousands of years and you accept really what we see is history is the last six thousand years or five thousand years but when you can have a connection to it and goes back further than that it's hard to get you're not around the Romans never mind the Bronze Age yeah and then what is that there's the guy with a big willy holy shit what an odd and I hold is that then I did say how old is there's lots of that that goes on around imagine that guy running at you fully erect with a giant Club how strange and there's a bunch of these and they do they understand the origins of these things they know where they came from I don't know is the answer to that these are these are later they look quite primitive yeah I think these are later how strange but that whole area is littered in this sort of paraphernalia if you will yeah and they don't necessarily know who did it or why now but what's exciting to someone like me is that you aren't going through any other conduit and I suppose it's what it is it's the mystery it's the mythology of all of this but it's your road into it as an individual you're not going for any history books right you're seeing it and it's like discovering treasure you can access it on your own on Google Earth and you think it is anyone else doing this right why would they be doing it I started doing it because I wanted to see I can't remember some aspect on some part my land before I know look there's barrels are look at them before you know breadcrumbs leader bakeries and you find yourself filling your boots with all the pastries in the world hmm um and there's something very exciting about that so in reference to what it was that you said earlier if I could go back to any time I like to go back for a minute I'm not sure I like I go back for long see that the period that we're living in is the most exciting period to live on this planet and not not least so because of what we've been talking about stem cells mmm is that going to be the thing that allows you and I to age more gracefully and without so much pain we have enough wealth that we can live a comfortable life if you decide if you choose to live a comfortable life we have medicine that we never had before and this period in history it is we are still complaining we're still complaining but if we could just remember what we are comparatively we're the position we are in history comparatively it's an end to all complaints yeah comparatively for sure it's interesting to when you're talking about this the use of technology and how what you can do now with stem cells in comparison the pesticide is really exciting emerging time but similar like the use of Google Earth to discover these mounds and things if you see what's going on in the Amazon now they're they're discovering evidence of civilizations that were just rumors and myths like the gold city the ancient gold city that there's that what is that movie that there's a paucity of Z yes they're finding these established irrigation paths and city grids in the Amazon jungle thousands and thousands of years old and they don't know the origins they don't know who was there they don't know why they're constructed what the culture was like but this was all at one point in time just mythological and now they're realizing like no no no this is history and this is they've been told and passed down in these fables and now we're understanding there's an actual there's a concrete a physical grid rather that you can go and you could see I know these are real cities that did exist and the jungle is sort of engulfed them it's taken over them it's amazing yeah it's a thing Google F it's incredible I mean it's allowing and this is only step one I think Google Earth is going to give way to some sort of a magnetic resonance type thing where they're going to be able to look deep into the ground I think what we're seeing now is you're you're going to be able to you're right now we're exploring the surface of the earth and we're finding all these characteristics that are oh this is a body or this is a burial area this is a pathway that was probably irrigation but I think they're going to be able to come up with technology that allows you to do the same thing but look deep into the ground and then I think you're going to be able to find all kinds of crazy shit the same way they can understand like the complete topography of the bottom of the ocean now if you look at some of those maps that show the ocean and literally shows the depths at every stage yeah I think you're going to be able to do that deep into the surface of the ground they're going to be able to discover all kinds of crazy stuff someone keeps opening that door what are you saying we got to get going this is why I don't allow people to come ruin the perfect goddamn conversations that song even I know eivin's great cuz you guys fan I'm a big fan him you got some other commitments I guess huh I do yes I'm selling a film I know so you go can see you like fuck yeah gonna go see it I love all your movies ma'am a big fan he's really excited to have you in here so when is it out this weekend not this weekend next weekend so that is Ivan do you want to stick your head back in an hour Ivan's he's scared now you scared him off Ivan I thought this weekend this next weekend is that May the 12th it's the weekend after guardians of the galaxy so I believe that is made at 12:00 right excited about it yeah I love the film I like it tough out there that brother I bet it is tough you've got a crazy business when you decide and I'll just leave you with this when you decide like to commit to an idea I'm sure you have a gang of ideas bouncing around your head like what makes you just go all right this is the one let's run with it telling us changing and it changes by the year my next movie is Aladdin oh really yeah like the magic lamp that's the one really yeah and in no small part because you know you get a weekend ah right so that plays a little bit of a factor in your motivation but it has to you don't spend three years on a movie and no one air about it right Aladdin don't buy you would be very fascinating hope so I'll find it you know I like the idea of taking a sojourn into genres that I don't know anything about Rizzo is it kind of excited you like doing this King Arthur thing in this fantasy genre and this is sort of changed your expectations for possibly considering other yeah I mean I sort of did English gangster films on it yeah and they lead Sherlock Holmes don't stop doing those though when English gangster films this could be TV could be tell we're lost of that now because that's where it's gone that's sort of interesting like the Netflix HBO job stove that sort of stuff um and then Man From UNCLE which is like a spy thing and they jumped in to spy genre so let me go alright okay I can go from this genre to that genre and that's exciting and I've got five kids you got five five kids yeah Wow which means I'm familiar with Disney right of course um so yeah all that what that world looks very attractive and challenging awesome Guy Ritchie you're bad motherfucker thank you Joe I love having you in here thank you it's been a great pleasure on enjoyed it enormous let's do it again alright next time you sound something come on in baby thank you no alright folks that's it for the week we'll see you soon bye much love [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
