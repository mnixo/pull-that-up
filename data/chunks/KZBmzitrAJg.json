hello freak bitches you put that much emphasis on beauty being one of the defining self-worth characteristics then when that starts to go you're in this mad fucking scramble for as much surgery as possible to restore this youth rather than appreciating the gifts that each age bring like each age should bring more wisdom and like like the older Abuelita is like that you see down in the jungle that have fucking magic that they're able to bring like yeah I'm not young and beautiful anymore but I've lived 65 years I'm tuned into my instincts and I can fucking bring magic I can heal with herbs I can do these different things that's all well and good but their Instagram asked pictures of like shit pisses on those fuck yourself old magic lady in the jungle look at these yoga pants pictures' fucking yoga pants have revolutionized the world changed everything change the game you know you can look at a girl naked without our being naked but better than naked because it's all compressed like it's not it's not like you don't see the sloppy aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and deposits just that beautiful pressed in shape and shape is so deeply ingrained in the human in the colours of a flower yeah you know you get your whole eggs are all pink it's amazing it's very a bright pink a shocking bright pink or a white like whoa it's a white rose right like a total hack in your psyche like the month I have those colored butts mm-hmm totally freaked out the monkeys out thank you for goddamn explosion of fireworks coming out their asshole we they should be baboon ass yoga pants maybe too much just all flesh color just all normal and then just bull baboon ass [Music] beyond that no there's really quite a bit of fear of my speaking so there are mostly in Canada right America outside magazine they quashed that story I mean this is gonna be a big feature how did that happen do you know so yeah so the the writer was staying in our place and at the time I believe we had there were there were people watching us and I had specifically said because his rental vehicle was parked across and here he was sitting on the couch and you know we were talking talking and I looked there was a truck that repeatedly drove by and stopped and went to the other end of Street turn around I said fuck you're being you're being watched like he's just like you know I think at this point he didn't truly appreciate the depths that we were in and at this point I don't we weren't even sued yet and sure shit marina named him by name the author and and that was it so he wouldn't I mean he tried to get the article to run but outside ultimately sadly we're not interested in being sued now was a different time there's anti slap legislation now so outside if you're listening but well why didn't they just shut their fucking mouth until they published it he was looking he was asking current and former employees to see if anyone would speak and and obviously there was someone I went to okay you know when you live when you worked in an oppressive sort of regime if you will you're quick to try to score bonus points I assume the former trainer or someone probably said hey this guy's calling around looking for something what are the businesses that guy have they're all in-house businesses but yeah he's got it he owns a lot of property he has he owes no-one any money there's no outside financial interest whatsoever he is the sole controlling mind it seems like guy like that needs to come to Jesus moment or just realized I was like what am i doing my wife is I mean he's at the later stages of his life and living like this suing people it's all anger and evil and I'll hate to mention it but a couple years ago a few years ago and this was my greatest ally his son actually passed away and this was a guy who actually allowed me into the park when I went unbeknownst to me I was no longer allowed there he let me in and that's when I saw you know smooshy in the condition that she was in that ultimately inspired me to sort of speak out and and not be anonymous and he shortly thereafter actually passed away and he's my age I think if you became a lawyer and you were arguing all the time you probably a nightmare to be around cuz you probably was trying to win well for sure yeah yeah that's what they do right that's what they do find their way out of technicalities what does your a shrink to and you're you know every every conversation you get in or you cycle analyzing everybody probably right you for sure that's gotta wear on you other people for a while like will you knock it the fuck off yeah well when I was in college that was the area I've never really applied myself at college at all but the one thing that I was thinking of like if I had a job like what what are things that I'm interested in psychology did come up because I'd read a lot of like self-help books and psychology books while I was fighting to try to like manage my mind and anxiety and shit like that hmm but then I thought about I'd be like you just be dealing with people with problems all the time and you don't I don't necessarily want that I don't I don't think that's a good idea - Thank You dick soft that's why yeah yeah when someone tells you their problems I always feel like if you tell me your problems you're making my dicks off problems make you dig I always felt like that when I was dating no it's like girl you start telling your problems like man you're making my dicks off depends on what the problems are the problems I have an ex-boyfriend he just never was a problem that makes you big harder baby we got solutions we got solutions for this I've never heard that before thank you but now that's an original yeah problems make my dick so you should make a song I've written a few lyrics yeah I really have a rap or knowing the way that I had it written out is that it's one of those songs that starts with banter between like the piano player letting the guy on the mic and he's like uh you know hey Joe how'd it go last night ah man you know she came over but you know you there's nothing I hate listen I hate more than problems right oh yeah man then you hear little sick of your problems make my dick so thick so that can actually be a funny song I think so yeah definitely yeah you see the team up with somebody [Music]
