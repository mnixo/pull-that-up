three two one and we're live we're live what's up brother dude how are you Betty good we got you in here finally man how many times we have to talk about this several right I'm not this was a universe wanted it right the universe made it happen after the till victory that was that was that was uh for a lot of people a big coming-out party for you was it yeah yeah you already out but that was like holy shit the way you put him out it was that was a holy shit moment I was going for that moment that's what I was trying to do yeah I knew a decision wasn't gonna come my way that way you know not to say nothing about the English but I I don't like the judging over that I've seen a lot of decisions ago like yeah I don't like decisions in almost every state yeah you know I mean there's there's decisions in almost every athletic commission that you just shake your head at you don't understand what's the worst thing you can think of I don't know I don't know I'd have to sit back and go over the archives but I've seen some horrible ones even once we guys win they like barely win you're like how the fuck was that close like twenty nine yeah that kind of shit around yeah there's a lot of those but it's getting better though cuz more fighters everyday or joining that force you know I'll see or hear about fighters are used to fight that are involved in the Commission's at least I can floor it and stuff so I know ten years from now is gonna be nothing but productive people and they're people that know what they're looking at you know we can only hope I mean that's the number one problem I think the scoring system sucks to like adopting a 10-9 even the new improved scoring system it's like MMA is so much different than boxing and to adopt this scoring system just because it already existed for boxing you know that's like adopting the rules of tennis for ping-pong or different things there's some mafia is that what is the boxing thing yeah yeah why is the boxing commission governing the MMA Commission shouldn't we have our own thing I think in some places they just didn't have the infrastructure you know and nowadays we could do it nowadays for sure yeah in most places but yeah it's um mean time to change me you been around for a long time my friend I remember the first time I ever saw you fight it was a back up backyard bare-knuckle fight in the Kimbo Slice days that was the first time I heard about you and then I saw you fight Evette words in BO dog I'm the ho dogfight yeah there's a golden age the golden ages man awhile ago damn it's crazy like bo dog fight was fun organization came Velasquez fought their tail son and fought their Eddie average that's right yeah fade or fade or had a fight over there Fredo had a fight over there brat pick it as well yeah Mike Brown yeah but what happened with them they went under because of the the whole gambling rules on lawn changed right off from what I heard know what I heard was a spending budget I this is what I what I heard um Calvin err there was the owner boy he put up this huge budget and these are just rumors from what I heard from the people working you know it was like a hundred million dollars for XYZ mining years to get him publicity so people would see the fights and then go to the casino that 100 million got blown out like in 230 years is what I heard and I wouldn't disagree because they used to pay me really good and give us super perks they used to give us some super perks you know take us to exotic locations to fight be there for two weeks you plus to that fly out take care of you they really really took very good care of you so when I heard that they blew out 100 million in 30 years I was like yeah it could be you know well they were fighting on the beach with hot girls of bikinis we wandered around dancing yeah but you were on the beach like in the Sun I was like what the whose fucking idea is it to fight in the Sun but let me tell you the training sessions that went on there were some of the best that I've seen in the world cuz they so you would go and you'd bring two of your cornerman and then somebody found that and then before you know you had like four people of your entourage going with you from whatever team that was and everybody was doing that and we'd have a training place in what they had done was laid out tarps and mats and it was huge so we'd have like 100 pros 50 pros from all over the world just training you know and you don't know each other and it's like hey you want a role you know it gets competitive you know yeah so some great training sessions that I saw and that I thought I took a part of you know wow that was fun man good fucking time look the the world needs more of those they more one FCS we need more Bella tours we need more you know competition whatever the professional fight League is called now what do they call themselves now as though it is its pfl used to be world series of fighting that's right yeah it would need more need more of them social pfl world series used to be world series downs pfl okay yeah I think pretty sure most the same organization oh yeah do you need we need more you know Oh need more money she had that Oscar De La Hoya thing you know that that's probably never gonna happen again after the the Tito and Chuck fight it doesn't look like but someone of that ilk someone like a Golden Boy Promotions I started getting involved in MMA and putting together they could get some guys that aren't signed but are super high level with a big name which may be the contract comes up and they decide to do something with a big-name promoter you know it'd be good for everybody the Golden Boy tried a many years ago didn't know where deflection was in the Oscar part of that I remember Oscar Donald Trump that's right yeah Donald Trump was a part of affliction that's right Josh Barnett sunk that ship Josh Brener tested positive and that ship sunk remember yeah yeah and then the UFC bought it like right afterwards yeah yeah dad they had some fun fights though that fucking Tim Sylvia phaidor fight was wild as shit Andrei Arlovski yeah Lasky fader look at Donald Shepherd fader he would Tom attends yeah that's hilarious yeah back in the day son yeah Donald Trump and Tim Sylvia that's allure he was a totally different character back then to our troubles like a fun guy like everybody liked him you want your boxing fights yeah people liked him he'd get cheered on now people are so fuckin mad at him same guy they don't see him that way no one no they don't they don't man so he has our security around them that oh yeah you has to yeah you fucked up became president yeah huge mistake for anybody you want to enjoy your life don't be fucking President as you know you could disappear get facial surgery or something sighs of course plus you get that and booklet with all the secrets of the history just the CFR book just for that what do you think gives you that book is it the CIA the NSA or who comes to you with the book some guy with no face enough no face yeah like the guy with the battery and the mast what is the watchman who was that guy inkblot what's his name Shack brochure that's right that guy yeah he comes to you he comes to you with the flood of the air he thinks in that book tell me I don't know what's in that book what's in the book you think I'm gonna say here and what minister people listening get killed I can't say I've seen the book I can tell what do you think's in the barrel Joe girl what do you think if you had to guess like let's say president Jorge your first day in office mr. mas Badal words you like to would you like to go over first is Elvis still alive what about Tupac where the fuck were super well what's going on with these evenings bro and they real which was mine number one the one number one I want to know about aliens I was hoping this is my hope when all these people screaming the streets about the Trump but yeah I was hoping the moment he gets in he's gonna ask about aliens cuz Trump's into conspiracies like used to go on the how it's Joan show all time I know he's into conspiracies if you were gonna be the president the first thing you'd ask is fucking aliens what do you got she was going on here with these green fellows yeah what's going on with them you live in Florida there's plenty of aliens down there no we got oh yeah we got a lot of different types of aliens Florida's we're talking about those arrests no notice Lord of the trip it's one of my favorite places because it literally especially the whole southern Florida area like Miami you know west palm down it seems like you should have a passport to go there it's just yeah it's so different than the rest of America it so my English it's great food is all exotic it's like it's it's it's such a different flavor and then the weather is crazy it's it's almost like going to another country yeah you need a little pad you go to the gas station jump or gadget what language you're speaking nobody speaks English there people get upset I'm always at a gas station and then somebody like an American person will be in the line and fucking damn it man nobody speaks English here and then I have to let transit I'll come down and it's okay bro nice people speak English in Spanish yeah it's yeah it's also the weather there it's when it gets crazy gets so crazy I went with Eddie Bravo once and he was doing the jujitsu seminar we had a drive from West Palm down to Miami and as we're driving this storm hit it was so hard you had to everyone stopped dead on the highway because you couldn't drive because you couldn't see in front he we were laughing no one could see anything it was just all a wall of water that was pounding down the car for about 10 minutes and then it all went away we were like what in the fuck was that you can't see in front of you didn't matter if you had windshield wipers on you are going nowhere you couldn't drive you couldn't see sounds about right that's about right right that's why Miami people Florida people got that uh spastic behaviors we'll just like the weather you know temporary yeah yeah well you know you being down there though you couldn't ask for a better training environment I mean what they've established down there I mean it was great when there was the black zillions there as well but I mean American Top Team down there like holy shit we are in Florida I mean like savings just trying to do that yeah thing to saying that there were children's competition whatever having well the guy died no but before that it was long extinct yeah well it's look Dan Lambert's a bad motherfucker it costs a lot of money to do what he did and that guy is he's one of the treasures of the sport you know you know and what he did was not just do it once but then build a whole new place the giant new place with dormitories and shit stay there our facility and love him and and he's amazing have you have you ever been at Dan's house no never have or he's probably gonna get mad at me I'm gonna put him on blast and I'm a fucking let's pick out him real quick he's rich so you know it's got a really nice house to start with and uh you go inside the house and you don't see any pictures of his kids she has a beautiful family but you do see pictures massive pictures they won't fit in this room they're huge pictures of his father's knocking people out of sunbathing all over his living room and he'll tell you go out I the gym is my baby nowhere to get rid of this you know this is that's the thing that's his baby man he loves it man and Dan's also a tough motherfucker I've rolled with him back in the day when he was maybe like eight years ago he should war with everybody if you were a world champion and I'd be like let's roll just rage its when he's playing pretty good man yeah he's very good he's legit yeah he's a great guy too and you know I remember when that place is basically just a money hole for him he just kept pumping money into it he was funding fighters some of them took advantage of them a lot of them it was but he stuck with it yeah and then he started developing world champions now it's like wow look at that place when we talk about best gyms on the planet you always have to mention att you have to obviously my opinions bias but I think we stand alone in the world I don't think nobody's just sheer numbers you know we just got another title holder mm-hmm on my card we got four people from American Top Team fight against the world you know I think for a while I was uh like Greg Jackson's in aka or producing a lot of people but as of late the last like four years I think it's American Top Team yes it's also the incredible diversity of talent that you could train with yeah you know there's so much that's what attracts you yeah you're 135 and back home you're the only 135 and maybe you're a world-class guy you come in here you got like five 130 fibers and 30 of them might be in the top ten in the UFC yeah what do you tribute your longevity to and your enthusiasm to because you've always been a guy who loves fighting and you've always been a guy who mean you've had that enthusiasm for a long time man you know not a lot of things y'all can capture my attention you know like I can't just watch TV for example you know like a football game and sit through the whole thing you know I'm not trying to dish for but on it I just don't have that attention span or basketball or baseball fighting can just like I'm talking to you in the fight goes on and I'm just like almost get sewn down you know it's always had my attention since a kid since before I knew that I could make money off of it it just attracted me you know he's that primal instinct survival whatever it is is just hardwired deep into me know and my longevity one thing I definitely a tribute to is not taking steroids man just being natural enjoying this ride that the natural foam you know yeah not like pushing my body towards limits that I'm bench pressing 400 pounds with my ligaments are weak words like that you know and I also think God made me for this you know the way that I've been fighting my whole career you know I have really good defense the last writer didn't show but I'm also like Bill Hardman I walked out as you got clipped with one left hand in the initial after you dick kicked them which is crazy that was the first fighter ever saw with an opening flying side kick kick kick Luke Hank to the balls sorry but then he clipped you with was a perfect straight left but you survived on the ground you survived in the ground you covered up you showed great defense on the ground you got back to your feet and you kept it together you know and the combination that you hit him with you'd hit him with that combination a couple times you did is that something you prepared for that when you were switching and then throwing that left hand is that did you purport that was up on the bat yeah yeah me and my coach ah he's the one that'll do like all the technique the guy that I've been with forever Pauline or nuns I think the greatest training coach ever yeah he showed me like hey let's do this you know don't you techniques come on just do it you know and we started doing and doing and doing and this was like a while ago and there's for this fight and I had stopped doing it because a lot of techniques we work on a lot when initiating when he brings me a technique to the table we're gonna rep it out 1000 times in a week and the next week the same thing to leave feels that I got it and they'll be like all right cool it's it's there in the tool shed when we need it will polish it up so for this fight he's like hey remember that technique let's let's bring it I think it'll work here man but he's just south plays like I'm telling you the way he's moving ways you know fighting with you it's gonna work hmm so we started doing it and boom money you caught him with it a couple tons before you put him away with it right I not with that one with that same exact one similar ones that I didn't uh I didn't go full south part to the Blitz you know I did other different ways you know and I also caught him a lot with like overhand and left hook as he was coming in specially in the second one I caught him I think maybe twice with that comma yeah man that's a big knockout that was a big knockout he's a he's an interesting guy cuz he's really too big for 170 yes so fucking tall you are a guy who doesn't cut much weight at all look how much weight you cut for set whoa by the time I get into shape shape I'm around 182 pounds 180 pounds so fight week I get over there I'm like eight pounds away seven seven pounds away and that's so light yeah it's nice I don't cut anything at 55 if if everything went right when I used to fight 155 I got there at 174 pounds 173 pounds 5% body fat the rest is just water man it would fucking kill me so I I always felt I was too big for 55 you know I loved because the competition was stiff there but it was just getting harder and harder once it took those IVs away forget it there was no way for me to make that way hmm yeah and moving up has been very successful for you I mean you better moving up then I think you have ever in your career I don't think I had any stoppages at 55 with the hands like ending somebody I Drive I've got numerous people but I never killed somebody stiff you know and at 70 I got a couple of minutes do you tribute that sort of having more power at 70 or you imaging up healthier feeling that any confident you know once once you run that desert to cut the weight and then you still have to fish fight that's still in the back of your mind right you know do I have 50 good hot right hands in me no right right and those doubts and stuff come in you and also your insides take a beating when you cut that way when you cut in like 12 pounds and up of water your insides take a beating so you get hit in the stomach in like whoa I should fucking hurry it doesn't run like this in practice you know so um it sucks man it sucks much water could suck we were talking about an outside that I think that they if they instituted hydration tests and more weight classes and just cut it out just cut out weight just cut out weight cutting all together cut it out man just you just figure out a way to eliminate make people fight it what they weigh out but you gotta have more weight classes no def have to I mean most of the population walks around between like 145 and 170 I think then you know most of my friends are not heavyweights or very short dudes you know they're like right around there so I think definitely knows weight classes they could definitely add more you know maybe even seven pounds in those weight classes every seven pounds or difference and then as they get bigger they get to like 10 pounds you're like 85 95 205 you know I don't think it's you know some people said that boxing is too watered down I think what water down boxing is the different organization yes yes I don't think it's weight loss 15 belts for weight class come on yeah I don't think there's anything wrong with a 147 and 154 that doesn't bother me no no that seven pound 47 154 160 yeah and they have 168 I think that's perfect perfect yeah I don't think I mean I think look I always thought it was weird that we didn't adopt if we're gonna adopt the boxing 10-point must system why don't we adopt the weight classes why do we have our own so weird is how is lightweight 155 lightweights always in 135 yeah welterweight 147 it's not 170 how is that welterweight like that's ridiculous there was already a welterweight like it's like calling a pound like oh well this is our pound in South Dakota it's seven pound little heavier and that's not the code it's it would be better for the athletes but I get the UFC's idea that they don't want to have like all these titles they don't want to have like 12 different titles they don't want to water down oh it's starting to be we got a bunch of interim champions right now don't ya yeah well listen those two that we had this past weekend I don't see how anybody could argue with those no it was a great fight those were amazing Wow and I've been I've been training alongside DP for a while so everybody knows with DPS already but this I think puts him in like a special category for sure yeah a guy like max man and defeat him the way beat him to stun him bad in that first round and then just every time he connected he was rocking him I mean he just he really showed his power shield the difference between a 55 and a 45 and just showed me holding crack I mean looking back for a while yeah I've seen him lay out dudes stiff in the gym a lot you know he's got one of the higher body count for leaned udacity I'm not even joking I believe it he um our another guy would lay dudes stiff on the constant was hecht him and those guys got body counts yeah for the gym Lombard yeah that can imagine he kind of sparse hard yeah he spars a little hard he's a wild man he's also a freak athlete too you know I remember when actor was laying people out in Bellator before he came over to the UFC I mean I think he fought his prime fights over there really is that was at 85 - yeah yeah yes 70 was a harsh cut from brutal cut he's so thick yeah yeah you know those fucking Cuban genetics man yeah that's what he looks like thickness yeah yes July was ridiculous 42 wait lady would anything I can't even believe this is a real human when every ways in what what the fuck is this he's such a specimen you know I mean every dude I've been training long that guy too long right he does some he's one of the freakiest feats oh you know him Lombard and to me one of the best athletes I've ever seen that I've been around with not too many people know him but he's he's a wild man like the wildest of the but he's the one that when he comes in the mat in the room me Joelle Hector every whoever's there the knows and takes off the hide angles the guys here the man is here is the Lexus available that guy's a freak a thing bro yeah two-time world champion wrestler Olympic bronze medalist but man that guy could play any sport man like handball when do you how long's he been over at ATT no no he's uh right now he's uh he's beating a sentence right now he's doing a little bit of jail time for for a crime that he didn't commit but he was fine he fighting better to he beat uh Joe Warren knock tomorrow oh no shit okay Alexis Villa hmm you know Manny from pure athleticism this guy would do crazy stuff you know the only basketball were like a basketball high school team just by like what the fuck wait is he comedian he was at 125 and 135 free Cathy there are some crazy stuff yeah bro free Cathy man yeah there's some freak athletes in the sport now it's interesting to see the difference between the athletes from like 93 you know first UFC to now it's it's a crazy difference I still don't think that we get the same caliber of athletes as the NFL or the NHL or rather NBA well yes in different weight because we get the the best and fastest guys from like 117 down like those 45 35 pounders you're growing up either wrestling or boxing you're doing somewhere I'm sure they know they're not gonna play basketball or football that's true that's true yeah that's true yeah yeah we do have some pretty freaky lighter-weight athletes yeah how rude oh how old you know 3434 how many more years you feel you're gonna be doing this comfortably I'm gonna fight some 38 at least four years and then if the money is right I'll stick around you know but at 38 I've lived this roller coaster long enough it's time to stop just that occasions are tied to like 20 honking problem yeah Wow I had a couple of amateur fights went pro and enjoyed this roller coasters my favorite roller coaster okay training did you have before you went pro um just that fucking somebody that had like maybe one or two pro fights and ever may like advising you like I think you should be doing this man on we go chop trees and shit alright let's go do it did everybody fight training yeah I had fight training but it wasn't like structured you know that was the first original martial art like as a kid my my dad had sucked many in anything you know in martial arts because I was a very hyperactive individual you know some like that is like man I gotta stick this guy in something you know so they had me taking karate maybe some Taekwondo what I didn't get like far and a lot of these things cuz I'd start to excel and the programs obviously because of my natural aggressiveness but then in school if I get in trouble with the grades or anything my mom be like no we got to take a mouse only gonna further the damage we're not gonna let him go there and be at peace we're gonna take him out everytime he messes up at school so I'd start doing good at the gym like two three months and then get taken out you know so I was like a recurring thing that I got to like 14 years old and I was like that to him I need to be in the gym all day long so anyway to do it so when did you when you had parts in your career where you took it more seriously Oh as a kid until I got to like 13 14 I wasn't able to like mom I'm not going to school to them I'm going to the gym now you know we're right around I got 14 I knew already more that's what I wanted to do I had already seen that you have seen enough and before the UFC came out I was like I'm either gonna box or I'm gonna wrestle those two things are amazing the coolest things I've ever seen and then UFC comes out and blows my fucking mind what the fuck is this you gettin paid for this and then I was hearing what they were getting paid at that most like man I could I could make a living off this I'm doing this fuck that you know and I invested everything I had ever since you know into this Wow so will you keep saying the resurrection is a big thing that you're putting on it like social media the resurrection resurrection what is that about No numerous things you know more on the personal side just cutting off a lot of bullshit out of my life like tremendous amounts of it you know and focusing on what I got to do you know I've done a lot of stupid shit in my career you know just from being from having genetics and being blessed and like man I could party all night long and park the car at the gym at 6 a.m. in the morning I'll wake up at 10 a.m. and then kick everybody's ass in the workout room and I'm not talking shakers anybody works out women tell you every day that I'm in there I'm a night man you know and then I go home and sleep a couple hours and go back to the gym at night and do stupid shit like that and I didn't ever Wow and I've not that I was currently doing that but I did that align didn't I use my body your body chance to really recover you know from that into like a million other dumb things so I've just focused on just fighting man just doing this 100% you can cut out social media yeah that I've cut out a long time ago but uh you know it's for me I'm not good with technology to start with it's I'm not the greatest with the technology gizmo and stuff man right you know you got the Elon Musk's of this world and you got man another spectrum man I just want to fight I just wanna do athletic things sports you call me up if you're gonna go for a fucking five-hour hike but if I got to send emails and shit I'm fucked so I'm talking about social media I don't know how many followers I got and there's a lot of pressure to keep up with the stuff you know but talking yeah yeah I don't ignore it I get on it no manager stays on top of me he helps me out tremendously but uh I was in the special classes in elementary you know I had the short bus two teachers in my class eight students you know so you can't force me on the social medias it was like I'm back in school but you obviously are a smart dude you're a smart dude I can tell that from talking to you and you're clearly smart from the way you fight you know there's no way you could fight the way you fight and be as creative as you are and not be intelligent it's just you're suppressing it in a different way yeah yeah for sure for fighting yeah definitely you have to be smart there's no unless you just some crazy freak athlete you know for fighting yeah I definitely got like a good sense of what's good and what's bad mm-hmm yeah definitely have you always had that sense of what's good and what's get in terms of like if you always had good timing for sparring oh for four straight my most gifted ability that God said here is boxing since the first day I walked into the boxing ring maybe like three weeks later was the first time I would let this guy spar you know and they put me this far and I remember there was a couple coaches that didn't know me they were handling already the boxing team for that program and I used to go to the state-sponsored program which was like $40 for the whole year you had access to the gym 34 hours a day and it was like perfect you know the best thing that could happen to me so it was a lot of good time and then we had a couple of national championships coming out of a program and I remember my first sparring session sparring the coaches coming up to me he goes ain't me how many amateur fights you gotta go no I've never fought my life you know what I come over here man and start working with you and it was like a meeting you know and I just had like all natural born radar where I could see the punches in slow motion you know mm-hmm I didn't know at the time how to react to him right you know just trying to get out of the way and it would just work you know and still to this day I have that same radar so I'm that's just a blessing God gave me and also for my eyes whop is my mother you should give me when the belt would come with a metal buckle in the shoes that that's the first test of the reflexes you know when I get home like at UH 2:00 in the morning I was like 12 13 years old my mom be waiting for me dodge the broom time you've obviously put more work into though oh yeah it's not just this this whole resurrection is you seem more focused definitely more focused I've always been like ultra focus when I got a fight you know like nothing forever and all my career like I got a fight that's I'm gonna make it to every single practice it's on my schedule if I got two practices today in three tomorrow and whatever it is I'm always gonna do outside of fighting or like once I don't have a fight those seven eight weeks man this would happen fucking stupid shit you know yeah you know that gets you in trouble I get you out of shape I'm fuckin yeah I love to eat you know that's another fuckin huge problem right yeah I love the eat too much maybe what's the heaviest have you ever gotten in between fights was recently right before I went on this reality show I checked my weight I was that a staggering to sexy no it was just it was time to cut the weight man it's just too much man I went on my manager a bomb got me this this D like we were having trouble this was after the Tom's in fact we couldn't really get a matchup couldn't get a fight that I wanted I wanted like a tough fight there were kind of offer mean I ultimate fighters and things like that and no disrespect to them I just in at that stage in my career I want the hardest fighter the best fighter that I could get and he's like calls me up on dates hey I got this reality show nah so awesome click and calls me back the next day yeah what don't hang up yet listen to me you know I think you might like this is not like that's not like Jersey Shore it's like a competitive like you're gonna compete against people like nah no thanks bro you know and then we talked like a week later what's going on did I get a fight no we can't get you no fight yet unless you want to fight Joe Blow or this guy you know I've already been sitting out seven months nursing my injuries I'm already thinking you know fight whoever it is you know so while this is going on the reality shows pitching numbers at us they keep increasing the number every time they get to a decent number they talk to my manager my manager talks to me like I can't get you know fight right now that you want why don't you just go to a couple weeks one or two weeks collect these paychecks come back and that's it you know and the the reality shows like you go through like a park or kind of obstacles and then at the end you gotta aim so why your heart rate shot up you'd have to like knock down water bottles with a frisbee or a football or something like that but the cool part is it I'm up against an Olympic gymnast parkour dudes tennis players soccer players all types of athletes were just mixed in there and we're just all competing in this thing so it was pretty cool you know it's awesome experience ended up lasting 13 weeks in the show and the show ran for about 15 weeks so I got pretty our deepening you know and uh the coolest thing was that I had to be alone by myself because one of the things is there's no cell phone there's no TV there's no music on the show so it's just an interaction of us and outside of that that's it that's your only interaction you don't have no interactions with the town people are nothing they strictly forbid that you know they want you like caged up so it was awesome I thought you know after a while was the best I'd go work out in the nature be by myself in the mountains or in the beach and just chillin and you really get to notice yourself and that's why I call it the resurrection because I thought about like all the negative dumb things that I've done in my life and just let me eliminate them whether I like them in my life or not let me just eliminate that shit and that's it you know that's why we call it the resurrection you know yeah well that fight would tell man if anybody had any doubts that fight erased all of them and that was I mean till was top five right when you knocked Mountain believe so yeah yeah yeah and so that puts you in the hunt now and what a crazy goddamn division that is now yes sir I mean we got a robbie lawler who's uh he's about to fight tyron woodley again they're gonna have a rematch that's a crazy fucking fight so crazy fine Guzman is waiting to see who's gonna be next for him at 170 now that he's the champ I mean Wonder Boy just got killed by Pettis it's just crazy that was crazy and now our da which is a ranked seven calendars gonna fight uh she's gonna fight the 55 I just forgot his name right now the second uh Kevin E oh yeah Kevin Lee is gonna go up in seventy now so those are the things that throw me off like if if peda stays at 70 also might but if he goes down to 55 we kind of like makes it more of a of a weird you know set up and same thing with Kevin the other I don't know if he's staying up a seven year or he's doing like a one time one night same thing you know he's staying according to him well I talked to him he just had it was just too hard for him it's like 55 just ruined him every time he got down there he made well you even met him he's big yeah he's a big guy yeah he's walking around like 185 easy maybe more and thick you know so man there's not a lot of weight there that you can cut off though if he stays no problem I love you it's when they come and go it like Fox isn't am makes it up yeah a labyrinthine yeah yeah I don't understand why the UFC is so reluctant to have more weight losses I really don't get it like Dana said that the 165 pound weight class will never happen while he's running the UFC and he's gonna be running it for the next seven years he said because the ESPN Plus Kevin Lee's want to make ruffles on just fight at 165 he's asking him to see like if they can make a backroom deal to just both weigh in it 165 and said I 170 just to sort of force it that's not forcing it why would that doesn't mean any sense that's so weird I mean 5 pounds not that much of a difference it's not but it would be nice if there was a 10 pound gap oh they both I mean Dell Santos has fought successfully a 270 look great when you fought Lawler you know be Magna - yeah but I feel like he's probably a guy that should be 165 - you know they can make it like a 162 or something else it could be something like that yeah probably just fucking whistling in the wind now they have their ideas I was gonna want to run that business I don't want to tell them what to do fuck running that imagine being run in the UFC what a nightmare that would be depends how much money you can't pay for right I guess still once you have all that money for a few years and then you're dealing with high blood pressure and your fucking panic attacks and the other night they got things for high blood pressure they're pretty good they do yeah yeah marijuana it does help what's it like in Florida getting weed is it hard now Florida's a fucking mafia man and I'm getting a kill fish but you know every state when knee gonna had the flour and shit mm-hmm we only had wax that's it that's it man another in medical right you have a medical they're literally about to become I think flour just became legal in Florida or it's about to become mad right yeah medical yeah yeah no you know just smoking to smoke I wonder if they're gonna be easy with the medical recommendations the way they used to be for opiates opiates you'd be able to just get be able to get oxys with like just go to a doctor one of those little pain management Center in Florida yeah oh yeah I'm just wondering how hard it's gonna be to get because they obviously there's someone who spending some money trying to keep it from being fully legal yes yeah and I think a big part of it is because uh like South Florida culture um there's a lot of natural growers over there mm-hmm they grew like it's always been a big business it's legal of course to grow marijuana in Florida and selling you know especially Miami Florida and a lot of people did this so I think when the rules came about legalizing medical marijuana they said we're not gonna have plants because then everybody's gonna grow plants and you know it's like we can't really charge them because it's it's legal you know so that's why I think they did the wax you can't grow yeah I guess and I don't really agree is like smoking waxing somebody giving me wax like oh here smoke this I don't really know what's in there you know I always feels like that uh from cocaine to crack people thought oh it's the cocaine and then you're fuckin a crackhead you know so the wax always I don't care how many times somebody tells me no it's just super safe I get it you know but I rather the flour if I'm gonna smoke yeah it's just pure but apparently one things are dealing with in California is pesticides yeah that's some weed you know grown by shitty growers has pesticides on your smoking these pesticides I mean this is why it should be legal so you could test things exactly testing to find out what's purer what's not make things organic only the best of the best make it to that to that other side you know yeah it's just weird it's where the it's so easy to get opiates in in Florida so hard to get weed I wouldn't know nothing about that I wouldn't know about that either so when you look at the the landscape now you you're obviously in the running for a shot at the title has anybody give you any indication of what you would have to do to get a shot at whose bond or to to be next in line well the next one's is uh this idiot I don't even mention his name on your show because I'm not gonna make him famous he's a fucking idiot you know but fight this guy and then go for the title after this homie so you have to fight somebody else yeah but it's his name rhyme with Dolby you know [Music] you know channel you see on Edwards no no you just made that guy famous to think you made him famous a couple weeks ago I know it whoo-hoo men yeah oh that's right you're supposed to fight it Ben Askren in July fuck you don't like him not one bit really uh not as what I forget that was that fight was scheduled um what was the problem that aspirin he's that new age you know and he's like a fucking 40 year old and a science teacher - I don't know why yes but he's like these new ones do - just fucking talk like just talk and talk and talk about everybody fuck up when you see one when somebody sees you in person you're not that guy in like I said I don't come from this technology world I come from like if you if you say like yo fucking Joe you're a fucking idiot where you gonna punch me in the face where I better be ready for it you know I'm just not going around disrespecting people I get taught respect because if not somebody's gonna make you respect you know right but these guys nowadays they grow up with these little things Nicky just say whatever fuck they want words carry weight especially my kids can read your stupid comments you know my kids have access to the Internet no I just don't like them you know one incident I remind when Kobe won the title right and Ben immediately comes out I'm cabbage kryptonite I would smash him or something like that for starters you're 70 pounder you fucking moron he's a 55-pound you're not even in the UFC you know he's that type of guy an attention whore look at me look at me I I don't even like his fighting style I like a lot of Russian style because if that's what you did in your imposing and winning awesome but when your sole purpose is just to hug somebody's leg as hard as you can and then I I don't know what you think about the Robby fight but he didn't win that fight you know several times we watched that fight several times I thought that Robbie was asleep for a second and then Guzman showed it to me and then I changed my mind and then Herb Dean came on and talked about I change my mind again because herb team was saying that what he was concerned with his way the arm dropped and that it was a cervical locked essentially when you have a bulldog choke it puts puts us some serious leverage on your neck he's like and he's seen guys go out from that and their whole body goes paralyzed and saw a guy where that happened to and he came back is he got his movement back again but for a while I was pretty fucking scary so he was getting choked out you know by getting his neck pinched it was pinching down the nerve he was worried that that was happening with Robbie said the way his arm dropped he goes it wasn't normal and he goes at it and he gave me some serious concern Ben Askren said that he let go of the choke a little bit when herb came over to him because he thought herb was gonna stop but because he thought Robbie was out and he thinks that during that time when he let go Robbie came back to life which could have happened I don't know it's hard for me to say but I feel like in Herb Dean situation I think he did the right thing because the arm dropping was fucking weird and yeah the arm job was a little weird yeah but he wasn't out I never seen nobody go to sleep doing this you know I've seen people go to sleep Ashlee evans-smith went with the thumbs up thumbs up but what here's what the perb said that made sense he goes was it the thumbs up because I want a thumbs up if someone looks at me I want this I want this it's not is your arm down in that position why is it this did he do this or was his arm down I don't know only Robbie knows whether or not he was out he says he wasn't so you have to also say he's in the middle of war in fact so I if it's up to me I want the guy to go peace I'm watching the guys defending a joke with Lauri you know he did that was the other thing that herp said he didn't grab for the choke they said the natural defense would be to get get his hands on the on the hands and try to separate them he didn't do that he said that's herbes natural difference maybe Robbie because he's seen this guy do it has a fucking a thing you know maybe Romney can't be put to sleep from there's guys that are weird like that that just certain positions they could go thirty minutes you're choking them and then they don't go to see maybe Robbie's that guy all I know is he wasn't sleeping yeah well that's what Robbie said Robbie said that he was waiting for bandit IRAs arms out that's what he said he said he felt the tight the squeeze the squeeze really tight because like I'll just let him gas his arms out that was his thought look mean michael Chiesa said that when kevin lee got his back and they stopped the fight before he went out he said i let my hands go cuz i was concentrating on my neck i was just tightening up my neck and trying to to keep my blood flowing I think down was a little difficult very naked you know yeah it was different that yeah you're gonna go to see B eventually and that one let a guy go to sleep like that one you should let a guy go to sleep madam yeah the other thing happens you mean just wake them right up hey you went to sleep oh but maybe they pee their pants asleep no big deal uh-huh it's certain neck cracks we just go wool no but that one's not gonna put you in a wheelchair no especially not from Ben's ass man probably so your take is on all of this trash-talking media hype shit that you see going on now you don't like it I don't I don't I think I fast forward it's not it's distasteful right now to assembling but if you just fast forward so the guys like me when I was 14 years old watching the sport now you're looking at the dudes right now doing it you're gonna grow up and think oh I got to do the same shit I just got to fucking talk a shitload of shit I don't really gotta go Jim that much just gotta have a banging litte social network account and I'm fucking golden you know and we see it you know sage Northcutt for example you know great times and stuff but um what he was getting paid out did it make sense for a lot of fighters you know why was he getting paid so much because the social media is but is he really bringing in those people into the chairs and into the TV because you have a lot of likes you know the things that I wonder and not like to disagree on of them but sometimes girls have like tremendous amount of followers you know mm-hmm do those numbers translate to viewers on the TV or or like butts and seats or any of that like I would like to know you know a lot of times when I've asked like people in the you have seen stuff they say no those numbers don't translate so why do they get more money you know I'm not talk about the girls get more money you know something about guys that they have like a social media presence that are just getting more money involved I think it's kind of translate a certain amount no I'm sure it does I'm sure it does that guys like Colby Kobe's gotta translate I mean he talks so much shit he you know gets people excited about the fights there's something to it I don't know I just I appreciate what you're saying though and I look I appreciate the way 1fc handles things because they concentrate on just fighters being honorable and fighting their best and fighting the best fighters they can fight and they don't emphasize that shit talking at all they emphasize the martial arts aspect of I get it mean you don't like each other John Jones and on DC I love it because you can feel these guys like each other you feel it yeah kill each other you know but to me it's okay he's doing it when max Holloway fought Dustin there was none of that there was just two guys who were the best in their weight class I mean max is the best hundred forty-five pound ever and Dustin Poirier is absolutely one of the best 155 pounders alive and they're gonna go after it and it was artificial dog was beautiful was all barking just biting them fighting shaking hands full respect before and after and I get a lot of people like they have that uh I hate you syndrome born into a fight so they don't want to shake hands they fuck you I don't like you you know but when when they're giving so much attention to that WWF stuff and right pushing you to the forefront that I don't really like you know and just to think that the kids watching they're gonna be even worse they're gonna do it to the next power mm-hmm did did you get ups I mean when when you went over and got into a fight with Leon you were being interviewed he was yelling some shit at you while you're being interviewed and you walked over and one of the one things that I like what you said is he walked over your hands behind your back you're like talk say what the fuck you want to say to me but then when he was standing in front of you like you wanted to punch you you're like okay mom you know first thought was he Sandia well initially um I was doing my interview and he's crossing by and he's with his corner man and I don't know if this guy consumes a lot of drugs or what that he thought that that would intimidate him he was walking like this looking at me and like pacing back and forth and I'm trying to do my interview you know and he asked me something about something a date and I say maybe maybe not and then he tells me to shut up you know what everybody watching his back home from Miami you should have punched him as soon as he asked you a question while your interview because that's my natural instinct if you're getting interviewed and some fucking idiot comes here and cuts your any of you off well you should get punches slapped upside your head you know that'll teach you respect not to do it and nobody else again I should immediately done it but I didn't I answer this question but lightning maybe maybe not he goes on to say shut up after that I can't take that my daughter might be watching this interview I've been telling her stand up to bullies your whole life don't go running to somebody in town so is picking on me handle it yourself that's what's wrong with this country I think with this whole somebody picks on you go to somebody else I'm not gonna tell authorities this hooligans picking on me I'm gonna handle it myself you know because I'm gonna see him again he's gonna think he could pick on me got a handle to myself you know I'm in my any of you man you're gonna steal my moment I just worked out here just me but out here you barely want a split decision in your own country I not just do doubt and you're trying to steal my shine like this that that's what I'm saying I mean and then he got famous off there which I hate so only thing I could take back about that night that it wasn't filmed that him filmed it and be even better you know he was just gone off in sinus you know neon got his ass I think it helped you two did it helped me a bit helped him more than anything no it helped people know who these people knows mas Vidal doesn't take any shit people known that since hey nobody for rainbows had color they already knew that man they didn't they didn't need to see me whipping this like I see they like to see it they like to get remembered ah yeah they like to see people have consequences for shit talking in this weird era of constant shit talking you know I think people enjoy it they like it and if you guys ever fight it makes it a bigger fight for sure my gosh man yeah I guess but does that like I beat number City I've been in this sport for a while been beating up guys would that validate him to fight me when I beat in the top-ten guy you know still yet to be the top-ten guy you know like but he could get that fight off that that's a new age in era there I know right that's a concern yeah that's a concern I'll fight when his when he's beaten in the top ten got I'm gonna be the first guy to expose him to break his face but until that moment comes you're talking about the business side because you already saw in the personal side day of the week I will address you but on the business side get to my level buddy put in the fucking work okay the top ten guy knock him the fuck out did you worry at all about getting in trouble for punching someone in another country I was scared out of my fucking life Joe that's what I'm thinking I was scared I thought this guy was gonna kill me man I might have not looked it but I was scared out on my life yeah I get it I'm very cold-blooded you know I get that from from genetics from my pops in them but I was scared out of my mind I thought this guy was gonna take everything I had you know you had to do that I had to defend it I understand but did you worry at all about them arresting you or any weird shit like that over there I mean you're another I wanted to press charges ah that's how scared I was but I'm not charges cuz I understand I'm a man yeah but that's high five so you're in danger I was fuckin head of in danger and you do not see it was not just one assailant he's him and his crew of hooligans who lawless people I had to defend myself I did everything in my right to defend myself is one against like three or four dudes and they know it it's some video okay I understand I understand and so the would the police say that already tell me nothing man then tell you should I didn't speak to no police that's amazing no no police for me up in the Spanglish immediately we've gone new and not big English yeah okay no big English yeah I mean how many times you find England before what first time yeah so like if you go the rest of your career you can't go to England oh wow no I I really liked England did you fans are so knowledgeable and they were just cool even the ones that were like tille fans and was it like a funny joke to me or something cool but it wasn't like that weird bad energy you know even if there were two fans right oh my boy tills gonna get you know but it'd be like funny and how they say cheeky you know it was it was a great experience everywhere I went and the people were super SuperDuper cool yeah Brazil's rough if someone's fighting a Brazilian yeah they don't they don't I've heard the song there it's a super nationalistic and proud very proud so they're not into people coming over there and fight Brazilians they're not gonna be friendly to you but England's different man they're very polite very yeah one of the countries has been around for a while with the sport yeah what'd you think about that style bender gasoline fight I was pretty good that was wild Shetty good tested both both testings yeah both tested guessing who's got a ton of heart oh he's a tank was nobody him he mad at him if in the fifth round he said you know what yeah just fuckin hot dog in survived I mean it's incredible it looked like style bettin was gonna take him out several times yeah I mean what a fight and to have Kelvin land the first big shot early on a drop style bender and show him some real adversity and let him know hey man you get knocked the fuck out in this fight you know that was a that was a real awesome moment man what a fight two men back and forth and yeah oh so much chaos and to have Kelvin head kick him and rock him how about that shit the thing that really rock style bender was a fucking head kick from Kelvin don't Oh Calvin would press him up against the cage maybe here to take them but just definitely keep him up against the cage and working there you know yeah what is wrestling background went I didn't I didn't see that going like that you know yeah um there was some wild scrambles on the ground to a style Bennett threw up that fucking triangles like whoa he's got a game on the ground no he's a gifted eye and fast it's a fuck man they more than just gifted he you could tell you pitching the work 100% he's smart as fuck yeah he's smart and creative and just has a broad encyclopedia of first of all striking knowledge but obviously when he went to the ground he knew what the fuck to do man he was throwing up triangles he locked Kelvin up in a triangle it's just kidding they're slippery ting it's the end of the fight and you know he popped out of it and with with all the obviously Kelvin use the right technique to get out of him too but that was a serious fucking triangle attempt you serious for your hard-earned money for that fight oh yeah well I hope um enough people got a chance to watch it because I don't know what that ESPN Plus debacle was because apparently there were a bunch of people that couldn't get it like there was you got a sign that razor that mm-hmm and there was some crashes and some people wouldn't work on their device and they had to order online then it still didn't work so all pay-per-views in our bot fiddle each peon yes oh I didn't know that I thought it was just like some no it's all of them from now on so if you have DirecTV tough shit you got to get it through ESPN plus I think it's a good move because I think in the future that's where everything's gonna be I think the UFC just got way ahead of it whereas most people are still like boxing matches and shit you're getting most of them you're getting them off of pay-per-view on DirecTV or cable or whatever the fuck you use but now they're using that disown you know to zone has a lot of fights you get from that app and a lot of boxing matches though signed Canelo to that huge huge deal they signed triple G yes you know so they're doing a lot streaming shit too yeah I saw a commercial with the mother dad Dave and Buster's with a Tracy Morgan I think yeah yeah yeah streaming I think is the future and I think that's why the zone got way ahead of it and then ESPN Plus getting way ahead of it too I think they see where they're riding on the wall is yeah just uh from here to there a little bit of time yeah well everybody's used to just pay-per-view deals like TV you know I think whatever Comcast people gonna get used to having their TV connected to the Internet there's a lot of fucking people that don't have their TV connected to the internet you know so once people start using yeah once people start using like Apple TV and connect through that and get the app through Apple or use you know Android or whatever the fuck they use to get online it'll be normal to have that on your TV in five years yeah but right now it's it's rough if you don't have that you want to see the fights or if you come from the Stone Age you like me and you got hmm Internet labyrinth it's it gets crazy man yeah I wonder how the pay structure works like say if you get a title fight say you beat Askren and then you get a title fight with Roose maan what I mean how do they do that with ESPN Plus as opposed to like pay per view points or something like that how does that work yeah I look at you you're in pain I'm using brain power requires energy yeah that's was this gentleman by the name of Ibrahim Khan why let him do it all that good move yeah let Eve handle it he's been there done that negotiated bigger contracts in mind such as Haber take your eyes you know now this Aspen fight you're you're fighting him in July that what is that July 6th yes sir when do you like how much of a camp do yourself how much of like a fully dedicated just all in camp if you look at him from a skill set Ben's not even worth waking up before like 10:00 a.m. in the morning but I don't like the statement before my alarm goes off I'm already awake I want to break his fucking face man I want to break his fucking ribcage and I don't want to knock him out early on I don't I just want to torture that guy man if I get the chance to torch him 14 minutes and 50 seconds before I stop him that's what I'm gonna do man you know I just I don't like to dude I don't met him a long time ago he's a fucking prick man I don't make him me there's not too many people that I genuinely dislike he's one of them you know if I was I see him right now thought it wouldn't be too friendly of a greeting you know now do you base this on how he talks shit and just plays around tries to hype things up or if you had a like a real conversation with him combination new things you know uh like I'm I'm the type of dude that um if we if we train you go to American Top Team Joe and let's say I get lucky and I tap you out twice I'm not gonna ever tell nobody that cuz that's not my glory moment it's just fuckin training I don't give a fuck about that I already forgot about that but there's some people they violate that man : of Jim you know I went to American talk to him into like he's that type of of pussy you know like oh he's talking about Jim Stowers he came over to American Top Team after I dumped him on his head we kept wrestling he got scrambled me and he said it yet you beat me rushing but we were straight wrestling two-time national champion you're proud of that you're telling people that you know and uh that just shows me his character you know he's not he's not who he pretends to be and then he talks so much on mine then I could have respected him a little bit if he had held to his guns but I seen him in London and as soon as I see him I start walking towards him goes hey man I'm gonna spare you I'm not gonna say nothing talk to your fight Ben don't do me no fucking favors bro you're not doing me no favors say whatever the fuck you want when you want it you know and I dress him and I went up to talk to him and if she got involved he put his head down and they squirted him out of the hotel he never came back to that hotel you know and he actually wished me good luck at some point - like right before like why are you doing this man you're not that person I'm on social media that you portray to be you're not you know so you're fake as fuck you're selling something to the public that is not there obviously and you're a coward fuck it let's throw that in there too and if people don't believe me tune in July 6 I'll show you what how much of a coward he is just to play devil's advocate don't you think that what he's doing is smart marketing to play devil I know you don't like it I know you don't like it but to play devil's advocate but it's corny though I looks back it's corny like ain't nobody going oh he just wants validation he wants to be accepted you know I think half of what he's doing is corny on purpose all that boom roasted shit come on man half that stuff is cornered on purpose no no that guy you haven't seen him you know that guy's just fucking pointy to this day I like him you think I like talking to him he's smart motherfucker I might be smart man but he's a corny motherfucker bro just cause you for all the wrong reasons I just can't wait I love the fact that you're a purist like this though I really do I want to hurt that I know you do don't do it's gonna be a great fight it's it's one of those interesting fights because you've got good wrestling takedown defense you've got very good wrestling you got good very good takedowns yourself but you clearly have a big advantage in striking yeah so it's one of those can he impose his will can he get a hold of you you get a hold of these fucking numbers people talk shit to me in the past but they'll say to my face and mana game respect right cool bro I'm a punk or whatever you call you said it to my fucking face you know but you say it online it's just the whole way it set about you say it online then when you see me what's up hey how are you picture be fucking kidding me man okay so wait I feel like I've been brought up from like a Twilight Zone from a different dimension sometimes it's a lot of these rapper fighters that you see acting like criminals on the social media when they see me hey what's up bro let me get a picture now fucking fanboy doubt I go man I could've sworn you were just mentioning my name singing some shit bro that's fucking nuts to me knows my mind right I'm such a simpleton but I just blows my mind every now you're a purist I don't know if it's appears simple I don't know where you want to put me but it's not simple to mine just don't want to play that game you're not interested in that game it's mine yeah listen Kabir's I'm interesting that fucking game either yeah but he's on top of Connor let's talk now damn let's talk let's talk let's talk now not a shame shit purist I love it a shame I do I appreciate when that shit talking has consequences I like some shit talking though it's fun starting when you back it up yeah back that shit up yeah not you see me in the hallway lobby and fucking run to security and get a squirter down who's a guy you fought in the past you had the most beef with before you actually fought all right everybody had like no so not like this fight like tell me you went back and forth a little bit right no no no we went back and forth like hey you want to fight yeah let's do it I liked it boom boom boom but we never well it's pretty respect yeah yeah Oh salute me what about cowboy cowboy I mean yeah a little bit of beef you know nothing crazy like if I see him in the street we're gonna start fucking fighting or nothing you know is that what you mean by they be for just like ya talking shit to each other oh yeah you're right mean cowboy we're talking a lot of shit back and forward to it yeah you know yeah yeah it's coming from genuine places both sides you know so it was good I mean it gave that fire you know yeah yeah that's definitely one it came from like a little bit of I did not like this aspirin one I respect the cab we're going into that fight you know obviously I think he's a fucking stubborn he proves it again by having the most wins most knockout submissions dudes a stud I I don't think Askren is even yet to get a win in the UFC you know I just think about it like if I had fought Robbie Lawler which was a great champion and has done amazing things in the sport since the start of Robbie toe now I think I still fight him and I remember watching him in the UFC back back in the day not 37 and a half with the discus he came along seven and a half deal fucking lame people's day okay and little amazing it looks oh yeah it looked fucking amazing looked amazing physically when he wasted Askren off the air and dumped him on his head and then started just driving his fucking knuckles through his brain and it shows you how tough a screen is the dudes durables fucked man he handled that he's built for survival even by his body type you can so like physiologically he's just built for a guy like me to put him under the radar like all this guy's not a threat look at him you know but it's not gonna work I already know what to do to this guy just fucking hurt him and even the way he's fucking Billy's for a pathetic newsman but let's skip the subject minutes ago somebody else made this guy famous on your show that's too late too late well this man when they put his picture up on them on the marquee he gets a big pop that's crazy people love Askren I I guess I don't know I haven't seen they loved him before he fought in the UFC - I never seen that guy I see I see I saw in England in England they didn't fucking hated his eyes never booing him out of the fucking stage and she looks like he belongs there right he looks like oh you left us lad he looks like an English guy doesn't he I guess Millie doesn't that like what do you think his nationality it's Askren he looks like he probably has some English in him curly hair a lot of English dudes of course over there yeah you got it bit the dude's got a while that's wrestling style wrestling style it's funky yeah it's very unusual very effective he was gonna have the wrestling match with Jordan Burroughs it's gonna be smash is that before or after yours think it's before does that concern you you might get injured do fuck if he does this cuz he faked the injury out you know he knows what he's doing he's big boy you know I was like if you're gonna fight Joe or male and uh one of your teammates might come up to him and tell you like Amen I think you should fake the injury in the Drake oh um I just faked an injury and cop out of that fight you don't want no no problems with that guy you know so that might be what he's trying to do who knows man mm-hmm damn dad fucking 185-pound division we were Maryland it what a division now now with style vendor and Gastelum then style benders gonna fight Whitaker and yeah I hope Yoel fights board chena they're supposed to fight right Paulo Costa they're supposed to fight I don't know I thought you were gonna fight Jacare than um Joel got hurt yeah and Yoel was supposed to fight Paulo first but then someone got hurt there might have been Paulo but Paul's healed up again and the chakra fights out and school they set a new fight up for Jacques ray so Jacques Ray's got an opponent and now Yoel doesn't man it's fucking crazy division though huh that division is a real shark tank and tell you the truth I would like to see you all fight for the title because I feel like I'm gonna take no time way from Whitaker guys I think he's one of the baddest dudes on the planet I feel all one I feel like you want to the second fight the first night straight of Whitaker was the second one I straight of thought jewel one I was actually there in this corner you know I was like oh we got this Wow you know one the third one the fourth one the fifth and also with the damage yes significant you damage was a new one I think I don't know if they used the new scorecards the new scoring method but if they did and he didn't win then it's a real travesty but he had him hurt and that was a note any final ten seven that's the big difference in that fight in my opinion Robert Whittaker for sure scored he fought well he won rounds but when you well heard him he really fucking hurt him and there was no moments like that for Whitaker where he had ul staggered and almost out Whitaker is a fucking beast I'm a super-intelligent do it when he fights me him and stomping is gonna be very unusual because that's a that's a big step up to go from from style bender to go from the very first fight in the UFC which was only like a year and a half of all the way up to robert whittaker in a year and a half it's amazing it's an amazing step up Whitaker's something special and he's another guy that was a 117 just cut way too much way too much couldn't do it went up to 185 really found his own place so many guys I think they're in that category where they'd be healthier if they went up yeah oh yeah but when you saw Holloway versus Poirier did you get the impression that really Holloway should stay at 145 mm-hmm yes and no cuz i i know person dps fine I know he packs a punch so I don't think it's like all your career 55 is done max no you fought one of the the more clever powerful punches because one of the better boxers you won a better box in in to the knitting grid of it man DP is like a brawler you know he likes me brah but an intelligent one you know yeah he wants to hit you as much as he can without getting hit very greedy you know and uh I think it was just a bad fight for max I think max is fuckin there's a lot of guys max murders at 155 I think you know I think so too I think so too but I think at 145 he's almost unstoppable yeah I don't even know how he makes 145 I don't know how it makes it either but when he gets down there man he's just something special he doesn't it doesn't seem to diminish him in his performance I'll give you look at his performance against Ortega he can make it he can make that wait and once he gets there man good luck catching up that guy think of his crowdy behind this it's incredible footwork mm-hmm timing the face that he throws reaches up and then he explodes and the face facing explodes as I love his rhythm and B yeah yeah very very great at distant management and also switching stances and being creative and never always giving you a different look yes he's he's amazing yeah he's a special guy he really is he's in my pound-for-pound this you know mine as well and he takes a loss like a fucking man I mean it just takes that loss so well you know he's like hey it is what it is he's a great champion he beat a champion you know I'm still the champ 145 he's like laughing yeah like he should be he gave everything he had he came up short no excuses and and and full respect to dust and it was great man maybe a year to phonetic back 100% come I fight him hey he's only 27 yeah that's even crazier already the best featherweight of all time one of the best pound-for-pound fighters for sure on the planet earth only 27 I mean he's good and he's grappling defensive he's pretty fucking good yeah those chokes up yeah yep yep you do everything scary dude yeah he does everything he really does I mean it's uh it's an amazing time for the sport really is there's so much talent right now I wish she still had that 25 Division I I like that they're well they still kind of do I mean Benavides is still still trying to set up something you know and if Sahu doge owes up and beats polymerize and decides to still defend his hometown that's a huge fire that's sick fight Marlins a scary cat yeah he's a scary cat I saw judo oh yeah Wow oh yeah I remember when cejudo won that gold medal mm-hmm we were watching uh I was we're already like fans of his stuff and he came over to American Top Team not long afterwards and he was already working on he said no I'm gonna keep rusting but I want to fight him and Jimmy I remember watching him this guy work out he was like maybe 2021 cuz he was I think he's the youngest gold medalist ever in at least American history I don't know if all wrestling history so I remember watching him work on I was like man that dude one day will do something big in the sport if he commits to it the way he did the wrestling yeah I'm sure enough he's done fucking huge things yeah well the way he took out TJ I definitely thought it was an early stoppage but I definitely thought TJ was fucked he was in a bad place and if so who dojust let it go for another 10 15 seconds he might have shut the lights out on TJ we don't we don't know but the fact that he just staggered him and just came out right off the bat just start dropping bombs on TJ I mean that that's just and again the backgrounds in wrestling she shows you what an athlete he is and how quick he learns when he fought Wilson Hayes and also his fight like a karate fighter remember that who stand at sideways and they drops like blitz right hands on I'm like what the fuck like look at he's fighting the fact that he can incorporate all these different styles to he's something special endurance power speed and success you know the first guy ever to be an Olympic gold medalist in wrestling and then UFC world champion it beats the best guy ever ever ever ever you know I mean it's amazing he's in he's an amazing guy something else to me that's another guy yeah the right books on yep whoa yes another scary father yeah he's he's a special guy yeah um I hope it gets fucking paid over there one Fc deception I really do and they have a deep talent pool over there they have littler guys in Asia you know there's a lot of guys over there for them and they got a lot of I know they bring in a lot of good multi guys which I know might be nice to just scoop them up put them right but it'd still be fun they'll be fun to say cuz those high-level Thai guys are fuckin something else I think Mighty Mouse has entertained the idea of having grappling matches over in one Fc and even maybe possibly kickboxing matches in one Fc oh did you know they do everything over there one Fc has a fucking huge audience man you know they talk about 40 80 million people are watching into each event in Asia no way and all throughout the world yeah it's giant and they aired over here in America too I think was on the Encore Network I was flipping through the channels and it was on I was like whoa okay so it's on it's on TV in America too yeah it was after the fact it wasn't live I mean I think you could watch it live on bleacher report live there was a website right you might watch it on bleacher report live what the day of the event I think was free wasn't it find that out I think it was anyway it was free to watch the replay on television and look they got fucking high level athletes that guy nasty yukine who knocked out Eddie Alvarez guys legit as fuck you can check out Eddie Alvarez like that you're legit as fuck and that's some Tigers Twitter scary was garyun them yeah 225 fucking Thai fights yeah got some clots in clive fighting with MMA gloves on almost see he's so dangerous to let him fight Thai style but with MMA gloves like I love him in I fucking love that that's not to get to like they can't work their grips a little better than maybe their takedowns are gonna come out a little better there and the shell does not work as well yeah exactly the shell hands again to sneak through little spots and that's what happened with him and andy souwer and with our glass roof so what happens when these like high-level strikers come into high-level like I'm amazed they think they're safe when you're fucking not you know I say perfect examples gokon sake and Khalil Roundtree round cheese just snuck that beautiful straight left right down the pipe but ain't dropped him did you see Roundtree in his last fight no holy shit against Erica Enders this weekend do it holy shit dude fucking holy shit massacre just a shutout was the best he's ever looked he went to Thailand apparently after he got knocked out by Johnnie Walker he got hit with an elbow in the clinch and decided really need to work on his clinch game so he moved to Thailand and he was there for the entire camp to put all this shit up on his Instagram all these videos and training footage it's he looked sensational but when you see him alive against Erik ham he came out like a Thai guy light on the front leg hands up in a classic and just brutalized him she brutalized him why he just pitched a fucking shutout man against Anders who's a savage and he watch it was I mean I knew look we knew Roundtree was good but there was just a giant leap between the round tree of pre Thailand and post Thailand the most I've ever seen a guy improve in in two fights amazing yeah look at this significant strike differential 63 more significant strikes he landed but it was the way he did it man it was the highest significant strike differential that's crazy oh that's from that event that's all good and everything like that but it was what it looked like his switch kick to the inside thigh was insane it was so fast big guy man to a fight yeah do be as fast as he was no no no telegraphing anything like that over and over again and he was all Thai style it was really interesting to watch man he just embraced it and came out way better it was a surprise when he got gokon like that you know but I also knew it could happen cuz it's it's not kickboxing and I think Gohan's a start kickboxer man guys fucking good I came boxing man oh yeah first wait the shit that he does he moves like a 55-pound yeah I was surprising to see that Roundtree has a ridiculously fast rate left its he caught Anders a little bunch top so he dropped him at least three times he's backgrounds lessening or no he's a striker strike yeah his background striking he's a beast man I mean it's just some I mean it'll be awhile before anybody's excited about anybody fighting John Jones because it's like what do you got you know you got a dude who's just there's certain guys like remember when Anderson was in his prime and like like what are you gonna throw at him there was nobody there to Wiedeman came along everybody that they threw at him you're like what's Anderson gonna do to this dude when's Aniston got a knockout you should know commie when is he gonna connect on this guy yeah I think that were in that situation now with John you know we got the Thiago Santos fight that's coming up should be interesting yeah but it's just the interesting is that Santos is a murderous striker what is he gonna be able to connect that's the that's what makes it interesting I think Jones has some of the best defense the best wrestling grappling yeah and striking just doesn't get hit yeah distance side kick to your fucking kneecap is no longer there and then when you fucking thinking about that side kick boom left elbow to the eye orbital yeah it's a tough puzzle he's like and he's he doesn't he's not light on his feet he's just right there in front of you like an unmovable force you know he's just gonna stand right there in front of he's not gonna go back or nothing it's just if he catches you catching a break you try to take a breath of air wow wow wow wow pouring it on you so it's kicking your legs front kicking you in the body over and over and sees you slowing down he's a predator man I wish like they can make a science experiment make Mighty Mouse 205 that fight happened or shrink John Jones I make that fight happen yeah no shit right no shit that would be crazy see the thing is no 205 ur can move like Mighty Mouse moves you would have to see how can Mighty Mouse move at 205 yeah cuz the thing is I don't gravity yeah there's no gravity fuckin with them yeah when he's 125 he's fucking cutting angles and he's whoo where is it yeah you know he's on your legs he could do everything but it's nito is also that's right this room when I see him doing the things like kicks like a fucking tight dude shoots a double leg like a fucking good wrestling dude it's not like just an athletic guy that's explosive everything is done just right you know same thing with John you know it's got great technique everywhere yeah I mean Matt Hume has produced some great fighters but then there's Mighty Mouse like he's produced some great talent but then there's Mighty Mouse he's like stands way out and you got a wonder with his it Mighty Mouse is it Matt Hume put more emphasis on him is it a combination I think Stu usually when you get a guy that's that good you get a gym that starts producing multiple champions like that usually right they get but to that area like that paint creations not known for having that kind of talent other than him is like him Josh born in yeah Josh Barnett came from there so but Josh trained everywhere now Josh started his career there but he's basically been everywhere he's met Hume open to like the public anybody just walking I think so I mean he has regular classes the whole deal but I know he gave a lot of specialized attention to my t-zone anyway also he just felt like Mighty Mouse was a real sponge you know you really live as well yeah for the fact okay there's everything but what do you think you're gonna do when you retire I don't know you don't think about it all I do think about it um the main thing is make sure that before I'm retired my kids are set for life with their universities with their houses all that stuff that's number one go then when I retire out and I got a lot of options I can do you know I gotta see which one I'm gonna like the most cuz whatever I'm gonna do obviously nothing out love as much as fighting nothing don't make me wake up at 6:00 in the morning to go fucking run no nothing to have that loving me when you asked about that longevity is just cuz I love it so much I don't have to work for it I just I love it I love what I do even hitting the bag for 35 or 40 minutes sometimes it's so fucking boring and monotonous if I got the right music going on I mean a little bit of water let's do it you know I'm I have fun doing it you know so I gotta just find something that my heart is solely in and I'm having fun I still haven't figured out what that is you know maybe skiing you know ever scheme the skiers are trying to recruit me like yo who is this guy minutes we need this guy over here in our team to it maybe scheming that she gets my blood pumping you know really you like ski I hate it I love this I always worry about falling that's your problem it's my problem oaken snowman is gonna happen yeah you can click in the head you can now but I have their fucking ACL torn apart I've already had two knee reconstruction I guess when I go down the hill I'm like don't get hurt don't get hurt don't get hurting that didn't hurt that's so crazy how brain thinkers I'm thinking there's no way I can get hurt I'm just fucking going as fast as I can oh you're one of those guys yeah like there's no way I could get hurt it's fucking snow oh you could definitely get hurt yeah definitely fucking up while I was standing still like past my friend hey guys - say what's up and just like some seven-year-old man didn't see that I'm stopped not moving here just fucking hit me into the kneecaps good thing there's so more flexible nothing tore nothing but it was like a good hit there you know like a good little low kick out of nowhere you know I worry about that with my kids some clodhopper if they start young no to forget about oh yeah already doing black diamonds a little fuckers yeah yeah they're so low to the ground they're tiny you know the the will skis and shit they no fear that a no fear once they already fell down once or twice yeah it's just snow I watched some of those fucking men going down those hills though Oh Shh like when they drive him off in the helical my god oh that's ridiculous I watched a video the other night of a guy went down this mountain that no one's ever skied down before they dropped him off at the top and he had to climb the first couple of feet down with the skis on before he got to this open chute I was like what in the fuck are you doing he's climbing like you can't just ski this rocks everywhere you shit that's great fuck you that blows my mother gave a better hobby his ridiculous sliding down a mountain I might end up in there one not in no time soon cuz those guys are a lifetime of skill but I wouldn't I wouldn't not take it off you know I got I'd love to ski one of those crazy mounds that are just can SuperDuper steep and just rip it you know one thing about skiing is you could do it when you're old yeah because this lady who was teaching my daughter she was giving my daughter lessons at this ski place she was like deep in north 60s she's skiing great well he got technique technique yeah I grew up in the snow I saw she did it I was like 30 you know so I got a lot of catching up to do yeah yeah it's uh I just know too bit like re my friend are he broke his wrist last year and he broke his ankle two years ago he's always fucking himself up is that guy balls to the wall I don't know he probably is on mushrooms that's a good time to ski that's the best time I know a couple people that have done it on mushrooms they say you ski really yeah you like it what's the best thing about skiing on mushrooms well it could go both ways because it fucks up your depth perception you know I don't know where the trees are so though the first time I did it I was like super grandma you know like everybody's like what's wrong with him like no no just because the snow is all the same - right so now it just fox wiiu depth perception so bad you know you don't see divots in the sky everything gets pixelated yeah oh you're a really tripping hard then oh man and everything is like the same and I can't really see the bumps and then I I don't see the bumps I just feel him in whoa whoa all right I'm gonna need to tough this one out in the story you know and then the next time I did it this letter literal less of a dosage had a blast you know yeah they say it's a it's a micro dose thing yes just like don't take like three grams take like a half a gram yeah something like that well the first time most I was doing the bro science it was like oh yeah I think you say four grams is cool man let's go on a phat I'm done like a slight fast you know you're the problem with it that the vision thing when things when you do the mushrooms and things get pixelated well you see like almost like a matrix around you that yeah I would imagine that that would fuck you up skiing you wouldn't be able to see all the creases in the snow and shit and you just feel it all of a sudden you have a snowboard I did it for like half a day I was pretty cool but I I used to ski like inline like you know parks you know like on ramps on half pipes probably yeah so I could like jump on rails halfpipes and I could even do like a front flip on on my skate but this is nothing the season yeah yeah so skiing came very easy to meet and snowboarding not so much because I didn't skateboard when I was a kid mmm i skateboard as a kid but i've never snowboarded but the people that do it they say it's easier to get better at snowboarding there's to get better at skiing they say it's like it's hard in the beginning but once you get it it's easier to get better okay but when you fall a lot of latitudes fall this the snowboard goes up in the air your feet are stuck on it you land right on your fucking head a lot of people get knocked the fuck out cuz you can't move your legs individually like you can if you're skiing and you'll end the tailbone a lot - a lot of people tell me yeah and if you're skiing and you land funky to ski snap loose and you move your legs on board is shaft and yeah you strapped in the snowboard is this shit so there people vote through the trees like fucking Silver Surfer ah that's fun man yeah but that's an rush this blowing down part with those seems different like less options to slow down I love all that anything he gets my heart pumping they do skydive or anything crazy like that I haven't done the skydiving cuz I'm afraid of the nerd bad stories about the landing how you are with the skiing you got a couple buddies he got in her I got a couple buddies they got in her on the landing of skydiving all right I can't do that I'm fighting so I'm fighting whoo yeah yeah have you had any knee problems yeah numbers any problems I've torn the meniscus or a couple times on both knees from wrestling practice all from wrestling practice I'm sure yeah do you did you get them scoped or what'd you do about it just rehab I got a big fear of going to sleep by anesthesia yeah really yeah I got a supreme fear that I don't want that in my life right now I'm not ready for that's a sucky way to die go to sleep to get your knee fixed yeah that's a wrap see in heaven tweet-tweet yeah it's not yet nice so you've just basically whatever meniscus tears you value just dealt with that just rehabbing then I also heard from doctors you don't really need them in this it's just gonna fucking hurt like fuck so you don't really need Mascis that's what they told me they got a lot of times instead of scoping it they cut it you know like I know a lot I think you just cut it you know they cut pieces of it yeah yeah especially depending on it's a bucket handle tear or how bad the tear is yeah like uh Mike Brown as I know his meniscus cut and he was the one that was sending me last time I fucked on my menisci said do not get his coke because then you're gonna reinjure and you're gonna be again through the whole thing get it snipped out get it cut you know did he just got to cut out yeah all of it yeah joe romeiro same thing I don't think Joe has a meniscus sure yeah cuz I've had numerous problems my meniscus and I was about to go in and get the surgery and I was asking everybody's had the same problem and I was like fucking well I'm just gonna rehab it out just do rehab and I did rehab for like four or five months and it got better oh wow for five months huh well that was last year in 2018 that sort of did uh larger part of the year just heal up injuries that are hiding and just getting better and better and better so when you say like rehab it what kind of rehab are you doing for your meniscus what were you doing like where they you go to the place and the guy tells you like you hold the towel mm-hmm okay different foam mats here yeah physical therapy right that's what I didn't what is it what's your diet like uh I got many of diets like when you're in training are you training not when you're not when you knock out there until I'm sure you ate like a wild animal yeah for fact I got many of diets at all times oh I just kind of have 55 I used to have to dye it so hard eight to ten weeks I would have to die to bring my body to like 173 174 especially the last 34 years of my career mixed with a lot of running you know I 70 I don't have to do that so I'm still kind of strict I just stopped eating after like a certain time like 7 p.m. I stopped eating you know wake up when's your last training session depends there could be some times I get I'll finish had around 10:00 10:30 9:00 not just drink tonight yeah II don't need anything after you train no I just drink a shit ton of water you know this one I'm like I'm training training that I'm used to it you know cuz I you should do it at 55 spreading gain weight so I just let's say I went for a run like 10 o'clock at night finished at 12 I'll just get back drinking shit's on the water wake up and then have my meal you know mm-hm I don't need when I'm in training camp one thing that I noticed um I don't like to have a big breakfast before I go train it fucks me Rilla slows me down the body's processing all that shit I just don't feel as accurate I could just wake up and go to the gym and do fine if I wake up eat to all that something go to the gym it's not the same yeah easy energy it takes your body to digest it that's legit yeah I always feel the same way I think you're better off just eating a little bit of fruit yeah a little bit actually some pineapple anything with sugar so my caffeine goes light yeah I don't want my system actually having to dissolve things as I'm already dreaming that's why I'm surprised that you're you're running late at night and then you're not eating something and then you're going through the entire night with no food and then a light breakfast and I'll burn right through it like I'm burning through fire in my sleep do you have a nutritionist eConsult Orton I had numerous ones that at 155 I had numerous ones and I took what each one gave me that was like wow this actually helped me for this or for this and I've jot those down on my book and I used those things still to this day there's some things that I use then mixing with the stuff that I know works for me know like I know for a fact somebody numerous nutrition or something no but that's wrong you should just wake up at 6:00 in the morning get a meal and then at 8:00 in the morning get another meal and then by 10 o'clock you're good to go not buddy I'm just gonna go to the gym and I'm gonna fucking feel amazing I don't need all those extra fucking meals and then after that I pick out and when I eat man I'm like it's almost a religious experience for me I like to be very happy so if we go to a place to eat and I've never been in you're telling me this is the place right here this is where you want to eat at I'm getting everything on the fucking menu it looks I'll feel this fucking table up and I gotta try everything and I'm gonna know what's good at this place I don't like to put restrictions when I eat but I don't eat like that all day long you know so my one or two meals that I eat they're powerful you know mmm so you real light but when you eat a big meal you just go hog yeah and then nothing nothing after 7:00 p.m. at night yeah in an FSA movie yeah that's like basically like intermittent fasting really so mimicking that and then I I saw that the innovating fashion it started breaking down like the details of it you know because where I got it from is that uh when I was at 55 let's add finished my my workout at American Top Team I finished at 178 pounds fuck three weeks oh okay I get back home I did a little sum because I just finished the two-hour workout and I put my sweats on and go run I gotta run ten 11 o'clock at night never run for like an hour I'd get back I'd touchdown like to 172 maybe 174 I couldn't eat I just drink water so I got used to that that regimen of not eating after my workouts you know I'm feeling fine the next day just a shit ton of water your body just got used to it yeah maybe electrolytes or whatever and then when those the the intermittent fasting diet or the or the fasting came up and they put the science behind it I'm like oh no one there makes sense to me you know it's not the most special immune it's there's a science behind this you know yeah it's actually healthy for you my body needs breaks yeah now when you're doing strengthening auditioning and things on those lines how often you doing that a week it depends where what stage I'm at in the fight if I'm like 30 weeks out obviously or like 12 weeks out like right now lift weights running swimming anything to just get my heart going and I do a lot of kettlebells I like that it's a like a full body workout and it's kind of like almost wrestling you know when you're when you're getting in there in the reps and it's heavy if your techniques off he just fucked up that rep you wasted too much energy you're not gonna get to those projections you want it again and I got lucky down at the gym and I trained one of the kettlebell champions he's a world champion he's at the gym so he showed me like I got a technique and a lot of the the grip behind it and it's amazing I mean this guy doesn't incredible things you know you know it's all it's huge for me the kettlebells I like him you know a lot of strength in addition to with my coach ah his who's guy we've been together for like 12 years you know yeah I'm a big fan of kettlebells as well it's my favorite exercise tool if I pick one thing that I would say give me a chin up bar and kettlebells and I'm getting a grip back and then the the sheer coordination and pop them up in the air making the whole body work as one whole unit and when you're tired and you you can't fuckin not concentrate because every one of those techniques every one of those those lips has a severe technique behind it if you fuck up and fuck up your back and shoulder you just throw your whole shit off you know yeah yeah now what what do you alter when you get closer to a fight like what do you eliminate do you eliminate the weightlifting do you the the length of the training session you know as in when we're more out from the fight will train for longer periods to three hours you know three hours always the max and maybe I'll do that twice in the day you know when I'm closer to the fight maybe an hour and a half tops tops two hours and maybe two of those in the day you know and then that's it you know monster 34 so I don't like not when I was like 26 that I could fucking train ten hours in one day and wake up the next day like nothing you know so now I just I I also listen to my body like man the last session beat me up I'm gonna do a one-hour session now you know do you take your heart rate do you use heart rate variability monitors or anything like that no no nothing I don't even know what you just said hey old school yeah it's um you know people are doing that to see what their heart rate is when they wake up you know see if like if your heart rates inconsistent say if you have a resting heart rate of you know 40 pizzas per minute then you wake up one day it's forty seven forty eight that might indicate that your overtrained 52:53 would be a real good indication and you would probably want to either do active recovery that day or just take the day off maybe even go for a light hike or something like that it may mission in business or loose yeah there's a lot of thought behind that because sometimes people are getting sick and they don't realize it they're just too tough and they just push through it I feel flat today but what's really going on is your body's fighting something off it makes perfect sense yeah how much sleep you're making sure you get a night for the larger part of my career is I'm I have a sleeping problems like really bad I would seem like four or five hours and be fucking perfect man yeah be perfect never never have a problem you know as I started getting older man trying to force myself to see that's one big thing with my coaches my management cuz they know I sleep you know like I'm fight week I'd be up in the lobby thirty in the morning and then go to sleep wake up I ain't in the morning and you know we got to change this you know so I've been trying to change that a lot and I just try to put myself in bed early and then I just stay and you know I don't do nothing the phone's already off there's no TV in my room I'm just chilling it but this isn't fight game it's not like year round you know right you know I'm just trying to go to sleep you know however long that takes does American Top Team have a float float tank no not yet but they're working on and did you just hear Joe Rogan they did the fucking float broke get the float why did I think they did were they thinking about it at one point in time is that what was going on they sure now Dan get the fuck down low Dan needs to float you know we love you Dan get that fucking tank in there baby I'll hook you up I'll get you to the right people float live from Jonah float lap at Venice shout out to the float lap yeah the guy put my tank in here they're the best tanks mile show it to you afterwards they're so ridiculously over-engineered but when you get in the man you relax like it changes your world things are fucking awesome I've done it like uh two or three times your fucking mind is there a good spot near you Nona you remember like on the road yeah yeah two hours up north that sucks yeah Dan should open up a spot down there I mean it's it'd be great for fighters you want to keep them from jacking off in there that's a problem get a little too relaxed certain guys that are ready flag lane now so it's all can't come in Miss waters got a evacuating my brother you gotta have a passport for these waters yeah they're certain dudes that are just freaks you gotta be careful with them athletic freak same fucking yeah big freaks double freaks yeah well you you guys have how many people at your chimney Bob we have one of the freakiest gyms ever in terms of talent overall talent a family fighters there I don't know sometimes I get to the pro classes and there's like 50 pro fighters or guys you know crazy 40 Pro fighters in the map because the main man and the other main matter covered in the cage is covered in the square cage where I'm always training at it which fits like another ten people is completely covered with with pro athletes you know and that that we have we have the 11 o'clock to like 12:45 session and then on a different session for like either the lighter or the bigger guys were coming in a different session you know and then we've got guys throughout the day doing their individuals raining so it's it's just crazy how much your time is spent doing group classes versus how much of it is time its individual specialized stuff like say working on something a combination tool and until or you know what you're planning for Askren group classes will be more like well I won't really learn it's not that I can't learn much but I'm not like my Mike Brown for example which is the the guy that runs my my can't love him something great guy I don't easy a great guy but his brain is he's the like Elon Musk of like fighting and shit man his his ideas are fucking dope solid and like way ahead of their time always you know another stuff that we're seeing now Mike Brown's been preaching to us for like a while so he knows me pretty well he knows man man I can only do about two moves a day so if he's gonna show me something he showed me one to two moves tops and I just am a driller I'll just drill those moves as many times it takes me for me to get him and that that's like my group setting you know that's like okay go just drill this and he knows that I need at least an hour of drilling with a brand new move for me to get it you know and then after that just go live with whoever's in the class you know wherever they they brought for me um now when you say you drill a lot like are you drilling a lot striking drills and my major Martling drills basically everything just console the trailer okay I drill I drew a ton and I go live a ton but I like to complement it with a lot of drilling I just feel that I'm always on my best game when I drill now sometimes I take away from drilling completes that I feel drilled down like man I've been journaling so much I just want to go live now you know but I'm usually everyday that I'm in a gym I'm drilling a particular technique you know I think that's so important Oh super 40 for every every up martial art Jiu Jitsu anything what's your large drill or you know you're draining your free throws or whatever it is you have to just drill it to your body knows how to do it without thinking about it yeah that's why when you see guys are just spar too much and all they want to do is spar like man you don't care you you you you're decreasing your chances of success again to think you're you're enjoying because you're just not spending enough time focusing on the fundamentals and techniques kind of sharpen tools yeah and keep those tools you like keep moving them around like you keep adding to them yeah driving guys fucking nuts when you just drill in eventually you hit that a thousand mark mm-hmm it's not the same when you were doing it five or six times you know giving out too much wisdom that he's people are gonna know what's up but this is training it's it's boring so people don't enjoy it as much it's not your legs exciting I'm the only sociopath then you could ask my heart I enjoy drilling you know I had a good pace good speed where we're just going and it's almost like a like I'm just drilling that move when I'm giving all my energy into it I love it man well you're also aware that that's gonna bring you success yeah of course but I just I just love it you know this year making sure that my penetration step is right or my left hand was opening through my right hand and my coach was a good job do it again okay pay him that fucking loving me now you when you have a fight coming up like say with aspirin are you watching footage on him I don't watch footage my Mike Brown Bottling Hernandez guy although the watch footage on and tell me what to do what not to do you know like for the toe fight same thing you know or maybe they'll send me like a clip did they wanted to see me like why no Woodley far till they're like look how Woodley are counter them with this on or look what to do there's something like little clips and I watch him but to watch fights not normally watch like my opponents fighting now what about recovery do you guys did they get a lot of massage do you do ice baths you ain't shit like that I do uh I've always done ice bath unit around my career but thanks to my good friend Michael Miller I tried to do him a lot more which I still need to do more you know like good to 30 times a week is when I feel like at my best sauna I usually for recovery you know especially after like a lot of I guess he you've had in your show I've always done the sauna to cut weight mm-hmm and knew that I had great benefits and training in the sauna but it didn't know the science behind it then you have like doctor Ron they go Patrick will come in and it's like mind-blowing yeah this all makes sense why the Sun is so amazing why I feel great after I use a sauna maybe not immediately because after to our wrestling practice for striking practice and then you go in the sauna because you're like heavy they want you to workout in there you feel like shit afterwards yeah but surprisingly the next day I don't feel that bad or the day after that and I just thought nothing of it you know just fucking whatever men's just I feel good today I had a great breakfast I guess but I started thinking about times that I was implementing the Sun Allah in my training regimen the times I wasn't and I was like wow the Sun of things amazing for everything you know ya know it's huge its its giant for reduction of inflammation and there was that study that they did and was it Norway or sweet somewhere they they said there's a 40% decrease in mortality amongst all causes stroke heart attack cancer everything for people that yeah 40 percent decrease in mortality for people to use the sauna I think it was four times a week for 20 minutes at a time at a hundred and eighty degrees I think that was the study that they ran they just showed it an 80 degree yeah so they just they which is you know normal temperature anywhere between 170 and 190 s where a lot of people have their sauna set but they said that in that hot range for 20 minutes your body produces so many heat shock proteins that it yeah it's it helps with so many different health problems yeah I when I heard uh Pat you're gonna say all those things my fucking mind blew up yeah it's crazy right I got I'll never have to take pharmaceutical drugs nobody's ever gonna take tell me you need these pills alright alright and then people that hear this do they doubt it you know they have one pro fighter Tony Joe Rogan Tony and they had a doctor telling you you want to cure problems just go in the sauna yeah man people with arthritis and you know another thing that's great is cryotherapy cryotherapy is great for people with inflammation issues too anything where you can get your body freaking out about temperature your body freaks out about temperature whether it's cold or hot and your body produces cold shock or heat shock proteins and then that really helps your body reduce inflammation that's fucking insane you just feel better too right you get out of there like I feel better yeah even will not be sucked out like man I feel like fucking shit I just lost fucking 4 or 5 pounds of water after practice in the Sun you feel like shit but then I take a bath and then go to sleep wake up the next day feeling good you know I put the water back in the system obviously but I would just feel good and I didn't quite know why this is happening you know like let's say I got kicked in my elbow my elbow would blow up and then for some reason that day I had fucking 45 minutes of in the sauna because that's what my coaches thought I needed the swelling would dramatically go down but I wouldn't attribute to that just be like oh shit that's crazy so I'm sure being Wolverine had something to do with it but the song I had something to do with it too now on your as you gettin you know you're one of the top contenders in the division now and as things kind of heat up are you having to do more media obligations before your big fight Sal no no that just fucking say no man do you man I'm fucking only what if you gotta fight for the title they're probably gonna make you do all that shit won't they you you want this circus show this is how it comes buddy you know cuz I can't watch shit my own fuckin fly to LA flatten your fly here Rex you're right I won't pay you know don't get me wrong I'm a fucking soldier for the money you're gonna pay me for these fucking numerous TV outlet stores you got me going to him selling products I'll do it man and I don't want to sound like I'm not a company man but I'd like to get pay for my services if I gotta be talking numerous people that's not what I signed up for I signed up to punch people in the face alright let's get that right you know if I had a greeting speeches out giving up my secrets of wisdom pay me some money for them whoa do whatever you wanted yeah well it definitely takes away from you too yeah it does I'm so much energy you haven't no I definitely take away yeah definitely takes away and I feel also like like the guys that are constantly putting stuff out there right shit man people get bored he fucking just putting shit out there you know and certain people are putting certain things out there they fucking gravitate those things this guy's not a lot of talk shows or whatever I want to hear what he had to say on this person yeah if you're constantly like this squeeze in this one this guy's a necessity everybody the notification comes in there already fucking put you on mute you know and you did that to yourself yeah nobody to blame but yourself you little Instagram whore and I'm not talking about to the ladies I would never talk to a lady lay down tell about to the dudes that are for this rate sluts yeah to my ladies I love you long time me loving you old when you have been in the game as long as you have and have been as successful as you have you have information that is very valuable to young fighters they can learn shit from you without having to experience a lot of the negative things that you've experienced all that without having some of the mistakes you've made you know some of the things you learned that were positive you could teach people and but oftentimes as fighters get older than retire that all that knowledge just goes away it just gets lost because the fighters either don't become a coach or don't ever write it down or don't do interviews I think a guy like you in particular because you're a very crafty fighter you have a lot of valuable information for young people for young guys coming up oh I do I know it you know and you know how I got that information putting myself in uncomfortable spots you know I went to the University of Wyoming which I loved that experience it's higher than Colorado and I'm with a d1 national program ran by mark branch I mean David branch was our and chris pendleton these guys are fucking studs and they'd let me come in there I'm just some I'm a fucking fighter man you know and they let me come in there stay with him for about a month and just Russell and be a part of the program so I I learned what worked at the high level or not because I might think when you get a single leg I could backflip out of it I might think and I go over here to his University I'm gonna find that if it works and up and this the same thing went to the State University of Oregon got to Russell over there I've done a lot of high-level boxing chemistry with good boxers just being around them amateur world champions gold medalist you know Miami were a hub for the Cuban crime wave of great boxers you me and all these guys that are Olympians they come in there and I'd be at the gym with him picking their brain getting beat up by them learning since I was young so I I for the boxing fundamentals I got very very lucky I didn't even know what I had it to me at that access that I'd be working out with gold medalist world champions it was insane you know so I think one thing I would tell any young fighter if you want to learn something submerge in it you know if you if I want to learn jujitsu I'm not gonna go to Rex kwon-do I'm gonna fucking go find the dopest jujitsu guy and get humbled you know a lot of people don't like to get home I don't want to go with that guys you would look at a wrestling no man shut the fuck up put the ego aside and go get humbled learn because the more time you put into that craft eventually whatever is bad will get good you you put the time into it you know and a lot of people don't like to do it and I think even more nowadays that I see on the mat now with the egos and social media and like people filming in Shay there's a lot of Pro fighters that I see sin now they don't want to do the wrestling class because a couple wrestling studs just walked in through the door so there's like two types of guys are when I see these all-american and national champions I'm like wow he's gonna be a good practice these guys are my weight I better be on my a-game put some good music on that's just gonna get crazy or there's the guys that when they walk in they're like man I don't need it you know anyways I'm gonna fight no sir I don't need me I'm always hyped for the challenge you know to push myself to the fucking sheer limit and see what comes out of that you know solo you think a lot of it is just some mentality to embrace struggle and embrace difficult moments and embrace the opportunity to learn and grow yes and unfortunately in this sport you don't have to get a concussion because in boxing you don't don't take me wrong you don't have to spar hard to be a good striker you don't but there's certain things like wrestling you got a wrestle hard you got a drill hard jiu-jitsu same thing you got a drill hard you gotta get you're going with Marcel oh gosh you're gonna get fucking tapped a bunch of times guess what buddy okay bro right learn that humbling experience enjoy that you know if you get a chance to roll with a guy like that take full advantage of it and nowadays it seems like a lot uh sometimes if you don't want to do that you know like I'm in the mix alarm and one of the biggest gyms and I see sometimes guys don't want to take those challenges in you know like a top-notch MMA fighter go Strait wrestling with some College rest or some high school kids it's just so start a trusting you know do that put yourself in that uncomfortable position see what happens bro you know do you think you'll ever be a coach I could be you know I got a couple amateurs and a guy I got my boy Charlie deca that's that they'd he's also like a friend in the amateur and he's uh he's doing good things in amateur and now he's gonna go pro he's gonna fucking he's gonna tear it up man one day I hopefully he'll be in your show man getting interviewed guys got a lot of tanning but um I don't know I don't know if I'll be a coach it's a full-time job it's a full-time job and you got to be committed to somebody right and if they don't have the same mentality that you had you're gonna get frustrated and I am sometimes fighters don't like to pay me well do now you gotta collect from a fighter she's gonna get crazy man I don't like to pay I don't like the pain and you know something about me Joe I like money man if I work I better get paid man yeah cuz if I don't get paid it's gonna be a fucking problem and it's gonna be a fucking problem but there's a lot of fighters that do pain that are fucking amazing and that are the most straightedge do I know yeah I mean certainly a guy like you if you ever did decide to be a coach you would have a lot of choices yeah how do you think but but what I'm getting at is that it at the very least you should write some of this shit down like wait what you know is it yeah we got the street survival series coming out volume one two and three very soon books DVDs everything everything's coming out here man you should real win is coming out but it's coming out soon though you should write a book about your experience and use it just just going from the backyard fights that people could see on the internet with Kimbo to where you are today it's pretty fucking incredible hearts amazing that's something what an incredible rise to the top yeah and you know what some markets all the young fighters before anybody saw this before anybody tell me you tuber anything i side up here I invested in myself I believed in myself that's why I put myself in these tough situations to go with the best wrestler in the workout room the best striker from the world and just constantly get that because I knew the difference between me and them was only time I just had to put it in time wedge mentality where'd you get it where'd I get it maybe God opened up my mind and just gave me the message of just growing up very humble just fucking wanting certain things that it didn't happen just like I'm gonna I'm gonna get this but understanding that really just takes work really understanding it yeah really just takes work yeah it really takes work and it really takes the right mindset you're not just the work itself but the way you're embracing difficult challenges instead of shying away from them to protect your ego you're doing the opposite God's to the only way the only way I'm in combat sports in combat sports tennis maybe there's another way I'm not coaching tennis right but as long in combat sports is you're not being set up but someone's gonna fucking murder you when you're first starting out exactly with striking that's no way you don't want to get yeah you know I've got ten prophytes your first day here and I break your nose that doesn't do anything right but it's just embracing those challenges whether it be running a mile in six minutes or drilling for two hours long just two techniques because you're kind of dumb and you fucking gotta just do it over and over and over and over embrace it you know I'm glad you're gonna put some of this information out I think this is something that as I was saying like a guy like you that's been in the game for a long long time and you've learned a lot about what it takes to become a world-class fighter that that information a lot of times just goes away when that fire retires most so many fighters have retired and you don't really know too much about the process or what they learned well uh we got a document he's been filming for about three years but we've had trouble when the UFC sold it to like ESPN getting all the rights and and things that ago associated with dropping documented like that and in that documentary no I told him from from the start when we were gonna do it if we're gonna do it I want it done right and meaning I want a lot of control over it and I I want a lot of training you know I want a lot of the things that I do in training to get me in shape some people find it cool some people won't so in that documentary there's a lot of just highest rate of training you know like a lot of the Cuban mythology that goes behind it from my from my coaches that are Cuban what what we like to do to prepare for the fight how we break it down you do different shit then then people normally say in the preparation yeah actually you you know Joe well well sure and uh and stuff Joell my my coach which you should trained you all as well and a lot of human community they have a big especially they grew up in Cuba that have that big conspiracy theory like nobody else they whenever I'm hitting pads or anything like that I'm about to fight somebody you will never see me do a technique on the pads that I will do in the fight I shouldn't even say my coach is gonna slap him in the face you will never see me do anything he might resemble anything I doing the fight and he lives by that you know he doesn't he's another guy that just shied away from cameras hates cameras he's always in my corner he's got a yellow bandanna or something yelling he's been in my corner Joelle's corner numerous numerous guys corner you know they're very like secretive of the training you know they think that everybody's watching we start you know they think America might have eight Cuba stills right who knows right so that the training footage they don't want that leaking out you know and uh most of my career been like that you know before the documentary we opened up and a lot of things that we do for training for like from reflexes to ways to recover how we spar how I set up the sparring things like that you know what kind shit did you that's unusual uh not unusual I guess I would say but I don't know I could we could do like two hours of boxing right just straight boxing and we would just break down fundamentals I would just just do two hours just straight basics which is fucking boring but it's just like endurance mixed with the technique you know we do also a lot of right from here from this chair or punch room you hit the pad for me from the chair from the chair yeah just our core norms with the pad zone with the gloves hmm just go five-minute rounds without using your legs without using the lace you try it out and you tell me how that feels you know it's fucking great like right now for that I'm gonna get kicked in the fucking leg pretty hard when I tell you this man is secretive how's it gonna feel about the documentary he doesn't know how much is getting not because he's very like this is for us you know why would you release is why you still fight this is when you don't fighting type guy you know and why do you want to release it while you're still fighting I mean fucking you can't stop the Sun from rising you know gonna stop me if you know my techniques you know it's not gonna change anything that's what's coming is coming you know that's a beautiful way to look at it listen brother I'm glad we got together and did this man I appreciate you as a fighter you're an interesting cat and I wish you nothing but the best and I'm very excited to see that fight that's right love
