NAT the podcasts the podcasts for sponsoring my podcast yeah I'm fuckin giddy today the podcast is sponsored by the fleshlight this is the fleshlight bas Rutten have you ever seen one of these things before this is clean you can feel it it's very it's amazing amazing device American ingenuity at its best well well you do heat it up in the microwave you don't recommend that I think that could damage your penis you know what they did you see they they call it like the jerk-off cups they have like cups in Japan and you and you there I swear to God and has a little like celery thing on it you know so to keep it moist and there's a little hole in it and this actually you can use it and then throw away my buddy yeah we went up to the room my buddy goes right away he says men they were usable I say that my other friend he forgot it in a little paper bag and there were some poor magazines in the bag also so when we left thought that was at the Tokyo at the Hilton Tilden hotel we walked up and this little girl goes hi sir you forgot your and she she looks in there and she looks at my buddies like it yeah so she knows exactly what it is exactly it's very common in Japan they're a bunch of freaks over there right this wall Wow yeah so what happened the whole Cup so no penis can only go in its four small penises yeah it's not designed for American or Dutch cocks right for those who don't know who we're talking to this is a true mixed martial arts legend a real pioneer bas Rutten was a former UFC heavyweight champion and when I first saw boss fight I saw you fight back before there was any real good striking in mixed martial arts mixed martial arts was a lot of it was you know karate guys weren't that good you know there was a few people that were just wild and crazy that were getting in there and trying it and there was pancrase was going on over in Japan and a buddy of mine had sent me a tape and they'd say uh I forget who gave me the tape but he goes you gotta watch this motherfucker bas Rutten like this is finally a guy who's over there that knows how to strike and you were blastin guy it's like in pancrase it was a lot of like they had these these shin and shin pads on for folks who haven't seen it and you weren't allowed to punch to the face but you could use open palms so what boss figured out how to do was pull his hand way back so he was punching with his palm where everybody else was doing bitch slaps boss was blasting guys with straight right palms and knocking him unconscious and body kicks they just couldn't believe how much pain they were in you you were one of the first guys from Holland that you know that hard Dutch style of kickboxing to enter into mixed martial arts I I worked I used that already palm strikes when I was a bouncer I didn't like to mess up my fists so and I always thought you have a way longer reach like for instance a left hook right straight you know that combination it's great but if you if you connect with the left hook you're too close for the straight punch you see and the longer the punch is the more power that so I said why don't it with a palm you know because then it becomes almost as long as my straight punch so the straight will have more effect you know and people started thinking I said if you hit behind the ear if you can see when I'm fighting I'm hitting right here just behind the ear at the jaw when the jaw starts and if you tap it there yeah you'll drop well you're one of those guys to you you analyze different ways to attack opponents and that's why you've got all these videos online of self-defense techniques and bars if you haven't seen these videos have you seen them a music video one no sorry I'm not sorry Oh looky look what we got here well how did that get started how did you start doing those it was the funniest thing I I made the Big Boss Rutan's big books of combat yeah and and then the I promised the first three other people were going to get it self-defense a book a small one a small book like fifty pages book or something but then this guy screwed me over with the books and when it all happens you know I left this guy but I came back to him I said listen I told the people that the first three hundreds were gonna get it now I want to keep my words but I don't want to do anything with this guy anymore because you know it took too much for me already well anyway we said why don't I make in a video we do an instructional DVD and then we give that to the first 300 people oh that's great shit what do you want I said well get the camera it was like totally not scripted you know when we started at the bar how funny was that you know that I go around the bar and I get I see a little what do you call as a saucer or something I said okay well this you can throw at him to distract you can break it now it's got sharp edges you can slice him you know and then when I go through that thing that holds the receipts you know that spin I grab and I look at the thing I go so many times that we were dying laughing and that's all one take no preparation nothing will see you don't have to worry about things that you think like that all the time yeah and being a bouncer that is one one I've never been a bouncer but I did well I actually did work as a bouncer at a concert place had great woods was a concert center and there was a lot of fights it's cons you're constantly dealing with fight that's different than a bar because the bar is more dangerous it's more contained the concert places big and wide open it was outdoor venue you know when you're at a bar you must have seen a lot of shit especially in Holland Holland's a fucking crazy place it is it is a crazy place you have to watch out and you know I wasn't in that era that they really started to come with the weapons I was always fortunate you know to what the big guys would come in and they would actually give their guns to us you know we put him to the side and when something with their guns oh yeah and that will be put be stored in for them before they went in home yeah it was crazy you know I had one guy it was a it was high up it was actually cool because I worked there only for like two weeks it was a big place the galaxy Insaf talkin boss and a very known place because big buddy had some epic fights there man really cool and this guy won't shed any weight something broke out and right away the big guy the guy was on the top of the ladder he grant me from the front and he bare hugged me and he says we're just going to stand like this oh is this I I just want to take that the worst one the most dangerous one I just want to hold you with like this so that was kind of a compliment because all the other bouncers heard it they go like who's this guy no and then the world starts to travel you know he does so uh Holland the fights that happen in Holland in bars it seems to happen a lot with MMA guys I know you've been in a bunch of them Alistair Overeem fucked up his hand Badr Hari got in a big one notes just constantly kick boxers and MMA guys are always getting bar fights um it's the bond just the bow just really think that they can do something and I don't know why maybe it is because they got more of them and they think you know so they give you shit they want to give you are it's a lot yeah do you find you like do you find that because of you have such a reputation do you find it like guys get drunk and then they want to test themselves in that happen I had that till that whole bar fight in Sweden happened and after that for some reason I never had it anymore and what was the bar fight in sweet because that was a very famous like that was the Internet what happened with that well I walked in and what year was this oh god I don't know it was like ninety six or seven so you weren't the UFC champion then when when the UFC was in 99 99 I think yeah so but they you know they reckon about you from kickboxing and from MMA you already famous in the MMA world and you know yeah yeah I was there for seminar people knew me you know and and the bouncers right away when I came in they say hey Rutten stay calm tonight and it was a little alarm bell going off in my mind you know maybe I shouldn't go in but I go ah that was drunk already why not right so I go in with my buddy crazy friend from Holland not house and and sure enough they started they suddenly asked me because I'm jumping around and having fun you know hey what's up hey what's up everybody you know me man I tried to make friends with everybody tried to speak Swedish you know and they they said can you come with us so we go to these two doors through these two doors and there's a big fire stairs like a marble stairs giant and he says well we want you to leave I said why I said well you're you're too much energy you're flopping it around it's not good you're bothering to customers that's for sure okay but can you tell my friend my buddies over here he's also from Holland Takei tell him that I'm gone because otherwise you know we can't find me so they didn't expect that they thought I was gonna do something of course so he pushes me and I said now why would you push me I said I want to go it's okay you know I don't want any trouble and he stopped pointing his finger on my chest which is something I really can't stand right so I said okay don't touch me because his you know if you do that again it's gonna go wrong and sure enough that we're looking for a fight of course he did it again so I pushed him and another guy behind him jump over him and he stabbed the finger in my eye he said guys come on let's stop this right now I don't want to book my other eye and there I went boom and that guy went down he went down like one point sets never seen anything I heard him over the music oh yeah that was the wildest thing ever and then they had these little microphones right so with yeah I don't know but fast there was like there's was five guys four or five guys and they start fighting then the guy that I knocked out constantly because he will wake up right and everything went good and it went good and but then I start realizing wait a minute this these guys are gonna come back up all the time you know this is gonna come to an end I gotta get the hell out of here so I just knocking them down so you're hitting them they're falling down everyone that's coming at you you're knocking now but you realize it and you got to get out I had to get out of there and there's one part until this day I have no clue what this one's I'm falling against the wall and there's a hole in the wall you know with a little like bar in front of it and there's broom sticks broom sticks but no brooms on broomsticks just so I'm grabbing one but right away when I grab one I think to myself I said if I grab one they gonna grab one so I leave it but they passed it and they called freaking broomsticks it was wild and then I had to get the hell out of there so I went all the way down and I remember til this day was a door that you know whenever these copper things that you have to push in and then you open up so I click and it's closed and I'm going yeah now what you know so I turned around that I thought okay now I'm gonna go only for the ice I'm gonna hit him in the throat I'm gonna kick him the balls there's the only thing I'm gonna go for now and they looked at me and they all step back strike a wolf they can't see I mean visitors right but behind me is the whole police force outside because there were windows so they is they throw me in jail and because apparently one of those monsters was a cop and yeah and I knocked him out of course also but he'd never told me that he was a cop but I wouldn't have done that anyway we're there and this is also this is actually a funny story because before this all happened I'm talking to my wife and I'm already tanked right she says why are you laughing where you have so much fun it's honey I'm drunk I'm having a lot of fun she's know you're there with two swedish blonde girls huh I said I don't worry about you know me if I'm drunk you know I don't care about anything especially not that I just want to have fun so after two days they allow me to get my first phone call and I'm calling my wife and she's freaking out I saw honey you gotta be okay relax relax I said I got some good and some bad news so you want to hear first she's a the good news I said I didn't fuck two Swedish girls I mean Jill is she gonna hate me before this story because every time it's not funny I think that's a hell of a story that's an outstanding story so how did you get out of country what happened you know what I asked him if they press charges and they said no so I said okay I'm not gonna press charges either but apparently they did press charges and that I had to go to court so I get this lawyer no and also you know they drive me from the normal police station to jail right this is like a move Joe you you drive into a mountain and the road stops in the middle of a month you get out this elevator like two elevators I don't know Mike Goodwin an elevator I go like four stories up I go out take an otter elevator core like two down go out take another six up I go home I go what am I you know was so weird jail with I was sitting there with like murderers and rapists it was the wildest thing ever but all the folder all the guards knew me so I had a VCR I had coffee cookies I was playing cards with the guards they actually gave me my phone they said I call so then the lawyer comes the lawyer goes I say okay so wait can I go you know and he said mom you're probably gonna get like six to nine months I said whoa back up I said what he said she had one of them was a cop I see you're kidding I said but they started she said well there's five against one you know you can't say anything so anyway it went to court and my friends some friends in Sweden they start they talked apparently they talked to those guys and I said man come on take your charges back and that's what they did and then yes Majan six months hmm yeah that was weird man that was like a movie like that movie with a guy from Highlander remember he he he made a movie I'm in a jail somewhere really weird jail was in a mountain that skate was in the freakin money that's crazy and then was the when when you had to they let you in her to go your your one hour a day it was like a circle and it was divided like like a pie like an eight and but with the fence like you she fenced like that in eight so you would you have a piece of pie let's say you know that's base to yourself from here to you tip to the wall there Wow and then another guy right next to you the right Denise and you're not interacting with them you're not in the same jail as though you're not gonna same cages them no nothing same cage everybody has no room yeah how weird that was well yeah scary stuff because it's funny now it's really nice weight and this is where it happened in Sweden in Sweden this is the the place where all this shit is going down with WikiLeaks or they're trying to put that guy in jail for for rape because he had sex with a girl in the condom broke and you didn't tell her Sweden is a strange place and they take like violence and crime very very seriously over they had just a suicide rate is the highest in the world that real yeah Japan is too but Sweden is one I had well Wow why is it why Sweden that chicks are so hot yeah that seems like that would cut back a lot you know who's killing themselves in Brazil the girls are so high yeah yeah it's like we the flight over that was a funny story too because I would caught my crazy friend Phil Mullen right so we we get thanked on the plane and and he says I got to go to the restroom and I said well go you know but he sits here that the aisle was next to me and he said some of the other side he said well but they just turned the light on because we're landing I said who are they gonna do to get to stop the plane and say go take a leak man so he goes up and he's like walking up you know because we're going down hey guys did the rest of my people complaining complaining you know and finally he comes back and he wants to get in this before nine-one-one okay he wants to get in and say no you can't go in and I looked at the front and I see the the pilot there this is to historic jovis where this and the pilots at the doors open I say I want you I let you in if you go to the front and touch the pilots head and he says okay and you put his hand on yeah what is that and people like yo you can't do this but not not as bad so if for some reason they let us into the country that was the one scare maybe that happens now if you won't shut your cell phone off they'll put you in jail yeah turn the plane right around and you don't know Wow so this is not you say 96-97 yeah I remember when you could get on a plane with just you didn't even have you didn't have a driver's license you don't know what you didn't even have to have a driver's license I remember when you didn't get our anyway with nothing yeah you just go on with a with a with a ticket that's what I meant when I was when I used to compete when I was doing tight with no tournaments we would fly oh yeah I had a ticket I didn't have a driver's license no because Canada for a long time you could go what you driver's license till right to Canada yeah Canada and to Mexico but then the United States started being douchebags about it and you know they've cut back on you know Mexicans and Canadians coming over here and so they made it more difficult and so Canada and Mexico made it more difficult to but yeah when I first used to go to Montreal I used to the Comedy Festival up there I didn't have a passport you got trouble at the border there all the time no in Canada never for some reason they always get me out I have no clue whether this meets it I have well it's your record they find your record I mean you if you have a assault like like what happened home eaten but what happened in Sweden no that was not because I went to court and I threw it out it doesn't matter the fact that you got arrested and you went to court and all that and you were in a jail for a little bit even if there's no charges that that stick you still have that on your record like Eddie Bravo got arrested once for legally having a gun he got pulled over for a traffic violation this is when he was working for a check-cashing company needs to carry around a big bag of cash with him and he had a carry a gun with him and it was totally legal but he had done something like not stopping at a stop sign or something like that so they pull him over he said I just want to let you know I have a gun a loaded gun in the car because I do this they arrested him they released him because you know it was all correct they check his paperwork it's all good doesn't matter it every time he goes to Canada every single time he gets pulled aside and they check his shit and asking questions and it takes like an extra hour and a half I got stuck with him the last time knowing its really annoying yeah and you know he had no record I mean he did nothing you know and never it never stuck as a record but just the fact that he was even arrested yeah yeah just big roided guy one time standing there all messed when you go to get that hiroi to the bag yes I did that same line or nothing also in America really thing I came back from Japan same to be the same guy did ask you they always ask me write song yeah yeah yeah you know but you want he's going to be a man girl yeah the bag the funny thing is you could say that roids are for faggots and he won't say anything because no guy on roids everyone said MIT there are Detroit yeah fucking most gigantic ridiculous human beings every six meals a day how much pork all of us that the guy took that summer uh sarong skis no no that's the wrong skis this strongest men which is now ski puts in a ski they were saying that he ate took like a handy and Bacon's well you have a twelve part of making uh said something like say something sir heater purple yeah you fucked him so yeah yeah yeah yes not good your body's not supposed to look like that not supposed to that is not a fighter's build you know when you see these guys like there's guys in the UFC a lot of times in their first couple fights you'll see them they come in they're just too big it looks good and it might be good for the first thirty or forty seconds you know you can even really guerrilla fuck a guy for 30 or 40 seconds but then that lactic acid builds up crashing yeah I said it III I never cared about it and never forget if somebody said oh he's on roids I say you know I did do me it it is that you're insecure already you notice something wrong with you because you're not happy with yourself let's go to that and that bullshit think that they say you know it yeah but everybody does it I mean it's insane I did this for the amateurs they you know it dated the camo I'm the board of the camera right and they asked me to go and camera was the four people no no the California amateur mixed martial arts organization yep and they asked me to speak to the guys you know to help a lot of the future ones InterPro what to watch out for and then the last the most important thing what is the most important thing they said I said well don't do roids I mean if you if you already did roids or are thinking about doing words I mean you might as well stop your career because in this particular stage right now if you're already thinking about it you're gonna fail are you gonna be a loser because you you want roids I never got that and how danger is it you know what I hear the EPO you know people doing that I go Matt it doesn't that make you blood really thick mm very dangerous and very common by the way yeah guy boxers been caught with his Sugar Shane Mosley got caught with it you know EPO is what they always accused cyclists of using yeah yeah it was a professional cyclist and he was on it and he said that when he was on a tour they were on a tour with they would ride on a bus and then they would you know they compete in these tournaments and these are races rather and you would hear guys in the middle of the night unrack their bikes and go ride they had to heart out or something well you much blood too much blood builds up in your body because what what EPO simulates is it's like artificial altitude you know like to see how the effect that happens at altitude where your blood thickens because you need more oxygen because it's a low oxygen environment so these guys and they take this EPO they have to exercise well wake up at like 3 o'clock in the morning and they're like their parts all fucked up and they gotta get on the bike and go yeah it's gonna have a heart attack or something yeah yeah yeah you could have strokes you can it's very dangerous I know mixed martial arts guys that have done it and I know guys that have done it that you know their trainer found out like after the fight and they were like what the fuck man you got to let us know that you doing this so if you get knocked out we can tell the doctor hey here's something you didn't consider you guys on fucking EPO you know use the pen as a syringe you know you need to involve like this because it's so thick Joe McCarthy and I said you know what the new or no no he asked me says you know what the newest drug is like a for fighting I said tell I said um viagra and he goes how do you know that I say I read an article about it like a week before that and apparently guys are doing that taking Viagra and apparently Vegas is one of these wonder things it's really good for your kidneys for what pressure for I mean I read an article in yeah that's why it's magazine any of us like raving about it it's a real good medicine apparently but can you imagine well what it does is it increases your nitric oxide and all those supplements that people take you know nitric burn and all these different nitric flood all these different things this is the exact same thing increases your nitric oxide though your dick gets art so quick your muscles fucking flare veins get bigger stuff happy mmm definitely yeah until it goes to the ground then it'd be uncomfortable that's what I'm sure you have a dick that could fit into one of those Japanese master yeah that was funny you're one of the guys that you're one of the few guys that has gone through a mixed martial arts career and has successfully brought a transition to a broadcasting career I mean you you made you you're very smart and how you handled it because first of all you didn't take too many fights you didn't go with your ego and have fights after you weren't were you were busy with other things that weren't fully concentrated on it you stepped away in full health yep you know how did you manage to do that mmm oh not full health not full health my knees were very bothering me and one of the worst thing that is tendinitis in both of my arms yeah and if that hits if that starts then it's you either did you how could you ever that you have ever had yes yeah okay now I've got both here in the arms upstairs and if it hits it's about a five forty five minutes our a pain which is unimaginable Israel yeah you have no clue it's like coming from the outside it's like yeah it's you can't describe it there's no pain like it and there's nothing you can do you can take pain pills for it nothing why if the writer I would lose weight you know so when I made that come back in 2006 six weeks before it hit it you know I had nine weeks to prepare and I think two times three times five days I took off that I literally only worked my leg said because I had two tendinitis and then because you lose weight from the pain and then start realizing okay this is the reason that I stopped because it's not fun anymore you know you're underground everything hurts I was I was rolling with in Eddie's class and with the Goliath you remember the big guy there and and I was gonna fight a little bald oh and um chemo chemo a porno and he very much looks like him like built right I might get a role with you because I need to just get up and just strike get a respect and I had two tendinitis and I'd man everything was hurting and I could see everybody look like oh this boss wasn't you know so I go okay my please give me another you know so I got his number of five days later I said and I took five days off sec come back again and he was like well what's going on now because it's a whole different ballgame but so that means that every every time when you train with that it man it it's so much pain that yeah you lose weight you can't eat you know you have tears in your eyes from the pain is Wow and so what exactly is tendinitis what is it what is it from I have no clue and and you know what I realized that because in the early days when I did try Canfield I already had it there I think that it comes from all the courtesans that I took I was a very sick yet badass my bad ad Jima everywhere and they gave me a lot of courtesans you know the hordes were afraid something was gonna happen at the end and and that has an effect I hear on your skeleton you know it melts stay but I guess if it's attendance right Wow so you were you were a sick kid and you transitioned somehow into a martial arts champion Wow did you start training really hard because of your sickness because your asthma yeah I I I got bullied a lot III was a very lonely kid I was I was into trees I wa I had a really cool skill I could climb in a tree in the forest and I could like 45% of the forest I go go from treetop to treetop swinging yeah why I got the next Arzo freakin yeah they would go after you and you would jump from tree to tree like a monkey yeah that's what I did and and a few of them fell you know one was almost they almost didn't make it you know I mean his hat fell like next to a rock and what that scared everybody so much that that was my Harbor that was my safe harbor you know every time something happens I just climbed a tree and it was it but I think that that's where I got my athleticism from just climbing climbing all the time yeah that's fucking crazy it's amazing how many mixed martial artists were bullied you know I mean people look at a guy like you and they would go was no fucking way this guy was never bullied yeah that's it's amazing how much of that happens and what the fuck I mean how do you stop that shit from happening in school I know you're involved in a lot of anti-bullying programs and I've seen you do you know public service announcements and stuff like that how do you stop that in school you can you you know and it's it's hard you have to make sure that that the whole school knows like I would do how do you say that and um I would tell there if I if I would speak in front of those people that the bullies that there we gotta have sympathy for those guys I mean because obviously something's wrong with them they only can't team up you know to get somebody and they pick the weakest guy I mean seriously if you guys think this is school that's the biggest loser of the whole school and I think there's human nature thing it really is it's like it may probably get beat at home you know yeah and if you start talking like that but hopefully it rings a bell with the bully because otherwise she can't stop this you know you hear every now and then about guys for fighters who are bullies you know who you hear about bullying in the gym guys who are really good fucking other guys up like young guys a little lock about Hector Lombard you know I don't know if it's true but you hear a lot of stories about him beating the shit out of young guys and hurting people yeah you know and you know that that has to be something from their childhood it just has to something happened there yeah yeah it scary stuff you can you would think that a guy who's a trained fighter though you would think well that's I like that would be my solution like how do you get bullying out of the schools I really think you should teach kids how to fight I don't think they should have to fight but I think you know offer it in physical education offer it because for a man it's one of the most important things you could ever learn for developing your character for being just me being more confident and getting out aggression so you can think things more clearly I we at KTLA this morning at a gym I wish I was friction your gym by the way for people don't know you have a great gym in Thousand Oaks and how do people get there what is where's that what's the name of it it's Boston's Elite MMA it's on 8080 Hampshire wrote in thousands of there's a rare opportunity if you live in this area to train with you know a true legend and a party and I'm every day there I'm Trey of yenching every day so it's not like my name is of the gym and I'm not there I don't like this you know and so KTLA was at your gym KTLA was a gym Frank Shambala said Jim my friend hold McElhaney the guy from lights out a new TV show on FX great show and boxing shows yeah yeah his next heavyweight champion you know and now he's got a cope with all the problems you know it the money's gone and it's got a little bit Sopranos meets rocky meets you know like serious like that and um yeah all of us were bullied also Franco's was a little fat kid he said and then he also because he went to boarding school in Scotland is far to send him over there he was the only American there so that went broke and with me also it's yeah because of their actually mine and all of my asthma that's my own eczema yeah sure that how they fix that I grew over there you know what the weirdest thing is when I when I stepped into the state's when I was fighting in bankruptcy if you see some fights you know you'll see I still have everywhere have spots you know and when I came into America I think within a month everything I mean is almost disappearing like what's gone I think also the climate maybe has something to do with yeah I love this actually it's not too hot not too dry you know it's it's bad it's perfect it's a pretty good place yeah yeah we just said it right what do you hear about people in Minnesota freezing their dicks off give it to the states and say why doesn't everybody in America live here what would you do though there's no house yes there's a lot of people living in yeah there's a lot of people so um so you didn't exactly transition out without any pain that said that was one of the reasons why you you cut your fighting career shoes yeah yep yep that and my knees I have no cartilage of my kneecaps really which sounds as a very easy thing to fix but in reality it's the worst problem and he can have I mean the cartilage in between the knees for a bunch they can do something about that you know but cartridge on the kneecap they can't my friend has his knees resurfaced do you have them resurfaced with steel they put some sort of a steel or titanium plate over the knee my friend Steve was on the US Ski Team back in the 80s and he fucked his knees up really really bad like he's had I believe 16 or 17 surgeries on his knees and they're mangled and they just recently put artificial meniscus in place this like white padded stuff in between the knees and his cartilage is so chewed up that they actually resurfaced it with metal so he has like it like it's a crazy-looking thing man it's like metal like on top of kneecap I have it here somewhere my email I'll find it for you before we leave tonight so you can check it out but so there there is a solution that my friend Steve you know it's it's hard as they can't for instance they can put a kneecap in constant motion you know so it's not like you can put something on there and then because it gets ripped off right away again but it can do is like drill a hole in there and then I put a Teflon plate in it but then if you drilled a hole then he becomes 35 percent more weak so you have way more chance to break the knee and once you break any gap you know that's why it was my doctor said that's why they debuff yours is they break your kneecaps because that's like the worst thing to do to somebody yeah the needs of brutal man I've had I've had three knee operations mm-hmm I had my my left ACL reconstructed my meniscus scoped tomorrow I'll have my left knee yeah I got a picture of it here if you wanna check it out check this out real quick see that this is resurfacing this is where they took his cartilage was so fucked up took it off and they resurfaced it with steel and this white stuff in this picture this is the artificial meniscus I'll put this picture on Twitter Wow later on so pretty fucking man the stuff that they can't do nowadays is bizarre yeah it's pretty fucking crazy yeah I don't know I mean this is really new stuff that they're doing but I mean his knee looks like it looks like but how does he feel it feels great you see maybe we should talk to the wildest motherfucker I've ever met he was a flight surgeon he's in his 50s and he's still trying to fight he's crazy instead of his money you you it's a very hard thing to step away from yeah I know to come back to it it's it's very but when when I have students of mine or friends of my fighting it's I'm Way more nervous than they are it's like because you can't control it's like sitting next to the driver you know when they go fast you go like I rather have the wheel so I'm in control here you know and that's now it's hard there's there's no feeling like it like when you win or when you for six or eight weeks you work on just like five special combinations you know on the ground and standing and then to see if if you can land one of those and then 90% of the time you do you know it's something that you really worked on and then you land that thing and then it's like a hole-in-one I guess that's what I always say it has to be a feeling like that yeah well I think much crazier than that I think that it's just the ultimate gamble you know you're out there throwing your bones at some guy you know trying to hit his vital areas and it ain't just a regular guy it's a fucking expert and he's doing the exact same thing and so much of your success is based on how much dedication you have how much time you put in how much you can keep your shit together under pressure it's the ultimate high right when you win is the ultimate high it really is and what you say it's the the thing is can you I always say can you bring the dojo the way you fight and train err and spar there can you bring that game to the ring cuz I give you a problem that's nothing there's a big thing on depression right oh yeah you had a lot of guys fold like you'll see them though they'll do great and they'll be like dominating and then the guy will still be there yeah and then you see the adversity you see doubt you see all kinds of creepy things about you know whatever the fuck haunts their subconscious whatever the fuck is in their personality they don't like yeah you see its surface most of the time is that you you see a guy when to get hit him at a hard but a shot you know and it's most of the time to muscular guys by the way you get a and the big blown up dudes when they hit somebody with their best bang and the guy recovers and comes back then you see him go down or they haven't made a submission and they think they had him and then the guy escapes you know that's like a mental break for them and they give up it's like the weirdest thing you go whoa manage so good I know so many fighters who are like that and I show just do it again do it again and make it a little bit more tight why would you do that you know but never give up the fear of losing is a tremendous burden that a lot of guys have and it eventually manifests itself in a fight it's like they're so afraid of losing they're so afraid of fucking up that it just it just make it happen but it's afraid of losing in front of an audience because they have to listen to what those people gonna tell them what you should have done this and Chris Leben said is really funny a long time ago he says you got knocked out by Silva right and and then he said um it's bad if you go to the blockbuster and the guy behind the desk tells you what you should have done you know because everybody knows better and that's horrible that's why I say I say you fight for yourself you say Oh buster you fight for your family your wife and your kids no I fight for me because that takes a lot of pressure off because really think about this and if if you have a fellow fighter and you go both into a room you lock the door you guys fight do you really care if you lose I don't think I really care I love to win but you know I don't I don't know you know he's the best man that day he won this fight now if it's in front of an audience you got to go through all that BS that these these other people say who have no what it's all about but you see what I mean is all your fighting for those people and it's so much pressure that's why I stay away from the I'm gonna rip his head off I'm gonna do discipline it is that because all that they will play at the moment you walk through the cage and you hear yourself saying does it do hand right oh yeah because that's why I never did that because you put a lot of pressure on you now I better do what I said yeah guys I don't think guys realize it but you see it in their face sometimes when I step into the Octagon you see all the shit talking they've said and they're like here we go like wow what have I fucking done doesn't there's a few shit talkers who are actually really good you know Chael Sonnen it's pretty good that was yeah he's the bastard that's pretty good - George Burnett is really good at it - yeah yeah there's a few guys if you guys have noticed sling Margai show frank shamrock was good at it what comments may Candido made a whole career out of it all so you know you know and everybody said that those are not the guys that you see you know they're playing a smart game nigga yes yeah yeah he loves it he loves it and he's he's a really nice guy you know well he gets fired up though when he fights when he fights he's not such a nice guy yeah yeah that's the way psychological warfare is a part of fighting right that's it who can I always say who's got the biggest balls who who can you know keep keep on going that's why I always say stamina is the one number one thing you know that that's one thing they can never say for me am i all MMA career never run out of gas because that's the only thing you can control you know when you train go run an extra he'll do something I have nothing for calmer than losing how difficult was that for you though when you start to get the tendinitis because you know there's like the stamina from you know from grappling that you probably couldn't get like I know for a fact that Joe shook Osaka fight yeah when you fuck Osaka when you won the title right that's what you won the title no that was universe fight your title manaman when you when you fought Kousaka you had a problem like you couldn't do any grappling for a while right Dean you had a neck problem a neck problem I get against a Darrell Goler that wrestler very good I got him in a triangle at the gym and he lifted me up and he slammed me down with my neck into the corner yeah that took a long Gotye was the whole thing I just had surgery comes from death all the way back and that was the injury what was it was I have no clue but it was so painful I had a daughter at the time she was like 19 months old and she could not lay in my chest well I was cuffing you know and everything was I would it was funny because I had this big syringe of lidocaine and I'm injecting myself in between my ribs oh my god I love you if she comes in with the cameras right and that was at the time with the movie with Universal Soldier and these guys are freaking out you know coming to me good I said this is you know does the doctor notice my tokine is dangerous shit yeah but you have to watch out try to do but you know if they do it it always goes wrong because they can't feel where it is but I have to between every rip you have to do it yourself yeah lidocaine is like the gay cousin of cocaine no numbs things up when I got my nose fixed I got a deviated septum fixed and they squirt lidocaine out there when they're cleaning it out yes but it doesn't freak you out because they go up in your nose with a vacuum cleaner yeah it's like you know when you vacuum your car at the car wash and it gets stuck on the floor mat back your fucking skull right where your brain is when they're cleaning out you know blood clots and you know and then dried up boogers and shit and they spray lidocaine up there and I felt fucked up for the whole day like I was like what is wrong with me I'm like out of it and then I realized oh that lidocaine didn't I go online and I'm like what is the effects of lidocaine people fucking die from it girls that put it on their legs when they go to get their legs lasered they get the the hair lasered off their legs it's painful so they they cover their legs with lidocaine some girl died in her fucking car she covered her legs and lidocaine and then wrapped her legs up and she was OD dime and you're shooting it into your ribs in my ribs I used to many times that I would go to the fight and then one day I had my my wrestling shoes because we had to wear shoes at banquets they would be open like our an ankle injury and I would wait till they called my name because one time I broke my hand at the knuckle and they said all we put the lidocaine in there and it's gonna work for like an hour but it's not it's like 15 minutes you know especially but your heart rate is up it goes really fast so at the moment I stepped into the ring I go like you know so I did it on them at the moment they would call my name I would put it in and then hopefully I was not gonna feel it Wow yeah so you were fighting on lidocaine she shooted in you and then fight right because you could walk you know I yeah I made a really bad trip when I was running today before I jumped on the plane and it was against Vernon tiger white it was like my fourth fight or something summer there and and it's like it's unbelievable he takes me down and he goes for a toehold and that ankle like I mean it's like I'm sending out a signal you know take this there's a weird signal because whenever I get a tattoo somebody fucking slaps me with a tattoo it's always if you have an injury yeah here where you never get hit if you spar you're gonna get hit there that's it is what it is did you hurt your hand for sure someone's gonna squeeze it when they shake whole year without a guy giving you one of those douchey handshakes you know that's DC handshakes where he grabs a tip your father yeah fuck is that about it secured and you'll go a year for with that out but if you hurt your hand it's right away that's the first thing that's gonna happen because that it fucking strain that's the same you got two lines you always big the line that's the long exposure this one is way longer you ready shortest and they go this guy comes for a break and the fucking replacement comes in they're gonna redo the register yeah and it check though your old grandmother you know oh sorry I gotta take another one when I see people paying with checks I'm like why don't you just fucking whip out beaver pelt I can I thought one the other day at the grocery store it's like really you're still using this yeah that's where last time I saw it too was at the grocery store yeah checks people allow you to just write on a piece of paper yeah The Big Lebowski it's like 70 nights milk yeah so if you didn't have all these injuries do you think you would have kept going or do you think I think it would have kept going a few more months a few more years yeah because it was not a problem with not having stamina and you know always been very blessed with my body you know not good people look at me now the whole time but they say oh my god how much you're trained well I didn't train for a year you know it's like I I just genetically but he put together because of my dad my brother has the same he's a lawyer but you look this is a safe he's got no fat it's just good just good base good jeans yeah the wall athletes the roots inside you know so yeah never had a problem then what's the question the question was whether or not you would keep going oh yeah you know like I said there's nothing like it but at the moment the fun is gone out of training the training would be so much fun for me because you know somebody everything you know when you roll every time something pops up oh god that's cool yeah man it's a new thing and they start using other people and works and works and works works oh my god this is great you know and every time a new a little teaser somebody shows you the other little thing like it really for you guillotine choke do it like this because they can't escape no surge of pain is shot you may go it's like bizarre things that again that any legislation yeah and you know and it's so cool but then the way you have to paint the whole time it takes the pleasure out of it there are chefs no more fun what's the use of sticky so you can't roll it all right now no no and especially just asked about surgery but this surgery is the same surgery from the dow goal our incident that he's just had I don't know I think it added on maybe you know that was the first time I got hurt though yeah what was the actual surgery would they have done between see four or five and five or six minor so flat squashed so I lost at two feet my whole arm and shoulder so now they home two holes open around it they made so that nerves are they could breathe again so a lot of guys get that the Joe say Aldo just got that he has a nerve issue as well no a long genome and Carwin Carwin had it as well he just had surgery on it Carlin did oh my god that for Jose Aldo based one of my favorite two guys good that's not good man this is a bad injury because this is gonna take a long time I mean this is over two months ago and I III know this thing's like a push brush my teeth the harder a little bit harder when I push up in my carpet or I can shave my whole head now with the razor blade which I couldn't do before things like that but power-wise I do fifteen pounds that's it Wow yeah it's really it's really weak so when you roll around it's it's not fun you know of course they attack that arm there we go again Murphy's Law yeah everybody goes into that I had a gig out musashi was over and his brother and his brother said that nobody could they could break his grip at an arm bar I have a really weird way of putting an arm bar on but the way I do it nobody can escape you know and I do it I control the hand I make sure that the elbow points up you know and I controlled in such a way that your arm you can't get out I can just cover your face the other leg I just can put it away and you still can't get out really yeah and he said to me oh but you can do it on me so I'm trying trying I can't break because apparently he's known for its very strong and he says see see a guy say flipper out he says why I said this is my wrong arm so I cut the other side to go right away I said listen I can't do 50 pounds with this you know it's a very weak arm right now so is it eventually gonna come back to hundred percent you know if they say it's like a millimeter today and it's two months ago so that would be six centimeter go starting from my neck that's got to go all the way to here six centimeters of what of healing I feel like the nerve heals like a millimeter a day they say okay yeah so nine months to a year I should expect at least he said he says it comes back because I was very late with it they misdiagnosed me so I walked around with this thing for a long time so what is the thing that what was the actual injury so it's the compression of the depression and the pain all the hard pain that I had that was the the nerve apparently is all bunch of little cables she says and outside there's the pain thing you know once you squeeze that you know you're already really far gone and that happened with me I had no pain anymore and he says man that's the worst thing because that means that's already died so you're damaging and you don't even feel it that's it Wow so yeah they go in there and they drill it out and then you you have to wait forever for it to heal up yeah Wow and there's nothing you can do in between town you just have to leave nothing I started actually yesterday and this I think two days ago I started running on a treadmill but only with the incline so I can roll in the balls of my feet so I don't have my knees shocking alright I'm actually feeling okay today my knees so I figured okay if I can do that then I can at least start doing my Sprint's again that I used to be a freak man I could these these what I do is I run ten miles 10 minutes 11 miles an hour that's the warmup Wow and then I jump off I start stretching while I put the ink line all the way up go to 9 miles an hour and then I jump on for 45 seconds and off for 30 and I do those 10 10 of those rounds and after that I run like five minutes to run it out done take a five-minute break and then I do my power training workout this is what when I was top of my game because that's really hard so you would do your sprints first and then you would do your power train way yeah that everybody thought it was fear but for me if you do the power feeling first it hinders you with your running sometimes I would do it to mimic the fights because that's what I think is the biggest problem with a lot of guys they don't realize that you you know you're pumping of it you should do apps a lot of apps before you fight and stretch them out because what happens is your abs they start filling up with like that's it behind your abs or your lungs and I said that's why you see the roid guys because they have that right away they go strong boom and then they drop and I think it really is because of the add today because if you if they do ten times this it's taste like this right it pops up while imagine that happens to your core and with everything while you're fighting you using your core takedown defense thing so that's not bloating up stops your lungs from breathing that's why you get that so you think the ABS are important for stamina that's what you're saying very important to keep them loose to keep them loose and to stretch them out this is very important I would take before a fight also aspirin you know to make my blood thin because I bet in Thai boxing I would never wear reps I don't like to have wraps around me so hey let's go bare-knuckle in the gloves and with the shoes I hated those things you know this was totally Japanese rules right the pain great shoes yeah because what happens is those Japanese guys do really good on the ground that's how they say okay and the striking not so okay so let's put them on shin guards let put them on knee protection and push shoes because they're good with leg locks and no gloves because that's a good for the rear naked choke channel I mean they're totally adapted when I left bank Rus I think two three months later it was they chased the rule so it was closed fist I go whoa I've been waiting for a long time for this yeah they had to try to adapt to be mixed martial arts yeah yeah eventually so is it pancreas where you hurt your knees I you know I don't know I I have no clue I think I'm so I'm very explosive and I think over the years that just scraped off of my things a bolt they say that bleeding bone marrow out of one knee so it's like yeah it's like very painful man it's uh it's not fun do you do any other martial arts exercise I know you have that thing that you sell well that's that's part of it because you you don't want to hit things right exactly like that yeah because it has no impact you don't have to get the tendonitis right every fighter should use that thing like twelve days before the fight not to have you back anymore that's what accidents happen you know you get tired sweat on the bag but your gloves and slips order it wrist hurts there's always things happen with a heavy backhand and they like to hit have your bag which I did also because it's it's a cool thing but there's always that moment when you hit really hard like a liver shot and you feel think right then I know okay tomorrow I got the tenon item did you develop this thing this is what it's called the BA system what is it what does it stand for the body action stand so what happen was this there's a long time ago a long time going to for years or something ago my agent tells me that this woman wants to see me they have a product and it started out with the stand with two of those kicking things you know like one don't ya know - so I came to her and I was hangover hungover there was one in the last period that I was still thinking and I walk in I said okay I'm telling you right now because you can breathe it get smell it I'm a little hangover let me take a look at this thing and I call you back tomorrow what I think so I looked at the thing in the next day I call Beck I said okay now this is what we should do and add this whole Israeli and she goes like whoa we thought you didn't notice anything yesterday I said no and then I came up to do a head to do a body patch you know I make targets on there and you know but then then it starts because people think this is an easy product there's knockoffs from these things right they're already selling knockoffs if you buy that thing then you're real that was like our early stages what you're gonna have they're gonna flop around they're gonna break because you need to find a spring that is just right to not be too floppy and not too stiff if it's too stiff the whole stand will move if it's too floppy you can't knock it for the second punch because it's still moving you know it needs to be just right now the foam in there needs to be just right now foam the density the density if it's really tight foam it's heavier you know so if you say okay it is a little bit too hard I want different foam to put different foam but now because it's lighter then the spring needs to be changed again so every time I got like eight prototypes and I have to train on those things the whole time to see and find out which is watching what's the best weight and the best foam with what spring it took two and a half years nearly two and a half years to find that they hit that thing I mean 30,000 time with the machine Gong Gong Gong that thing when you buy a won't break - guys there was two heads broke but that was from a shipment that we right away took out because it was something with the glue that was that it didn't connect up that it was it was vaporizing or eating the glue so it didn't work there was stew only we sent a new heads back and we never be sold a lot of those things no problem no bro do you use those yourself do you use every time when I train yeah but I now right now I can't I use a lot I can't do hooks like she that's we have to great angle for me in uppercuts if I make ten uppercuts the last type of guns goes slow up because it's yes biceps now you really realize that you need your biceps in order to put your body weight into a punch you can't look it up now a straight punch I'm okay with but hooks I can eat but the glove I can hit you as hard as I want to your belly you're not going to go down really yeah it's really but it's pathetic but I like why did you like having no raps on I always have that I want to have my blood flow keep going for some reason I have the feeling that this happens that it doesn't circulate any more naturally so bathroom and you get a tight wrap yeah yeah I don't like it and you don't need it if you hit the right way all these guys are so like like Tyson I always give the example just know or just learn how to hit the correct way and nothing will happen these guys they come in the room and they got the special guys that they got a stitch they're on call every day two times a day to wrap the hands perfect he can hit it in any angle that doesn't matter so then when you when this guy that's why when he had a street fight he would always break his hand right Tyson because you don't know how did he hit some with the pinky or whatever wrong technique but isn't it hard when you're fighting because guys move and sometimes you wanted to hit him with these two knuckles be accidentally catch them with the the last knuckle you know of course that it's always it's yeah you know specially in karate with the cubish in karate or sparring in it's bare-knuckle and some of these guys they have a gay and some guys have their hips here right mhmmm said that's how I broke this one oh so you hit a hip you can think you have to get the liver it's a it's a hip bone yeah that Dow hotel that was the good thing in mixed martial arts because now you can see what you hit everything did you start it out you started out and Taekwondo is that were you Taekwondo that was my first sport yeah I did that for about I don't know four weeks or six weeks and I was already beating up the brown bells yes understand my my parents are very conservative I never never allow me to do martial arts but but I always got bullet and saw a Bruce Lee movie in 76 and to the Dragon Inn in France when we were on the holiday and I came out and say that's it I want to be Bruce Lee you know so I made these nude shots and I was only like kung fu shoes I had all the Lance I was really so I I asked my parents please please please please but they won't allow me so I kept going kept training myself so watching moves and just kept training and then finally after two years they said okay you know stop asking crises go and we had a neighbor the girl next door she had a boyfriend who was the cool guy from the town and he said okay come with me I need to be kind of under a swing and and I went really good I started being up like I said the brown belts out like within six weeks she's a man you got a good feeling show my confidence rose and at that moment I was driving riding my bike on the street and the biggest bully comes with six of his buddies or something and they said something and I started something back and they all laugh were laughing and they right away came after me and when I saw them coming from me I stopped my bike and I put it down and I was just waiting for the guy and then the biggest bully comes to me and he's pleased you know that in the early days you push with your chest right and he pushed against my chest and I go puff and he goes down broke his nose out anybody more nobody did anything I come home police was already home and that was it no more Taekwondo for me sir but I moved at a husband I was 21 you know that's when I started fighting that's when you start kickboxing and everything boxing yeah Muay Thai and how did you transition into pancrase where'd that come about you know this is oh it's cool we got time right yeah ok cool now um let me go back cuz that me she I was fighting Thai boxing in Holland I want a lot of fights but no I like my first 14 fights I won by not character 13 in the first one in front one I was sick what was your uh your final kickboxing record when you in 1616 and two now 14 wins two losses so I fought this guy who was in jail for that Frankl Altman very powerful fighter had a record like 52 with like three losses of like 48 not got some monster no apparently I was a bouncer at the time apparently on New Year's Day when I was bouncing him was also drunk that's an example and somebody asked me if I wanted to fight him and I said sure so in I think like the end of January I get a phone call they asked me we have to send the posters too and I said what pulses from the fights she was gonna fight you again slope Minh and I go ooh who said that he said you you told me that you gotta fight it fuck so now they had posters already I got okay you know like might as well yeah I got a do now because otherwise you're gonna think I'm scared right so I had about five weeks to Train now you got to understand that I I got tired from jumping rope the first time I was so out of shape but was not even funny so anyway I go to the fights and I just had my my knee my shin at this this year there was a huge hole I I did some crazy stuff on a wall there was a wall I jumped on I I was always really good in jumping up like a wrangle build it you know I could jump this high like my chest here I would stand in front of it and jump on a wall but it had been raining and I jumped on it my toasts lit up and I landed on my shin on it I said I ripped my shin open so the day of the fight was all wild fleshie we had to tape you know and they it was like a super glue and everything in my friend friend says ok lidocaine there it is again right he says you know I said just put it right he says no we'll numb up the whole AK you know don't worry about it he says and he said he put it in my butt so you know the leg would be numb and you'll see that fight you'll see that fight I'm like jumping I've never jumped when I fight and the whole time I'm you know and I'm shaking my leg and I can't feel my leg it's like the weirdest thing either No so then it they said that was it not guy wasn't no guy would you look at the fight you'll see I don't think he even hits me but I I'm landing on my butt and I want to get up and I can't get up my leg doesn't work and I go whoa you know I said man my leg doesn't work you know so and they refuse stop the fight then all the people start saying see I always said that he cannot fight so that really bugged me of course anyway I said okay I'll fight another fight shouldn't have done it either because under through three days or four days before the fight I helped the body of my out they really beat the crap out of me at this jaw all the way wired you know and this is Martha's claws so we we went to the guys who did it and we got in a little scuffle there of course and they threw me in jail for a couple of days in the jail yeah that's a long time ago in the jail I have for some reason I got an infection in one of my testicles whoa and a big game like really big and it was hurting a lot and they let me out you know because it was only a few days so what they did the whole test and they found out that you know what the guys did they say you know what we don't we're not gonna bring it to court you know they kind of felt that we were right you know doing what we did anyway I still fought and I shouldn't have taken a fight I knocked the guy down three times in the first round and then and and then actually I I win I make a spinning of a back fist oh yeah that was it he's standing in front of me and I'm so tired you know my body so I go boom I make give him a beca's in his neck he goes down and I so I think I want to fight and apparently like a month before there was a rule that if you did a back fist you only could do it with the turn some bullshit yeah it was bullshit anyway I couldn't come out for the second round because I was too tired they said okay now it really started homes you see I always said and you use not so good a blah blah but I say okay I never fight for Hollins anymore this is over you know I if these fans I like this I I don't want to fight it for other people like this but I was always yeah it is because you know it's your life and but it was always that I wanted to do something with martial arts so a buddy of mine we both together we made this show it's like an and a martial arts show on music and we start doing this in like nightclubs and we would like but really cool really cool stuff I would kick him in the belly like Bruce Lee and that's a dragon right you will grab my foot throw me back and I would make us flying look at this and yeah in his phase that land and you know we do all that cool stuff we I will come on with like an the cartwheel flick flag and that's the way we would hop to a walk to the place and we had both and we did new chucks and we did like break that's the crazy stuff and little cups on his mouth I will kick the best-fitting back here and jump up and jumping flying backing the cup off his hat you know so good quality martial arts but we started putting comedy in there also like funny things that for instance I would I would stand there very serious with the suit and I go look at the cups and the guy would come back and he had done these little cups and I kept looking straight to go no the other ones what the other ones okay so then he would walk and he would come back with cops like this he like stuff like that we start doing stuff like that it he would to heaven this is also funny one we I would do a brake tester the same thing you know he would come with to break to Stanko other ones you know so then he came back and he had like these these wooden things there were this thick you know things and he was pretty much like a dick car and I would like pick one right and he would hold it and then would stand in front of it that I go and he would buy because of fear he will break it all right now it's not like that we we do it and that caught on real fast people really started and seem to like that so suddenly we were doing this on bigger shows first at nightclubs then we start doing it on shows like events big events what came and when he was fighting I think that when he had the main event one time we were in the break you know showing this to the people so that got aired and then we were on Dutch TV and then your Eurosport saw it and they had an event yearly in in France and we went to there and we started traveling now and doing these shows all over the place and comedy was always the thing once we start doing the comedy people who know me is there's a few of those things on YouTube Baxter so on one of these shows because we came up with all these place flexing some salt and all that stuff Chris Dolman was sitting there and Chris Dolman is one of the forefathers in Holland was a judo champion tough guy you know and he called me to him and he says man you you you got some really good abilities man did you ever think about free fighting you know what is she says no he says well we do that in Japan are you interested I say sure because they go okay that's not Holland that's Japan right so he says come and try it out so I walk in there and at that moment I was you know European champion Thai boxing so it was because the dose to flex words for a title so I thought I was the cool do it and and that was literally like hoist Gracie in the beginning you know I walk in and they killed me and they will put on these chokes not blood jokes but like on my windpipe you know and pulling pulling pulling because those are grappling back then zero did you know that they were gonna Grandpa when you went there no no nothing nothing I had no clue I saw him on the ground and then they say okay just go whoa no so you showed up you just thought it was just some kind of a crazy fight you had no idea so we're training and I literally when I drove back I had to stop my car next to the road and I had one of the first Philips telephones cell phones it was really cool at the time I remember these Chinese and I called my wife I said listen I'm um and my carnation is wrote here I'm gonna sleep I say I can drive it broke me I really I I had to drink liquid food for like three days because my whole throat was messed up because I thought I could hold that you know so I was just fighting it and they were pulling pulling till yeah at the end I with that but it was all crushed up and and my wife was already left me she says ah okay so that's it right I said no no I'm gonna go back and within six months three six months I'm gonna tap everybody there you know because did I want to learn this I want to learn this game but things started happening and and I got an injury here an injury there and I had to work and it was a bouncer and and you know I once a month I would go over there and it kind of faded away then my wife looks at me or in the beginning of our career she says you're gonna be a famous fighter in Japan and I go well buddy say that sister that just came up with me I said now I'm not gonna fight anymore I told you she said yeah you said Holland but you're gonna go to Japan six months after she made that comment I got a phone call and I never pick up the phone and an answering machine was broke or turned off because my crazy so I was calling all the times I didn't turn on so I get the I pick up the phone for some reason and it's crystal man he says boss you gotta come tonight you gotta come to them so them there's a tryout just two guys just uzuki of Iraqis are looking for fighters for a new organization bankers so I went to the tryout I had a scuffle with one of the range champion because they were fighting for rings but it was a lot of work I heard already that they were having works which I works we mean fixed fight takes fight there was a lot of that Pancrase right no and there wasn't rings in bankers I will come back with no no I believe showed that there was but enough what the people said like they never asked me welcome back to that oh so anyway because he told me the right there he says you know it's probably gonna ask you a little later if you were to lose fight anyway I started sparring with this guy this by a guy was a ring champion he tried to hurt me because they were filming result was me knocking him out with a high kick boom and it's he is all over I was open he had to go to the hospital four stages Suzuki of Funaki I saw them pointing at me so they want to be I think two months two and half months later I was in Japan and and and before I went I got that speech from chris doumitt he says they're probably gonna ask you you know to to lose what to win a fight a sick person I don't want to do that if I want to if I fight it needs to be real otherwise I don't I hated those guys who were there and they they would come back and they would say yeah champion and and and I said they were all cool but that money came back and they have to lose they would come back and they say yeah I lost but you know you know they had to lose yeah last time they made you win you know but you don't say that but you only say it when you lose I hated those guys with that you know you're not a real guy so I'm not the first guy out and in the second fight I know the other guy out foo K and then by the way we had dinner with foo nakiye Suzuki neither Gaga's here we go you know so dinner they gave me a book from Fujiwara really wrestler and oh yeah great dinner and they put me on a cab and just before they walked it I do all I say I thought you guys were gonna ask me so he said what do you mean he says well chris doumitt told me that you know that do you probably gonna ask to to to throw the fight and Sookie told me straight in my face I will never ask you such a thing he said we will never do that now over the years I've been hearing of course and some fights when you look at fights it looks really smooth and going over and like Ken Shamrock said he lost also he lost the lost fights were all works you know it's also you go like okay he lost twice by exactly the same combination and he look into a kneebar against the same opponent there you go like if it was not real wouldn't you come up with something else would you really do two times the same you see so that's been also in my head I guess you ever see Bart Vale versus Ken Shamrock no it looks so fake it's one of the early ones that looks really like a work there's a few that look like a really like oh yeah that's one of them you know you've seen the ones in Pride like remember when Coleman oh I gotta know you're commentating on that one you would oh my god they hated my guts because there's the funniest thing ever we knew that Coleman was gonna lose his six minutes for the heel hook right new that's was the word I heard that so when the reporters came in they asked me who do you think he's gonna win and I say I think the kana is gonna win and about six minutes with the hill and they went around and they changed it's a bit like faster or something they didn't really didn't like that that I was doing that why would I go like that's that's something again I can that's why I get sometimes I get emotional from it when people say oh it was so fake and then the worst one what they say is yeah but sometimes it was fake and boss didn't know of it so they told the opponent to lose against us you know like against I fought against Funaki and then one guy said one time he said yeah that wasn't work because she didn't hurt you I said when did he decide that he was gonna lose was it before or after he tried to break my freaking leg I mean I know if you don't if you see the fight he'll hook and inverted he'll look with the toes in his neck and my heel is a hundred and eighty degrees there I'm literally looking at my old leg and I go oh my god I don't feel that you know that I thought nobody else what that was a big risk what he was going to take if this was a fake fight right yeah I need that they're like two or three times so you see my leg completely be turned the other way did you suffer any damage because no I have no clue however as he look is one of the worst is the worst one I broke this this I'm walking on the street right and we should certainly be here with all the fights for your hybrids wrestling playing for us and we look and there's this giant screen and the first thing you see is me both keeping a palm strike and the guy goes down and we go yeah you know it's the promo for the next day so I see this guy Takahashi sitting in an inn in a half guard and he grabs a heel and he falls back and I go this is at the time I had nobody to roll with right I traded on the back two times a day to my first year to have a bank was wasn't be trading on the back pretty much what's wrestling no no no very much nothing like beat you rolling a rock if there was somebody who knew judo he would come I mean I'm talking about once every three weeks I'm not kidding so next day I'm in that position and I go uh might as well try right so I grab that heel but since I never did it I didn't realize how much pressure I put on so I grabbed it and I fall back using my bodyweight I snapped the shin in out so first we here vehicle you know so I got whoa you see me letting go and then he feels his knee and he's like do I feel you want to fight you say yeah but I go like what dude night I hurt you nice nap because we thought it was a knee but apparently he was still like a little stuck on that leg so then he kicks with that left and I flex my muscle and then when he puts the foot down it bends all the way out do you know that's that I've seen I've seen a few times we checked legs only in person wants Cory hill and I forget we fought Branson no hotels his name anyway whoever he fought he he checks his kick and Cory Hills leg snaps back where its referee didn't even see it so before he goes down the referee was in a bad angle we're all screaming stopped a fight didn't even know and he's just on his back like freaking out that's dangerous man especially this chin when it's split hurt you know and it hits a wrong you can pin it out do you bleed out the guy that you you you showed me I think on Twitter you send a tweet with the guy who's fighting with the broken arm yeah remember I mean how tough is that dude and he didn't feel it then the referee saw it in around three and then they stopped the fight but this guy was just going and not landing the other guy with it it was unbelievable these guys were actually really good I go what organization was that well you know richer Rich Franklin when he fought Chuck Liddell was an army punched chuck with it after it was broken yes God so you went and after you fought your fighting crew was done then you started doing the commentary in in Japan you did a couple fights after that the Ruben Villarreal fight you have the WUF a young what whatever was that I would have marker and Marco who was a Pedro hizo and all these guys that were training with us in the Beverly Hills jiu-jitsu club but I would train those guys and I would go with them as corner man and in in Japan when you when you fight you see the fights are on in the dressing room so I'm sitting I'm watching there and Yukino and and he de aqui those two guys the the people from prides who live in America you know who are the in between persons or to say are there also and I go like oh look at that he's gonna go for straight armbar it sounds right on my charts like shocked there he comes here we come boom and the guys got straight armor so they look at me and then the next fight it's right away also again I said oh my god he's looking for Annie Barlow he's gonna roll in alive I said he's gonna roll is gonna go for any book and she's on a few rolls and it goes for anybody they go like how do you notice I said well you can see the setup and they look at each other and said did you ever think about being a commentator and that's how I got the job who was doing it before you nobody because they were looking at that moment they were looking at and new people because they had the first nine or something mm Quadros and I we did that in a studio later you know yeah but but I we I think the first one was cuz that no Eddie did it with Quadros for a while Eddie Bravo also yeah and you came which way she oh it's great she was the first one I was there that was the first one I think they got broadcasted to the snail this is it after you fought in the UFC after you'd won the title did you you'd completely done I mean you obviously had another fight in the WUF after that what was it like being there and pride during the glory days and you know did you think about making comebacks because I know there was I made yeah yeah no I did I did it was two times two times one time it was against Vendela Silva yeah because they needed an opponent for him that wasn't the event that that that dynamite if a 91 and a half thousand people man life outside crazy you know and they couldn't fight an opponent and I said listen I did a role for a long time because that problems I said but everybody wants to see a strike anyway why and enter was also I had the same card was to k1 you remember jerome lebanner was fighting on fright k1 rules mhm so I said so why don't we do k1 rules with MMA gloves I mean that's what the people want to see anyway you know from us too but that that fight didn't go through they took somebody else and yeah that would have been awesome because at that time you man I I was I was hurting like my guy who holds have the Thai pets I mean he moved to have purple arms he was got my god this is no fun anymore you know because I was in shape you know I had a real good stamina fuck that would have been a great Wanderlei holy shit a pure stand-up fight and then and then when when Ken came to pride I was the first one to say I say I come out of retirement if you if I can find him I can't say no we did it already I swear we don't need to do it the third time really so he declined to fight in Pride with you yeah that's what he came personally to tell me he says boss I told him that I didn't want to do because you were worried for two times what does that mean yeah well any fun Pancrase he never fought in there man I would have loved but but also at that time I was a totally different fighter like he can't can't fight against me made me who I am that that fight was like literally God was watching and he says okay I give you this one guy to train with in the hall a 19 year old Leon Van Dyke freaking monster he did on a machine with 275 pounds he would do curls it was bizarre I would have him in an armbar better do two hands because he literally would start doing this this is insanely strong and I started trading or both we didn't know anything and we would watch tapes I would watch tapes I would see a hill hoop for instance I will write down how it works next day we start rolling I will go he loco hill ok say ok now let's break this time let's see how we can make it better say ok how can you escape well if I push this way ok so I can I stop you from doing this and we start breaking down every little thing I say ok basically did it by yourself for everything every level instruction at all nothing wanted everything myself and you know and that's the cool part because what my time I got a phone call by my big DVDs if combats came out and I was at the time and BJ farts mad use all the way back and BJ caught me and I say bosses BJ should be Japan yeah I said Wow I say what do I owe this pleasure for is I just want to tell you made the best instruction that I've ever seen that's a man that is so cool he says you got to go I get us do my run say what let me can I use your quote but that's cool stuff and I saw and I realized also that a lot of people a lot of fighters took everything straight up Jitsu and they put it into mixed martial arts and a lot of stuff straighter jiu-jitsu doesn't work it makes martial arts because it needs to be more compact like a the sleeve will will take care of that it's harder for you to roll out of an armbar so that's why when are bars with me I always control the inside of the hand so yeah you get rotate your hand whatever armbar pretty much I do it's always control control because they don't want to rotate you know and I bet he looks at we start breaking everything down and I say okay if I would tap in for instance within an armbar from the mount to I'm just making something up he would after three times he wouldn't know my setup so I would create a different way to go to the lombardi would find that were out and then I would create a different way so then suddenly I start for every move I started having three or four different ways to go to that submission and then I start tossing those around that seems so crazy it's like you had to learn jujitsu on your own on my own you had to figure it out like look at how people were doing it and deacons doing it and then my next eight fights I trained for three months I think two times a day sometimes I would wake up at night would call him and we go he think I was always game always and we were trained and my next eight fights I won by submission that's ridiculous yeah so when did you ever get real legitimate jujitsu instruction did you get someone who never never your whole career you're self-taught yeah everything that's cool Wow and the cool part and I always said it's because I'm very proud of it and that's why I'm saying it it's you if you look at the record in bank runs that rope escapes right that means that if you could get in the choke but you could touch the rope they're gonna let you go it's religion but but uh but on the other side it's really good for you as a fighter to develop because now you have to make me more strategical now you have to make sure that you have them in the center of the ring before you go so do that again if you're gonna miss it you're in the center of the ring so there's more thinking which sometimes I want to fight with like for submissions so instead of going out there I had now for submission victories pretty much in one fight and I think that that's why the bankers guys were so good in the UFC I think six or seven guys from bankers became all you see champion because they of that rule I truly believe I I know it's crazy I always said as long as I don't get have to escape because if I escape for me that would feel like a loss but I didn't see so even allowing them to escape to you it's good because it just means you get more submission work and say you feel like you won you want already and now let's do that let's do it again and then if you look at the waste I submitted people you can call a submission okay a go-go blood I didn't do but you can come up with some crazy stuff I put in everything he looks normally he looking for the knee bar triangle choke triangle arm or a fake force how many fights did you have over in Pancrase 31 dirty ones yeah holy shit over the course of how many years that was only of course five years I fought the first year for nine fights in the second nine again one night aid again I mean I was I go I fought that in a pretty short time so by the time you got to the UFC you had shitload of fight cycle all the boy toy fights all the Pancrase fights and then finally you got to fight MMA style finally because I I wanted to go to the UFC for them for the entrance son I kid you not I thought that was the coolest thing do from Eindhoven horns you know I want to come up with that song that is so cool and that really that's that they kept asking me I said but that was the deciding factor that I said okay I want to do it because they just loved that stuff and then they promoted the shit out of you when you first came I remember that I gave you one of the posters that Bryan sold it on eBay after all the world's best but it was school and and and I had a great idea why I had that the 3-2 Norse you know Pavarotti and all these these guys they had this they didn't at or and on one of those strikes is I like to be in America and it's a forty three second clip and I told them I said I liked America you know and I thought okay please let me put on that clip for 43 seconds and then do UFC tune comes up I mean I'm gonna score for every fighter I always got that that's right did you read the script already for Kevin's movie no I haven't read it okay because you're in it right yeah yeah so it's really telling James you don't know it was trained with you a bunch of times right yeah yeah yeah he did it's very talented martial artist he really is people gonna you know people who are talking a lot of shit like Kevin James the comedian yeah I'm gonna do a UFC movie Kevin James can hit the fucking shit out of the past when I was in Boston when I was doing that a zookeeper movie with him we train with Mark Telegraaf a it was like god damn dude his fucking technique it's a crit and you know what if you if you if I say okay you need to open you up a little bit more do it he'll do it the next I'm very smart dude yeah see buddy as he hates it when we say this because she said oh I don't want to people you know I'm just he's a very very very humble guy yes for a successful successful guys I am I met him when he lived on that apartment on Overland and a one-bedroom apartment she shared with another guy yeah and now he lives in the house yeah you know where you live and then you go like he's the same dude same guy same guy I know you haven't since he was basically an open mic girl I just want to talk to his my manager into signing him oh wow you'd only been doing comedy just like me we were both basically open my kurzweil a little bit of professional work but I mean been doing comedy - three years you're really an open mic oh that's getting paid you're an amateur right basically that's when Kevin and I met and we've been like shit 91 maybe 92 yeah he said that you and he would watch the bank response used to come over my house and Encino we would watch him man yeah I had a buddy of mine from Canada who would get them from Japan yeah they're a connection in Japan so he would get them they would send him to Canada and then he would send them from Canada to me and then we would watch him at my house got all Japanese commentary you know I watched all of them I watched you know I did get a stack of them every month yeah this was before I was even working for the UFC yeah there was a you know before I ever even started thinking about doing commentary yeah yeah we were just fans that's well how did you ever get in there because you went from fear factor before that I started working in 97 before you came to the UFC I'd done done the post fight interviews Oh two years I started at UFC 12 Dothan Alabama Vitor Belfort debut okay and I did it then I was on Newsradio and what happened was they just needed a guy to do the post fight interviews they didn't have anybody and my manager was friends with the guy who the same guy who signed Kevin I was my manager was friends with the guy who was one of the producers of the show's got Campbell McLaren was also the guy who tried to get me to fight Wesley Snipes one day so yeah they they needed someone to do the post-fight interviews and so he just sent me to fucking Alabama out of nowhere and before you know and I'm doing it was very unorganized though it's not like the UFC today I did it for you know maybe two years but I saw a lot of great fights you know shamrock versus an ova Frank I shall Randy Couture's debut vitor belfort debut Dan Henderson's debut I was there for a lot of great great fights but it started to cost me money so I quit yeah it was like I would make more money doing comedy than that so it was a little too and I was on Newsradio at the time the sitcom so I was I was too busy so I quit and then when the UFC came along when Zuffa rather purchased the UFC then I started working for them that was light and and what did you feel fear factor that was at that time also yeah - pure fact it was 2001 I believe it started and I was already on fear factor when I started working for the UFC that I did it as a favor the first I think eight shows I did for free yeah I just said you know they wanted me to do commentary and it's like alright I'll do it I'll sit in there oh yeah I just was just talking you know yeah really honestly I shouldn't have been paying for the first ones I was fighting you you don't care about money but until you know so there you go like okay well actually should get pay first then it became you know became the thing that I enjoyed most I mean it's like stand-up comedy I enjoy the most I'll always be a fan of mixed martial arts even when I'm not doing if I retire one day and stop doing commentary I'm always gonna watch the fight was gonna be a fan but I'm always gonna do stand-up comedy as a profession so that's my number one thing but other than that all the things that I've ever done in my life like you have or a fear factor or a news radio or the UFC's the greatest fucking job ever I mean I love it I always loved also in Japan I I will say tomorrow say tomorrow we're only two in six billion right now who see freaking phaidor versus cro cop yeah phaidor and Nogueira you know Dukes epic fights and and Fendley Silvan I elating you know crazy stuff and they were there for some prime prize for people who don't know weren't aware of pride pride and even the heyday was one of the best if not the best argument organization in the world because they had so many different rules first of all they a lot of things that I like they had ten minutes for the first round not like that because then you know a lot of times a guy would take a guy down with five minutes into the fight and then the round would end yeah you know and he was just starting to get and impose his part of the game yeah but in the in the the pride rules they would give him a full 10-minute first round and they allowed soccer kicks and stomps I mean it was a lot more lays and no elbows on the ground no elbow you have less cuts I that's that's what I always say I wanna have the Malone nice on the ground you know and get away from the guts yeah we know how many no guys did you see one elbow right for life yeah if that's yeah well it's a good weapon I mean look John Jones when you use it on Brandon Vera I mean he broke his orbital bone oh yeah no but that divide that's been one of the five mmm yeah made me out of four yes yeah yeah but yeah but a lot of flights get stopped by cots and a lot of guys and I hate that because of the street you would stop if you get cut you keep on fighting you know it's not a real wind I'm gonna discard guys who make careers out of it you know but still it's an effective weapon I feel like you can't take it away either because it's so it's so good it's a good technique okay maybe what they should do is they've yeah but again they don't pad then oh yeah so something around it that at least it doesn't cut I'm totally for it if you knock a mom and I'm the biggest guy but not like laying and somebody and little II don't even load him up right right just rubber rubber rubber and then they get started and they win the fight yeah I wanna fight no you didn't win the fight for me you didn't win that fight do you think they could solve that with a neoprene sleeve on the elbow maybe with problem is you know it's like these crazy we tie things that have a ride you know that always starts moving in a run it's gonna be annoying people gotta you know maybe surgically implant one man so I do or not that's you you're all fired up yeah so you've done you did two fights in the UFC after you won the title with Randleman what made you wouldn't me just stop pain pain pain that that neck injury I brought it all the way to the Randleman fights and it was still not gone I was hurting I couldn't sleep I wasn't sleeping pills for such a long time because of the pain there was always pain pain in my neck and then I said you know what I'm gonna sight or biceps like throwing the left hook in the air pack and go oh my god what's going on no you know I stopped breaking down breaking down and then I started I didn't do anything then I started Trey like three years after that I started trading and it and it went it starts going good and the garage start going good and you know okay everything feels good and then I stopped and then like two years later two and a half years later day day that's when they called me for the WFA if I was interested they offered me a lot of money and and apparently what happened it was funny also because they Kimura leopoldo to him they said he says who do you want to fight and I said they should know at first I said he said right they said we don't have the money for that that he's never going to happen okay make sense crazy right he wants Millions yeah that was at the time you know and I was just wanting to see what you can do against the right and so they by the way that would have been another awesome fight that would have been awesome fight boys yeah you against Mandalay or you ago yeah anyway then I said yeah I don't know you know I I don't know no they said he only upholds the positive for steroids yeah but when they said QB polish very sure I said man I just hang out with them in Japan when they fought in Japan it's kind of weird right no no he actually wants to find you that's how cool so then when we had the photo shoot I go to the photo shoot and he's there and he's acting all weird like giving me Han but like was shying away and I go like wow is taking is this fight very serious right I mean what's going on oh yeah we told him that you specifically asked for him I thought you know what am I gonna tell him but then I said no I'm not gonna tell him because if I tell him you know that maybe he's not gonna train his heart I wanted to have a tough fight you know so I thought he's angry he's gonna train harder there's gonna be awesome fights and then I thought that was my my crazy mind I say on the day of the fight I would deliver a letter to him in the in the dressing room saying exactly what I just said so he would read like I do I knew this already but I didn't want to tell you because I want you be a hundred percent before you fight me and a fool of stamina because you're gonna need it and that way I think that would be totally backfiring right or hey just before you fight so that was the set up to play and then yeah I got that's positive Reuben had to take his place Roman took it so now what a lot of guys that gaved didn't want to do it and there's a lot a bunch of guys they went over because I said anybody take a day came up at that because I didn't it was just the only one who was that willing to take the fight yeah now when you were over there in Japan and you were there for all those great fights like Nogueira vs. Nogueira vs. Cro Cop and Nogueira vs. phaidor and what was that like sitting there ringside I mean did you want to just fucking jump in there sometimes oh you get crazy you get crazy you get you you were over there some of the greatest fights ever ever ever and nobody gets take that away from you I said what they said but my fights also I want to fight the first two fights of peckers and one guy in Holland says he says boss everybody was saying always gonna lose you lose you gonna loose you know like it's very negative public country and one guy says boss whatever happens they never take this away from you anymore so lock this up they got you got this you know and and that's what with those fights also that's something that you carry on with the rest of your life they were great moments and to interview those guys you know to reenact with them and do crazy stuff and then but I got to start doing these crazy openings you know yeah it was fun man I liked those who didn't like those they pulled them like that Gary melon came out that guy yeah you know he was suddenly everything needs to be the same as boxing and I go why is it gonna be the same as everybody else you know let it let it be like how many fights did you do over there in Pride how many cards oh god I don't know I mean it but when they started Bushido also I was there 12 times in my ear every month I was like 5 6 - f yeah I have no clue what's up during heyday it must have been completely insane I mean I heard stories about guys getting paid with stacks of money stacks of money we're all crisp old numbers exactly in a row look I mean I think if they would walk in there with guns but yeah then again you don't want to do that yes yes money there Japan is run by the Yakuza right they'll deal with pride and all these organizations that basically and that's accepted that's a part of Japanese culture right is that just how it works no no it's not accepted because when when it came out then it was over right then because then the TV said we would don't want to be associated with it and they pulled the money out or was it was that just because it was made public but it's already known but I think it was made public yeah I got it let's forget this it was the past from Joe Rogan for a buddy of mine oh yeah I gave my UFC pass yeah that's cool is that your phone that keeps going on it has no clue let me see oh my battery's too low for use okay dude laughter no note so when you were over there though when you were watching all these classic fights and you like I said you'd been there for I mean you were there for Shogun Mark Coleman you were there for Shogun versus rampage rampage versus aronia I mean some of the greatest fights of all time rampage the things to be dead with rampage how you know I remember my first when he fought Sakuraba and he lost that fight I've took him to the side I say listen you got it man you got this thing they love you I said make sure this doesn't happen anymore because they actually had to get him out of jail to get that a fight there was a whole stress thing going on because he had a he had a warrant out of him or something and he was at the airport and they they got him and they put him in jail really yeah but that the pride people started talking they got him out they made pictures of it he's standing in front of the jail it was on the cover of all the newspapers was he standing there with his big chain you know and that was that was Quinton he came in now the prime what was going on back then at that time was pride was a mainstream Japanese sensation it was huge in mainstream Japan right it wasn't like mixed martial arts in America back then was not nearly as successful as it is today oh yeah a small show was 43,000 people damn yeah and they would sell out all the time did he show 91 and a half Tokyo Dome 55 60,000 I mean was crazy and you would go out on the street and you a good mom do it oh man everybody yep so what happened what happened over there cuz it stopped being like that it stopped being like because of that is the aku's oh yeah when when the TV pulled everything out it was over that's when everything went down dread it was so successful so many people liked it I couldn't imagine yeah else wouldn't come along no no I think the main reason of this is Sakuraba started to loose you like an organization in Japan in order to be successful they need to have a new star star and and where you're gonna fight good luck to find another Sakuraba who beat for grace she's not unbelievable fighter you know but if k1 never got big in America why they don't have an American champion right they have an American champion in America k1 but that that guy doesn't do good in the final tournaments right so but once an American guy is gonna win in Japan you watch then k1 becomes very interesting for the people it is logic you know you wanna root for your own guy that's funny though because you know I mean horse Gracie when he won in America he was a hugely popular guy and he's from Brazil yeah I think if they had k1 over in America I just think people you know Dana White and I had a conversation about this what he was talking about how kickboxing has a negative stigma in America because of PKA karate yeah the old boring kickboxing yes yes eight geeks above the waist or something you couldn't even kick low yeah at all very few of the I mean they would occasionally they would show you a low kick fight yeah well our like special rules or special rules yeah the most part it was like they would wear those big stupid slippers on their feet yeah they wouldn't really kick it wasn't exciting wasn't nearly as exciting as boxing or Muay Thai but the k1 now like if you watched the Grand Prix now that's bizarre so so ever so exciting that show and Max as well you know the k1 mats and lighter weight guys and it's Rosie and I mean it's unbelievable right tell me that guy couldn't be a star in America or you know Alistair especially yeah but the thing is in the beginning it will work but eventually people want to see an American American champion well I think made sure it was really big and successful over here you would have you know some Americans that do well but they would have to they would have to know that that's a legitimate Avenue for a profession you know I love that Barry you know guys who are real serious fucking strikers you know you just does not that many of them there is no no just really not and and and you know did in America it's just there's no venue they have to go out of the country to get like real high level it's very hard it's very Martin Schmidt would say you know he wasn't the top of the pyramid that time and he didn't make it over there so then you know they go like okay because who was gonna beat Mari submitted in America nobody right right yeah Maurice that was he was another interesting guy when he first came to the UFC I was there for his debut I was there when he fought Mark Coleman no but he gave him a chance you know everybody thought Maurice is gonna be killed yeah I'm a backstage he's so relaxed yeah he was hanging out and goofing around and laughs I'm like does this guy know he's gonna go get fucked by the biggest guy in the game you know Coleman was a fuckin monster but yeah but Maurice just it was the first guy to have like that real high-level cardio you know was the first guy that just not get tired he knew mark was gonna get tired yeah and I thought it my foot him twice more yes right you submitted him didn't you yeah twice yeah it was fun you know did the best one was the first time I'm standing here and he makes ki giggle box punch him and it goes he goes whoa fast and right away hey give him a geek boof and it's like it's on his defense climb very close so I think oh cool I make another one right away I make switch kick and I kick and I slip and fall in the ground and he wants to jump on top of me and I go wait he stops and I get up and I go things is legal right that's so hilarious yeah that was hilarious that was funny and then he tried to take my back this was the coolest I did a mini bar upside down knee bar on my hat feet up knee barring him I'm standing against the ropes and he's trying to get my back so you had over our knee bar that's it I go like okay get my back so right away but he did I drove in but he grabs the ropes so I'm standing upside down to the top of my buddies he's tapping into rubbish rubish camping Wow yeah that was well then you are really there for some crazy times what is it like now going from like your your very beginnings where there was no mixed martial arts where you went over there you literally had no idea what it was like to see what it's like now you know with what Cain Velasquez and all these guys you understand that what I keep from Thai boxing right you get weight classes it's like boxing so I came to Japan and and the first thing I see is my opponent is 245 pounds and I'm 195 so I go like okay but I didn't want to show anything of course because okay there's one of this why'd you get a fight so I go okay cool cool cool cool I said how many runs they say one round I said awesome how many minutes thirty say awesome I didn't think inside awesome I go you know that's why I put those arse on my hand like to stay relaxed because I'm such a hot add well that's what the are stood for yeah relax yeah in holistic starts with an R also so let's go incidentally Rutten no no no for this they stay constant every time when when I get hit you hear my corner you listen to the fights you go stay calm stay calm stay calm because they know I bought it that's that's why in the Hall of our old first-round knockouts I would come out very technical so I figured I said man if I'm gonna fight it out like a working for sure no you know we could take a lot of punishment but then come back and I got 28 more minutes to go whoa we're gonna shoot a load I don't want to have that so I put the two hours of my hand to then and they would sound they never shouted in a an instruction the only instruction they shout it's like when I'm in a guard I would tell them right this is my easiest God escape on a planet imagine the guard is here and his left foot is on top right right I would look at my corner and it would show it would go right and I would swing back and under who kids they would be the eyes for me and I feel this day I don't get it that nobody does this it's the simplest thing on the planet that to know which foot is on top so you'd push up yeah because it's not being held they go right and then you relax you know pick it up oh that's hilarious do you do that for your guys as well oh yeah yeah also yeah carefully don't get kind of triangle though no no you gotta you know you know that fact right yeah yeah this is not like what while he's pulling on your arm let's try it now man I'm calm payment place how crazy is it watching beam the evolution of the game has I mean we literally in America there has never been a sport like mixed martial arts that has exploded and changed and grown right before our eyes Mia I mean that for some sports got famous like skateboarding and you know BMX riding me some stuff that wasn't a viable way to make a living when I was a kid became one nothing like mixed martial arts where was just constantly in the public eye in movies and jammed down your throat on television I mean it's pretty fucking strange isn't it it's I I predicted it right away after my first fight they did an interview with me and I said this is like a roller ball that movie this people gonna need like an outlet you know and this is it this is gonna be very big I say you're watching four years from now no yeah I said the four years from now this will be the biggest thing and it was like seven years later or something I was like way off in time but eventually it got there I I go like what is what is better than this I knew at that time already that everybody likes to be you know who's the toughest guy on the planet and this is literally being the toughest guy I was an insight up in May last week and I was ashamed about a comment that I made against Frank because we had a comment that one guy says over MMA is just like two guys rubbing against each other on the floor and then I told him the story that I I was fighting Frank and that I I stood up and I said to Frank come up he says no no you come down I said no come on fight like a man you know and I go I'm eating those words right now because when I broke that guy's shin bone because I had no clue how much power that wasn't the joint you know that really started making me thinking I go yes understood it the ground guy can break whatever he wants in your body you've got so much dominant power if I roll with guys my students they'd rather stand with me than the ground because of the ground they say you always you're they're standing they can't move around you know right and they get hell out of that is but it's way harder on the ground so I go like wow listen I can dislocate break snap I can do whatever I want if I say okay your right arm is gonna go your right arm is gonna go to any guy on the street you know I mean talking about power compared to knocking somebody out you know I could put you to sleep I can some crazy things with you the jujitsu that just came it just came out of nowhere I mean when I was a kid it was all about striking there was no one ever took judo yeah I wrestled in high school but you know I just did it as a sport you know on you know I got bored with it quick cuz it just didn't seem like there's anything going on ya know the guy down but it wasn't it's a meeting it's obeying him and once the jujitsu came along man it's amazing how much it's evolved you look at like MMA look at the jujitsu that was in MMA in 93 and look at the digit sushi now with like chalk or a god damn Ian Maya you know it's fuckin so many levels above it the thing is what I always say I said all the moves are pretty much invented right but it's the the setups they they found such creative ways to go to a particular move that is the cool part about mixed martial art style if you have that set up that nobody noticed yet use how many times you remember the first time in the other corner got introduced in the pride you know the guy from the girls camp they said we call this our anaconda that was no parent told me yeah because nobody saw the freaking thing before boom everybody start landing anaconda yeah you know Darce choke same thing whoops our leaders the Darce you know oh you can do it on the other and study art but you go to the UC so people start playing with it and they create these different ways like d-lister against the suck what is the allure to italian guy let's just the car the car the way he said that triangle choke up I mean wow that was so cool it was so sneaky slowly but surely that loop go like this there's a master yeah I mean Lister if Dean Lister was around in the early UFC's nobody had jujitsu like him yeah 93 you know even hoist crazy didn't his jiu-jitsu was very basic it wasn't nothing like you know the jiu-jitsu that you see today you know there's there's a few guys that they say when they compared to Jitsu they say you know a kick sand is a perfect example people today even high-level black belts that roll with them just say that guy is on another level there's just a few guys that are just you know Liborio Ricardo love oreos another one they say about that he's just on another level just there's just such a high jiu-jitsu but overall the level of jiu-jitsu from the new guys like the Marcelo Garcia's you know these new guys coming along it's fucking since it's so high level it's so much more advanced than it was just 10 15 years ago you know you know what a cool thing is with Liborio he saw me rolling my joke you mention and in China he was watching there and then he saw so we started showing me things and I said what he could do with those particular leg locks and how he could do this and they would make it that stronger and and he was sitting look at me and he was like oh I saw oh you thought it was a striker right there he go I didn't know any and then it's finished that he wanted me to come to America top team to teach the ground fighting seventh house I said that is good stuff well it's good to have a fresh perspective you know I mean you never know that everybody has their own way of doing things that I haven't seen it before that's right now there's so many different techniques what people don't understand that don't do jiu-jitsu there's so many different techniques available it's like a it's like chess if you had a million pieces you know yeah there's so many different submissions and so many different transitions and chains of submissions and new techniques and new counters and yeah but I believe in in it's good to know them all but I mean but for every fight you have to say okay I'm gonna use this particular move for that guy I don't go crazy on this dude because you know and and then have those different setups that is the key man I would and set up one to four and go for month to 4 to 2 to back to what if boom card but I was like Jake Shields who Jake Shields is very basic he doesn't do a lot of different techniques rear naked choke armbar guillotine choke but he just fucking gets them yeah you know any notion yeah his path to yells techniques is so sharp yeah what do you think so what do you think about guys today like when you look at these guys today and you know do you you ever wish like man I was did you ever say like I came along too late like wow yeah on one side yeah but you know I always go with the glasses have fooled with me you know I I I'm in a great position right now man I mean I got a movie coming out but of a big part for this you know that Kevin James comedy you know I got the TV show my wife predicted that one also by the way what's mine I was though the inside I mean which is like oh we go there's a fourth year it's crazy tonight no and my wife when she she predicted that I was gonna be a fighter in Japan and I said no because I'm not gonna fight she said she had haunt you gonna go to Japan much six months later I'm in Japan then two years into that she looks at me weird again I said now what she says we got to go to America you're gonna be in TV business swear to God how'd you ever get that a part of the grand theft auto like the men's room was probably one of the funniest things that are you gonna ever do another one what is it I haven't seen Oh going you do inside the Grand Theft Auto I would just sit there to watch his show yeah gta4 that was and say these guys from bar fighting they saw it and what they did they gave me a script I said can I treat this thing and they said sure so I would start building sentences in the middle of the sentence I would stop and then restart it so it looks like I'm a total freakin psycho when I'm talking it's like really weird because it doesn't work and and the the results when you see the result is one of my finer work man I had to send people out there I say you can't because they were cracking up so hard all the guys who have fought though you're the very best in my opinion at transitioning into a career outside of fighting and you do inside MMA you do commentary you're always do so by the way you and Michael schiavelli when you did the commentary for Strikeforce for the undercard so fucking best part of the night I loved it you guys need to do it together I love schiavelli I think that's fucking hilarious you guys together we're awesome somebody really needs to scoop you up and have you guys do more commentary yeah you know I love to doing it but just right now you know this is one of those things that I thought I would never say but I'm so busy and I don't have the time for it anymore but any time I have a chance like for instance now I'd go to Brussels you know and then I do this just like three days before I have to go to Boston to shoot shit why do you do it you don't need to do it I say yeah but I enjoy it I enjoy it so much to go there and there I'm also the rig announcer and they let me free I can slap the girls I do you know I do fun stuff you know this Brussels are there mixed martial arts makes martial arts and a k1 tournament you know both at the same time fine I seen that they had one before right yeah also on inside MMA yes yeah inside anyway by the way if you don't have HD net you're missing out HD net is the best for watching fights yes always k1 k1 max they have a hundred different you know MF C's on a hundred different mixed martial arts organization yes fights from Japan fights from Europe it's really and that's where inside em and may your shows on its way I love it and the thing I love about its I see my old buddies again whether they're still fighting order now coaches from guys and then I see the new talent coming up you know and and we all have him on the show you know we who would have thought you go to get a bazi award you know like you can win a bazi if you have the greatest knockout of the year or something how cool is that you know it's we really want to start doing that thing I think in the front of a live audience that would be cool to do also but it's really getting that we never thought it was gonna go like that you know and it just exploded from the half-hour show we went right away to an hour and now commercials are there so that means we're doing a good thing with a lot of showing that yeah I'm a sign in my mind it's great it's a really really fun show to watch now what about guys that you know that you started out with that have taken a lot of damage you know I mean you didn't take damage you took damage to your bio you have tendonitis but you have no problem with your thinking no yeah but what is it like when you see guys that do because it disturbs the shit out of me really it's it's really sad that way I know a few guys that you know start lisping and and it's scary stuff you know the like a lot ski fight now you know Andre ya know I love this guy he's a really nice guy somebody I know he wants to fight he already wants to prepare for the next fight I think somebody should say you know what let's not do it what do you think about the greg jackson saying that he's gonna get right back in there they're just gonna fix it and he did some things wrong but he's not done and he's gonna come back it'll be even sweeter than ever and i'm listening to him talking i'm like motherfucker do you know that this guy knocked unconcious you can what times in a row you can you can kill everything for the rest yeah you know I mean maybe he's not gonna be a teacher anymore nothing but mix Barcia that that's the the bad thing also is like your legacy is going down what are you going to be a coach you gonna go to a gym to train with a guy who lost his lost seven fights imagine you're a guy like for though I knock no I'm not there was nothing offski I'm doing but right now yeah so you know they should what I said what they should do should tell him okay you know what you're gonna you know gonna fight for a year and in between we gonna do some grappling tournaments to keep the competition on there and there you're busy and it doesn't matter if you win or lose who cares about it just be busy with competition so you you perform under pressure and then if everything feels good you know that maybe try it one more time but then really say okay if this is gonna go the wrong way you really gotta stop like you're off from the Brett Rogers fight didn't he yeah but in my book if I was my student it was no yeah I would say no this has been shut off too many times yeah because I don't want to be that nail in the coffin that's gonna say god knows what happened what about a guy like Al star that got stopped a bunch of time yeah I mean Alan star got stopped like think nine times in his career Bobby Hoffman knocked them out chuckle Adele knocked them out so many guys stomped him yeah and look at him now I mean I know the greatest comeback ever I know but you you you see this fighting style how he fights he doesn't throw I was I'm still getting so let it go make three four shots pop pop pop I do doesn't do that mm-hm everything is single shots his defense is perfect boomp boomp boomp every watch you know there's no three right uppercut left hook he's very good and I know you know yeah of course tries not to get hit nice not to get hit and and and and it's gonna be hard for people to hit him need so much power yeah you know I mean look at look the striking is bizarre the guy so strong is taking out his fences getting really good using great submissions ground control is really good no one has ever been like Alistar that won the k1 Grand Prix and is a mixed martial arts champion yep dream dream strike and strike force three bills pretty fuckin crazy yeah yeah that's really cool stuff that's a guy you know dis is cool he trained in the early days she trades the Chris Dolman when I was training there he had his broader Valentine and I would submit him and then they would date day they're very competitive and then if I wouldn't come over there they suddenly would calm they say oh we're at your gym we want to train now because now we're gonna get you I said okay and then it went again and they say how is it possible I said because I'm training do it you know but I always said that's the guy those are the guys because they they keep on coming keep them coming I want more and travel for it he wants it the guy who really wants it it really is like that it's like the book I always say the alchemist you know if you set your goal you say that's where I want to go whatever you do you don't get off the path you know you are gonna get it I truly believe that's there's something up there that helps you for that you know go go relentless don't walk over people though in order to get there unless you're on tour laughs ski and you've been out four times in a row yeah physically you have to stop and look at it and go all right what are we gonna do here yeah that's true yeah I don't know how you say this I think that you how do you tell when to tell them I think that people inside deep down inside to fathers know if they can become a champion or not I think they already know that when I was fighting and I started winning in Japan when I got that ground game I look at my wife I say I think I'm gonna be a real champion this thing I truly believe I can beat all these guys now you know and then it started you know I think you feel that I think that that a fighter will actually knows himself they will keep on trying and keep on trying but I think once you know that it's not really there that that's not a good feeling I won't say it but it is well it's like the guys who you mount you hit they turn on the back and they get choked mm-hmm a lot of these guys they give the choke speaking of that what did you think about the fatal fight when Federer was fighting a Bigfoot I mean he gave up his back a couple of times he had to it was just too big it was too big actually buddy said too big with today week go too big and combination yeah and then and then being what sixty pounds heavier you know that's a big difference man I always said I wanted weight class two or five to thirty five yeah I agree no I agree right yeah I agree it's the too big of a leap yeah those big giant guys that are cutting weight to get down at 265 that's a huge percentage they said that he was 290 today how could you gain 25 this fucking head looks like it's too night baby yeah when he got on top of fatal mountain him he see how wide is oh yes he like that's a giant person I can stop by a Bigfoot did you see the footprints back won't fade oh man that was uh that was a tough thing to watch and it's tougher even still to watch all those people that are behind himself gonna fight again he should fight people booing when they don't let the fight continue I shake his is is closed and he can't see anything coming from the left you know at all yeah any real it was gonna be the same thing anyway he's gonna get taken down and smashed that was it that was it is it hard watching a guy went out you mean you watch them enter into very alright ride and then see him get beat down like very hard yeah that that's something to you you know there you get a bush - I do get abortion from that's a crazy thing right but in this game and the game of fighting we're gonna see it no matter what I I mean I was there for Chuck Liddell's debut I was there you know for Hector Gonzalez I think was a guy's thing we fought I forget the guys name he fought I was there for that know he Gonzalez maybe I was there for that fight and then to get to see him you know all the way to the end to the Rich Franklin fight you know it's like wow you know seeing seeing guys like at the top at their most vibrant when they're just dominant you know and but with Chuck it's a mental thing but I also with with Chuck if he has the right person who who can't talk to him that he's too hungry like if he Lance if he smells the victory all the doctor she had is because of that if he would step back relax mhm I mean he was doing really good against for its Franklin this guy still could be the top guy that's his only defect with him it's not that he lost his timing and lost at it's only that he's too hungry you know he's been knocking out people too easy mm-hmm you know and if that's the same you can also see what the training went when he fought Couture you know that when he trains he puts everybody backwards and then suddenly went could do came and start pushing him backwards that was like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what now what he never was there that fight made him again way better after that make them a better counter strike oh man yeah he learned how to fire him off as he was moving backwards and one of my favorite guys still was amazing yeah he also lost the ability to take a punch I mean if you go back and watch his first fights like with you ever watch the pale a fight with oh my god yeah that was crazy yeah bare knuckle or knuckles guys if there is a net underneath the rope so you could escape punched him in the face with bare knuckles people get stabbed in the eyes just grab the balls remember his pants and crushed his dick in balls you should have I Agri on them he literally got the guy by the cojones yeah fuck and it was totally completely go yeah I mean nobody had ever done it but Gary and Molly to do anything else yeah that is anything go were they allowed to bite now I have order you know well it's almost III read the book from a big job because I wrote the foreword for the book and man that's a cool book what is John's book it's wrong uh but where do you think John MacArthur yeah no no no what what is this line oh let's get it on let's get it on but that's sort of Mills lanes line Mills Lane in boxing had that way before the you yeah okay that was his thing and they like had made some sort of an agreement where John was gonna use it in MMA and Mills Lane was gonna use it in boxing okay but I remember when you know there was like some words that people were saying though oh you know only John McCarthy could say let's get it on cuz every referees got to figure out a thing to say it's Martin gay there's the one that started it Marvin Gaye yeah well I mean you know let's get it on bill Mills Lane you've seen it all boss you've been there from the beginning you know you're you're a real legend in this this crazy sport I'm a very happy person let me tell you that have a lot of pain when I walk you know everything hurts but it's been worth it and I know that with the stem cells and everything I hope something will pop up you know and I'm not gonna fight anymore you know I'm also you know this also would think that ahead when in 2006 when I made to come back I knew that like I would roll and everything would go really well don't get me wrong but there were things that I say I would have had that normally and normally I would have had that I noticed that I was getting slower you know and that my reactions were and there as they were before so you know you gotta be you know be very realistic to yourself what do you think about a guy like Randy Couture's older than you I mean how old do you know yeah but forty-five forty-six he's fucking 14 somebody's about to fight Machida yeah it's crazy but it's got the o2 trainer the boss was an intervention the long training device you know what this is a fun thing man yeah when I was 15 years old around that time my very bad asthma but I also did track and field so when I had an asthma attack that would be like a two week episode which from the two weeks I will be like five or six days in bed because I couldn't eat and can't breathe because you can't eat no you can't revised drinking like this 24 hours day oh yeah no really bad so I can walk stairs nothing everything in bad you don't have any of that anymore no no no sometimes I do that sometimes a little bit yeah but you take an inhaler and it's gone but then after I had an attack and I would do track and field I would realize that my lungs would work better and I go why is that and I start oh wait a minute it's an infection in your lung pipe you know it closes the long pipe your lungs have to work really hard to pull that Aaron then when the infection is gone you know they because they worked all the time they're used to pulling hot air comes in easy I go so why don't I come up with something that controls the air intake so I started thinking about like it's the stupidest thing man you're gonna laugh like I will hold my mouth in a certain position I tried to memorize that position I just stupid stuff so you say get much air in yeah like and then make it every time a little smaller I go man I gotta come up with something so I tell all this my oh my buddy sharing America everybody new in the holiday also that I wanted to make that thing and then when Vandelay came on TV with the snorkel I think I had six or seven phone calls days they said you got to do that thing that you're talking about because somebody's going to find it out somebody's going to come up with an idea you know so I started looking at a patent lawyer and what do you know man nobody made it I got the better to have everything to go boss goto trainer the old dude trainer oh that's why I was laughing because what I saw this is oh do trainer and it's it controls the air intake it's a very simple thing so imagine this week you do all your hard workouts like only four times also because you don't need to do it every way because she's actually tightening your muscles to testing it in Texas right now at the University that guy in twelve days he had greater lung volume he said man you made something really cool can I put my track team on it he's got his female track team on it they got a run tests on them now because he thinks also that because it's a little small type biodegradable little compartment that's flexible also she can't get hurt because Yuri breathe a little tiny bit of carbon monoxide which I wanted to stay away from because I don't want people to get dizzy says no no you don't get this you carbon dioxide I wanted to anyway he says he thinks it's just enough to spark more red blood cell production I said you kidding me he said I don't know for sure yet he says but I that will be the icing on the cake Wow what does this thing look like it's an you know I hope I still get better sit on line can I find it online um let me see you go to autotrader.com and people who are watching right now you can't buy it yet it's on there but you can't buy it yet so don't hit bye hmm Oh two trainers comm co to 0-2 or oh oh oh to shake this out and this is something that's gonna be available soon very soon this week this week yeah what does it look like I keep it's not it's not companies no pick up no hey you're probably getting smashed right now you just said yeah you said it online you might have 44,000 people in Ustream yeah yeah okay guys everybody you're watching don't buy it you cannot buy it okay it's not in so don't hit by come back at the end of the week could you so it will be something that you think there's gonna be make a big impact on I think it's gonna be the major impact is because you're looking to describe what it looks like okay this it is a supportable advice it's a mouthpiece like an like when you dive you know and it comes to the front with two little things it's like a square and it comes to the front here's the air hole and as a cap the cap you can take off and you can put screens in there little rubber screens with all smaller holes they go from 40 millimeter all the way to 1 millimeter so this week you train all your hard work that's fourteen millimeter next week you to 13 then you do 12 you go she slowly but gradually you're going down and I once you're down you know you you you really allergic to pull the air in and it's it's the the voice my wife was saying like after three weeks of training in restaurants she said man keep your voice down you know because your voice gets really loud so I go man it's for singers it's for people
