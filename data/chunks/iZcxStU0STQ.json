the girag an experience I asked us historian on my podcast if they were really that bad he spent his life studying the Mongols I said no they really that bad and he said yeah they were really there's no dude well huh don't worry Wall in China the Great Wall china was built to keep the Mongols out and if you go there now I was just I just got back from China on monday i went to the Great Wall like two weeks ago but the first time I went to the Great Wall was about 12 years ago and there's Mongolian people hang out on the top just a few of them that are like selling things like woman selling postcards and cheap stuff and i bought some postcards was like a dollar i gave the woman at ten she wouldn't give me the change so would you know the change they might be brought in people historically but i also want to remind you that they'll cheat you at the Great Wall hey Tom Thomas outrageously wouldn't be no she the Great Wall she wouldn't give you change how does that go down I you know hey good friend good friend you know it was just want to keep the money it was awkward yeah she's just like a goodness in yeah yeah yeah yeah good friend that's interested friend I would just hit the great wall again did you get your money I didn't they there was a few they're selling like cokes and some different trinkets I didn't I didn't fall for it this time it's crazy yeah yeah you'd attend right wall ten dollars did you never got it back no wow no no I'm a detailed question there at the great 104 is a to z kangan if he had my friend my good friend what happened I got a video on youtube Beijing Tom Rhodes Beijing and it's on there I've had my camera running oh you could see the woman's a woman's money giving me the change it's in my little Beijing video and what's the video title yeah it's Tom Rhodes Beijing and what and what's in that video also is the greatest thing as great as the Great Wall is there is a toboggan slide that you go down as a little you get it sitting like a little luge plastic thing and you got to stick between your legs and you push it forward to go fast and pull it back to slow down and it's windy and it's got some huge drops in it and I went there I don't remember that damn there's three there's three sections disorders can go to the great wall and there's only the one section that has this fantastic magnificent slide and it's thrilling and then you you get down to the bottom and there's a big it's on that Beijing video i filmed it while i did it i guess you actually i just did it again a few weeks ago and at the bottom are there it is exactly there's some Chinese soldier communist guys with like military jackets on down at the bottom on these big turns going slow down slow to remove it because obviously they've had a few people like fly all it block the corners oh my god whoa yeah you kid how are you slowing down how do you slow it down well you just you pull the stick towards you oh my god and I did it I would see that was in winter when I first went but I just did it again man it's it's I wanted to go right back up to the top is that is that it's great as the great wall is I think that slide is even cooler and that's as I'll avoid the Mongols at the top I want to see the Mongol footage I wanna see that broad right thing is the only man-made structure from what I understand that you can apparently that's horseshit is that too I thought so here it is here it is yeah this is Mongolia peachy order you off you look lung and go out when's yours nice with the snow on it ok 10 cars just melon go out 01 down or teeth
