hello freak bitches if you're a dude and your best friend is a woman it's it's it's it's it's suspect it's very suspect highly suspect yeah yeah unless she's really unusual well look there are there are look and I'm not saying that women and hot women and whoever are I mean they're fucking they can be great friends but yeah you all if they're hot and even if they're not you sometimes still wanna yeah and that's okay right you know but guys that do have like a hot woman that's the best friend that they're not banging and they pretend now it's just totally platonic mmm okay yeah I could never trust that guy unless he has like an insanely hot wife that that yeah or or if they used to date yes that's works yeah that's possible if they like legitimately have nothing to do each other anymore right like I have exes that like I wouldn't want to sleep with but in their hot you know what I mean right it's over yeah it's over but you're still friends yeah yeah friendly yeah they're not your best no no no Shawn no and shit fucking weird that's weird well it's weird with anybody pretty like when a guy is like working an angle and try really hard to like position himself as better than you like position himself as being like different than him every other guy I'm you know there's a lot of guys out there doing really negative things I read this one guy's fucking Twitter page other day it was amazing it was just like he might be the ultimate white knight I don't want to give out his Twitter page yeah but even he might be like the greatest if I met him he probably has almost no blood in his veins his blood sugar is probably zero he probably faints all day long it was so weak but one of the things he said is he said he said although I still practice feminists I still practice feminism I no longer associate are no longer would you say advertise myself as a feminist because I feel like it's up to women to decide whether not I'm doing feminism correctly Jesus Christ so I'll still practice feminism but I will no longer advertise myself as a feminist Jesus Christ dad that's I actually don't even know what to say about that and then I got started playing in a rock band in my 20s since I didn't do much martial arts at all did you do you practice music before that like when did you get involved in immune I was growing up as a kid Bruce Lee and Alice Cooper we were like my two okay so that's the glam rock came from the make up and yeah and late mid 20s I started playing in a band and I really liked performing and I did a lot of jumping and kicking and wearing tight pants and you know and I liked it was sooo David Lee Roth so exactly exactly and somewhere between David Lee Roth and the New York Dolls I know I'm very drunk very very fucked up like through the whole era like we would go and we man and I told Eddie this story I haven't told a lot of people this story but people asked me about it my friends asked me about it recently but I was basically on tour so I do that for like 10 12 14 years and we're touring England in the UK and and like Italy and a few places like that we did really well over there and I had a seizure from just doing so much drugs and drinking so much and like a bad like you basically I had been that when I came back the doctor said the vodka and Red Bull was actually the biggest component the fact that I took a lot of speed over the three days without sleeping let me drink more vodka redbull but basically as the sugar leaves your body it goes down and you get sick and when the alcohol then leaves your body it draws more sugar and you have a hypoglycemic seizure so I'm laying on the couch I felt terrible for like 10 hours and then all of a sudden apparently I just yelled something and people came over and I felt this electricity shooting down my arms into my hands and they just locked up and I rolled back down my eyes rolled in my head I thought it was ten seconds later and everyone's looking at me like I just got knocked out you know and then apparently it was like a minute or something and I went back and the doctor said dude you gotta get your life together Wow and I started training martial arts again pretty much that day and then I trained you know three times a week then five then seven then I was doing jujitsu Monday Wednesday Friday 7:00 a.m. noon and 6:00 p.m. and Tuesday and Thursday noon and 6:00 p.m. wait a minute you were trained to do two three times a day every times a day Monday Wednesday Friday twice a day Tuesday Thursday for about six months and then people kind of knew me a little in Canada like on television doing stuff I was like a reality show judge and the network said oh you're gonna fight well why don't we do a TV show about that Wow and that kind of loud me I really wanted to be in the fight world that's what I love the second I kind of had you know been not living a crazy lifestyle all I wanted to do was martial arts and then real really from that minute on that's all I kind of did that's all I was interested in how did you get started rapping man well let you do you consider that rap kind of I mean I started off in spoken-word so I started off just kind of with no beat spars into hip-hop and again a lot of people hear spoken word and think that sounds shit basically in poetry and that but I was exactly the same spoken word has potential right Kamini I mean what do people like I mean people love I have a dream yeah I have a dream as goddamn spoken word I mean Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech why always refer to a spoken word rather than poet or anything else that's the most literal right and I mean a really an intricate stand-up set that's like one piece that's a whole story that's a spoken word it's just does that word poetry does poet does that have a bad connotation like a pretentious critique belong from people kind of think yeah obviously I remember I was at the the Comedy Cellar in New York and David tells on stage and he's killing and there's just not a fuck in the audience and for some reason the guy took offense to one of Dave's jokes and says something and and days like well I'm sorry sir just drop here trying to do some jokes what do you do for a living sir you know he's fucking the guy goes I'm a poet published and I'll never forget that and there for a year I was saying that to people I'm a poet published like insurance and shit like that I just try and explain what I do and then just go with unemployed or self-employed itself I put poetry or my or my thing let's I never forget that asshole I'm the power published and he had like fashionable clothes on shit you know just Oh totally lives at home still with his mom Ava tell doesn't even remember it but I remember it it wasn't even me that got heckled fuckheads
