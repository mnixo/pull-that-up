motherfucker a volume slider on these bad boys yes when I'm an old man on a mountain somewhere my ears are ringing I'm gonna be like fucking Brian got in there he got me the fuck he wore it all out beat my eardrums in this a few guys that come over the house and we have to just keep saying don't talk don't talk ok nobody talk nobody talk because you know once Kevin gets over here at the moment he arrived I I met him in my driveway and immediately we start talking about how Siri is fucking Skynet and I mean it's like right out of the gate I'm like shit man we haven't even got into it yet I mean started talking well I offered you I gave you the opportunity to wipe your workout stink all over myself and Joe actually went for it was put me in a city lock in his driveway it was like dude absorb my essence I'm used to jiu-jitsu man I'm used to dude sweating on me but uh I came out all sweaty cuz I was hitting the bag and I was like I'll give you a hug but he goes not come on man all right he panicked oh I've ran I ran for the hills yeah first the first time I moved out here that first time I went over to Joe's house he was working out with his friend Eddie and he answered the the door and this is when he was like insane boys still you're probably more now but you were insanely ripped and Eddie and but you both came into our sweaty as hell and did the same thing gave the man hug those are totally different weightlifting days all right more bodybuilding muscle back then wasn't as strong it's weird your description sounded like a little bit of slash fiction there for a second slash fiction yeah like you know he writes the story oh yeah Joe came out of the garage his son was glistening off his hips his nipples were protruding out his ass no sense that's called slash fiction yeah it's a whole like subset of fiction people who write like sexual fiction about like celebrities Star Trek really kicked it off there's really yeah how do I know about this so what you're saying is that there's a whole genre of like fiction pornography about famous people yeah or like it's fantasy porn yeah and there's probably Care Bears slash fiction out there yeah you know I'm sure there is I probably wrote some of it how fucking we're our people man that they have like sexuality intertwined into their hobbies and in their you know their their fetishes and their their weird TV shows that they're into this podcast brought to you by flashlight what is it to have sexuality intertwined into everything yeah but that's just something to jerk off into I mean everybody jerks off and all the fleshlight is is a technological improvement on jerking off so what if I need slash fiction about like what if I need a good story about the brawny towel guy fucking the Jolly Green Giant what do I know that to get off but there's people that are into that kind of shit right that's like now that you brought this up I could be pretty hot I remember somebody else having a conversation with me about this and they were talking about house they there's a website where people are into different cartoon characters first porn ever bought was a playboy Jessica Rabbit issue we now I'm wait a minute now that I'm realizing now I'm thinking back again now it was like there was like all this porn that used to be online where it was like the Flinstones fucking yeah that's delicately hardcore hardcore and it was weird because it was kind of like hot like you know fred was fucking banging babble Barney roles wife what was her name was it Betty Betty Rubble Fred was banging Betty Rubble Max and Ruby Jo it's awesome on there Maxim Ruby they say sorry or whatever Dora the Explorer yeah really I saw a Simpsons takeover ad once it popped up and it was like Maggie had a penis the baby had a penis the female baby and was like fucking Marge's mouth with it it was like hold on there are hot singles in my area that want to chat with me I got to attend to them first there's anything ever shot anymore like anything at all oh those videos are in nothing I'm pretty desensitized didn't you just say before there was there is one there is there is one like it you got understand I've been I've seen like soldiers get heads cut off and I just sick shit like eight or nine years old you were on where it's style project back in the day style was like the first yeah I was how I know you yeah I talked to that guy online still he sent me a Facebook message Sonic back one yes supposedly it might not be the real style rhinos I talked to one out for Vaughn movement he's not a person anonymous no I talked to him on the phone once we were on the radio show so it's like on I was on the phone he was on the radio show this always he like it was like an internet radio show he's a good guy yeah yeah he's just a kid you know I no well I don't know his thing but boy did he have a crazy fucked-up sight you should get him on on a show or you should get him on his show that's something has never been done on like no one's never it really scenes yeah I would have to know who said there was a real style though how the hell would you know yes yes a guy who has a blog like that you probably know pretty quick yeah I think so there's a lot of guys that would be fake styles that I think would look absolutely just have a blog in the snow project so chat with it's a twitch app with a guy who's trolling a style once one of the guys that really from the first guy to promote my website though on the Internet yeah he made a blog post about my comedy being really funny and my websites being really cool and and then also these people started coming over to my message board then I started taking off it's one of the reasons why at the beginning my website was so sick till I'm sure my message board has always been so twisted that it was styling the style infection from the beginning have you been to Rotten calm recently yeah they need to hire a web designer is the exact same website as it was since the beginning of the Internet I don't think they need you want the web 2.0 version of dudes shitting in people's mouths like that's what you want that car accident just rot and really need its own app like what exactly is web 2.0 it's got to have rounded corners and glossy buttons and reflection shadows what is it it's like it's it was a concept for a set of standards for how the web should work at the time so it's like you know web 2.0 you know what things should be you know cloud-based stored in the server there should be endless Scrolls on pages there's all these things that happen with iterations of the web you know I just saw it on the first time I saw it was years ago on some guys website who makes websites his websites were kind of whack and you know I had this thing about web 2.0 like he was like using all the right terms and everything but work was whack right synergize the web yeah I was like management system in the future yeah it's a weird thing right when anything ever anything becomes popular you know there's there's people who are real for real geeks and then there's people who see geekdom as an opportunity to sort of make some money and they pretend to be geeks no they never experienced that in my life you've never experienced fake geeks not once really what do you smile like that for I'm just I'm just saying is that it's a pleasure to not experience I see it every day Oh every fucking day yeah you're kidding right everyday some fake geeks yeah is it annoying to you being a real geek you know somewhat someone out there thinks I'm just fake is like has they come as well so it's all relics I'm a geek as well and when I say this I'm not saying like you know I'm a mean person calling someone a geek you know and I'm I'm a undereducated geek I wouldn't say I'm a fake geek I just don't know how anything works if I didn't do it all but I don't know you put dotnet instead of TV by the way on your links everyone's freaking out on Twitter did I really yeah oh yeah sorry yeah I'll retweet bitch are we live is this yeah yeah say what I'll Drive is there it what was the video did you ever say what the video was that you we want to get into that it's just too gross I mean it's dark it was fucking dark I mean I don't know for whatever reason it rocked me it was there was a reddit post on people that are making knockoff ugg boots in China and they said that there's these entire factories where they're just cutting up dogs while they're alive just skinning dogs alive and taking that fur and processing it up and serving out there as an UGG boot and I'm like dude you know what I don't i used to click on this stuff and i used to I can't do it I used to pride myself on separating these are just pixels on a screen these are ones and zeros this isn't real there's no emotion here there's now an I was so desensitized from those those early days and I was like oh fuck it let's see this video let's see what this world really is and it just shattered me it ruined my whole fucking day it's ruined my week it's still like in my head which you know what like good cuz at least now I'm talking about it it was a graphic terrible thing but I didn't know they'd do that I know these skin fucking dogs alive yeah knockoff ugg boots I've seen that video it's very hard to watch alright it's very hard to watch any of those skinning video so those are horrific because you know they show the bodies they're still alive they don't even I'm not killing them now they just they you know they can't they don't kill them first they skin them while they're still breathing and they feel everything and it's they're so insensitive they know it doesn't bother them even the slightest there's like levels of humanity people dip down to that's very disturbing like I'm sure you've seen the the dolphin decks in Japan where they have dolphins lay down a deck 50 60 dolphins and they just slights their throats they pull them out of the water right and they slice their throats and it is horrific how else but I'm sorry I have to play devil's advocate how else are they supposed to do their solar degree search Oh it's fucking terrible it's a bit man you can't shoot him in the head if you're gonna kill him you can't shoot him in the head you got to do it that one I'm not saying you should kill him you know I'm not for killing him but how horrific is it that they did the way they choose to do is to bleed them out but you're asking for like an ounce of humanity and some of the most inhumane acts it's like that's okay to ask for what's okay to ask for it's it's really disturbing right but what is it that allows some folks to go to a place is it necessity I mean what the fuck is it that allows people to not give even one shit about a dolphin or a dog than make boots out of or anybody because they don't see the dolphin or the dog they see their survival and their family survival yeah that's all they see it's a necessity it's a gotta be innocent must be right like I mean if you had a choice of doing a podcast every day or slitting dolphins throats you would do a podcast every day this person doesn't have that choice or they at least they don't feel like they had a choice I would imagine if they had that if some dudes out there was like I'll do it I get to I get to skin a fucking greyhound today can't wait and I'm gonna punch some rabbits in the face before I get home if someone's really thinking that I don't I can't I don't want to rest my head around of course they are do you there's people there's there's dark people no doubt about I know that there are people that do that but I mean systematically for hundreds of thousands of workers to do that I don't want to believe that that's their attitude watch videos of people beating cows when they work with in the slaughterhouse and they're hitting cows with hammers and shit well that just makes them tastier once that's pure that's pre tenderization I went to the city pound today and I have you ever been to a city pound like I'd kill two dogs from pounds yeah a dog squeaky member squeaky yeah for a pound I don't understand how any of these dogs ever get taken there like all the dogs there today all look fucking dirty beat-up just nasty every autumn were barking it was like the most saddest depressing and thing ever and then I watched somebody give up their dog this this girl about 24 came in with a pit and she goes I need to surrender this dog and they're like it's $25 and she goes all right and she gives in to $25 and then she gives the the leash to the woman and the dog didn't want to leave the girls side and so she the woman had like coal and like drag the dog through and then the woman just seemed unfazed by it though and I'm just like which woman the woman woman that was giving up the dog and I'm just like how do you like if I have a dog that need to get rid of and even for whatever reason it's never gonna be that I don't think it's going to be find a friend first find something first and but she probably the dog was probably nuts yeah you know or it was hopefully it's that issue it's not that she didn't have the space for it at the time for it all right because when people do that and they bring a dog to a pound I mean you're just asking someone else to kill the thing you just ask you just like take it out out take it out of my hand take it out of my head I don't want it in my head anymore right you put it in your head now now you deal with it what's crazy some people are like that and I think some people are just really irresponsible and inconsiderate and they don't you know it's like well I'll get this thing for two minutes and then okay I'm done with this play thing I was really not my love I was really surprised though that they didn't clean up the dogs cuz I my friend works at the shelter and the place they did they take dogs that are about to do to die like to be put to sleep and they rescued those dogs then they clean them up and repackage them you know and like you know refurbish them or whatever and then and then these dogs amazing-looking you walk in you want every single dog and these are all dogs about to die so you would think this like sitting location yeah little city pound would hire four kids you know in high school to clean up these dongs there's no money yeah there's no money for anything those poor people yeah anybody I mean that's a that's a dark road when you especially today when you deal with all the fucking economic hardships that are hitting people and then you ask people to care about dogs so good luck they had roosters there those snakes they had bunnies they think tons of bunnies and chickens and like fingers like it was crazy but it's like the new thing that's like the new thing to have I think is a rooster yeah no joke well also there's there's a lot yeah I mean that was like a hipster thing for a minute serious yeah dead serious microphone and my headset down Oh same here please yeah it's really loud man um I went to my old gardener used to fight roosters on what to actually cock fight them like strapped razor blades on their feet lay the whole deal a little louder little louder that's good good yeah he he used to raise him and fight him you know and uh he took me to like where his friend has like this hole where they have hundreds of these different roosters in these cages and shit what's the set it was just like underground or you know he had a lot of space it's a really weird man cuz it's so you are not that far from here you know I mean you drive maybe 20 minutes and you're in Mexico bro I mean I mean you're really in Mel I thought you like solve this here I don't know I mean it is here okay it's closed I'm saying it's in Mexico because everything's in Spanish right the entire neighborhood is they've just completely turned this one neighborhood I don't want to say where this into into essentially like a branch of Mexico it's nuts everything is in Spanish every Sun at every store was in Spanish really yeah it was amazing I was like this is kind of cool that they've been able to do that it's kind of weird I'm like come on man you're in America just learn the fucking language it's not that hard you know I know it all right and you know I know a lot of idiots that know no English right dude just get a goddamn rosetta stone figure shit out but you know to them I guess you know they want to be around their people and there's nothing wrong with that man you know this guy was cool as fuck this gardener but did he show you did you actually go watch no I didn't watch the actual fight itself but I went and watched him fuck around I want to watch them train with each other they train them you know they like they have them go at each other with no spurs on and they decide when to pull him off and you know they they do a bunch of shit to them to like they feed them like certain certain food to make sure they're strong you know high protein and yeah they have those championship lines of roosters you want to buy roosters and breed them with like championship bloodlines cuz you want like a really aggressive badass writer that really knows how to get out is there a fantasy league for cockfighting ha ha that's that needs to be built that needs to be put together gambling a lot of gambling that's what I mean farm field no you know bring it in bring it in to Vegas you got to be there legitimize it well I think it's legit in a couple of states I think it's legal in a couple states that was illegal everywhere really I would I would imagine something like I mean it's like it's it's like dogfighting how would that you know no no no no no it's not like dog fighting dogs are awesome chickens can suck my dick all right I never care about chickens there's some dude there's some good at home though like right now is roost that that feels the same way about his about dog they're cold-hearted dinosaurs okay cockfighting is now illegal in all 50 states and in Washington DC we the last state to make yeah yeah it's interesting Wow I think it was it was legal pretty recently though hmm not illegal in West Hollywood shut up Bryan trying to be gay and funny silly goose yeah he's apparently what was the other gay Jim Carrey thing that you're watching oh that movie did you ever watch that no I did no but he said the reason he watched it was it well it was on but the remote was so far away that I was just like ah I'm like that's that's your excuse for watching gay porn like I just wanted to watch two dudes fuck well it doesn't start off like I'm sorry here's the information Louisiana was the last state and it was 2007 so that's pretty goddamn racially yeah ban took effect in 2008 someone's still fighting to repeal that there you know it yeah yeah it's fascinating rappers yeah well I know that um Roy Jones jr. is a huge proponent of the cockfighting you know he used to fly in private jets with roosters he was flying like he was the fucking middleweight champion of the world yeah all right flying around a goddamn private jet he would bring like ten roosters with him in cages Wow yeah he was nuts man and he would fight them himself oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's no backlash for that for him or now well it's not the same man you know like the backlash from Michael Vick look there's a great difference you tell someone someone fights dogs and you go whoa man that's kind of fucked up you know like in and then you heard the other shit that Vick today like to shoot the dogs drown them or shoot him in the head like he murdered him he murdered a bunch of dogs and that takes a certain personality that we don't like yeah that's Mel we were just talking about wasn't even a court even worse because this is a multi-millionaire this isn't a guy who's in any state of necessity it's this isn't cruelty because he's in a bad position and he needs to do this because he's got to put food on the table no this is a guy who's getting off on killing animals for sure and we just kind of accepted him back into the fold because he's really good at football you know and I know people say well you know he did his time yeah I guess he did do his time but there's there's a certain amount of what he did that's so horrific that it just makes you really hesitant to ever forgive someone for that kind of behavior you know I forgive someone for fucking up I forgive someone for saying things I forgave someone for racism I forgive I forgive someone for poor mental choices but when you kill a hundred dogs man and you electrocute them and shoot them and stab them and doing all that shit that he supposedly did right I don't like you I don't think I'll ever like you I don't think I can like you I think you you you're capable of doing some shit that I would never imagine and how far back of you bounce from that 180 degrees are you a perfect person now right are you just less creepy because you know the cameras are on you and you don't want to go back to jail for killing dogs fuck you man you think there's an expectation though that people have an expectation like well okay he did his time so you should forget I guess you should because I don't have expectation I would like to believe I would like to believe that people can you know fully learn from but man I like dogs and that drove me crazy and I like pit bulls and you know what for pit bulls like to fight man that is a fact they like it I've had to break my dogs up many times when I have pit bulls and it's scary especially they don't want to let go and there wagging their tails they're both wagging their tails and they're locked onto each other's faces you know it's crazy yeah it's crazy but that's what they do man it's it's they're thousands of years of genetic breeding and you know what it's this coming from a person who's deeply involved in human fighting so for me like dog fighting is what is it less brutal than when I fucking watch every weekend right is it less brutal than you know then Alistair Overeem kicking you in the fucking head with his shin I think a dog biting you might be a little less brutal than that you know it might be less brutal than having Cain Velasquez punch a fucking hole through your face like he did the Brock Lesnar you know I mean shit yes those guys are those guys like they're because they want to be there they're making the conscious revision to be there that's what the dogs want to do it too they want to bike through the some do yeah but they're also killing each other and there's no referee really scary so I stopped it well yes there are no it's not stop - you don't know that's not true that's not true the dogs they break the dogs and they bring them back together again as the dogs shied away they stopped it that's incorrect I mean where is the elect the electrocution in the rally that you brought that's all we've got dogs that are not game this is what the the idea is you never breed that is a human aggressive you never breed a dog that quits you never breed a dog that is scared of another dog a dog that backs away the the thing what they've done with pit bulls is they've taken this animal and they've engineered it into a super fighter and there's no other dog that comes close to a pitbull when it comes to dogfighting there's no other dog and this isn't you know I'm not I'm not bragging about this this isn't like fanboy talk this is this is just what they've done they've taken this animal they've made it something very unusual what they've done is they've made an animal that's absolutely unafraid to die absolutely unafraid of pain and absolutely unafraid of conflict and impact they go right after other dogs there's no hesitation a lot of dogs they growl they try to figure out who's gonna be the boss and the piss on the fence might mean it would be able to avoid a fight all together there's no avoiding a fight with pitbull none zero if there's a wild pits a pitbull and he's out of his cage and he's a male and he has his balls and there's another dog that's a male and has his balls and that dog does anything even remotely resembling something that challenges the pitbulls dominance there's a fight he's been bred for them yeah unless you're you're just a bad motherfucker Cesar Millan guy and you've done a really good job of breeding your dog or you've got a particular docile version of the breed where many many many generations of breeders have bred the game 'no sout of pits when im talking about game pitbulls most people what you see when you see a pit bull you see this like 90 pound muscular big-headed that's not a game pit bull a game pit bulls about 35 pounds they're very small and they look like like almost like a beagle man I mean I don't wanna not really but they don't look like the dogs that we are used to seeing they look like these these little sinewy little like springy athletic dogs right the idea was you you had to get a small dog because you had to be able to physically separate them when they're going at it if you got to 90 pound pitbulls going out first of all they don't last the gas out really quick just like heavyweights like yours and the gas out really quick and they you can't separate them they're too fucking strong it's too dangerous to 235 pounders you just get right in there and pick them up 25 pounder 28 pounder so they have weight classes and they put dogs on tread so I guess I get that they treat it like a sport I get that they treat it like you know like anybody else would treat something professional but does that make it okay to be breeding the dogs for that no it certainly doesn't I mean I don't support it in any no and I wasn't lying you know what I mean like that's woodsy I I'm a hypocrite though because I guess at us you just said it's you I'm fighting UFC no it's not really I mean I did they did dogs get fucking bit by pit bulls behind of kidding and I'm kind of exaggerating but I did say it but I what I meant was I mean I am around voluntary human violence amongst the most intelligent species on the planet right a regular basis and for sure I know those guys enjoy it and I think the dogs enjoy it too I don't think they should do it I hated watching dogs fight and when I'd come home and dogs would get angry and you know sometimes it would it would be a fight over attention and you come home and they decide like one person wants to pet you want to get pat and then the other dog wants to get pat and they'll fucking growl it right out there and it's really annoying you know and it's one of the things that happens when you have a bunch of dogs but my my point about pit bulls is not that you know that it's there's anything good about what they do now you're just saying this is what they do this is what they did right and what I mean I think a dog could be bred to love being pet just as much as it loves aggression I'm a dog is so I mean of course over many generations well my dog now is what's called a Regency Mastiff and what a Regency Mastiff is is a Neapolitan Mastiff that's bred with a pitbull and Lincoln one-percenter it's what it essentially is is this big strong athletic pit bull mastiff combination but there's no dog aggression at all and no people aggression he's like but but it's because I know the guy who breathes it and he breeds for the exact opposite on show any aggression to anybody done no breeding right make a no hasn't fixed he has effects but he doesn't killed him he's not shooting him in the head you know he's a he's a breeder who loves animals sure to come over his house when these dogs are playing with his two-year-old daughter you know man so like that's you you can do amazing things with animals through breeding and what they've done with the pit bull is an amazing thing I love the dogs there are amazing dogs a guy had one at the gym the other day I couldn't stop petting it they're fascinating animals be brought to the gym yeah yeah guys jiu-jitsu come on my friend I bring the fishbowl to the gym the the thing about them is because they've been bred that way we're only the strongest most aggressive though the ones with the the most impenetrable will those are the only ones that are allowed to breed in the dogfighting community the other ones are called you know they're either killed or they're neutered or they're given to people as pets but when when you have that what you get is this incredibly like energetic intelligent animal you get this survivor you get this like cream-of-the-crop genetic specimen of a dog they're just fucking amazing I feel the same way about Yorkie pues ya fuckin you get the adorableness of the Yorkshire and get the intelligence of the poodle Dave I mean who doesn't want that on a calendar or in their living room once you have a pitbull it's very hard to take other dog seriously really yeah German Shepherds are pretty easy to take seriously they're pretty good buddies uh my buddy's cousin trains German Shepherds very smart dog and he taught like he trains them for like celebrities and I guess he taught jay-z's dog diamonds really until the German Shepherd diamonds but I said oh jay-z but I think that's so awesome it's all there isn't that the coolest thing ever yeah German Shepherds are super super smart you can't just leave a German Shepherd in the yard they'll find a way out man they don't like it they'll be they you know they'll they'll if they have to they'll stay in the yard but they get bored really quick they're task-oriented animals yeah their SWAT team members yeah like they you know they are treated like LSD malam was the smaller versions it looked just like German ships but they're small same thing you know those dogs are super both German Shepherds at the pound today both just standing at attention now they are dying or anything and that didn't I say - they're great dogs German Shepherds are great dogs I had a German Shepherd my grandfather had one when I was growing up what a great dog it was it was literally a dog would like go check on things like watch over the kids like kids would be playing like my cousins would be playing and the dog would just stand there and watch over them and make sure everybody's okay right make sure no no human hosts you guys cool you mean if people would like walk by the front if like he was by the babies and the little kids and little kids were playing and people would walk by the front the dog would take two steps towards the fence just in case you needed to go Jack somebody just take two steps and then he would look back at the little kids look back at little kids and I'm like this I was like six and I realized that so I'm like this motherfuckers guarding these dogs you'd be right the dog is guarding them you don't see that from very many dogs and house dogs don't give a fuck about somebody's babies so fuck this baby you know lick my balls let me eat some food they can strip later yeah this is a totally different animal was weird hey you mentioned Michael Vick did his time and I don't want to ten gentle eyes too much but I mean I think it's crazy that that you know this occupy stuff's going on I haven't had a chance to talk to you about it mmm-hmm I don't know where you fall or what you've seen but it's crazy that those guys haven't done any time yet well there's no leader that's the thing you know they're trying to find someone to put away where they can stop the movement the scariest thing about Occupy Wall Street for them is that there's no one person with a megaphone right it's the only reason they're lasting so long I mean it could be it's getting bigger to it it's it's bigger and bigger every day this is the beginning of something huge right this is not just what it looked like you know you what it looked like was like one of them fucking Glenn Beck rallies that just got got real long lasted a while and everybody's pissed yeah I get it you're pissed I'm pissed too but then after a couple of weeks it's like this is not the same this is a different feeling and this has a this hasn't overthrow the government feel to it yeah I mean I saw people out there for the first time with signs that said audit the Fed yes like I didn't see you guys out here for any other rally and maybe that's just cuz my eyes weren't open enough but I went okay if this is how it's gonna go down let's get it going well I've had some discussions about this on my message board and there's some real good points a lot of these guys brought up that I agree with and one of them is that there's not a lot of cohesive message to this thing right so it's like there's so many different people with so many different ones that's what happened with any movement sure absolutely especially a movement with no leader right you know that they go there and they like stop the drone killings you know and there's PETA people there and there's there's fucking solar people there and hemp people there and they legalize marijuana people there and everyone's got their own signs and it's not just Occupy Wall Street it's everything that sucks and I don't got how to sign that said shits fucked up and it's shit like so abso-fucking-lutely dude it's bust up so that's reason enough to get out there and right now the major concern is watching special interest groups Agent Provocateur yeah watch them try to roll into the fray and do their YouTube videos to fight back and their CNN coverage - yeah picture the protest in a certain direction it's so fascinating to watch the way the steps were outlined for here's what happened to the Tea Party here's how every other movement has been marginalized excuse me coffee bad marginalized every other movement for four years and to watch those steps playing out right now with Occupy Wall Street and seeing if it's gonna thrive or if it's gonna crumble in on itself do you think this sort of marginalize the Tea Party or anything they just did to themselves the people who truly and this is this is from reddit articles and from what I can cobble together on Wikipedia but the people who are at the true heart of the original Tea Party were anti Federal Reserve right they were anti big banks they were anti corporations and a lot of people said well they're Ron Paul supporters so they got lumped in is okay you're you're Ron Paul so you're Republican and they're like wait but we're not necessarily Republican I mean we do believe in similar Ron Paul's idea isn't it nope you're Republican now we're gonna get some crazies out there with some hats that have tea bags dangling tea bags dangling from them and send out flyers um you really think that someone sent those people out there you don't think there was a lot of people that just joined in no there certainly were but do you think there was a war Kasturi I think I think aspects of it were orchestrated I think you I think there's documented proof of people doing that I mean they already have they already have agent provocateurs core that Citibank thing where those guys got arrested the forty people that were in a Citibank trying to close their bank accounts hmm now they were being assholes they were they were being dicks they're had their cardboard signs inside a Citibank we're disrupt and they're shouting you're being disruptive yeah they weren't just just just canceling their bank account the guy who was the loudest there one of the guys was allowed us from videos that I've seen was an undercover cop he was he was right in the yeah it's out there so one of the one of the ladies who went in there she did protest she did say her speech but then she politely after they told her to quiet down and this is again I can only cobble together so many stories but this is what I've observed over a few articles she quietly calmed down she closed her bank account she was outside they locked everybody in because the police said well if they're disrupting business hold them there which I don't even for being an asshole I don't think you can legally detain somebody like that without the cops being there dude came outside she said I'm a customer showing him the Citibank Bank receipts and stuff she said I'm supposed to be in there I'm trying to cancel my account he's like you were one of the protesters grabs her bear hold style and drags her back inside the city bank to be processed City Bank this is hilarious the Citibank protesters saying that the undercover cops set them up you know thought it was a setup so the one thing this organ that this this movement has going for it which had remained may has me remaining so hopeful is that they are so fucking connected like that's what makes it great because the second bullshit happens it's like listen yeah that's one story but here's 40 other angles of that event start to finish you look at what happened you know and they show they showed a commercial right now there's an attack commercial against the movement that has some crazy guy who's known for being a crazy YouTube guy spouting anti-semitic remarks at people left and right and there's one guy and there's another dude that has a sign that's that was anti-semitic and they cut back and forth between this guy for like three minutes you know this guy with a sign the guy with that and and there's video of people at that protest shaming them telling them to get the fuck out of here this doesn't belong here so you see the one message and go crazy anti-semitism there you go I get why people believe that that's the message they see but this movement is so connected that there's a chance that you could see 40 other perspectives on it and truly make it up for you well you can truly decide this Citibank arrest now that we're talking about this and now that I'm going and you told me that's what I'm going online and will tweet this stuff too people are getting a chance to you want one of those when there's cold ones yeah open open the top then the bottom there bottom shelter there you go fella get one for everybody yeah Shore thanks this is why they're saying that they know that the guy was an undercover cop it's because he fucking arrested one of them once they got outside the fucking guy would know what he wasn't just an undercover cop he was mocking them and laughing about he arrested one of the protesters outside slammed her into a wall pushed her back into the bank there's video of that he was at the precinct while they're all getting arrested and he was laughing with fellow white shirt cops telling him about what we'd been saying basically it was a bit startling how inside their information was how they were being paid to go to these protests and put us in situations where we'd be arrested and not able to lead not be able to leave that's amazing it's not it's not the only incident by a long shot that's crazy but who is in charge of this if this guy is an undercover cop right and where is this Citibank branch what part of the country was this I don't recall that sucks I would like to nothing not there on the end York it's New York Wow there you go so you know who's boss Newton's quare Park Police Wow they they set this woman up this is this is disgusting it's Nate's not the only incident this is a disgusting that that this is this should be fraud we should be able to sue them for fraud I hope they can misrepresenting our our our tax dollars and misrepresenting your position to protect us you are leading someone into an illegal event and and and then you're the one who's screaming shit out and you're writing them you know about kattiline the process the procedure of Quetta lling was a it's what the cops they have a term for it it's for cutting off large sections of a crowd for arrest during a protest so that Brooklyn Bridge arrests uh-huh there's a lot of views that depending upon how you want to interpret the video that you're watching those guys were kettled so it means like they create a pot in this case it was a Brooklyn Bridge right they cut off one end of the Brooklyn Bridge then they told protesters hey you know no foot traffic allowed on the bridge into a megaphone which if you've ever been to a rally the first three people can hear that megaphone no one else fucking can no one else can so they one officer at the very front you guys can't be here guys can't be here guys can't be here no foot traffic puts it away all right everybody turns around and and many of the protesters felt that they were there was a line of police officers walking down the street leading them onto the Brooklyn Bridge like a crossed it the protestors thought they had some a minor victory they're like fuck yeah Brooklyn Bridge we this shit the cops get about halfway in they cut them off they put the lid on the kettle and they cut off this large group of protesters on bridge and arrested them all Wow it's like leading the marching band interested like 700 yeah that got a lot yeah it's Cowboys yeah it really is they were just hurting protesters yeah well you know what man but it sucks this movement is an anti cop whatsoever and it sucks that it's unfortunately only the bad and salacious stuff it's the news coverage well that's that's important though because people need to know what can happen of course happen we need to know about this this Citibank thing is fucking disgusting right this is really gross and if somebody just feels like citibanks a shit organization they just want to go in there and cancel their thing and maybe say Citibank I disagree with everything you're doing and I want my money back good fun leave so search the one that happened today with Bank of America because a woman goes into a Bank of America she had a sign there's video this whole thing again I think don't preach don't make a ruckus you don't try to be the YouTube splash but then again here we are talking about it so I guess it worked is this today you're saying I think it was today was that something from October 11th where a bunch of women were arrested inside a Bank of America for returning trash from foreclosed home no no no I think it was from today it was two women one has a sign she says I'm against you guys I'm closing my account she immediately goes in and like a branch manager comes over to her and says you can't be here you need to leave she's like what you talking about you need to get out of here I'm calling the cops she's like listen I'm not I'm just here to close my account you can't you're a protestor I'm calling the cops white what I haven't done anything and she's like I'll put the sign away I'll put the sign away no calling the cops and it gets to the point where she actually delivers a line you cannot be a protestor and a customer at the same time whoa kick them out lock the doors oh they just kicked him out yeah well I mean the cops wouldn't do any I mean come on man oh yeah but you can't be a protestor I know but you didn't they didn't arrest him I don't know I mean what do you want to do you want to be able to go to a place where you work and have a bunch of people stand around yelling then what you're doing is bad or protesting inside your job no but you have to watch the video because they they were they doing she sat down with her sign I was waiting to close the account again I still think it's dickish to go and make noise and shout at some well it's a poor district manager that she's the 1% because you know she's not she's just doing her job too well I think that's what eggs are like airplanes though like you really have to watch what you do inside of a bank right especially if you have a sign you don't know if you like person has a bomb connected underneath their coat you know I mean it's a little different like I feel weird wearing an open shirt in the bank so somebody had a good point about Occupy Wall Street and they said all we need is one or two bounced checks and the cops are with us yeah and that's so true because the cops are with us you know it's the cops are not fucking bankers but did you see your idea to see the nighttime release the idea that you can get the cops to act as protectors for these cocksuckers this is really dark it's really dark when you think about it that it could even be steered in that direction don't you think it's already happening now in what way I mean I mean they were this one Citibank thing yes I do but I mean they're like the the police actions in New York from checking IDs to make sure you're allowed to walk on certain streets you had to have a Wall Street ID and of a night ID that matched one of the addresses that you work there well don't you think that probably has something to do with terror attacks as well I mean they did do it before these protests right but I mean now the only think they're worried possibly that someone's gonna sneak through them if there's so much fucking like but I mean sample and so much attention in a certain area I I don't think this protester hasn't been violent security this protest hasn't been violent there have been outbursts you know but they haven't I mean that's beg beg beg officer Tony baloney that pepper sprayed those women that were in the net no know if you saw that video yeah I did like that guy lost ten vacation days that's it that was his punishment really the verdict yeah it happened yesterday he lost ten vacation days for pepper spraying and he's still a cop 3-1 I was still a cop doesn't get demoted nothing you know he had also some sort of a into some sort of situation in 2004 or he abuse and punched somebody I think yeah but real quick to finish that point though you know you got guys like that out there you want those guys checking your ID to make sure you work at a building and it's like well you go yeah it's for safety but we've given up so many freedoms in the name of safety and is further erosion of the I agree with you but just playing devil's advocate what if you don't work for anybody who's doing anything evil and you work on fucking Wall Street and you can't get anywhere near your job because there's a million hippies out there beating drums bragging it for the bank's to close and you don't even support the fucking banks be like I hear you but I got to get over there cuz that's where I work and they're like you fuckin one presenter you fucking piece of shit suppressing people and you know meanwhile is the person who works there I don't know I mean I know that's not the attitude of the protesters I hope that they and that's why I was troubled to see that woman called the branch manager like oh you're the 1% I'm like again this is just a motherfucker trying to do their job yeah I marched in the LA rally that they had I was like let's see this thing if I'm gonna put my weight behind this at all or I try not to get too political at times and I was like if I'm gonna be outspoken about this shit I need to go down there I need to see what it's like and I'm shocked at how many people have framed complex opinions about it and yet haven't gone down yeah to actually see one and when I was there the cross-section of society that I ran into I feared didn't exist anymore truly amazing people there's incredible people that for every avatar dressed up head to toe blue hippy that's banging a bongo drum there were three people there of all ages all races that like understood that shit is fucked up in this country and was trying to be positive about it mm-hmm you know and trying to elicit change and so it was really nice feeling about I feel like there were there were clear demands and there was a you know a good purpose to it then now it's been a little co-opted how long ago was this that I went out there yeah probably week or two ago so you think it's being co-opted by nefarious forces that are working undercover to try to sabotage things yeah the Citibank thing I think so yeah really and what do they do that to every movement I mean from the attack ads to marginalizing the message to entrapment it's costing them a lot of money I mean I think it was New York or said something like that like they were gonna go bankrupt from this you know and so the cash is what got billions right well did you see that mayor job fuckface well this was going on I believe it was JPMorgan Chase announced their their huge grant to NYPD I've like four point six million dollars or something like that it might have been billion dollars I'm not even joking hey this rep is probably million you should google it but it's literally like as this is going on and the cops are there protecting Wall Street and pepper spraying civilians who are protesting it JP Morgan is making multi-million dollar donations to the NYPD no what were they gonna serve and protect man right so yeah they might be wanted to pensions away but guess what they're not gonna lose their pension politicians don't fuck with the cops cuz they know they need him there to protect them and protect the bankers says door that's why it was inspiring to watch Marine it was a fuckin Marine colonel that was on the street and you want to talk about pitbulls Joe yeah I saw that that motherfucker was inspiring and people were like he only said three words and like it took him three words like it was like there's no honor in this which is several more words than that but it took only that from that dude wearing that uniform with that intensity to shut those cops down those cops couldn't say sure I couldn't say up shit pointing to his medals and shit what do you guys do when you're on horses trampling fucking innocent protests you're supposed to protect these people yeah this isn't a war zone these people don't have guns yeah y-you heard in these people there's no there's no honor in this it's all it took from that fucking guy ap Morgan Chase donates 4.6 million to Nye during the proto rings of protest that's amazing it's amazing it's fuckin transparent as sin it's gross this is something that would have happened a long time ago we would have never heard about it but look at the sight that that announcement is on that's on their official website it's not like they tried to hide this it's not like somebody had to go digging up some file to find some back-alley deal yeah they were like hey world we just donated 4.6 million to the NYPD that's how good we are as people Wow either how gross and then the cops are acting as if that 4.6 million is worth more than whatever these fucking regular people pay out of their paychecks every goddamn week and a percentage of that for sure right has to go to public service they're the people that that are in your community man the people that are that are fed up and you are just gonna bend over and take it up the coulee for 4.6 from some fucking bankers yeah that's a main or an Adam Sandler movie that's not my horror how much does the movie cost it was a lot more than 4.6 million well that's what they gross but there's a lot of fucking money you might not like his movies but now I love that I was a total joke guy made $16 for a movie who would cry yeah that would be a terrible weekend so ah fuck it was a talk about JPMorgan announced it's right in the middle of it it was terrifying so yeah so here's what here's one one thing I'm gonna attempt to do I'm gonna try to raise some money do an app to help facilitate protesters right now really and how's that work I got a couple ideas I mean I think right now I'd love to see geolocation mixed-media chat rooms that you can join password-protected anonymous whatever you know you'll log into the room maybe I'll create occupy LA and people go in there now we have a mixed media shared space with like IRC style moderation meaning whoever creates that room can anoint if I create a room I can give you permission and you permission to post directly to it everybody else chats in a separate area of the app but allow people to push button quick voice message chat so you can quickly communicate in a crowd like hey the cops are coming everybody fucking sit down whoa right idea ma'am hey there Katalin us in pull up the Google Maps drop a pin on it and send that out to the group so they can be like alright here's our new rally point and get there all the names of keeping it peaceful and organized if anybody takes a photo or tries to livestream from within the app it would be geotagged and hashtagged automatically because you're in that group so when it goes up to the web now like right now I'm trying to follow the protests and they go cops are beating a dude in a wheelchair in Sacramento they weren't they were just arresting a kid in a wheelchair so it's okay and he was just there after curfew I had to track down for Twitter accounts to find where that was happening click on the protest go to the livestream one livestream went down and like that's it's inefficient if everybody organized through one channel all their media you could pull up a map in real time of all the shit that's going down the world click on a bubble and view it back like a timeline and see when the room started what people were saying what keywords were popping what media was happening where the videos were you could piece up angles based off timestamps and the ideas you could really you would have the most honest slice of an event and history that's going on and be I think it would be amazing it would help people on the ground really organize and be safe you know safer that's a great idea they're there in case quick so I want to do it on Kickstarter if someone hasn't stolen the idea already I want to do it I've already said what do you call it we gather how about fuck the police yeah underground now because it will never get it'll never get funding as I think I had it like a riot fudge the pie riot no Elijah riot I had a bunch of like angry aggressive names but the way to really sell it is to say well not only can this be used to help facilitate marches but if of 10 is going to Disneyland they can all create a group amongst their friends and share their media that way you know yeah that's how you should market it Riley so what do you think yeah yeah we gather we gotta know like it's a social app and I like it someone touched took the dot-com and the logo and everything else so register yeah no how dare you I just wanted to get I want the idea out there I was gonna sell the I was - oh don't steal it no I mean I hope if someone can help me make that please why don't you register tonight good yeah do it I got aspect up I know how much it's gonna cost we're gonna go out there and do it sounds brilliant thanks I was like a brilliant idea I agree I think it'd be cool and really one earbud for Disneyland - it would and if you're at like a fucking Coachella let me try the Coachella room with my friends and then we can keep our room private but promote media up so I can go to the public room so you go to the Kentucky Derby and you get lost you a group of friends right or you're just out of cock fight you want to know where your friends I don't know who's Woo's roosters on top that's it we gather yeah that's a great idea I like that a lot so you're like a revolutionary look at you well dude how revolutionary would that image because right now the crowds the path of the violence and the confusion comes from panic and the panic is coming from a lack of communication they've when you see those people chanting back what people are saying in a park people think they're crazy and it's like a cult it's like actually no they don't allow amplification devices right so people were just like will loudly repeat everything else that's happening right you get enough people running a we gather style app pop in one ear bud you can still hear what's going on around you you'll know exactly who's connected and who's in that room by the side of the earbud and by glancing down at your phone and just fucking push-to-talk man Jimmy kills teen made a tweet and this tweet will forever in my mind embody what is going on here he made this tweet he was down at Occupy Wall Street he was talking about how fucking crazy it is he wrote they just arrested a guy because they thought he was the leader period there are no leaders Occupy Wall Street you know and you know hashtag and I was like wow like what a crazy movement that must be for people where there's not one guy on a podium with a microphone true truly democratic movement right now growing truly in the crowd ohing and how the fuck do you silence that when you got because if you got guys like move on there's a petition on move on site to have them to stop supporting Occupy Wall Street they're seen as a radical leftist group and very political and they have their own ties to corporations etc etc depending upon who you ask so right now you can't have anybody from a group like that Republican Democrat I don't give a shit you cannot have groups with strong political ties funding your movement and you know and gathering an interest for your movement we're gonna do that because that will be used as fodder to shut it down immediately this is this did you see that we are that this song a political party here there's no political party involved in any of this there's Republicans out there and libertarians out there I think a lot of Republicans don't think there are Republicans out there that's a message that I run into a lot a lot of Republicans are so goddamn brainwashed don't even know what a Republican is a lot of Republican Democrats tell people that I would register to be a Republican if I really thought that Ron Paul had a chance or that Gary Johnson had a chance what a real Republican is supposed to be about supposed to be about small businesses saying the fuck out of people's personal ass Ron Paul yeah a real Republican by the way wouldn't give a shit if you got married if you're gay a real Republican wouldn't give a shit about what religion you want a prayer your business as long as the government doesn't tell me if it's okay your business a constitutional Republican it would say that right now would never be wanting to intersect religion in with politics what's gone on in this country is people like always lump themselves into fucking teams whether it's Windows versus Mac or which is why we can't you know which is why they can't allow a certain group that represents a certain team or a certain color of fucking animal you know glom onto their message and they're gonna have to communicate better that you know what this is the big question about this Occupy Wall Street thing is that it's already gotten way past a boiling point and it's gotten to a point where if the economy doesn't improve and these people don't have to go back to work well what the fuck is gonna stop them from escalating right the fuck is gonna stop this from getting I love that and bigger I love when people give me a job get a get a job you hippie get a fucking job it's like what create one for me what create one for me I'll take it that's why I'm out here asshole everybody says get a job today's an asshole yeah huge let's get a job be interesting to see what happens to come winter it's ten percent unemployment and that's just for people who are fucking registering for unemployment the people that aren't even know that's why those numbers are screwy man then when they say the country is nine percent or 10 percent or what it is that's just people that are like registering for unemployment how many people are not eligible for unemployment and they're still unemployed how many people have used up their unemployment and they're still unemployed you know was it because they're playing World of Warcraft it's because they have no Drive because they're alcoholics it's because they're let's paint whatever negative picture we can on the fact that some people get down on their luck sometimes that's what despite worm and cane things right yeah yeah okay Herman Cain is it's your bad you know it's your ass bleeding it's not cuz I raped you it's cuz you didn't resist it you hard enough it's like he's wrong but isn't he right too isn't he like he's absolutely wrong and there's certainly people in certain situations and there's there's for sure people get a shit roll of the dice man I've seen that we've all seen it and some people are just fuckin lazy and want to suck off the teat and a lot of individual greed had led to the situations that we have right now there's there's it's so multifaceted right he's right and he's wrong right exactly what I was gonna say is that his point is it's very simple and generalized but the reality as many a person has gone from intense poverty to immense wealth and they've done it by Bulldog determinations but they didn't the game was rigged what I don't know about that I think Toob we're doing that right now even while the game is rigged harder than oh it is most certainly much harder well what do you think has changed and as far as the game being rigged I mean what is the interest rates are much higher for credit cards and you know it's it's harder to get a loan for for businesses it's a to buy a house jobs that you can get but what other but how else is it rigged I think like I think the jobs you can get right now I mean the dollar is being so manipulated I think hey first of all to get something big going you want you want to get Bill Gates money you want to get that kind of money you want to be a baller you got to make your own shit you got to make your own shit sure you got to create your own thing your own business your own boss so we'll do it of whatever the fuck you got to do but it's got to be your own thing that's the only way you make a monumental kind of money and so what here Raphael sucks in this country and Cellular sucks so I'm gonna start my own my own carrier throughout I'm gonna make it awesome but the game is rigged against me I can't rule out history people have figured out a way people have figured out a way in the darkest times to make shit piles of money so he's wrong in generalizing right now but he's also right it is possible it's as most people aren't willing to do the work to create the possible they're you you you have to become like a madman to become super uber successful in the middle of a fuckin economy but I don't can do but there is no middle class anymore that's what yes I think it does take that Drive it does take I think you said like Steve Jobs ran himself at 11,000 rpm every day just be themself out it does take that to be at his level but these aren't people in Times Square I'm getting back to the movement I don't think these are people that want to be Steve Jobs necessarily you know they just want jobs just don't take a job I just want it they want a modest house in a modern a bit in a modest neighborhood we used to be able to get them for what's impossible anymore I mean for some people I don't think it is like if you're born in impossible is that a real is that possible that something could be in past I don't think I don't think anything's impossible if there's salutely not but should we hang our hats on oh no but a 185 or so let's let's say the the unemployment the legit unemployment numbers 15 percent is probably worse than that but let's say it's 15 percent nationwide that still means 85 percent of people are working and if 85 percent of the people are working why can't you work is it is there a way to get through you know I'm saying you know I mean I'm not saying you can't really say there is no middle class for sure the situation is fucked up for sure we're in a terrible financial situation where we've realized that we've been scammed all these years right in essentially defrauded and lied to and we you know we have a congress that's bought and paid for it it really it's pretty obvious absolutely no one's no one's prosecuting any of these folks yet they're going after pot dispensaries I mean you know what's good what's going on is shameful in 2011 with the internet with the access to information that we have that the government conducts its business this way is absolutely completely shameful right but people some people are still doing okay some people are still getting through I'm one of those people I'm yeah I'm doing all right I made some opportunities myself I've been working my ass off since I was 12 years old I mean I think it's possible but I again I don't I'm not saying there isn't a middle class there clearly still is but it is shrinking exponentially yeah ba Bay just offloaded a bunch of fucking bad assets to to to a branch of their on that's FDIC FDIC insured here in the states that were European assets they did this thing that's not supposed to be legal once wiped over a bunch of stuff so if the euro fails if there's a financial crisis there the American taxpayers could end up bailing out the European banks by transferring their assets I mean it's so again I'm doing alright right now Bank of America - but who's that one guy donated a shitload of money to Bank of America like some singer or something like that just donated a shitload of money to bank of donate to bank in America not a singer there's some celebrity guys here I'll find out hmm yeah find out I've never heard of anybody don't any no to a bank that's so easy with all the connectivity that we have in this day and age just as you're saying it's crazy that the government is run the way it is right when I go to that's what this protest is all yeah I think so weak but so you know this is this is a pipe dream but why not we do I pay my taxes online pay a lot of taxes online well and they trust it enough to be verified and it's my social security number and blah blah blah and there's the amount that I'm paying and the government takes it state and federal right if I can pay my taxes online we can do a system that does that why can't I pay my taxes and then apportion those taxes directly to the funds and the projects and the things that I want let me vote truly democratically with my dollars now if we have to set minimum levels you know for defense spending or you know well you're talking crazy now why because first of all this is a democracy but why not what a representative Republic right and that's what we are we're right we're represented by yeah the handful of people that directly you don't even get to know where your money goes they don't even have to give right so see how great would that be if I could decide where this is that by the way that you pay like what do you you're probably in like a thirty eight percent tax bracket or something right you're doing really well one year when I wasn't incorporated like now I'm a court michael worked for myself as a corporation right but the last year that I wasn't I paid forty three or forty seven percent come on come to tax Nadi is that think let's just round that bitch off to half you're paying half of your money happening you don't even get no a statement that says hey you helped fix a road you helped pay for cops you helped support firefighters you don't even get a fucking receipt they don't have to tell you shit nope Warren Buffett Warren Buffett donates a Bank of America he to help America he I think he bought a bunch of stocks he bought three hundred and fifty seven million in stock no investors five billion in Bank of America oh well that's not don't anybody know but he did it to to help them that's what his reason was I'm sure was purely uh he's also old as fuck and doesn't give a shit he's a weird cat that guy lives in like a regular house you know he's a super super super rich guy he lives in like middle America lives in a regular really yeah as not does not live extravagantly by any means and he has apparently donated a substantial portion of his riches to charities when he dies yeah good for him yeah he's an interesting cat that Warren Buffett I like that I've heard him vilified several times so it's nice to hear like I don't know it feels bad for all the creepy shit that he did get a hundred fucking billion dollars or whatever he's got stashed under his mattress he just worked hard Joe anybody can do it it's not impossible you talking about videos that disturbed you in that dead video of the the dogs getting killed yeah earlier there's something to disturb me way more and I couldn't even watch it I just heard about it it was a baby getting run over in China the baby got run over back and forth like a bunch of times and people stepped over the body of the baby this video of them stepping over and nobody did a goddamn thing about it was a two-year-old baby just wandering around run over by a truck the truck seized it ran over it Kent doesn't do anything about it gets back in the car runs over it again with its back over the back wheels yeah and then another person runs over I mean it's we as human beings man you know we have to look at what do we like at our worst what do we like it the most callous and unloving that's got to be an example that right up there with war you know that's we got to at least leave a note like sorry I hit your baby here's my license plate be insured you gotta at least do that cuz that's fucked up well I don't know whose fucking baby was just wandering around the streets first of all you know where you know there's no one that did anything about it they didn't even know the baby was run over there was no screaming there was no oh my god where's my baby just when when population density gets to a certain number and the value of life diminishes because it's just a just too many goddamn humans and literally not enough food for people so instead of someone being valuable you're actually a hindrance everybody's a hindrance right you're you're a resource drain I'm sorry but that's you know that's what you are at times and thankfully Siri is gonna figure out how to turn us all into battery and the matrix is gonna fucking happen guys and series gonna figure that shit out well if it's not that and maybe aliens you know one of the things I've always said about aliens you know people think I have several friends that are obsessed with aliens any Bravo being the biggest one who can loves UFOs loves the idea that there's they're out there man they're out they it's so exciting for him it's so sexy for him me I'm not so convinced I look it around at all the goddamn video footage that people have on their cell phones and and then I see the video footage of UFOs and I'm like this is horseshit these these are fake this right and they just smell to me they all stink nothing seems real there's not a single fucking video of anyone you know spotting a little gray man running around their backyard I just and that doesn't mean it's not real it doesn't mean that if they were here they couldn't avoid detection but I don't believe it and my other take on it is that if they did exist we probably wouldn't want them here because guess what they're not gonna just let us run things as usual and give us more information so you can blow each other up quicker right no they're gonna treat us the same way we treat dolphins and whales we don't give a fuck about them you know we we kill whales every day not we not you and I obviously but people in this in this world kill whales every day we take dolphins we Americans do and we lock them in fish tanks we take these amazing animals and we put them in a fucking swimming pool mhm and we don't give a shit about them you know we really don't we know a minimal scaped from a zoo it's like that's because you put it in a prison it escaped it went home you know asshole got free of your fuck didn't escape you know you lock this guy up for nothing but why why would we think that anything more intelligent than us would treat us any differently than we treat the most intelligent things that were aware of chimpanzees and dolphins are the most intelligent orcas the most intelligent things that we're aware of we just locked them up we don't give a fuck man we put we experiment on them you know we put them in cages we teach them how to do tricks for our amusement you know why the fuck would we think that aliens would do anything different we steal their babies man chimpanzees dolphins orcas we steal their fucking babies what if we are a zoo for the aliens we very well could be men you know very well whatever they are just walking around right now invisible men can you believe it Oh in that shit right oh my god well let's let's make this guy do that and see what happens oh my god well if you think about you know what we're capable of right now you never go to the Wild Animal Park in San Diego yeah it's fucking amazing a huge huge place you drive around there I mean these animals have habit did you ever feed the giraffes I actually never went there but that's where cliffy B is getting married oh is he really yeah like on a giraffe or I easy somehow it guys setup yeah he's gonna see he's a crafty dude that sounds like something yeah it's um it's an amazing setup they have a lot of room these animals at all it's not ideal do they have a lot of room so just extrapolate that take that to a hundred million years of evolution or whatever the fuck you know who knows how long you know life can exist on certain planets and they could be so fucking sophisticated they could have like not just created a planet but you know but engineered our whole environment right well they see what happens it's truly sim earth yeah the same way we do it with ants and video games are now people in the sims like what if they just now let's see what let's see how this one turns out you imagine if the whole idea of asteroid impacts and you know a mass extinction events was actually a programmed cycle and that we're just not aware of it we we just are still assuming that there's sort of a random nature to all these rocks out there colliding but really they just happen every certain amount of millions of years just some sort of a global reset it just keeps going on getting defragged yeah until your until your civilization becomes so intelligent that it can spot it and prevent it you know that's the mad race I'd like to test yeah the mad race is to get off the planet some sort of an artificial environment that you control be it a large spaceship or a giant artificial planet and to avoid all the cosmic impacts solar flares you know all the really big shit that happens supernovas you know like wouldn't when hyper Nova's happen you know everything anywhere near in the galaxy just gets cooked instantly and that shit can happen to us why I hate that I wasn't fucking alive for the space race I'm serious really yeah you mean the notion of it and it might be Messala that I've absorbed not as much it's more about who can fire lasers from satellites now it's not about like let's explore and I know that was the bill of goods that we were sold I'm sure it had a lot to do with the fence testing and everything else but you know if all the money that we did and you know this is this is just me wishing we could vote with our tax dollars again but like if a fraction of the money we've spent blowing shit up in some other fucking country was spent to just solving something like a problem for Humanity here oh no he considers again me to be yeah you know positively revered and we could fucking help the world yeah well not even just dad I mean just I'm gonna sing that no curiosity of people curiosity of expression of you know just traveling the fucking universe and finding out what what it is like on Mars you know how if you have humans set up some sort of a civilization on Mars where they you know they what is that called where they you take total recall no way you take a an environment and you you sort of engineer it to a geo geo forming leaders like geo forming yeah well you you you we need more ozone or I let's do that we need some more you let's ship that in heaven form on this love and environment you know that they said that you could do this that you could take machines and you could build them on Mars massive massive machines like literally the size of cities like it would be like a Manhattan size machine and that machine would just be pumping oxygen into the environment and that somehow or another with it's called the reactor and Quaid starts it with his alien hand did you not see Total Recall did see that was that what it was until I saw the reactor and we which is the reactor and the rods go in and the fucking oxygen on the planet oh that's Arnold's head from freaking out when he's on the side of the mountain that's that some stupid movies are actually based on real scientific ideas good thing I would get an implant in the third one no one's ever done it you know what girls have three nipples I've never heard of a girl really having three nipple oh you've never seen one yeah I know I know guys and girls that have three nipples really yeah it's creepy cuz it's just like the nipple part is not the areola oh wow so it's just like it like this weird nipple I guess out of all freakshow genetic mishaps you can have that ain't that bad you never have an extra got an extra nipple who's gonna complain yeah extra testicle wouldn't be that bad either yeah maybe what if your loads are just overwhelming there's a some guys want that yeah maybe it was too much I saw a product at GNB called max load next to the checkout counter and CNC on the counter I took a photo of it made me laugh so hard I tweeted it and it said come harder come longer come like better that was like three hits and there's like you know fucking max Lowe through it see on the on the counter the checkout counter like where a take a penny leave a penny should be it was like dudes come harder that's that was on the counter at the GNX amazing what a crazy world and it fucking did not work that is in did not work didn't work at all I fuckin came Pixy dust for like a week girl who's just glitter and wish it it tastes different no no citrusy do you think that's the Internet that's got people so desensitized there's letters porn now where they're using fake dicks and pumping gallons of fake semen out of them I've seen to splash all over people in there and they're doing like drive-by cum shots and I'm splattering girls that are just walking down the sidewalk oh yeah that'd be hilarious if that's how the gang settled their warfare with tripe I come shots that's actually pretty funny brilliant well what are they gonna do when CGI gets to a point where everybody can afford it including you know porn companies right and they've owned it real time have like you know Japanese what is that called that that Han Han tae ik yeah weird of tentacles look when you'll have real of that but in a realistic human form they're so close dude they're so cool oh yeah woman I'll just get I think it's gonna be procedurally generated you're gonna be able to go to a website and through series and knobs select exactly the kind of woman you want fucking slider her tits choose her height the hair color select the scenes and positions and hit play and that shit is gonna Auto generate and it's going to destroy humanity what will happen first holograms or virtual reality that's super realistic well it depends on your definition of super realistic for me like virtual reality isn't true virtual reality unless the shit is being into my brain it being in like beamed into it or electrified into I don't care if it's through a helmet or a glove but until my brain is being tricked to imagined ones and zeros I'm not gonna call VR VR do you think it's impossible to do that without some sort of an electronic aid or do you think that they'll be able to figure out I thought at one point in time I don't know about the science behind this because this is all just out of my imagination but that there may be a frequency that they can tune into that the human mind can tune into for whatever reason right they may be a little fine a frequency that you could tune into where when you put yourself in a relaxed state it can generate thoughts you know what I think I just had a bizarre thought about that I was like now what they'll do is I'll engineer because I need the transhumanism thing they'll enter like they'll create a chip first that allows you to perceive that but you'll still need power generate it but then we'll get so good with like fucking manipulating molecules and DNA will create the cell that will be put into something virus style that gives people perception to that so imagine like a chip for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi we're gonna engineer that on a on a biochemical level so that you can now perceive this thing so you and I can communicate telepathically this device can beam the images in to me Wow why not right yeah like but but like yeah but a viral fuckin you know or yeah shed but which it kind of sucks their time bluetooth the 7.0 if they're talking about genetic engineering and they're always talking about the possibility of nanobots going in cure cancer right yeah what about the idea of artificial cells I mean they've what was it that they just discovered recently they created something that reproduced itself in a lab for the first time yeah what was it I saw something like that I forget what it was is some some structure some small structure and atom or whatever it was and reproduce itself what if they couldn't create artificial cells they in inject this artificial cell into you and slowly but surely over the course of you know however long long it takes to regenerate and read all of your tissue you become like a superhuman mm-hmm absolutely and I think outside the realm of possibility and no no and what concerns me is the potential we think we're having class war now class warfare now imagine the haves and have-nots in that day and age when it's like it's pure Gattaca shit of like well hey I was born with it because I got upgraded right and you know I can perceive this shit that you can't and manipulate and manipulate you with my mind so sorry you're just a thing we're gonna enslave ourselves before the aliens do I don't see any escape from the technological singularity do you do you see any I mean I don't see any escape from art I worry veg and I worry that stunted minds will not allow us to evolve to that point I don't think to get to that point I don't think those stunted Minds have a fucking chance I think it'll be on them before they even know what hit them I think no one is stopping the the onset of artificial intelligence no one is putting the brakes to it everybody's worrying about weapons everybody's worrying about these threats from terrorists and all these different things what about a sentient super intelligent computer that can do things I think we're so on the path so we're absolutely path to it but we don't know you know it may look at us and just go your molecules I could use you more efficiently Thanks exactly don't know if it's gonna be that way we don't know if ever gets at first whether it's the US or the Chinese they're gonna put a hook in it that allows them to use it for whatever they want I think you know we don't really know like the AI might become the next nuclear weapon before it becomes sentient enough to stop ourselves from blowing the shit out of each other is possible but I don't think that's gonna happen I think once something becomes sentient we're done I don't think we have any more say in anything and I think the idea of controlling it once it has the ability to rationalize and realize how silly we are no I agree with that species I agree that if I think it's to that form it's gonna happen but there is there is a sliding scale of fully sentient AI and where we're at now mm-hmm and I'm worried that right here when we're almost there right here it's gonna be just powerful enough and someone's gonna have it and use it too yeah that is them that's what stereo right yeah that's the the story that they tell after the apocalypse that's after it's all over you know how close who were door and the scientists it around discuss how close we were to changing the world and now they realize that their old man and there's no medicine around anymore you barely can find gasoline and we could have hang about and a few greedy men who still live on with that a I still have it and then 10,000 the one that people find all these different ruins in America what America is covered with ice and then the ice withdraws again you know just like it's happened before right absolutely fuck and maybe they'll find a thumbdrive frozen and ice and maybe one day figure out how to you know unencrypted it but I doubt it I doubt it but he did find things they do find some old fucking shit they can't they can't account for you know the idea of glaciers still the real problem with glaciers we had graham hancock in here I don't know if you listen to that one who's a fascinating a dude who item out chicks that looks skinny from the waist up all those are icebergs sorry wagers sakes look skinny for the waist up right call nice Berg's because above the surface they look alright but down below oh that's hilarious oh I'm sorry glaciers glaciers glaciers move on land and essentially grind everything underneath them down to nothing yeah because they move you know several feet a year or whatever they do but they're essentially a mile-high sheet of ice that's slowly moving its way across the ground and out of my way bro there any buildings anything done giant boulders moved miles slow-mo tsunami yeah it's like a slow-mo frozen tsunami just like later yeah have you ever been to the Great Lakes no that's how powerful the imagery is you have to go the Great Lakes are something to really wrap your head around I mean that the oceans really made me think obviously you know everybody looks the ocean goes wow it's so big that's amazing but until you see a freshwater ocean and you go that used to be ice and it melted it used to be a giant sheet of ice and that's why it's here I mean the great lakes are magnificent they're amazing man there's so fucking I was big just near them too for a wedding I'm kind of pissed I didn't get out oh you got it I had to see a Cracker Barrel so another way to see that shit weave like a frame they're racists it's amazing what in the Cracker Barrel when you go inside it's just photos of old slave owners just framed around watching you eat breakfast yeah really I like the gift shop it's like old licorice whips and like old school pretty mannish games did you see that shit speaking on the Midwest that all the animals have you seen all the photos and yeah yeah I put that on my Twitter if we were talking about there was a guy in Ohio who was running a wild animal preserve shot himself and released all the animals I didn't know that was the analyst he committed suicide he let all the animals go and then he committed suicide which is kind of interesting I wonder why the dude didn't leave a note like I can't imprison these guys anymore I don't know I wonder why I didn't just let one of the Tigers Jack them you gotta kill yourself why not just kill yourself by Tiger that'd be wild well now you have the option you're around these wild animals every day you know it'd be quick it wouldn't take long at all just just just jump in there Nate and go what bitch what yeah there's something weird about the whole story though cuz like the sheriff knew him very well I guess he has to go he had to go up there all the time like there was shit going on all the time with this guy if you look at his a house on Google Maps it's actually listed as a Harley like motorcycle shop so he had a farm zip like an illegal Preserve he was running out the back like I don't think it was no I don't think it was a go I but so it's weird like I want to know the whole story like what this guy was going on this guy and now Jack Hanna that Columbus Zoo I is overlooking this whole thing but I was surprised that they they couldn't you know I I know they had to shoot a lot of them but this seems like there's someone they could have tried you know to tranquilize or something like the police force didn't have a chance man you know what was going on yeah but the zoo's the zoo honestly is like 30 miles away from where this happened yeah but do you understand do they have the resources to get out there like the animals were out and there's people living there and there's 40 fucking 50 animals and tigers and bears right yeah this is this mountain lion coach's poodle on Runyon Canyon yes if you go to my Twitter today while we're recording this a lot of people get this online but today is October 19 so if you go to my Twitter on October 19th i retweeted somebody about this the guy's name is Kenny Roy or three I like a winner too he might be have you seen his face his face or their own and I used to it's okay anyway I went to what did he write did not know he just eat he tweeted times i retweeted but there's a photo if you go to cleave scene calm I guess that's a Cleveland website Cleve scene calm it's very graphic there's an image of all of these animals just laid out murdered tigers and bears a bunch of them lions panthers were they all like in a Gabe yeah they're all in a pile here they don't they've they hunted them down Siddhant the cops hunted them down yeah come on over the cops hunted them down and just shot them all you know you got to think of what the cops are dealing with the cops are dealing with 50 fucking killers fifty wild killers that are aggressive and they were wandering the streets you know I mean they got to do what they got to do it sucks at these animals how to die but you know what even it sucks these animals were a fucking cage and some assholes backyard Oh is how was one guy how was one guy able to release all those animals like was there nobody else on this was his gig it was just a lot and there's I guess response talk to my sister who lives very close to this and I said you know what are they saying to you guys they're like well they're saying that they're shooting all the animals because they all have herpes and stuff it's what they're saying on the news is that the animals are all infected with something you have to worry about the tiger or you don't know the way I think I'm like I have a chance to fuck a lion later bro I'm fucking YouTube in this get some lion herpes looks like a cactus the dick just grows these cactus things off the side of it yeah I think your sister's crazy no no well they might have been saying back to they might have been saying that to people too so they didn't feel like oh you're killing the tiger I know they treat people like they're idiots in Ohio but they don't treat him much of that stupid yes as a musk immune County Sheriff says monkey with herpes virus still missing huh oh that's gonna haven't got ya oh you know what they probably don't want to be a pet hell yeah maybe that monkey knows things maybe you get that monkey and that monkeys one of those fucking plant of the Apes month right starts talking to you know they know that they're some alien coming they know that there's an asteroid you can't stop it there's gonna land right before the asteroid monkey talking did you did you watch the Planet of the Apes remake did you guys see that yeah we talked about a couple times I liked it I liked it special effects it's badass it's fascinating you know when you talk about manipulating genetics you know it's not outside the realm of possibility that they've already done something like that they've already created some sort of a chimpanzee human being hybrid well dude when they tell you this shit that they tell you they have done already you know that there's a clone baby being monitored right now somewhere out there and they're seen exactly how that worked and genetically eared genetically engineered kids out there yeah running tests on them right now like that's absolutely happening I've always said that by the time they tell you that they've they're capable of making a clone the guy telling you is probably a clone right it's been that there are clones and I'm the proof here you go I wonder how much how far ahead they really are would really love to know you know every now and then I hear like whispers of things of Technology of like military technology that's so far and above you know the the realm of what we currently think it's possible well we always hear like they have a satellites that can zoom in on a hot dog on your grill and they had those in 1983 man right I don't I'm they probably do I've never seen any images from space that I that were really really clear like that like they could read a license but I've never seen that well there was a point in time where they had Google imagery quality map and you weren't able to see that no we can see that and then we can see 3d versions of it and street views and all that other shit if we have access to that data you know they've got better access than that they have to they've got to have real-time video something yeah there must be some and I don't look I have a tinfoil hat that says I bet they have it but not it well um when I was hanging out with my friend Mike Swick my friend Mike's works UFC fighter he used to live in Russia and he was doing a defense contractor work over there and they had an American building and they would find bugs the the Russians had installed in their buildings and he said they were so sophisticated it was so far above anything they'd ever seen before they had monitoring devices that were powered by the movement of the building you know little vibrations it's like no no you know I'm building sway there's a subtle swaying back and forth that was powering these listening devices they were that sophistic that's like those shake to charge iPod holders like but they have it on that level that they can get the sway of a building and a device low powerful enough and mesh networked enough yeah to spread those ideas and that's how they were listening in on shit they china was just involved in a huge scandal for that for it was a China or Korea that's bad that I don't know the difference are you know it's I know the difference of the places I don't know the source of the article they were a shit storm up and they had a yeah bring it they already kicked my ass and Starcraft oh wait which ones are those those are Korean thank you they had little bugs in cars and they thought they were like listen this is just tracking how often you drive for discounts or for you know carpool riders and help you get through the it's like a Fast Pass Lane kind of thing right this will just help you get through the Tollbooth it had audio recording and and and some set video recording built into the tiniest little bug that was sitting on there - that they can monitor everybody dude eventually someone's gonna hack Apple and they're gonna get into your fucking webcam your cloud and they're gonna get in your cloud a million people beating off videos of people sitting in front of the computers your computer has a monitor on it your computer has a camera on it and you're connected to the Internet you're just assuming that nobody's watching you beat off like a lab rat right the Xbox know all the Xbox cameras and all the lot you get the laptop lenses but the thing I'm worried about is the photo stream and like you said earlier off a camera that we you turned off your photo stream which is a new thing on the new iPhones and stuff like that it's the cloud so every time you take a photo it sends it to your home computer since it's your iPad sends it to whatever and you can't delete the photos which is really annoying but uh but delete them from your phone your photos from the filmic photo stream yeah you can't I didn't know that yeah it's like once it's in the photo stream you can't delete it I don't know if there's if there's a way to do it but like you try it on your phone or anything there's no way to delete your home I'm sure on your main computer be on your main think about that time you you you do snap a photo out at a party or something like that right and it's oh shit it's already my photo stream I can get to my laptop mrs. Pereira opens of your life damn it Kevin or Bobby who's in his car sniping your Wi-Fi or whatever it now has all your photos no is that easy it well so I mean lights your Wi-Fi they can't get your photos oh yeah oh yeah there are applications you can i've run one at the at the airport in vegas and you run it up on your map and you connect like the public Wi-Fi and as people browse Facebook and as gifs and JPEGs blop in yeah it automatically reassembles them on the monitor for you so you can sit in the lobby of a small airport and just look around and see what everybody's looking or PC its this was a mac program I think it was it wasn't kismet there was a video so does everyone else have to be on a Mac or can there be a now if they're just connected to Wi-Fi and browsing certain services and certain packets are coming in you can do that it was PC or Mac no matter what it is yeah so this is why it's your Wi-Fi so it's that's incredible so what you're telling me is you're a criminal you were committing a crime no because these photos are in the shared folder right is that what you're saying because these photos were being downloaded and uploaded potentially on a public unsecured well you had to log in but a public you know secured Wi-Fi spot right right or sending it could be some dirty hooker who's got one them facebook pages yeah yeah their friend to look at yeah absolutely could have been showing some today absolutely but you could have got that city for free I haven't seen I have this video called a kitty fart cup and anytime I'm went on the road with Joe we're sitting at the airport I look at you know people with shared folders and stuff and I'll just drag this video into I've done it like a million times I do that every copy on every member connieyc seed into public folders at the hotel because what you're connected never connect to hotel systems and never connect to a hotel that's like laying on the on the matter naked and they do not do that you're asking for people to fuck with you yeah and the crazy thing is you could actually sit there and fuck people over by like putting child porn on people's computers and then if that person gets arrested oh you have child porn on your computer's they caught a guy doing that they caught a next-door neighbor who had been terrifying these people for fucking years doing exactly that and they all right that's right he turned them in and this guy's he was a their next-door neighbor's terrorizing the whole fucking family you know there's a child pornography checksum database so check sums are what you use like like a files ID it's it's it's it's thumbprint so if you download a file you want to make sure you got it exactly as though as it should be it's a way of verifying the file to make sure no bits were altered or harmed in the transmission they have a database of every child pornography and and illegal pornography video this is sorted by title with check sums so that way if the police are scanning Wi-Fi or get somebody's files from the internet they can match the checksum of the file on their hard drive to one that's already in the database and see if it's in there so they don't have to watch the video but they've got that database already so it's impossible for a another video this they don't have the same amount of bytes like what if it's the exact same amount of seconds and the same reason well it's the kind it's also based off the content of the file as well you know so it's not just a link thing so it's not just a size it's there's a thousand attributes that go into it you know what how are they reading that just they're analyzing each and every individual file I think and this this is this is pure conjecture actually so I shouldn't be saying it but I would imagine if you're doing a checksum it could it could just know that every hundred bytes here's a character string here so there's a check for it there every X bytes this is the character like this is the hex put it there I think it's way more elegant than that because I can already poke holes in that but well think about how there is a way to do think about how crazy Shazam is think about that thing that that program where you go to a club and there's a song of playing and you like the song so I press Shazam it sends a signal and 10 seconds later tells you what that fukk analyzed the file here it is and I'm not exaggerating if you never use your Sam it's fucking incredible it's ten seconds later think of that it's basically the same thing but now for TV as well they have that for video they're gonna have that for all that shit like the image and app recognition image engine have you guys talked about Siri becoming Skynet no we haven't I took someone's do you want to hop into that so yes please because someone actually sent me something we had talked about on the show do real real quick dude sorry just so I don't get raped on Twitter I believe you analyze the file locally and it spits out a checksum so it is checking every bit of the file and then you check that against the public checksum oh just so I don't get I don't want to deal with those tweets Dino hey I can't do my soul it's not in my soul anymore man I'm just trying to help you know so with that said I'm sorry okay so someone wrote that I said that Syria was based on Wolfram Alpha but it's not exactly true integral operates Wolfram Alpha it's integrated but this is where it gets crazy it's based on callo the cognitive assistant that learns and organizes from a company called SR I international I know is artificial intelligence augmentation software developed for DARPA right Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that's like those are the motherfuckers that really are Skynet so if this is the version we have now what's stopping them from tapping a phone line grabbing a voice chat taking the audio from this podcast and analyzing in real time just like Shazam and pulling out those key words in those context cues this is fast cuz we have the dumbed down version right now they've got the hot dog on the grill satellite version of it code 5 version yeah why is it so crazy to think that right yeah and this is this guy also wrote something about how Facebook was funded by Ti a Total Information Awareness Facebook is starting around a super PAC to lobby the government on privacy and information controls and what we should have rights to because they want to own the rights to your usage data your social graph your preferences they want to own that data they want essentially want to own your imprint online right they want to own your browsing habits where you shop they want to know what music you like they want to know what friends you connect with where you go who share my Swift I'm already my spacing Facebook lately you know but I just I'm saying that but you're not your f you're a kind of alone in that right now it's growing right it's growing more and more grating more and more twitter has kind of overtaken Facebook for the most part I know when I talk to you know I just tweet now yeah I know a lot of people to share to Facebook anymore will do the interesting they can follow that together from between it's more real time you know you're responding to people back and forth it's very in a very similar way to text messaging you know and a lot I mean it's it's it's essentially for a lot of what I use it for I mean I throw things out there interesting links I retweet things things I observed my photos I take but I also go back and forth of people I'll shoot the shit with people and it's people I would do you know ordinarily never really get a chance to run into her meet like my ex-girlfriend oh yeah well she got two ridiculously yes it is facilitating a real-time conversation so that I said something to her no oh you won't you prefer no one to communicate with her no no whatever okay so here's my always brought you brought this up so I have to said this this is what I said she she's by the way is Penthouse Pet of the year okay did she write the one she's talking another porno star and the other porno star says I feel a bad cold coming on who wants to make out and she says I'll make out with your butt so I on Twitter say wow just wow that's the extent of my communication with her why you're trying to fuck his ex-girl says what are you wooing I ignore it I just have to say Wow if you run around tweeting to the whole world that you want to make out with a cold carrying porn stars but I got a while Yeah right here's my question for city trying to block her Joe do you think that that that there is somebody inside do you think there is anybody at Siri that is like continuing to add to the database do you think they're looking at the top 10 things that okay or something going why does Siri need to connect to the cloud for anything that I do even though it's a local operation right read my text messages those are out any month on my device if I say play Joe Rogan's podcast it has to send it to the cloud first and they'll say it's for voice recognition you know it's faster in the cloud doesn't your phone but it's the program itself the database has to be huge for Siri whatever local things it could store that it could totally do that and maybe they will in the future but I think the reason they're there making everything go to the net is for the usage data yeah because then they can see what keywords are happening they can search as people are doing absolutely they can make it better but with with great power comes great responsibility and what's crazy is that I had a friend that got mad at another friend for cursing at his Syria to be like fuck you Syria you're a you're a bitch and he took the phone away he's like dude don't do that I don't want that been my profile and he was concerned about acting a certain way to an pretty dumb or intelligent the murder thing I've thought about the more I feel nothing when you ask Syria question that's being stored somewhere that request is indefinitely stored in some log right now so if you ever are the presumed baby or you murder somebody or someone suspects you of a murder they can now try it out on the stand you asked your your cell phone where to hide a body weight I wonder if they have that is it I want to know is this Apple say anywhere in those terms in agreement that they're holding on to the data of what we're saying in Siri is that one of the things I'm sure I'm sure it says that it's for a usage data which what does that mean I wonder that is kind of that they have to send it out to the cloud yeah now there's there's infrastructure reasons to do that there's also terrible usability reasons to not do that being that if you have eighty half the time Siri doesn't work because you don't have a strong enough signal to get out there you what it's faster what it's we're faster when it's available so I'm on AT&T but it's still a shitty Network there's no like bones about that yeah but I couldn't do 18 t he told me that I got a new iPhone and he told me that 18 t where'd you go change their system so that they can get double the speed of downloads and it's not double its obviously it could be it's like it's 3.5 G well I it's faster yes yeah whatever the LCG is gonna blow that away the next time yeah but I don't have that in my current one but I do have Verizon and I just was unable to pass yeah why is just too good why is the double is actually I had my girlfriend's new phone 4s in the I form both on AT&T did both at the same time those before S was double where I was at that's great which was my that's in a really good area I mean I don't get those speeds anywhere myself I'm sure calls in the in the the canyons yeah but um I think you look at how like think about Siri as that API opens up because right now I could say show me a good steak restaurant and it'll do that it'll pop that up you know then I can say call that steak restaurant but once open table supports it I can say hey Siri right put me reservation for four at six at that restaurant and it's just gonna connect to the database do it there we go invite my friends invite Joe you know the texting alone I think is the best when you're just driving the button yeah it was but Google has had that for a while it doesn't work this good does this work cited this works almost perfect I probably fuck up more just doing it by hand it's weird speaking into it cuz you still got to kind of talk to it like a robot you can't be totally fluent with it and for like grammatical things like I'm still a stickler with grammar even in texts so I'll be like hey Joe comma I'm gonna be a little late period hope that's okay period does it right period in comma it actually drops the peelings yeah have you ever tried writing like that with like you know I know they have the software like a dragon speed naturally yeah yeah yeah yeah I've tried that before but I write in a different at a different pace with a different Cadis they're not cadence then I speak hmm so for me it was really disjointed like I would say something and then be wanting to change that I edit as I write yes really really a terrible way to write but doing that verbally was even harder no I dream has already passed the sentence and as I got shit I agree with you as a matter of fact I I liked the idea of it and what I had thought about doing was writing at the same time as running the program in the background so the program would pick up some of the words and some of the things that I would say so just in case I could remember what the fuck I'd said while I was writing writings but I I agree with you there's a there's an intention to actually physically typing out the each individual letter there's when the way I describe it is if you write the word occupy it takes longer to write the per talk the word occupy than to know it or or to know what you're saying I know what you're thinking so it forces you to think about things just a little bit longer and it in creatively it to me at least it opens up different avenues for possibilities or potentials like the way I always get my biggest like us is what I'm writing because like I mean I get them in an ad libbing on stage and stuff sure but in actually sitting down and writing about something that's when you know just paths disappear you know roads just show themselves you know and I don't think you'd see I get crippling anxiety I love to do it and it's it's so releasing but when I do it I just see I see those roads highways that have sheer cliffs in them and I'm just fuck gotta come out you got a that's not good writing is it what do you do what do you do you listen to music when you're right I try to listen to language they don't understand I like resilient or Puerto Rican music I like I can't read music with lyrics even if I don't understand them I can put it in the background a little bit as long as I don't understand or sometimes if I'm really high especially on edibles I'll pick one song and just throw that bitch on reboot right now listen to the same song a hundred times in a row oh yeah oh yeah oh so I wrote some of my best shit on a plane blasted listening the same song over and over and over again have you heard the song Pumped Up Kicks I know you probably yeah yeah they have you know what that songs about you talked about that I didn't know we talked yeah we talked about I think we talked about it off yeah I think we talked in the green room or something like okay but yeah well that's exactly how the lyrics are all about Columbine and it's like that was one like a song I might maybe listen to that ten times love this song and then Johnny Rotten told me he's like hey you know that's all about Colin - and now it's even more crazy and I I love red lyrics I mean it's scary it's freaky yes absolutely but it's also crazy that people are just dancing around to it like exactly - without thinking about them into the Octagon with that oh really into these plane when he came into the Octagon yeah yeah interesting choice run baby run out I there's I'll listen to there's like a spectrum of there's like a frequency spectrum that's supposed to induce that kind of zoning out and I started writing with that lately it's pretty crazy what into it all the time have you searched it's like there's meditation videos and it's like nine hundred and something hurts sine waves that kind of loop but people have done made them like pretty sounding not just an annoying thing it's just filter sweeps there was certain band past that triggers that sort of white noise effect so what is un de like meditative noise if you have headphones on it's like buying your role it really it's kind of cool so it's supposed to enhance creativity no it's just well if I think you like songs with properties sometimes that you just zone out on right it's on a loop you let it go or sometimes I like to be inspired to them and I like you know well yeah that's why it's not for every writing moment but sometimes it's great to put on something that that that does kind of zone you out so you're only in that process that helps me because audible distractions knock me out like crazy sometimes yes sometimes no it really depends on where I'm at with writing what I'm writing about you know I I there sometimes I need to be completely quiet completely by myself what I mean I'm a obviously I'm a huge proponent of the isolation tank and I come over my best ideas we still have another that did it sober for an hour and that wasn't enough that's crazy I can't believe I'm talking to you you know that's one of the weird things that people talk about online all the time that listen to this podcast is how many of my friends are all fucking psychedelic freaks they're they're they're tripperz and they've never tried the tank yeah dude the tank is and I did it right by one you you're crazy you need to get in there dude you're just scared I'm not scared I just don't have money to spend on I'll set it up I'll set it up I promise you I'll set up we'll set it up this week I'll hook it up I'll do it with you if you're gonna do it all do it we'll share one double day bro we're gonna you need to get in there man anybody who's analyzing any part of their mind their thoughts it's the most amazing tool ever I started to feel it probably I mean what I imagined was forty five fifty five minutes into it even while sober like I really was like okay just let that shit go you know lose track and control of where your fingertips and the water begins just shut all that shit out and I started to get there and I swear the moment I was getting their brand hatch open like our sessions done I was like oh fuck yeah I caught the bug but I gotta get back in it's just like you know we're talking him in the kitchen before the show he was asking me about dreaming and you know what different nootropics that create or enhance the possibility of lucid dreaming right and the thing about the lucid dream is that it's really slippery because once you realize you're dreaming you kind of wake up real quick and that's the thing about the tank it's like these states that you can achieve I've achieved some really bizarre states the most bizarre one I've talked about this before but it's so fascinating I have to bring it up and I'd never do it justice I was in a jungle and I was with this indigenous population I don't know what their language was but I understood they were making a bunch of strange noises and sounds and I was I was thinking you in there like yourself were you physically made a specimen I was moving I couldn't see myself it wasn't a third person shooter yeah it was very first person I was walking around I remember feeling the dirt under my feet feeling the leaves and these people were talking and I was talking with them or no I wasn't talking with them I was understanding what they were saying right and as I was understanding what they were saying I was realizing what the fuck I understand this but I was saying that to myself in English and then I was like what is this and then I was like oh this is a dream boom and then it was over but what the moment was happening it was so amazing because it only lasted a couple minutes it was really brief but in that couple minutes it was so crazy the idea your your your whatever it is whether it's imagination whether it's genetic memory I mean you know who the fuck knows what is stored in in cells as they transfer from generation to generation generation there may very well be some wacky fuck and file deep in your hard drive and you just get in an isolation tank on a pot brownie and it just pops open this one little cartridge that you weren't supposed to access let's answer that portion of your mental harddrive and just beam that experience and you're some little monkey person from 500,000 years ago walking through a rain forest speaking in some dead language before the cosmic reset yeah that was one of those those lives that was one of those checkpoints dude there you go it was it was one of the weirdest things and the other the other weirder one is the other weird one that I've had hundreds of thousands of these so I dice dick salt like it was it a wire like you're just surrounded by dicks he'll like they have a dick inside of them that comes out through the tiny nation of penises the the number one thing is that you can never quite get deep enough like you get you get there's a bunch of videos of me talking about this online but there's one of them that some guy made on YouTube thank you everybody whoever does those fucking videos and all you people do there's a bunch of people do them and take little clips on the podcast your community does a phenomenal job of it's crazy signing your view and and everything you say and they do it really great job they're amazing it's a it's super fortunate you know when I say that to when I go to comedy clubs to you know the people of comedy clubs always say the same thing like you have the nicest fans the nicest the most generous and I don't know how that happened thank you very much I don't know I don't know what it is I don't you know I guess you put it out there and you know you hope that people see it the way you see it but um or I think they respect if you don't see it the way they see it and I think they see that in you as well like you're very respectful even if someone disagrees with like you're able to have that conversation when a large cross-section of society isn't well I certainly provides inspiring to see that your fans carry that with them and comment like I always have a good time chatting with your fans always really that's awesome always yeah I mean there's gonna be always cunts what you do yes there's gonna be certain amount of people you know I wrote about this yesterday I was responding to a bunch of people who are being insulting I was like man you know we gotta learn how to communicate with someone as if they were right there you know and so many people don't do that and the built-in and an M&E that the the Internet has has people have like added it to like their their their rights you know it's almost like you're allowed to be a cunt because you're anonymous it's like right there's a certain amount of disrespect that people were allowed to like shine on people it's like man this is not necessary you know like like there was a conversation that Duncan and I were having and that some people loved and some people just did not love and there was some of the discussion about it was like it was so bizarre how some people just have no problem just being completely fucking rude when they know that you're gonna read it you know and they're talking about in a way that's just not even remotely considering how a person's gonna receive it it's it's the the whole age thing - I bet a lot of these people are like 13 and 4 you're right yeah but there's no way we can stop that yeah you know I mean unless we figure out some way to register I mean we know that Rick was posting on my message when he was 13 years old that's ridiculous you know yeah see one of the good ones yeah he's great yeah he's he's gonna be our science advisor when he graduates from school I think I'm gonna hook him up with as well and he'll be our science I was I was so many times we talk about shit we don't know what the fuck we're talking about and he's pulling his hair out in Houston yeah so we're gonna have to hire nice I was I was shocked at the anger and vitriol that even my fans had initially when I started talking about like occupy and started talking about other things real and I was a little I was a little shattered and it made me question should I even be talking about this should I be taking a stance and then I was like now absolutely I should because I want to be and immediately when I started engaging in the conversations with the guys that were all-caps hatred no matter what it was like pretty much 99% of them either turned around and saw at least recognize it was another point of view or tone down the rhetoric right it was like hey look you know I disagree but I appreciate that you're doing what you're doing and people just want to get your fucking attention well clearly any other way and it ran clearly clearly but but this is the kind of thing though where you know you never know so you have to engage you have to engage if people are like well this is wrong and this is factually incorrect it's like well no here's the story read it have you seen it you have to engage because for every troll there is one person who that doesn't look up the information well no max has do you upset about shit even if that shit has nothing and doing it like I can't tell you any fucking people were upset at this alpha brain shit but I'm selling these nootropics there's these vitamins what I do but just going crazy on Twitter about it's a placebo you're ripping people ossified and this is what I said I said very clearly and I repeat this at every fucking step of the way the proprietary blend that we have in that alpha brain is available online if you're interested and you are on a budget please go to a vitamin store or order the individual component get live access get it at a discounted rate you could probably save like 50 percent or something I don't know if you buy cheap to see the big big thing is that gobber is using all the good shit so in the pills like that the good shit is the best stuff that we can sell what is the best stuff that's available I think I've noticed lately a woman one point though I don't really I ain't my number-one concern when I talk about anything that I like anything that's benefit in my life and know this this is a true statement I there's no exaggeration there's no hyperbole whatsoever right if I'm telling you about it I want you to do it because I think it'll benefit you that's it I'm not trying to sell shit I'm not trying to so I have a fucking t-shirt line that I never bring up it's called higher primate doctor blue clothing higher - primate calm if I could never bring it up I wear the t-shirts every now and then I want people to bond with you like I'm I see people with them at shit shows I think it's cool as fuck I'm not trying to make a ton of money on and I just if you like him I like him I thought it'd be cool to have some funky t-shirts of monkeys and psychedelics right nobody had them so I decided to make my own company it's that simple I'm not I make plenty of money doing stand-up and from the UFC I would never get behind anything that I didn't but it surprises me though you have to explain that my god your viewers because I just have to explain it getting fucking furious arguments with people by the ounce of these things well you you can't give them enough scientific information there well those what follows are words patience business you telling them is something that benefits Alzheimer's patient can't possibly benefit people so it has an effect on their mind but it won't have an effect on a healthy mind it's a fucking placebo some guy said you know what's better than that sleep and exercise yeah but guess what fuckface you can have sleep and exercise and my dad's yeah and vitamins don't tell me that vitamins don't work cuz they do work vitamins are actually I have vitiligo it's a skin condition where I lose pigment you can see it in like my not always a Jackson's eye loot yeah but I only have it a little couple spots and it stopped you know where it stopped vitamins I got heavily into vitamins when I first came to California I was under a tremendous amount of stress I had never been on TV before and I noticed like get like these white spots on my skin I was like what the fuck is this and they started spreading man I started going to doctors I was going to different vitiligo specialist and I would have to take these things called sorrel ins and there were pills that made me super sensitive to light and I'd have to get in like it's almost like a tanning booth but you only go in there for three minutes and it's they trying to tan the pigment oh that girl no no it's shocks the system where the the parts that are losing pigment it can bring them back to life and it works in a certain way i reaped it like my doctor melatonin and immolating come on sort of I don't know the exact science behind but I had areas that were lost pigment and brought them back but you know what stopped all of it completely stopped in its tracks vitamins right 100% why cuz you believed in those vitamins better let's see about people are assholes listen and vitamins talk and work a healthy diet works vitamins work even whoo but all of it works these and people who what about soy is chewing science where do you think they got the vitamins witchcraft you fuck are contracting vitamins from food and the way they're doing it is a scientific method they've done this they've applied scientific principles to extracting vitamins and they sell these fucking vitamins if you don't believe in alpha brain oh you don't believe in vitamins that's good for you but if you're fucking fighting people tooth and nail on something that they absolutely believe in you're just trying to fight man and I guarantee you most likely what it is with a lot of these people is they're not happy with their own life and they're probably smart but they're fucked up and what they're doing is they're focusing something whether it's online whether it's an argument whether it's trying to win a flame war or whatever and that becomes their distraction from their miserable existence their garbage pile up and fucking kitchen their bills you know their phone ringing off the hook it's a it's a kind of person who could use a little faith in a placebo right rather than being against it but us just if it works go with it but here's the sad part about the really sad part about some of these people are very fucking smart they're very interesting the the the the points that they make even though their nonsense points they're very eloquently stated they're argued very well is that there's a very professional tone to the way they're writing things like this is like a guy who you know obviously there's something wrong with this person they're really going after this is it he's just as passionate as the facts that he's collected to support his opinion oh no not these people and I'm talking about there was no facts they never no personal experience whatsoever on these I'm sure you I'm not I'm not speaking for those people I'm just saying that they're an across this where there is like you know data is the easiest fucking thing in this world to manipulate any study can be skewed you can prove that global warming doesn't exist you can prove pretty much whatever you want with numbers the way the way you've skewed I'm sure my point though was that there there's obviously they're powerful this is a good version of a human like this isn't a dope this is Ryan fucking ditch do you wish that they were donating their processes to a more positive cause you know it's fascinating like that that would be a subject that would drive you nuts whether or not vitamins work you know when there aren't bright and brilliant brain vitamins were like what a what a weird thing to get all hyped about and if he might he might be idolizing you though and this is something that he believes though and so this one issue with you has now shattered that and he has to prove would be that he could be the hyper fan or he could own 40 cats or gonna be a contrarian there's some people that are just fucking conferences were 13 battle or I don't think they're 14 I think there's a lot of older folks I had I don't know this is it it doesn't matter the point is the way the Internet is set at set up now with the the enemy anonymity that's built in it's so easy for someone to be a twat it's so easy there's like virtually no repercussions but slowly that's gonna change and you better brace for it okay because the shit's gonna come down on all you fuckheads because you're not gonna be anonymous very much longer you know of sucked boys 69 on fucking reddit or whatever the hell you know message board you act like a shithead on you're going the the ground forum on mixed martial arts comm or my own message board you're not gonna be anonymous that much longer it's really inevitable there's a clear trend and that trend is connectivity that trend is in interlacing of information and you're not gonna be able to avoid all the aspects of your life that's why I wrote I wrote and I wired article like aimed at anonymous which I know was opening up the floodgates for me to just be attacked but my message to them was hey guys listen like I know it's fun to deface websites and I know it's fun to hack Twitter accounts but you need to maybe you're younger maybe you just don't give a fuck maybe you really are doing it for the lulz but you need to not get busted for the simple trivial shit right now trolling people online and putting out their data because we need you for the fight the real fight you know yeah lowsec just got turned in by an anonymous website proxy they were like no way to say yes we definitely do this but in our thing and says don't do anything illegal and here we're giving the cops the information so they all got arrested those people that hacked what was a PlayStation 1 real the real issue is just like Occupy Wall Street who's in anonymous who's in LulzSec there's just it's an open door right any crazy who's on my message board it's an open door any crazy asshole can join up so personally someone does it someone could to face a website in the name of anonymous you never know and that's absolutely happening now yeah there was a there was a fake anonymous video posted to have like a hack Wall Street day and it was like on a Monday was on a holiday and everybody said this is clearly a plant because anonymous would never be so stupid as to attack the attack the markets on a holiday when the markets aren't that volatile and they would never post it in these ways and people are already it's agent provocateurs just like the guy in the Citibank they're doing that out at the fuckin rallies you know they're doing that as hacking what is this man those motherfuckers anybody want in there this is my friend Tom Atencio the guy who was one of the original creators of affliction he left affliction isn't work for fliction anymore so I stopped I stopped wearing their shit cuz he's my friend sweet logo than I like now um he curated limelight fusion energy drinks they're pretty fucking delicious their health care - I don't know yeah I just started drinking he just sent me a box well but there's a ginkgo biloba in them and ginseng and 200 for 50% of the vitamin b6 100% of the niacin and 800 percent of your vitamin b12 for the day so this uh this looks good stuff in it yeah it tastes good to mix that with some vodka so if I if I drink this rocket fuel right now am I gonna be up until 8:00 a.m. no no it's not that bad it's not like a red ball it's not it's not by but by the way I should state that I have a high tolerance to caffeine in fact I I quit caffeine for a day I took yesterday off and I have a headache really my first cup of coffee of the day this is my first cup and I'm okay today but that's usually how it is for me I've done this before where I was especially when I'm writing a lot I drink a lot of coffee and then the next day I have a headache I need a cup of coffee but if I take a full day and go through the full day and drink a lot of water the next day it's pretty much gone it's like one day that's pretty good it you can cycle back down yeah that's my only addiction I have a physical addiction to caffeine but it's not a physical addiction where it's painful or it's like a terrible itch it's just like I don't feel so good but you know what here's that fucking serious ruthless workout just get a just uh maniac caveman savage adrenaline testosterone bleeding work workout just where you fucking go full grape ape on something and then it just resets your system then water's fine I tried to do that hungover before and it just shattered my body for like three or four week when you workout yeah I've been like I'm a little hungover I'm a lot hungover I'm gonna go to the gym and sweat it out get those toxins out but I push it way too far and it shatters my immune system for like three weeks it's terrible best formula I've ever found for hangovers is this fucking alpha brain shit and coconut juice I love coconut juice and a lot of people don't I look and I'll tell you what this brand I'm not going to mention the name not so tasty yeah it's not that good I think c2 owes the Beth or Amy and Brian's pretty good also see - I was the best and they send it to us so you're saying take one of the placebos this is the shelf abrasive - oh is fucking delicious and I know a lot of people say uh tried coconut which is like dirty dishwater I hear you some brands actually do this plant brand it's fucking delicious and the reason I got hooked on this brand we were at jujitsu and it's one of our buddies brah case of it and apparently in Brazil they drink a lot of coconut water and we were having a day you know 10 plant jiu-jitsu we rolled out a key the key is like the traditional uniform of jiu-jitsu but we the idea that Eddie had was that you know first of all in nogi competitions a lot of the techniques of gidget's who don't work and in mixed martial arts you obviously don't have Aggie so you should learn this will like with the give you grab people easier there's more traction it's easier to hold on to people to get them to grab you which is exact right that's hoist Gracie strategy he would fight with Aggie on and strikers would grab him they couldn't help it so anyway they drink a lot of coconut juice so we had Aggie day and he brought a bunch of coconut juice to like you know like out of respect for Brazilians cuz they love to drink coconut juice and he goes you want to try one and they're like okay just be nice you know I'm like coconut juice tastes like shit right right but I drank this stuff I was like fuck this is delicious yeah it's like the perfect flavor does it have like the coconut pulp in it cuz I had one like that I'm like that's not I'm going on a ride with that coconut yeah this one is so much better than this they're totally did I don't know what the fuck they're doing see - OH email me tell me what the fuck you're doing why is your coconut juice but do you put sugar in here bitch unicorn see hey what you calorie unicorn see many pseudo-class in there and he wasn't even gonna cut the calories they sewed on Amazon I see - I swear again you could have it signed up so had they send you a whole case like every week they're good idea I got an Amazon one click on my phone that is so addictive I love a thought in my head socks yeah anything I don't know I impulse buy everything man rolling papers I buy my rolling papers I got on Amazon I got something you got to do that although I'm gonna stop being a medical marijuana patient why I'm gonna stop smoking marijuana because you can't have a gun anymore you can't have a gun or bullets the federal government is saying that you cannot have a gun or bullets because the federal law dictates that marijuana is a schedule 1 substance and so when you apply to the alcohol Tobacco and Firearms for right on if you get a permit to buy a gun you have to say that you you are a user of marijuana Wow Oh substance so I have to quit wait did they check the medical database so i'm gonna go to whiskey buddy no but database dude doesn't matter man yeah they doesn't matter doesn't matter listen the ATF does not right if you lie on your form that you don't smoke weed and they come to your house and there's weeding a gun honey you gotta get it in well that's the that's how they you know got Al Capone you know they said um they got him for tax evasion didn't they didn't get him for running whiskey and shooting people in the head is that retroactive like analysis no if I own several firearm exactly and yeah exactly thankfully I don't smoke pot but if I did I'm really concerned actly I stopped smoking pot you squares I'm here with a bunch of square it is it's disgusting it's I pay my taxes I'm a fucking constitutional believe an American constitutional believing didn't make sense don't agree it did to the people you were firing up this is what you say goddamn it you should be able to have fucking guns enjoy a little weed and who do I want with a gun do I want a guy on pain pills on fucking ambien though all our guy was drinking whiskey or don't want a guy who's high and paranoid is not gonna shoot anybody wait that's the guy paranoid part leave out the paranoid paranoid people gonna hide then I'm gonna go shooting people they're gonna rush into violence with you if you're paranoid get the fuck out of your band with the shoot back you know I don't I don't think that marijuana inhibits your judgment to the point where having a gun it makes it prohibitive or it makes it dangerous III think if anything it's gonna make you a scaredy cat it's gonna make you nervous it's gonna make you it's gonna make you more sensitive to the possibilities of you know hurting somebody or hurting yourself yeah but they don't wanna do to as a bad trip and you know thinks he's seeing shit off of an edible and start shooting somebody that's gonna have that bad science because what about a million people that don't pull their guns out because they are high right now and then just say let's just let this go but any number can be manipulated I mean it's it's clearly no worse than being able to like drink at a bar and have a shotgun rack on your truck you know when you're driving home no show different than places that allow that yeah that's fucking crazy it's fucking crazy it's fucking an American man it's on it's on American to step in and say that if you want to have something that the states have voted on and you have a goddamned white there states rights are supposed to supersede federal rights you're supposed to be able to decide what you can and can't use and the state comes along and says you know what we've looked at all the information and guess what there's a lot of people called comas a lot of people with cancers a lot of people that anxiety is a lot of people with all sorts of different fucking ailments marijuana there's a lot of people who know why it's illegal I think it's fucked up and want to get high believe I shouldn't need glaucoma I don't want to smoke weed yeah lying about marijuana this is the bottom line this is one way to look at it my friend Todd McCormick brought this up he said it's a commodity it's no different than corn or apples or pork bellies and it should be considered as a commodity and if it is considered as a commodity then you have to look well why is this commodity being kept from the marketplace who's benefiting right and follow the fucking money follow the money trail because guess what there's not a goddamn thing in the world that's useless that makes no money that people are beating down the doors trying to make you legal right there's not a single one there's not a single one do you it has to be worth something to somebody to keep that shit illegal that's the only way they spawn is an industrial complex the cops who enforce this shit that don't want to lose their jobs even though many of them now are for it in this Portland those cops are in this day and age when you get a fucking person on television who represents the United States government and they start talking about going after real estate owners for renting out property to these cannabis shops oh they're gonna steal their fucking property the government's gonna come in from hardworking Americans who put their fucking businesses for rent they have this they they buy place they say well now I'll rent this place out I'll make myself a nice little product this what do you what do you do oh you you sell medical marijuana legally under state guidelines okay well there is proposition 215 which passed in 1994 that's been a long time it's been legal in the state so go ahead and do your business and the federal government comes in and says no we're gonna steal your fucking house because you rent it out to someone who sells pot fuck man and people will say why are you why do you tweak out about this stuff why do you let it bother you why because it is the ultimate fuck it's the ultimate ridiculous thing you have a plant that's literally one of the most beneficial plants on earth and I'm not even talking about the psychoactive portions of it I'm talking about the use of it first of all it contains all the amino acids you can eat it it's got high in protein hemp proteins like some of the best protein you can bread you can make oil out of this shit you can make fucking biodiesel out of this shit you make superior paper out of this shit you make clothes out of this shit it's way stronger than cotton it sounds fake when you start listing all the different cool shit that you can make with it it literally sounds like you're lying it sounds like you're bullshit wait this has completely better properties than anything else on the market yes absolutely does but wait it grows in any weather condition for the most part in any so think about all the trees that get chopped down to make paper how much my fucking paper we use every day you can make four times as much paper in the same acreage of marijuana and it grows back in six months whose back right there instead of 20 fucking years or whatever the hell it takes to grow back your paper for trees it's it's amazing it's a it's one of the prime fucks and it's one of the things that has to be addressed in this even if you disagree I'm sorry but even if you disagree with with what it can do or why it can do it or the propaganda out there and even if you feel reefer madness and drugs drugs drugs the the sheer violation of rights exact title government comes in and as you said boots you out of your fucking business that you put your neck on the line for and try to do legally according to state law that should have everybody enrage regardless of what the subject is not only that how about prioritizing our fucking problems when we're living in a day and age where there's rampant crime all over the place people are getting carjacked and shot and you look at the fucking murder rate in Los Angeles 20 million fucking people stuffed into one small area and traffic and nonsense and car theft and home invasions you look at all that and you're telling me that you need civil servants to go after a plant that makes people silly you got away stop fucking tax dollars arresting people for selling silly plants for selling plants that make food taste better make sex taste better make movies more awesome really you fuckheads it's it's the ultimate fuck you it's the ultimate power move it's the ultimate this is not a free country move it really is and yet it's happening and then it's happening so now what well now what is Occupy Wall Street is now what now what is the bubble has erst when occupies darling so when occupy starts having signs that say give us back our weed then they're gonna try to roll on the movement and say that it's just another hippie movement all these kids want are their fucking drugs they're not gonna be able to do that I think oh man late for that I think it's too late for that I think it's already gotten too big oh I don't I don't think I don't think it's gotten big enough with the people who need to believe it's for them well it's gonna get bigger right but it's gonna be get bigger because they're gonna put their ad dollars behind portraying the movement as a pro weed this is what they care about movement like it's a marginalize feel at this point in time there's 50 percent of Americans in the most recent Gallup poll said that they want marijuana legal that's higher than it's ever been before it's the first time ever that it's passed the people that want it illegal 46 will be half the country though that is like fuck you that shit needs to be illegal that's what you hippies are about forget it and it divides us up into teams again that's what I'm saying I don't think so I don't could that's gonna be the the boiling point or rather just like they don't have a leader there's not gonna be one thing they're gonna attack this thing for everybody what I'm saying is I don't think it's a good point the marijuana point is not a good point because most people think it should be legal and how get dry people are good half of the people at ease it should be illegal so you just lose half of the country right there by making us about that one moral issue then you pick out another issue and then you pick out another issue that's another issue that's what I'm saying that's a good point marginalizes the whole thing that's a good point but I think there's enough people that do believe at this point that other people are gonna have to start listening because there's enough people like Ron Paul and Gary Johnson intelligent Republicans that are really pragmatic thoughtful people that can tell you why it should be league but does he stand a snowball's chance in hell of being elect not affecting any change no no no well effecting change for sure you know Ron Paul is probably doing more impact socially on any other candidate besides where people that win I absolutely ground that he got a partial audit of the Fed but you don't believe that they put about what they found out trillions of dollars billion that were not accounted for more than our debt over the history of this country they lent out without any debates without any notification they lent out more money than the history of the debt of our country to bankers to bail them out they gave us one amount and it said okay here you go here you go bank bailout the countries worldwide just go just go most people do some obscure lot it yeah partial order most people don't even understand when you hear about the Federal Reserve's it's not federal yeah it's it's a it's a private company in the line it's as federal as Federal Express it's a private company run for profit it's so hard to win some money that our money is all being privately untold by foreign banks I mean that is a that what a mindfuck that is every dollar that you work your ass off to earn has already tacked on to it to somebody and you don't even know it then it was it possible that they can call it the federal bank when I mean what what that is crazy that's like calling a company that breaks in your house movers right you know what I mean it's like how are you calling it that how is that legal you know how is it legal to call that the federal bank the Federal Reserve cuz I think they were they were reserved for the favor the reserved for the Federation right I mean that was what they were they're like well when this when this country is in dire straits or there's a market spike or the next depressions gonna happen we're gonna be there to make it all right by printing money we're gonna be the bank that lends money to the country what's amazing is when someone's running for president and they meet with the Bilderberg Group this out in the open they just gonna be like them and you know they they have these fucking meetings and it's all I want to chat with you for a few yeah people that write bill bill clinton running for president met with the Bilborough vote on that guy meanwhile they probably all meet with them you know that clearly figure out who's the best puppet clearly has that ever been that's what's so frustrating with Obama right now because the and I can I ask you that has it ever been more evident so clear and I was duped I was fucking Duke I was sold on the hope and change and the reason I was duped was not because I just I wanted to believe in the posters but because I looked at where the money came from and it came from guys like me I know if it came from you or you but it came from individuals it wasn't so much wonderful operation did there was some there I wonder if it even did I mean who the fuck is auditing where the money comes from and whose there's a couple sites that look at donations and what like and whatnot but that's never happened no I mean there's always back channels and so for all I know yes the corporations could have totally put him in there but I know that I donated and I know a lot of other people donated and so the the sentiment amongst guys like myself who feel like sheeps now the sentiment was hey the people are putting him here so he's got the chance for the hope and change he's gonna fuck those banks over he's gonna get us out of those wars like he said he's gonna do this that the other and I thought because well my money went to put that there and so did millions of others of Americans he's gonna fill beholding to us no he just escalated everything escalated everything continued the same policies right or people are being spied on than ever or more civilly or res addition is happening Guantanamo is not fucking closed down out of ill and Wars number that they're gonna close down Guantanamo Bay I listen it's a logistics thing we got an Excel spreadsheet it's gonna take us like a year to figure it out guys yeah no you're not closing that motherfucker down yeah you're clearly not and then taking the guys who are responsible for the defrauding the nation these guys from JPMorgan from Citibank from Goldman Sachs from Bank of America and putting them in positions of power in positions where they can control the money you put those guys in power the ones that literally fuck this country by selling faulty mortgages and betting against their own customers that's crazy like betting against them selling you shit in a box putting a triple-a rating on it and saying dude this is so secure you're gonna love this shit oh yeah we bet against it now it's gonna fail and they know you're gonna give me the money to bail me out you put those motherfuckers in his in his cabinet I'm happy Don't Ask Don't Tell got repealed but you got some fucking work to do if you want to kill that's a crumb that's what I mean a damn crumb I want a sign were allowed to be our hired killer even if you're gay congratulations the world's perfect man right yeah we really did we need those numbers up we don't need gay people killing people we don't need any new people killing people I was out at the rally plus sign that said Wall Street wants to gay marry your illegal abortions and people are like what are you trolling this event what are you doing I'm like no no no I'm saying that like someone might see this and get outraged and the statement that I'm trying to make which was woefully missed I get it now but the statement I was trying to make was that the same anger you have for moral issues you need to apply to the issues that are the fundamental problems right now in my opinion it's not those little moral issues that are on this sign that you're being offended by right now it's these bankers that took the fucking money it's the government that's bought by the bankers it's the police force that's being paid by them to stifle your your rights to protest it's all that shit like if that foundation crumbles we won't be able to have the conversations about the moral shit that you want to have a conversation on yeah I just won't exist anymore I had to read Matt Taibbi zart achill 'he's about this movement even though i have to read them ten fucking times just to even understand to all the bullshit that exists behind the scenes derivatives and shorting and it's it's so hard to believe that there's an economy based on gambling that things are going to fail and that is a hundred times larger than the actual economy right well based on speculation app your fucking head around that it's like I get to bet on a horse in the race I get to bet that that horse isn't gonna finish the race and I get to put the horse in that race I know he's not gonna finish and I'm gonna tell you this is gonna be the number one horse you're gonna be to super-secure give that money with me there we go and horse dies on the fucking first lap and nobody there's not that sense of saving in savings and loan scam don't arrested which is a fraction this means alone scandal was a fraction of this this fraud movement and Ron was a fraction of it in terms of detriment to the the country and homes and are in our budgets fraction and not one person has been investigated to put away how roses that yeah what a what else got the eared weird world we live in we are literally being sucked dry by financial vampires it's like there's a vampire colony that's preying on our people but the way they're doing it instead of sucking blood out they're sucking money out and they live in these opulent castles that you can go nowhere near and there's armed guards and fucking fences and they're sleeping in their coffins and they're just sucking money out of ya and they're doing it and they're doing it legally somehow or another yeah they're donating money to the cops four point six million dollars to the cops so they can fucking keep them away from them while the protests are going on fuck man yeah it's insane have you ever seen the American dream the animated cartoon no it explains in like a very simple beautiful way inside job was a great one for that now people are starting to get aware of that in the sad jobs in San Jose phenomenal but again died had to watch by the way a documentary yeah exactly but how amazing is it when that guy is questioning all these different professors that now these guys they become professors and then they get jobs working for the government so when they're professors they say shit that turns out to not be fucking true at all they say shit that enables businesses to get away with creepy things because well we went to this financial expert in his this is what his opinion is he's like hey everything's gonna be cool and they're like hey he said everything's gonna be cool he's got a PhD and then turns out this cocksucker goes and starts working for the federal government afterwards or starts working for some big corporation after work and get some cushy ass fuckin job ins making X millions of dollars per year because of his decisions that he made that support these fucking vampire criminals it's the same revolving door with the SEC right now like the guys are supposed to be regulating Wall Street and putting cases you know up to the government so they can actually enforce them they know that if they don't prosecute if they don't do anything there's gonna be a revolving door when they're done with their two or three years they can hop right on over and work for the guys that they were supposed to be investigating there's no laws against that what's gonna happen so this is this is what we all see we all see Occupy Wall Street we all see people freaking out we all see how many people are like us all across the country I mean what is this this is just a conversation between sheron's how many friends are sitting around smoking a joint you know drinking a couple of beers having the same fucking conversation spitting out each other in a bar somewhere I mean these motherfuckers what's gonna happen where's this guy great questions because it's more than ever before it's more than any time in my life mm-hmm this is like we are right now at like Vietnam protest levels we're like we're we're at the state well you see those that girl get maced in New York and you hear that that guy only got fucking ten days of vacation a time removed from you like how is that guy allowed to be a fucking cop you went around and may some chicks you should be you you should have to fucking fight Chris cyborg that's what they should do they should you want a mace chicks how about you getting the right guy running to wipe that marine that says there's no honor and if that marine might gas out it's better not against officer Tony boloney's job done Tony baloney might have a good guard his guard at that guy off his garden smells like old spice he's got it gonna be that strong that it's that one cop through a sucker punch at one of the protesters and it was like the worst punch ever yeah you're like you should never be confident enough to punch a man with that whack ass technique you have you don't know how to fight it all right yeah you have the balls to throw a punch in a crowd against an unarmed protester you fuckhead which shows just how fucking peaceful despite the agent provocateur is it shows just how peaceful this movement truly is because yeah that's the only way well it's also that you see these cops that are older cops that are the white shirt cops you know those are the guys that are older cops that have been the force a long time and they get jaded yeah and they've seen the worst humanity yet entitled to you know and they get cocky and they think that they can get away with some shit that's that's what enabled him to pull the trigger but they've also done they've also dealt with scum day in and day out like you said so they see somebody in their face screaming at them which that should not be happening but they see that and they go okay I'm now identifying us come right now you know we gotta win the police over if this thing's gonna work at all and that yeah that concerns me that's an uphill battle oh I don't think so I like I said before I think the cops are gonna figure it out eventually that it's all a pile of horseshit once things start sliding I hope so well I hope you talked about people that are willing to commit atrocities right because they've been desensitized like they've got enough they've got enough non-lethal Arsenal right now to fuck up a lot of people and still feel like they're not being lethal they're just being okay they're just following orders right you know they're just worried about their paycheck as well you know though and that that will be said but pepper spray is one thing they've got the sonic weapons maybe Hut fucking rubber bullets like you look at it at revolts and revolution throughout history they never had the weaponry that they have right now to use against their own people right that's what scares the shit out of me well that they could flip on a ray gun and it will microwave your intestines you're so freaky man google it this guy together Alex Jones there's video there's video footage there's video footage from a news reporter taking a microwave beam weapon from like 10 years ago google it right now and he stands in front of it there's I click click click click click and the guy goes all God instantly steps off the pad this was some years ago so it's basically like putting a my Gravatt in a microwave yes except it's directional it spits pinpointed they could point it at you or that could work it out and beam and say here's the switch hooks people you instantly feel like your intestines are on fire is the way this news reporter who stood in front of it years ago described that too wearing chainmail you know you're like well armor suits is like if you put a can of soda in the microwave it'll fucking ride right but you can't wear masks you can't wear gas masks you can't have sticks anymore for your sign because that's a weapon right you can't have anything anymore so they're gonna quell that shit right away you should really watch that video no that's a weapon oh my god you know there's a thing that I watched on TV the other day where they were talking about sonic weapons and whatever they're able to do now with sound they can cause permanent deafness that can cause permanent blindness have you seen blind you with sound yeah you imagine that it's an abuse arm there's a video of that in use I think it's in Detroit a to the Detroit or Pittsburgh where they roll out there was a small like union protest it's online and it literally announces and I'm gonna say Detroit I might be wrong on this but I was gonna fuckin say the truck rolls out and goes our tension city of Detroit from these giant booming speakers on a big black monolithic looking car with riot police in front of it bashing there she with batons to create sound you know and the thing is like attention we are going to employ what I think you're talking about the sonic weapons they used in Vancouver at the Olympic now that's what it was I'm sorry yeah I guess I remembered that I just looked it up but they were threatening to use things like that I believe it was that well you know no they used it yeah well no they used that at the Olympics for sure so and that was again years ago and this was this was for a nonviolent protest they're calling it an acoustical device right been setting a harmonica so this is an weapon this is a high fidelity dispersal unit what we're gonna make you deaf if you don't get the fuck out of this area they blasted some Somali pirates with it on this thing that I was watching the the US government used it to keep off Somali pirates they were coming near this boat and they just turn this thing on just fuckin blows their brains out they have to swim away they should have knees shit where it's like in the next ten minutes we're gonna have this thing that's gonna break your iphone my personally I personally like it the way the fucking Russians handle it the Russians go after Somali pilots they fucking pump missiles in their boats and they pill them up and they shoot him in the fucking head that's the way to do it you know these these sonic weapons men this is this is some lame shit but it's gonna be turned on either sent regular folk message yeah nice what concerns me yeah well that's a real concern you know when when technology as far as you know weapons and shit and and riot stuff when when it becomes viable you know when it becomes something that people can make money developing you know and these weapons companies they're gonna start turning it on people well why else would you build them and by them I mean that's that's the last Institute here's what's gonna happen right the military-industrial complex what you guys think that if there's money in making war there's also money in keeping peace there's also money and battling against insurgents right here in America I mean that's what people are gonna be called true version of insurgency I mean you know the people that are rallying up against the you know the oppressive force right and what they're gonna see is what worries about me it worries me about this is that the imagery like when they shoot people in protests right been the Arab Spring and you see people just getting fucking shot you go holy shit man that's fucked up no God intervened you get world support and get other people but if they use sonic weapons when people are angry in protesting finally which it may have to get sure fuckin hope it doesn't but even if they have an agent provocateur spark a crowd they're gonna say listen these guys got out of hand this protest is violent and angry and we didn't even kill them we just microwave their insides for a little bit they won't say that they'll say we used a sonic weapon and so people at home will be like well they're being very humane to those violent people so this isn't nearly as jarring if they were shooting I guess 10 people went deaf it was only 10 and they wouldn't listen right they they should I had this argument my parents and they're like well if the police told you to get out you're not supposed to be there you what they told you to leave I couldn't explain the concept of protesting to friends it gets to a certain point it gets to a boiling point where what happens because it's growing right now they're saying that every day at Occupy Wall Street in New York it's a bigger and bigger crowd every day people are coming from all over the world to participate in it my friend Jamie Keil Steen he's doing there in fucking Melbourne Australia they're doing occupy Melbourne you know and it's like 10 people fucking hippies they're out there and that base in Australia might but they're rocking bankís might you know they're uh yeah they're out there but I mean it's it's giant fucking gantt ik is beyond gigantic so what does it do what do you what is when you look at it do you do you extrapolate well constantly you know there's a million ways this thing can go which is why I'm so fascinated by it I mean we are living in a chapter of a future history book orbiting at the end of our society I mean really don't you don't know maybe both maybe both yeah yeah maybe this is New World Order shit maybe this is when the crowd gets completely beat down and that's it there's nothing you can do we just be slaves to the system did you see Ron Paul at the Republican debate yeah Ron Paul had this one brilliant thing that he said that everybody says that really pays attention to human history he said this is exactly how every single Empire has fallen they try to spread themselves out too thin and eventually it all comes crumbling down it's it's amazing we have a blueprint we've seen this we have the knowledge to connect all the dots as to what's happening right now and yet we're just repeating history but with slightly different tools and in slightly different volumes you know it's been ratcheted up and we've survived a lot of that history but who knows what atrocities could line around the corner but I've even looking at like I'm doing alright I got a good job I got great friends like I'm doing great and I see I'm really concerned for the director of this country which is why I'm trying to educate myself and be a little more outspoken about it but I'm really concerned to the point where I've had the discussion of all right well where the fuck where's our exit strategy what is it right now if the shit really hits the fan tomorrow and they declare martial law on the streets lockdown you know the riot police are coming into the Marines gonna come in and fight am I gonna wake up tomorrow morning my dollars worth nothing and there's a war zone outside my window I mean we're we're potentially two to three years away from that maybe more who knows what that's maxi-glass maybe less it could happen tomorrow and in that the notion that it could happen not that I think it will but the notion that it could I never thought I would feel that in my lifetime in this country and I feel it right now and I've been researching do I go to Finland Switzerland I mean Japan was my exit strategy for a little while there loved Japan but that countries hit some fucking hard times right now and it you wouldn't go to Canada I would go right to Vancouver Vancouver is a shit I've never been to Vancouver is it you ever done shows up yeah but you know yeah Mabel times me yeah dude Vancouver first of all well they're a great comedy scene great weed rapes super nice people and really a really diverse community there now I should gotta be there I almost moved there in 1984 for the ocean when Bush won again 84 rather 2004 when Bush won again in 2004 I just sat back and especially because I was paying attention of the whole Diebold voting thing right you know oh I was like this is ridiculous I watched the hacking democracy documentary and I'm like these guys they stole it this is not a button this is not real anymore you got a big old over testifying under oath that you wrote code that allowed him to rig an election yes and I showed how he can be done and then did it yeah and showed how this there's a there's a third party option in the software that allows a third party other than the voter other than the person reading the vote and a second person another person comes in and inserts data and changes the data and they showed how it can be done and this is I mean this is they've been massive contributors to the Republican Party the idea that some company can contribute to the Republican Party and then make a machine that decides whether Republicans or Democrats win elections is madness absolute fucking madness called hedging your bets I furious man there was there was a period of time over a couple weeks I'm a big fan of Candida I love going up there and I don't like the cold though and I was like man Montreal would be the shit but the winters are brutal fuck where else could I live right you know maybe so you have that oh yeah I still do I still go back and forth I have my friend Bobby lives so what's what's gonna be the pin drop do you know you imagine what these paddles I get older it might just be as I get older I just decide enough is enough of this nonsense you don't have to live in this country you know this is a we are eventually becoming a global society we're the connectivity that we all enjoy right now because the internet lets people realize that communities like my message board I have a massive message board and in this community is a massive message board of really cool people from everywhere man I have people from fucking Saudi Arabia I have people from foreign countries I have Asian countries I have people from Canada a lot of fucking people from Canada people from Switzerland and Sweden all over the fucking world and it leads me to believe that this idea that a fucking line in the dirt can dictate where you're from right no no no it should be like-minded people it should be cool people like-minded people find them and if you find a spot oh it's across the dirt line it's no good anymore yeah but it's awesome whether it's fucking Costa Rica or where the fuck it is if you find a place that you think that you could live a safer healthier friendlier life then what you're here in the in the center of the shitstorm you know look I would I love the idea of America I love the idea of it all I love the idea that you know we saved the world from the Russians and we saved the world from the Nazis and that we're you know the the the noblest and the most creative I love the idea but I don't see it in practice and it scares me I've never been to a NASCAR game it's not a game it's it scares me to think that I'm that I'm a rube you know that I'm locked into this stupid fucking system and if if it gets any worse man I don't know what to do that's what is that falls apart around what is the catalyst you know and that's what I've been thinking because you know people had chances to get out of countries that became locked down and war started and then it was like yeah you ain't going anywhere yeah they had they had signs they had they had news reports coming out they had all that shit I had the Internet though they didn't have the Internet they didn't it was a different world right world that we're living in is a very strange world and I don't know what happened when it all falls apart I don't know is someone gonna try to reclaim power I mean is there gonna be an actual physical war are they gonna be tanks in the streets and who are those soldiers those soldiers are gonna actually go after their brothers and sisters and cousins and neighbors yeah hold it how can they how can is that possible what I mean they could be sold a message that it's not their brothers and sisters and neighbors that is that it's insurgents that's their terrorists and that would be the Agent Provocateur so we need a certain population of sociopaths make this whole fuckin plan work for the man we're gonna become Mexicans well be going on you're saying in today you're saying that the agent provocateur czar so that's yeah we will be the Canadian Mexicans exactly Mexican versions of Canada yeah I'd rather live in a cold climate I'm not even living Alaska I might even live in Alaska better than this Joe have you seen this fish with the transparent head have you ever seen this photo oh yes yeah it's like a real deep underwater fish yeah it's it's a fish and they have it on YouTube or there's photos it's on from National Geographic but it's actual fish that you can just see right into its brain and and like you could see its organs and I don't know the name of it I think it they call it a large Pacific be a RR e l ey e baro baro I this is a video from a few years ago this was like 2009 I just saw it the other day it's like the fish from Sega semen for the Dreamcast yes exactly like that fuckin alien world that ocean now I always sees a real a real deepwater shit like the planet Earth deepwater edition anything on deepwater I see the life that exists on this planet and it makes me realize how uncreated human beings are at conceiving what alien life-forms could be oh yeah you know I mean it's like well this fish glows in the dark yeah you probably didn't think you know an alien this fish only exists in the infrared spectrum you know whatever I did an anglerfish develop how the fuck did that fish develop it has a fishing rod and as a fishing rod and a lure it dangles a little lure and as the thing comes close they're fucking giant mall opens up and just sucks the fish yeah it's amazing because it was created by some it was created by some alien point and clicks you know I mean we are just there simulator and he was like let's try this a fish with the fucking lure on his head and see what that goes there's this guy who's a chess master and he's a brilliant guy who plays blindfolded chess against like multiple opponents this Australian guy and he's also a creationist it's really a fascinating thing to see cuz he's obviously a super super brilliant guy and so many posted this interview with this guy where he was talking about how there's what what science doesn't account for with evolution doesn't account for how does carbon molecule become a person you know is right it's just in their idea it's like this idea of the soul and all these different it's the the complexity is too hard for them to grasp so it must be magic right kids to some weird in due time science will help us perceive what we have to label as magic right now and it was evil maybe maybe not I mean maybe that's the question we're not supposed to ever answer or maybe we'll get to a certain point where we realize oh no there is some sort of an inner code that's inescapable that permeates the entire universe you know right over it's string theory or whatever the fuck it is they they find some frequency at the center of all that you know accepts love and rejects negativity like the Hitler video and that contact signal yes no no no it'd be different than that yeah they heard the signal they're like and then the blind dude was like dude I hear video and then they put it up to a monitor and it was Hitler and it was like there's more this is interlaced information and then they had the blueprints on how to build the travel thing it's exactly like that that was a fascinating movie well the book was way better was it I never read the book was way better crawl Sega was a bad motherfucker by the way massive pothead for those of you hate weed Carl Sagan huge pothead Carl Sagan smoked weed every fucking day I was just a pussy son you see dr. Drew I was talking about you on that Conan O'Brien show which is cool by the way that that that not only has the California Association backed up Medical Marijuana but dr. Drew was on Conan being asked do you back up medical marijuana what he said and he says why get a lot of slack from Joe Rogan about this the reason why is because he started talking on his crazy CNN show about how marijuana is much stronger than it was back in the day and how there's dangerous withdrawal symptoms and I'm like come on did he clarify that it might be psycho purely psychological this is I said you know I don't know how your body works but I'm pretty sure that if we'd got yeah it's because we'd got there first well I mean if it wasn't we'd that you been addicted to it could have been cheesy fine now or scratch tickets or internet porn whatever plugs that wait for you yeah and maybe for some people there's there's people that have extreme physical issues with all sorts of altered states of consciousness there's people that literally must drink coffee all day long they must smoke cigarettes all day long they are constantly trying to change whatever state and it could be an imbalance it could be some sort of an issue that they have I have witnessed it many times with alcohol I know certain people with drugs you know I was listening to Ron Benny channels listening to Iran and Fez and Ron is a guy who's in the program and he apparently he had pendeks and they wanted to give him painkillers and he was terrified and he's pretty sure he's got his addictions under control but he didn't want to take the chance and one of the reasons why is because he had a friend and this friend I believe he said had been sober for you know 10 fucking years had been working as a counselor in a place helping people stay sober stayed up in the Poconos so that he didn't have to go back around the same neighborhood and he was working it as hard as you could there for ten years gets in some sort of an accident has a back problem whenever they put him on some pills boom he's a junkie again yeah there's some people man there's absolutely there's no doubt about it and I would never discount that I would never discount that possibility but what they discount and this is my issue with all these doctor true types is that they always have this sort of uh you know I love doctor Joe by the way he's a really good guy yeah he's great guy he's a great guy I really love him as a person he's a there's nothing wrong with that guy he gets silly sometimes but they they discount the positive benefits of it and they make it as if it's a goof they make it as it like they go like well uh listen I'm not gonna stop you from swag and paw if you want to smoke pot forget about all the medical uses because the medical uses are many and they're very very good and they're very real the actual benefits of it for the human race are substantial right they're huge and they're not something you should just dismiss and diminish because popular opinion is laced with the propaganda from nineteen fuckin 30s and it has just in entwined itself into our culture to the point where people believe also - bullshit and nonsense about what is really an amazing beneficial plant you know and maybe you can't handle it and maybe you don't like it but to tell me that this thing this turbocharger for the imagination this thing that makes you more sensitive makes you more loving it makes you more friendly it makes food taste better make sex taste better it doesn't harm you in any way you wake up in the morning you fucking feel great you don't feel hungover you get you're telling me that this thing that I take in that does this is bad I'm telling you it could fix the fucking world I'm telling you it changes consciousness I'm telling you it's a fucking tool man it's a tool like a hammer or a fucking jackhammer or a laser beam it's anything else do you think he fundamentally do you think these needs what the world needs is a shaman they need shaman they need people who have experienced altered states of consciousness and not only know how to navigate them can talk other people through them and do it on a professional level what they've done for thousands and thousands of years in the rainforest we need to apply not just with marijuana but all the different tools of consciousness including alcohol I should have places we could teach you how to drink alcohol I enjoy alcohol I like it I like having a shot or two with my friends it makes me loose it makes me silly I get I start enjoying things a little bit more I want to dance I don't think it's bad but I think there would be benefit so many fucking people if when you're 19 or 20 they took you to a fucking class or some smart interesting person taught you about drinking and gave you some fucking things to think about here's what you need to think about what why don't you write down how about this you're you're a new drinker write down on your iphone every time you have a drink is that hard send yourself a text message send a frantic text message every time you have a drink and he has to send you a text message every time he has a drink so that you get like six seven drinks in from this guy you can call him up and go hey bro you should stop drinking it's you you texted me 45 minutes ago and you've had nine drinks with the fuck you doing who's watching you who's a who's looking out for you who's driving you home you know that's not a bad idea you're teaching social responsibility with what's available teach it's its social responsibility but it's also shamanism you got it but they have a beating disagrees no no no no he doesn't actually had a thought yesterday that we went through all the entire stuff that dr. Joe has said about me all in a row and we ended up with a weight that he said on Conan and he's actually saying that that one of the biggest things right now is that there's people that get addicted to marijuana marijuana is addictive to people and that and then it was got physically though dude it's addictive like jerking laughs addictive right but one of the biggest things right now that's filling a hospital room or hospitals and stuff like that is people for you know freaking out on marijuana and stuff like that and that one is this big one in hospital room people having panic attacks or hospitals is is but but it's big I don't want to say in that cuz that happen to him pull over to the side of the road and call an ambulance that's not sure that's 100% not true well there's actually wasn't high at all when it happened but but here's the thing drew has to say this could happen there has to as a physician wait that's one of his biggest things that he treats is his medical a dick of marijuana addiction so what he was saying is that it is addictive too because people do get addictive cuz he has to deal with it all the time now he's saying he's for medical marijuana he says that especially now that after this it's got this thing but that but the joke's pointer it is addictive to your point though if there was a shaman whether it's yourself or dr. Drew or the fucking internet that yet hey this can be addictive here's what happens instead of it's either gonna be reefer madness or it's the greatest thing ever I mean you need to balance the approach I need to educate people I think we all know somebody that spends over $40 a day or marijuana probably yeah I know a few people with that fucking just go to the store and just fucking Spanish shitload of money every single day and smokes that money this is mrs. the current study this current study I believe they believe that 10% of recreational users will develop problems severe enough to impair their work and relationships very simple take the money that they would make from taxes from marijuana if it was legal I've always said if you want to have marijuana legal just how about this you want to give people an incentive make it tax it higher than everything else give it a tax like the idea to cigarettes or alcohol right give it a tax and then take a portion of that and use it for treatment centers for these ten percent that have wacky fucking jeans or whatever it is right it's not but for most of us it's not physically addictive but a lot of people like to escape man and they like to escape with video games and if they don't escape with video games they like to scape with weed I've been addicted to things before that aren't addictive like video games I've been addicted to playing pool I've been addicted to working out I've been addicted to several things in my life that were impulses masturbation I've had moments in my life special as a young man or you know you'd masturbate like how many have you ever done that like mastery not even horny meanwhile you're beating off like for the third or fourth time in the day like if the fuck is wrong with me there it's there's a difference I think between when you have a fucked up life and you you don't have discipline and you don't have like the ability to be objective about your body you'd be a bility to be objective about your mind how much organization have you done do you do meditation do you do any self reflecting time where you sit sit down and and look at your whole life as all right well if you don't then sometimes you get washed up in some crazy wave of momentum and then you become obsessive with things at least me I I find myself my most vulnerable when the rest of my life is out of order and chaotic when the rest of my life is like a bunch of shit and I'm not dealing with and then right fucking bills I'm not paying and all that that's when I'll find myself beating off three times a day that's when I find myself can't walk away from the computer because I want to fucking play video games online all I smoked more during those periods though or now that's they don't do any of that anymore and right all this was back before I even smoked weed and smoke weed anymore yeah I stopped right stop so I could have done because guns yeah you know I want to keep my guns I made a decision cunt cunt fucking government you can't yet when I when actually got pulled over which is I love Z I love the good ones don't get me wrong I love the good pots Joe when I got love the good cops when I pulled over that was an accident weed that was caffeine that was from energy drinks from from that was the gay climbing out of every pore in your body like like the the centre was a nuclear reactor and it was melting down high and the gay was just blasting out of all your skin pores and you were twitching and shaking and you had to call the cops yeah how many energy drives I had one of those big mountain do I don't you think they make them anymore the longest Mountain Dew super energy you had a bucket of energy drink a straw in it and I hadn't eaten all day my heart start double jumping wee a girl at our e3 booth we had these booth models we were sponsored by a first of all fuck yeah yeah you know and they're all that's been great this is not a on Detroit not even a mildly attractive girl there now III is ridiculous and there are some really hot nerd chicks there that really are into that shit it looks smokin hot what is hotter than a hot chick with a hot body in glasses I don't know what it is man Sarah Palin you got a glasses girl yeah she was like no she was a Gamestop manager like that level of nursers not yea and plays professor layton and cosplays yeah my girlfriend she works a crush on this girl yeah yeah there you go gotta get him to work out this is very important some girls are great when they're like 21 29 23 and then 24 it starts like becoming gelatinous and gives out and that's so sad you can I know that's why I like 19 is that's that's it that's the cutoff point we need to find out what the fuck Halle Berry's doing cuz that been just 45 and she's hot as shit do you think there's a lot on these and and survery is scissors and a lot of health and healthy but she's also crazy I don't know I haven't seen her be seen Demi Moore lately no whoa I'm sure they showed a picture of her yesterday I where she looks like a skeleton like and she just looks like whatever magic she was using for the last 20 years oh this is gonna take more mana but fuckin I'm gonna catch this sexy style like Charlie Sheen's penis now if you look at her you can't blame Ashton Kutcher and ran you can't blame Ashton for going out and getting some on the side you can't do you think I think they had an open relationship that's totally loud but he just picked women that were being vocal about it it was like I don't can't do this anymore now well let me see how I can phrase this no I have a friend and this friend may or may not have worked on the movie GI Jane mm-hm and you know that movie to me more on him this friend who may or may not have worked on this may or may not have had to me more grab his cock one night Ted Danson no a good try so if that was possible if that was real yes I think that might there's a two-way street I think it was probably together in giaggi No probably there's a lot of people that roll that way they just roll that way especially in the acting community is you know people think that oh they're no different than us many of them no but many of them they've grown up in these weird fucking showbiz super self-indulgent circles and you know many of them just you know they're kind of did do drugs and they embrace different lifestyles and you know I have you ever seen the open relationship thing or the swinger thing or anything or you tried it no I've never tried it here's I mean obviously I've been in situations where I didn't want to be settled down I mean right you know and I said look I don't want to be in a relationship I don't want to but I've never been in like you know you hearing yeah yeah yeah we we have a buddy Ari Shaffir who was in an open marriage and his wife would go on dates and then come home and talk about how guys fucked her and stuff he should really do material on that why does he do yeah he's weird about that right yeah I don't think maybe he doesn't want the world know there's that they're talking about Ted Danson yeah yeah not our sphere that guy who looks like Ari Shaffir was he getting off to it like it I was they were there no it didn't eventually didn't work I don't know man you know you'd have to ask him about that I don't want to say now yeah I already said too much as it is I think he said it before yeah yeah before I wouldn't have said if you hadn't said it but he's crazy always crazy you know Ari ARS a wild motherfucker though you know Ari will you know what makes you say it's too hard though just out of curiosity my kid well I think mentalize emotions for men I think it's look legitimately some people believe that that's how human beings existed a long time ago that that's the mushroom orgies you know the idea of you know these orgiastic groups of you know free sex monkeys that existed millions of years ago you know McKenna had that whole thing that he believed that you know and it it really the idea behind it is that at one point in time mushrooms were a huge part of human diets and they were part of all these rituals and people would get together and eat them and right they would have these orgies and have all this parties and have a good time and that's slowly but surely the climate changed the mushrooms became more and more rare and they were hoarded by the elites and then they were also kept from other people and then the sort of this or G astok communal society that we had this matriarchal society by the way that worship the mother and worship the mother earth and you know which mushrooms sort of tend to like put you in tune with that family yeah that all dissolved as climate change and he actually documents it down to them taking mushrooms and putting them in honey and that the honey became psychoactive as well because honey when it ferments becomes Mead and then you have a completely polar opposite society you have an alcohol based society which is you know inflates the ego right diminishes objectivity and self-awareness or diminishes the the feelings of you know of connectivity its I was that was the 10-minute
