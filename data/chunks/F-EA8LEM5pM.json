hello freak bitches everyone knows that the two-party systems kind of stupid but everyone seems to think that any other party other than the two-party system is unrealistic or any other party like a libertarian Green Party somewhere like anything independent is unrealistic well I'm back to right now fifty percent of all people that are registering to vote or are registering as independent statistically right now 43 percent of America is independent but new registrations 50 percent so I don't I don't know as the people do identify with the two parties the rigged game of the system is is that we're only presented with two choices and that really starts with just being in the polls look right now if Mickey Mouse were the third name in any poll Mickey would be polling at 30% but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50 states and if I'm the libertarian nominee and I hope to be the libertarian nominee that happens next weekend I'm gonna be the only other candidate on the ballot in all 50 states so polling I I just want to be in the polls there is no way a third party wins without being in the presidential debates that's just not gonna happen a Super Bowl of politics to get in the presidential debates you have to be at fifteen percent in the polls Joe the rigged game is is that if you're not in the polls there's no way that you can poll at fifteen percent but it has to be a consistent polling starting now I was in the first national poll that I've been in a month ago I haven't been in a national poll since but in a month a month ago I was at eleven percent against Hillary and Trump and was this all established back when Ross Perot sort of shook up the political establishment because that there was a lower percentage required to get involved in debates before that accent well actually there was no percentage points prior to Ross Perot that was something that got established after Ross Perot and what what is amazing to me is Ross Perot after having gotten nine 18% of the general election vote the first time the second time I ran they did not allow him in the presidential debates which is just I mean that's the rigged nature of the game the rig nature of the game is has come this fall if my name does not appear in another single poll the presidential debate Commission will say Matt Gary Johnson he just didn't poll high enough well they what they won't say is that he wasn't in the polls and the Commission for presidential debates is a privately funded institution private Democrats and Republicans we're suing the presidential debate commission also we think that it's antitrust we think that not think it's Democrats and Republicans and they collude with one another to exclude everyone else Bruce Fein is suing the presidential debate Commission Bruce fines claim to fame is that he brought Nixon down in Watergate but in the next sentence he will tell you that the biggest thing he's ever done in his life is suing the presidential debate commission because this has the opportunity of changing politics in America I mean this is really at the heart of this rigged game you can't win the presidency if you're not in the Super Bowl of politics we've we figure the dollar value alone of being in the presidential debates is several hundred million dollars just think of the Super Bowl and the ads that sell during the Super Bowl and imagine being having all second biggest audience you know like 75 million people for you know 90 minutes two hours that's that's a couple hundred million dollars worth of advertising yeah that is the show and if you're not in the show people don't consider your vote like they think of even if you have 50% of these people that are registering and saying they're independent what they're really saying is they're not committing to a left or a right they're not committing to a democratic or republican but are they going to vote independent that's a lot of people they have this idea that if you vote independent you're throwing away your vote that's that is a statement that has to be overcome right no no I I agree but but for those people that they do vote right and they end up voting on the basis of the lesser of two evils but yeah since they're registering to vote and they're registering to vote is independent they end up at the polls I mean for the most part most but most people don't even go to the polls most people don't even vote yeah it's it's is there a way to fix it do you think that there's a way to maybe somehow or another hat allow people to vote online and and change the way it's set up now we don't have to physically go to a location you don't have to sign up physically in a place you can actually just do it from your computer the same way we Bank that has to be the future that does not exist now but that has to be the future and from a legislative standpoint meaning okay your president United States or governor of New Mexico you could sign legislation that and and these are the things that are gonna happen it's gonna be easier and easier to vote and that's what should be the case which should be the case if the system isn't totally rigged because the problem is people like Hillary the people that are the longtime establishment people that have been a part of politics forever the last thing they want to do is turn over the reins to the internet because she's had how much they send they say they were spending spending over a million dollars just to combat online trolls just to go on reddit and forums and correct people yes and I would I would be surprised if the number was that low yeah I would be surprised too yeah yeah I think they're probably being pretty conservative about that but the idea is that the internet doesn't like the establishment they know that there's a real problem with assist the system in place as is and the internet when I say the Internet into the the broad-stroke that you're painting is obviously young people are a little bit more aware of how screwy this whole system that they're sort of born into is and that the people that are in charge don't want to change it they want to keep it a two-party system they want to keep this silly white hat black hat goofy game going on forever and keep control of the power right on and this but this cycle for the first time in my lifetime this might change I mean this because of just how polarizing the two of them are yeah and I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot of people think of as the alternative right now mainstream alternative stands pretty far out there from the other guys so have you seen the website i side with dot-com no how are you gonna write it down you gotta take take this political quiz I sighed and everybody listening take this political quiz I sighed with calm it's about sixty questions it's really easy you don't have to you know no you don't have to sign up on the website but you take this quiz and at the end of the quiz you get paired up with the presidential candidate most in line with your views it just makes real sense I think everybody should take the quiz and whoever you line up with I think you should knock yourself out supporting that person well for me taking I side with quiz amazingly the next politician that I aligned with outside of the libertarians that are running for president is Bernie Sanders I aligned with Bernie Sanders 73% of what he says now when it comes to economics we come to a tea in the road when it comes to socialism versus you know being an entrepreneur when it comes to big government versus small government we come to that tea in the road but on the issues of legalizing marijuana same-sex marriage a woman's right to choose hey let's stop with these military interventions this is just this is just crazy um we're in line mm-hmm so I I pushed this website because it should work the other way around okay I sided with Bernie most of the time but oh my gosh the libertarian candidate gary johnson i side with next in line and I do believe that Bernie is not gonna get the nomination I don't think that's gonna happen and where do all those voters go where does 50 percent of Republicans go that really are at the end of the day you know socially tolerant and fiscally conservative and I think that is the majority of Republican voters but they've been co-opted by the social conservatives that have an agenda that I think is really a turn-off to most of America and it's okay to be a social conservative there's nothing wrong with being a social conservative but if you if you acquire if you make that public policy if you pass laws regarding social conservatism you end up putting people in jail for personal choices and we do have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world and I think that starts with the drug war the word conservative is interesting too when you apply it to social issues like social conservativism because conservatives really want the original conservatives were stay out of my business I'll stay out of yours so social conservative really wouldn't apply to like things along the lines of gay marriage or same-sex unions or anything long as you would you'd say we'll leave those people alone that would be the conservative approach that government should stay out of those people's lives right well it started out as classical liberal if you classical liberal is being fiscally conservative and socially liberal which got co-opted I mean that not used to be what a conservative was and that got co-opted and like I said I think we're a little bit of both you've heard the old adage that if in college you weren't a Democrat you didn't have a heart and if as an adult you weren't a Republican you didn't have a brain I think we've got both all of us have got both of those things yeah it's just real polarizing to have only two choices well and it's plan is so polarizing because those issues at the at the end of the day why can't Democrats and Republicans come together on some very common-sense issues that would move the country forward
