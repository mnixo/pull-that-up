the Joe Rogan experience what's it like hanging out with those guys listen Joe when I went in there I told myself ain't talking to nobody all right I'm gonna speak when spoken to yeah there was a part one they were kind of lighting DeNiro and I and we're standing face to face and he's looking at me and I'm looking right at him and I'm I wasn't gonna say nothing and then he comes in on my my tiny tiny knees everything a little bit and he cinched my thigh Wow straightened out my so yeah I had a wig they put me in a wig what kind of wig look like actually there's their third that if you if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco Irishman that it should pop up yeah there is what is the difference between oh yeah it's I'm so confused why they give you a wig it's got sideburns I mean if you if you see it in person you'll understand maybe why I got the yeah it's not that much of a departure from from my my real hair but did they give you the option to grow in sideburns and you like get the fuck out of you know they just said again I dad I didn't say nothing they said you're gonna wear a wig no no problem whatever you want me to do Scorsese was like um okay um there's a part where I'm gonna go through a window and he's like okay when you go through the window and I'm like oh I'm going through a window cuz I knew there was a stunt guy involved right but he's telling me that I'm gonna go through the window and I wasn't gonna say I don't do windows right to a window yeah I'm not gonna tell Martin Scorsese I'm sorry I need a stunt guy right um but then they said hey Marty there's a stunt guy here he goes oh okay so I was ready to go through the window I can't wear necklaces man I did it bugs me did you ever wear necklaces they wore necklaces sure yeah it's never been a staple but it's uh it's it's a weird thing first of all if it's if it's big enough it's like this target right if you have like a BHEL gold necklace people want to steal it all right a lot of necklace natural out there Brian oh if you know yeah but then the other thing is uh what are you doing we don't that big ol shiny thing around your neck we doing what are you a chick remember in the 90s chokers were a thing and I used to wear a choker how gross is that like a dog choker just a really tight necklace yeah hemp necklaces oh yeah those are the little bead yeah the bead at the bottom the beads critical gotta have the bead yeah multi-coloured bead thing over you're cool yeah like it's weird like with like some guys will wear like little anklets with like beads and they tie them off and they'll walk around barefoot you're like okay huh what's kind of like that look that you're not the shop look where you have like the really tight like your pants to go up so you can see your socks you know you show a little leg you know why they do that why sneakers those guys show off the sneakers up full that's what Shaab told me do you do that Jamie that's fun that's how the pants are made that's why you don't buy to this pants man then you're not buying pants and we're doing it by your ears lady's store do you bought you buy it at coached buy those pants Aikido gosh that's hilarious you don't do that to you no how dare you how dare you little weird so I have to ask you this tom talk about UFOs all the time but you know he's not in the band yeah I know but do you always do that he always did we used to get loaded and just look out the bus window yeah and I used to do it with him as like I don't know it's kind of a bonding experience it's like uh if you wanted to show me bow and arrows whatever we're on tour together and like you know check it out so with Tom that was his thing like fucking let's get high and look for UFOs so he would you know we just sit there and like stare out the bus window look at UFOs or like he would even go as far as when we're on tour like let's go and fucking look for Bigfoot whatever you know and he would assemble a crew and they would go do it oh my god never got me on one of those trips cuz I was just to fairytale for me but yeah but I would you know I'd do that and he was always it's really not something he just got into from day I fuckin met him he was obsessed with UFOs and aliens and was always very passionate about it to the point where like I didn't know enough to to have any kind of I guess like opinion on it I was just very open and and you know just took it all in yeah but nothing has changed he's still the other day I talk to him he's like I'm on the way to the fucking White House bro and I don't ask any questions I drag as you should be what a great response yeah good luck with that yep Wow long story short he goes okay you can go but you have to take this blessing and we're like sure well whatever you need for us to go so he pulls out the snail shell I could show you a picture of it it's a snail shell with a monkey bone in the top and a tube worm to close it and in the snail shell is this green powder and he's like this is what you need for the blessing so he goes around the circle and threw a monkey bone pipe he blows this green stuff in your nose they're called a coup hey not nothing like that word that we heard I couldn't the name of the pipe no no the stuff they blow up your nose is it DMT it's coca leaf Oh mixed with a bunch of a root and tobacco I believe like all together and anyway so he goes there's five of us in my crew he goes around the circle and he hits three guys and they all go oh my brain feels like I've got chlorine on the head you know whatever loads it into your nose yeah so it gets really close it's got this long tubular monkey bone pipe and it goes and it just blows it up into your nose and hits three of my guys and I'm watching a little bit nervous cuz like I'm very like standoffish on drugs like I I know things affect me very strangely anyway hits three of my guys they go wolf you know eyes watering and they're like wow it's a it's actually a great feeling gets to my turn in the nose all of a sudden I feel like I've got acid on my brain like chlorine in my head I break into the sweat my eyes explode and I'm like wobbling like this and it 30 seconds later I'm just curled over in the fetal position just projectile vomiting cannot hold it together and Lorenzo this the the tribal shaman goes good good and we're like why is this good and he's like he had a bad spirit in him if he had gone up the river he would have been killed he's just got the bad spirit out this is why I had to bless you now you can go and I was the only one that it hit like that out of our five person crew everybody else was like my brain sore whatever I was literally fetal position feverish puking crate and I've never done any drugs like hard drugs like it's just not my thing and this thing just hit me like a ton of brick but so the Liam Neeson thing and you know forgive me if I if there's some detail that has come out that I'm not aware of but my understanding of it is he you know he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind this murderous state of mind he was in where he was walking around with the he calls it a cosh and that's the British word for like a it's like a small metal club right like a blackjack or like the another term for it I think and looking for a black guy to kill you know like doesn't hoping someone's gonna come out of the woodwork and threaten him so that he could you know kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because his friend had been raped by a black guy right so it's like any black guy will do now that's that's sort of like the the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now and he's confessing this as a kind of a symptom of transient mental illness at least as far as I know it's like he's horrified by the fact that he was in this state of mind right can you imagine like I know Liam Neeson an actor I have everything to lose and although I don't remember what at what point in his life he he said this happened can you imagine that I was in the state of mind right and this is as you say it an all too honest disclosure but it is damn interesting right and it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about right and it's not and the fact that this is becoming synonymous with racism seems just wrong given given how he's did he described her at least how I've heard this because he's saying listen if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or a Japanese guy I'd be looking for one of them right I mean what what what this was at least on his telling is the the virus of instrumental violence I mean the virus of like this is how every blood feud ever in human history gets start is like you like someone from your tribe killed my brother and now what I want to do is kill anyone from your tribe right doesn't matter who you and and that's you know clearly as toxic as it gets you know ethically but that's not racism right that's just that is that we have a word for it it's in its instrumental violence but you know yeah obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this but we need we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves once something this unsavory is is revealed about their past whether they reveal it or whether it's just you know found out about what people don't seem to realize when it comes to history is that when you read about World War two we've condensed all the highlights into a very short paragraph or a series of paragraphs you don't realize the war with several years there were periods where nothing happened right I was in Egypt during the second revolution you could look down and you could see Tahrir Square people screaming laser pointers helicopters Apaches and they announced in the news we have just we've to pose the president two blocks away a dude's eating a cheeseburger McDonald's watching a football match as if nothing's happening so when you look at these street battles the political violence when you look at the the biased bannings you look at the dude there was a guy who fired a couple rounds at a police officer in Eugene Oregon and some bombs got planted at the police department or somebody planted bombs at a statue in Houston it starts to feel like there's some kind of political violence that is bubbling up that can't be mended at this point well and a lot of this comes from this suppression that we're talking about what people don't feel like they have a voice or that voice is being suppressed by an opposing ideology you know yes but it is really complicated and it's it's I can't claim to know how everything happens but what I will say is I believe social media is responsible for the political violence I believe it's it's not just about suppression it's you look at this systems that were built Facebook right what content can make it to the front page of your Facebook poke of your Facebook profile when you're looking at your newsfeed well Twitter Facebook has to build an algorithm to determine what matters most companies then figure out how to manipulate that algorithm to get that content in front of you because you know at most you can see what three posts on Facebook so what happens is early on companies quickly found out that anger drives the most shares of any emotion all of a sudden we see a wave of police brutality videos yeah there was one website that posted almost exclusively police brutality content and it was like Alexa 400 in the world some ridiculously high number it blew my mind I know P someone claims to that they were making six figures writing police brutality articles because it was pure rage bait right you know content that just shares really easily but that content constantly being put in front of somebody breeds an ideology you then tell someone did you know that you know white supremacy is on the rise and there are 11 million white supremacists in the US and they go I can believe it but that's nonsense it's just not it's not the case you know the anti-defamation league in the SPLC say that at rough estimates are maybe like 10 or 12 thousand but people really believe that there is like that the president is secretly a Nazi and that he's being propped up by the secret cabal or there's an alternative influence network on YouTube where you and me are somehow trying to convince people to you know this is ridiculous [Applause]
