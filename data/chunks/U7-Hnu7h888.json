the Joe Rogan experience and I think a lot of it comes down to that we shouldn't sort of protest what we shouldn't agree with but we should build the things we should build a future that we do agree with so when you look at the past few hundred years of modernity in our civilization what we see is dramatic positive trends in terms of health wealth education violence I mean it Steven Pinker on your show so I think that's really really positive trends and we've done a good job in that and that all comes down to our ability to sort of imagine things that don't exist yet so sort of technology and innovation and being able to work work together in an effective way which is think about the corporation so so I think those have been a sort of very good trends and I think what we should do is we should also think about how to apply those to the area outside of our own species and to the rest of the environment because when you look at all those positive trends over the past few hundred years and then you know that that's so good but there's one very big exception which is the impact to the environment it's almost like we've had all the success at the cost of the environment and but I think that instead of there are some people that have sort of a more reactionary feel to this and they say well look at all these problems that was created by businesses and by technology so we should stay as far away from those things as possible and I think that's sort of you know that's sort of stupid I think that it really just shows that these are very powerful ways of getting things done and I think a much more effective way was to apply that what has worked in other areas and then also apply that to the area of the environment so so I don't think you know I for example think that the car problem is not going to be solved by banning cars I think it's going to be solved by electric cars and I don't think the the meat pollution problem is going to be solved by everyone becoming vegan I think it's going to be solved by things like lab-grown meat and and other kind of alternatives so and that's why I also think that yeah the ocean cleanup or the plastic pollution problem is not going to be solved by sort of people trying to do their own little bit and you know trying to live without plastic or things like that I think is going to be solved by you know things like plastics that do not harm to the environment as well as technologies like the ocean clean up to sort of clean up after ourselves so yeah and I hope that the ocean can be sort of as some a symbol of that approach you had like one of the most spectacular fights with John Jones I mean down to the wire like is as close as it gets and when you get out of a fight like that will you almost won the title against the greatest of all time like what is what is that feeling like and where do you go from there you know it was tough it was really tough because you know everybody was saying are you winning this fight winning this fight you had three rounds against him are you winning this fight like if it felt like and like you said it was something it was just it was just right there at the goal line I you know I didn't really pass that go on line at all I just felt like that it was tough it was tough but but like now I'm sitting here now talking to you it's a big it's a really good experience for me and and you know really it's a good time for me the fight was well it's a highlight in my career for sure in my life for sure it was such a close fight when when the score cards are being tabbed and you you know you're just sitting there waiting for the decision did you think you had it you know I didn't know right I didn't know I did so much chaos could you even remember what had happened over the last five rounds I remember I remember I remember the I remember the fight and I got I remember almost at the whole fight but it was just John Jones is such a beast he's he you know I'm telling you just for me John Jones winning over John Jones is bigger than taking the belt I'm telling their guys the guys is such a beast and and yeah what was the question no it's okay be express yourself that's fine I mean I agree with you he is a beast we had a little chalkboard sign out front that said venison is the new kale and you know we get cute with our sign we tease other restaurants around us like we have fun with the sign and it's fun and this cyclists vegan rode by and took huge offense to our sign and all of a sudden one day these protesters just showed up so originally I was just kind of frustrated because they're totally misguided because we take a lot of pride and where our food comes from we have vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu and I really respect that type of diet so we were just totally floored with why this was happening and so this started to go on they'd started come every week and they went from like two or three people being kind of peaceful to being like 10 15 people not so peaceful so it's when it turned not so peaceful they were shouting at our guests and shouting in our door and really trying to harm our business that I just kind of got fed up last resort went down we get a whole deer a couple times a month and we we butchered ourselves and I just said screw it screw it I'm like I'm gonna get these people to get out of here so I thought that that would make them go away how did you think that was gonna make them go away not escalate it I don't know I was it was just totally like last resort totally fed up I wanted to defend myself defend our customers you know you could see people walking in visibly upset you know they're being shouted at being screamed at called a murderer as they're walking in for dinner like you're going on a date you want to use time and then people are screaming at you you know just for eating so I was just fed up and I just kind of thought like you know buzz off and why so just one sign what's in is the new kale one sign set this whole thing off yeah I had those abilities if I'm the kid growing up in this environment and I I can't find refuge in my school I can't find refuge at home because my mom's working three or four or five jobs so she's never there where am I gonna go find parent I'm gonna where am I gonna find that parent to influence you can find on the streets so now I'm on the streets being led by people who grew up in exact conditions that I grew up in and so now I'm like okay well I have to make money what am I gonna do for money well then there's the knock old economy very conveniently right there for me right so drugs so now I'm selling now I'm staying on a corner selling drugs I got to protect my product all right if I don't someone's gonna take it from me so what do I do I get a gun I carry a gun now I'm stuck in a situation and in this violent loop right that feeds on itself and so now I'm stuck defending myself against the guy who shooting at me trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting back at him maybe not because I'm trying to take his stuff but because he's trying to take mine all right so that's what you get that violence that comes from that from those particular areas now if we would've sat back and said okay we have hyper concentrated areas in this country this is a widespread it's hyper concentrated communities in this country that are dealing with this that are also the result of the vast majority of our gun violence if we sat back and thought about from social economic standpoint how do we fix this what do we do how do we present opportunity I'm not saying gonna just hand out stuff but how do we fix this from the standpoint of improving our schools how is I can draw five minutes one direction and have a school that has everything you can name and then drive in the drive in the opposite direction as cool as can barely have textbooks to give to the kids hmm think about that yeah so why why aren't we focusing our energy on building that up versus talking about oh we need to get the guns off the streets you did that you have that in Chicago you have every gun law imaginable in Chicago but yet South Chicago still looks the way that it does still has a violence that it does right so if we would if we provide I mean you give people something loose or to live for they don't throw away life so easily plain and simple so it's nice socioeconomic status is in the dirt I don't have a problem looking at another kid down the street and shooting at him taking his life I don't have anything I'll have anything to lose but if we were to focus our attention in fixing that same way we talked about the mental health issue with respect to mass shootings then school shootings we wouldn't have to worry about the guns because we won't have people wanting to do those things or have the capability to do those things right so then that deals with that vast majority of the violence that we had there focusing that energy in fixing those communities the point of the story was this Isis came around and people were suddenly like oh my god where did this come from of course those of us who had been monitoring the situation knew this was going to come back around very very heavy now that Isis have been pushed back and and this is where the stories sort of the point of the story is we've got to resist the temptation to believe the problem has been solved because the the organization known as Isis which is an bureaucracy has been fought back but the ideology upon which that organization was built is still very much alive and it's still strong um what al-qaeda did while the whole world was focused on Isis was exploit that opportunity to rebuild and regroup and they've been rebuilding in Syria now they are stronger than they have ever been even under bin Laden because for the first time in the history of that organization they are firmly embedded within the Syrian population as they genuinely kind of viewed by the people that they were fighting on behalf of as a grassroots resistance organization whereas before that they were seen as a terrorist group that was like a you know just like a vanguard they've embedded themselves in the Syrian population in the Yemeni Civil War they've embedded themselves in North Africa East Africa and in Pakistan and they are resurgent and they are grooming Hamza Bin Ladin who is Bernard in son and they're grooming him for leadership and a time will come maybe in a couple of months maybe in a couple of years where they announce Hamza bin Laden as a new leader of al-qaeda currently it's Ayman Zawahiri when they do that once their grooming has been complete and assuming hamza isn't killed up until then all of the fragments of what remains of isis will probably rejoin al qaeda under hamza bin Laden and you'll have a stronger than ever before al Qaeda organization and we've got to we've got to remember that we never expected Isis to emerge we'll come back with a vengeance [Applause]
