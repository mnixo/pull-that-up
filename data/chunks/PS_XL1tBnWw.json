the dragon's mouth and his thing five-four-three-two-one yes and we're live okay gentlemen hello we still have the ability to go live that's nice oh yeah mr. Rogers fuck Jim yeah mr. red it's the Bob Ross the state every woman over the age of 90 s dream yeah but this is what most of what you guys do in terms of like the Bob Ross thing in particular first of all that was that took a lot of balls because this is you you had Bob Ross painting Mohammed which is in period blood the second one because they BuzzFeed women we're doing a painting with YouTube this is actually actually after meeting with YouTube remember him how you can top something because well you should know you wish you know our student yeah but yeah we were Bob Ross estate got after you but but that's parody how can they mock you or how can they get you in trouble for mocking something or doing part here's why you have a system with YouTube right we're they just strike they just strike you and you lose your privileges whether you win or not we've never lost so the Bob Ross the state sent us a message right it was saying like first off have you no decency you know this isn't in accordance with is like you're supposed to be in accordance with Islamic law I'm doing good guy they thought that we didn't know there was a fence yeah they thought we didn't know like like we stumbled across this and so then we responded to the lawyers as Bob Ross once and welcome back to the joy of painting we're gonna draw our lawyer friends eating from a nice big pile of shit we painted them eating from a pile of corn infested shit and then at the end of the video really Anna looks like they need a friend and put Mohammed right next time in the pile and it hangs above our bathroom and we never heard from him again they sent us cease and desist and we we ran it past her Lloyd the shock may have killed me yeah so that's and now we have mr. Rogers now what is missus matter ah we did it Perry we did a few parodies of you know won't you be my neighbor intros how was it like a year ago but again how could someone put a strike on you for a parody I mean I thought that is protected well you know you get to the realm of parody and satire and it's but but even then it depends on who looks at it that's the problem you - right just someone last time got our privileges back this time we didn't like we're like listen we've never lost a case we've counter filed we've always won this is clearly parody the mr. Rogers was actually your brother you need a tractor so that we didn't borrow any like their their their logos their nothing nothing harms original yeah no here's what's fucked up you were telling me about a meeting that you guys had when you went to New York for YouTube yeah and they were comparing like but what is demonetised and what's not demonetised and they had something that would you just explain what happened it's least we don't exactly know because it's boilerplate answers right we get brought out a bunch of conservatives get brought out to new york who like who is worthy with you well us you know the deal why are people angry who are really cool you up in Shapiro's guys alert for word Publishing's and then a busty mostly and everyone sat there and played nice and they bring out this whole spread they bring into the Google offices give you two of the plays do they fly you or do they ask you to fly out and pay for other pay for the whole thing they over the whole thing put you up yeah goes this summer was it summer yeah think so sure no sex mother half asian lawyer bill came with us and they didn't know we just were like yeah he's our producer right next to the whole thing moto like number one lawyer in the state and hilarious really funny guy so we go out there we're just sitting there kind of listening and they're just saying nothing and finally I said well you know what's happening with D monetization what's happening with obviously we're all conservatives here everyone we've had our videos put in restricted mode what are the guidelines we don't know and they wouldn't it like that's a very good question and they look to the back as if there wasn't the obvious that later in the day elephant in the room is if it wasn't obvious that's right that's why everyone's there and that's what happened that's was the period blood like well you know things that are hate speech things that could be offensive things that current events it can be controversial and so everyone's a player yeah but I just said or I said what about what about BuzzFeed women painting in period blood in the trending feed painting like yeah last week and visca see chunky period blood on the home fee that's an YouTube training what about that is that considered like child friendly and conservatives were than they're looking back as like we were ruining the movie I'm like yeah why are we here you know that's a problem people don't say anything well that is a very valid discussion that's valid like what if you can't I mean if you can paint in period blood and I don't you should be restricted I think if you want a pain period blood as long as I know what you're doing it says painting a period that well title if it was in the tested feet well I might actually watch it but here's a these women I might I might just for this the boldly channel but the point is like I don't I don't want to take that right away from them I just I'm confused by what what is okay what's not okay you can't they emboldened the right if you silence them you emboldened the left if you silenced them you write bold in people when you said you you give them power you you you make the whole thing bigger than it has to be yeah people are allowed to have differences of opinions and they're allowed to have different ideologies but when you have a platform where you radically restrict one ideology and you openly support another one yeah you're picking aside well yes colleague Dinesh D'Souza talks about is that about the laws is is it applied equally right well that you doesn't even respect the laws here's something can happen with YouTube just give an example people have to love you don't know this so there's you know single party consent state to party consent state California's one of the few states where yep both people have to know they're on camera now even sometimes in a two-party consent state there's no reasonable expectation of privacy if you're to public event right if you're the public protest you can't say hey you can't take my picture you're there publicly protesting right so these are legal layers right we had someone in a single party consent state in Michigan on camera at a public protest sign or release to give an interview and then complain to YouTube and said I don't want to be in that video it didn't matter that we presented the law the paperwork to YouTube it was taking it we had to blur the face but didn't look that was was it under false pretenses like did they think that you were doing one thing and you're really doing something else no the crazy thing is this actually was a guy who read with us almost everything yeah he was talking about divestment it was pissed about well you know what he probably just got a lot of feedback and was like well this is freaking me out I want to get out of this yeah but as a content creator you came like well sorry I didn't like it right yeah we don't know I mean you can understand like his perspective like him trying to get it take it down if you're a general public person and you don't know what the fuck you're doing you say something you don't put a leonard on him he realized later he was raped it was much later yes actively taking down Elena now we can say when you when you pointed out the whole period blood thing painting in period blood what dead silence no one said anything did not respond to you I could have to you know then laters that's a good question we'll get to that later in the day so late in the day was when they came up with this next gen news and we were like I got to explain this cuz he explained it to me earlier well I was like the problem is right we have to be careful because otherwise they'll take it out of context so then they this is a new portion of the day this whole YouTube conference bringing out conservatives and you know that the salmon pot a plate which I don't think there's anything grosser he was eating pasted fish in the car no way here it's quick delicious so I think it was at next gen news her evolution I always get it wrong whatever I think it is is the opposite side I think it's next ship look what's going on our lawyers would completely educate against written we're giving such specificity so this is the exact channel it's like hip-hop and sneakers you know like sneaker haul with whatever the guy from the show blackish anthony whatever that kind of stuff so it's a lot of hip-hop news they come out teach us how to do news and they also before we show you know someone so from Shenmue is a civil real and every other word is the n-word mf'er and you could see them looking back and they turn it down because what the whole channel is they didn't screen that no they didn't screen it and she comes out and she's talking about news and how to create content the algorithm doing your audience is the content creator she's like okay complaining you're filming someone go move over do some you cruise I don't want content okay and then I just said yeah you know at this point they've been saying we're gonna get to news all day this is the first time someone's come out yeah question we just heard about the new guidelines and now she was to be advertiser friendly it's supposed to be family friendly consume that you deal with hip-hop and a lot of pretty pretty adult pretty profane content have you been hit by at the time was called the ad pocalypse I said have you been hit by this and she said no not at all I said okay no further questions that that's amazing so all of that stuff's fine it's fine it's just it's about the wrong opinion that's really what it comes down but is it fine because they're black black she wasn't black no she wasn't black she was a white girl I think she was black really yeah yeah well that's why colored me saying that I'm Irish because I've been talking about this like I am more Irish than a lot of people that call themselves black I'm one-quarter Irish three-quarters Italian but if you look at me I look mostly Italian but if I said I'm an Irish man people would be like wait a minute yeah are you really she was like amber copying Fitch black yeah she's generically ethnic okay later or a guy you know it would have no problems of him dating your daughter if you were kind of a racist didn't you like slide Tim date everybody but if she went to like a really fucking heavy-duty hip-hop place and start throwing that word around they would look at her like hey she even loud just say that can you go blurting out the n-word when you're that white I didn't know that she could do it with her sizzle reel well that seems like a bit of a problem right that's like one of those weird double standard role rules in terms of like the language like if you are in that community you're allowed to use what is otherwise extremely offensive language yeah sure it's like it's it's a you have a hood pass to use it but yeah II like the Platinum version yeah it's a really go all the way but especially on YouTube I mean I'm not saying there's anything wrong with using that language I had a conversation I told you about this that I had a conversation with this woman from YouTube and one of the things that we were talking about was D monetization and we were talking about like why things get flagged and I was talking about a conversation that got flagged on something Jaime what is it called when someone recommends something and they have it in their feed like their their preferred playlists like a regular person not a content creator but if they have it on on there you know you could do that you can have it in your channel like you could I think just like suggested playlists it's they're out yeah yeah so what it's called you would you would call it but not their algorithms like you would pick it like say if I watch one of your videos video on Bob Ross and I liked it what it in your queue is that what it is oh the queue yes okay so this guy got gosh I feel like I feel really stupid right now like none of us just got that one full we're all on YouTube to houses but so this guy got flagged and it was just a conversation between Sam Harris and some other guy was was a an intellectual and it was about left-wing culture and it was about left-wing radical you know ideology and they were criticizing it and this this got his channel flagged and I was like well how is this possible and she's like well he's advocating that people watch this and it must promote hate speech I'm like I fuckin guarantee you that doesn't promote hate speech right did you guys even watch it or does somebody else complain about it and flag it and then I brought up Jordan Peterson who by the way was just here just left and she said like he's a problem he's a bit of a problem he's a troublemaker I'm like he's a troublemaker I quit because he's has his own opinions on things like what is going on like what what are you guys promoting a very specific ideology and anyone who differs from that is hate speech cuz we're getting crazy if that's the case I think a lot of them don't know here it is oh is this it yeah Douglas Marie Haley I can see it over there Community Guidelines strike for just listening to an honest intellectual conversation between Sam Harris and Douglas Murray who's the guy who got who got it take it down yeah the man's pee Trk CCX he's very bold yeah so this is a Community Guidelines strike for a come by the way I listened to that conversation between sam harris and doug murray douglas sorry Douglas there's nothing offensive about it it's just they're discussing thing well here's the thing is now we've scaled it backwards Eccles nothing even if there were something offensive in the actual video what that is and find out what the title of it is and if maybe there's some sort of a description does it say what does it say they're just as Sam Harris marine yeah I forget who Douglas maria's but click on him see if you can click on him strange death of your okay immigration identity Islam that's what it is so Douglas Murray is he is critical of the open border policy that you're seeing become very problematic in some parts of Europe and by the way which is funny because Sam Harris is against the wall yeah we got some Trump's wall so it's like that's just two people probably with differing opinions on that issue to some degree Sam Harris is a pretty noted critic of Islam but I think no - yeah but the I mean the immigration thing here he's more he's more open borders in the States than it got like that yes yeah well I think what he's essentially saying is they're they're talking about the very real issues that they're dealing with in Europe and amongst YouTube's eyes yeah I mean we played a video there they have Paris of some parts of Paris that immigrants have moved into and just fucking completely wrecked I mean I'm not anti immigration my grandparents for immigrants but I'm just saying that there's a real issue and this guy Douglas Murray was discussing this real issue with Sam Harris that got flagged and it got labeled as hate speech like well I had a fucking crazy man it's weird I had a friendly Dornan so he actually he's graduated like like a University of Michigan law really just a brilliant brilliant guy he's like it's a Pierrot kind of guy and he was one of the early early youtubers early adopters first other conservative on YouTube very analytical very very dry very smart and he did a video that was it was just called something like the Japanese were not the victims in World War two and it was a video about the atrocities I think the Japanese committed against the Chinese it was like The Rape of Nanking we didn't get yes but he didn't get super graphic but he's basically talking about like people just look back and I look at her Oshima but let's actually look at the aspirations of the Japanese Empire historical it was removed as hate speech and here's the thing he came to me and because we had those contacts directly at YouTube we were they immediately apologized and fixed it but what worries me is well what if you don't have a million plus subscribers right you know what if I weren't there for him and that's the one thing that I always get worried about with with comedy and was a lot of entertainers is they they kind of pave a path and sometimes these guys I close the door behind him like well it was okay for me to say it but now this is that's really we've learned about it we say well hold on a second we're in the boat where you were you know yeah well and there's a lot of famine thinking going on in that regard where people automatically want to protect what they have and get nervous about it and they forget what got them there in the first place right what makes any of us popular is the ability to express yourself online in a way that resonates with other people that are listening now as soon as you restrict that as soon as you change that and say well you know I just want to do real good and I'm making a lot of money now I'm just trying to change who I am you're fucked you're fucked you're just fucked I would take it a step further c'est authenticity people like you because you're authentic yeah I think we're pretty authentic with what we do with the show I mean we're pretty straightforward people come up and they meet us at shows and they're like wow it feels like a right you can't you can't be authentic and play by YouTube's rules unless you completely agree with them so just have to agree with them you have to be authentically willing to that's all thing there's no authenticity it's like regardless of the rules that they claim which are so ambiguous in practice there's no way to make it work well I think this is indicative of the ideology that radiates throughout Silicon Valley which is radical left progressive neo-marxist sort of ideology and there's so much of that going on throughout Silicon Valley so much in the tech community so much uber progressive thinking which you know look I think all of it comes from the right place I think they all want no racism you know they want no hate speech they all want wonderful things but you can't just decide arbitrarily what is and isn't based on your perspective you you you have to look at it you have to look at it honestly yeah you know and I don't think they're doing that I think when you look at that Douglas Murray Sam Harris thing and the guy getting a community strike for just liking it I mean this is crazy this is they did take an authoritarian approach to solving the whole thing which yes and then they refused to accept the results which is the Donald Trump presidency and right I think they've created so well in their defense one of the things that it did say to me that the problem that usually will yes beauty people the problem what they're dealing with is blunt tools they're saying these tools that D monetize things they're not good yet and she said within the next six to eight months they're going to get better oh she working on them I don't know but let me let me just express her perspective she was saying that they have made significant strides since they first started doing it and they're getting better at it they're getting better at isolating and one of the things we discussed is those fucking creepy cartoons yeah I'm sure you've seen know you had a child molestation stuff well the violent stuff a lot of it like babies getting hit yeah yeah for years no I watch good things nice moms you know we're talking about I've heard I've never seen no yeah well it's a weird thing where these things get put on a kid's playlist you know it's like Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse getting drunk and then like someone throws a bottle up in the air and it hits a baby in the head and there's blood everywhere and these same patterns are repeated over and over again and hundreds of these videos maybe thousands a lot of them have been removed from YouTube right they've been pretty proactive about Quentin Tarantino making cartoons it's fucked up cui Roth found a weirder playlist of like this guy dissecting candy and making weird voices over it then there's a whole list of videos of people saying like what the fuck is this Channel what's going on here and it just got bigger and bigger and bigger and I don't think anything's a it's just weird shits really YouTube dancing there is a different than YouTube kids thing no I think yeah the kid thing though is more fucked up because it's always the same pattern it's like these kids get together with a parent the parents give the kids booze the kids get drunk they throw bottles that baby gets hit in the head with a bottle there's blood everywhere it's like the same thing over and over and over again there's been all these videos exposing these videos like people that are analyzing and saying what the fuck is this yeah and it seems to be foreign they seem to be done in other countries and essentially what they're doing is they're tapping into this they have a like a pattern that they use they're tapping into whatever algorithm that you know creates you're coming up next these adjusted yes so a little kid could be watching like a real Donald Duck cartoon and then it leads into this yeah I don't think that's what anyone's really complaining about I think we can all find common ground like let's get rid of the Minnie Mouse being raped on YouTube yeah but the problem is I understand her perspective and that's what they told us too almost a year ago but I even asked them I said hold on a second you just wined and dined us and you showed us your whole virtual reality set no yeah yeah and you we're the most advanced no that's why YouTube wants to be at the forefront of policy you know they're really aggressively on this net neutrality thing everything Google really big policy walks really big lobbyists if you look at them but they go so okay you're super advanced most technologically advanced company in the world but it's our channels is a real life one that's kind of the same same kind of shit but these aren't as offensive to me as the cartoon ones get this gets we're world it's like a 15-minute weird video just weird stuff happening that kids are supposed to watch this too they stumble across it because the algorithm you know if they're watching a tune with spider-man in it this shows up next oh did she get drunk and he rapes her as often I don't know it's just getting tied up a second ago that's a really shitty spider-man I wouldn't be fooled yes that wouldn't make it past our wardrobe anyway alright but the point is he can't claim you're the most advanced you know tech company in the world and then on our channel you're you're getting ads for Muslim singles and gay cruises come on a second your algorithm figure out it is pretty funny but we're not getting any money from those ads like you can't find that means that if our videos are controversial right our videos are not a violation of guidelines there are sponsors out there I mean we see with Walter you know a firearm company came to spawn so they seek us out because it's worth octuple to them because they want to reach our audience right whereas YouTube says well no it's not advertiser friendly no no it's not advertiser friendly for the people you have on there it's not gay cruise advertiser friendly but you're telling me you have the most advanced algorithms in the world and you're running ads for Young Turks on my video yeah I think just add somebody might do that on purpose I yeah when you when you went to that one conference and you went as him yeah disappointing I would have thought that was hilarious for him I mean first of all was disappointing there was only 20 people in there I wouldn't even gone I'd have been like look let's take this to a smaller place cuz if video gets out of this this is fuckin impaired it's his twenty people in this one right now and then you walked in as him I didn't want to do it right like he had called me out and this we've had people even on this wish of course he wanted to do it that's why you know he knows I didn't want to do it I was like but I feel like I have to because he called me out and I said I accept you know basically okay let's head and then I called you out how so he was constantly talking trash I mean those doofen Crothers so still comedian bullshit you a whole thing so it's like okay I responded I'm like let's hash this out he will mention he will rebut every time they can Harry on YouTube not named steven crowder so at this point I was just trying to get an interview so we've had people on our show we disagree with we do it an hour long changed my mind where I sit down and listen to someone scream at me more than willing the video you did though were you drinking the bacon grease and you did funny come on man it's fucking funny it made me laugh but the point is he forced my hand but I had to do it like he it's like that guy in diner has to punch all the people who ganged up on on a baseball diamond throughout the like that sounds like well now I have to do this with Schenk because there's no other recourse and he kept going to the audience the only reason we showed the audience like YouTube there's no other recourse he's like you have to go to trainee Bane right like you so it's like at this point you brought up the audience let's do a pan you know there's 20 people like I don't want to go up and embarrass the guy but he's such just such an asshole you know there's just no way around it so we kind of retired that character the character was funny when you're drinking the bacon grease that's not sure we brought it back this week and I know that's right I've nothing but pleasant dealings with jank nothing but I don't have any hate for the guy yeah but I laughed because a handshake with him it was a wonderful moment was it yeah it's very good yeah I just think like most people they get embroiled in conflict and then they lose perspective and then it builds up and then it becomes something stupid and I think you know his thing with Alex Jones is handled very poorly and they start screaming to each other and Anna called him a fat fuck damn you can't do that like you guys against everything you guys stand for you're calling him a fat fuck you can't just body shame him meanwhile Jencks fatter this is fucking crazy yeah like what are you doing yeah well Chang's put him on that's a I don't think he realizes that yet I don't think he's at the point where realizes that he's you know he's bigger than Alex oh really I don't maybe he's lying to himself I know I don't want to speculate on how he looks myself in the mirror and what he tells himself in the morning to get to it like he said my dealings with Janke have been nothing but Pleasant I like talking to him I had him on the podcast I liked talking to him I just think people lose their place they lose theirs they lose their there their view of the world well I think when your identity is entirely tied up in the numbers right when it's entirely tied up his only defense was look at the audience it's like you're on a second that that ebbs and flows I mean you know even I mean you guys have been having a good crazy successful show but some shows are more popular than others of course and for them they you know this far left it was sort of I guess progressive viewpoint and they've gotten increasingly worse is not popular and when that's your only argument when that's your whole identities a very short time between that and when the pendulum swings though it's even even the when you debated ben ben shapiro yeah that was the the audience the year before was him indonesia and people were clapping for him and then when he was sitting in with ban it didn't work well the Dinesh won he had that ace in the hole like that card like you went to prison is a fucking tough card to get by it's pretty funny it is funny it's funny to picture de nition prison I'm friends with it you know well I felt like the Sam Harris one was a big downfall for him Sam just handled it better you know when they were in had that long three-hour conversation in a three-hour conversation with someone you know it's hard to hide it's it's like your ideas get exposed your lack of knowledge gets exposed well that that's what the left doesn't do it and I know people's why well okay we do a segment we're the big biggest success for us this year that we're really grateful for is the change my mind sent it and that's just right I literally sit down we put up a booth it says I'm pro-gun change my mind I'm pro-life change my mind or there are only two genders yeah it's wildly unpopular here in the wrong spots I can tell you where to go yeah and we had one that was like an hour long thing on abortion one that was an out just at SMU five people just lined up and I just listened to them and out of the five people two of them changed their mind and then some of them we didn't find come it's completely unedited and everyone when I worked at Fox News everyone in cable news would have told you this would not work and no one's gonna watch an hour-long discussion right but there's no one on the left who does that well they can't do it in their format they can't do it when they have an eight to ten slot or an eight to nine slot and there's every 15 minutes you have to shams and --which in a commercial and then you have all these segments to play they can't do it but that's just because their format sucks like it's an art it's an antiquated form of entertainment it just doesn't work anymore but even the left's on YouTube like The Young Turks they don't do that the unedited is long-form good record shows are there on YouTube what what are they like really popular ones I don't know I don't know they're really mean sam cedars show right the majority report is he to fuck that up I called the Minority Report once that's easy that's easy to do yeah they think I did it on purpose are they mad they thought you were doing like the conservative talk show thing where you're like now that Demma dumbs democrats I don't do that no I think they also called me right-wing to which all right pick up one of the things they were saying was that people just decide like that these people that we decide to help each other out that the right supports themselves and they support like other right-wing people but the left needs to figure out how to do that I'm like fucking have anybody on yeah I have left-wing people on all the time I have libertarians and although I have people that are completely neutral to politics on all the time I just think when you box yourself into these ideologies when you're only Pro left and you can't see any perspective outside of that it becomes an issue just it's gonna be an issue for you today after a double feature of Jordan Peterson and oz they're probably I really don't I mean Jordan Peterson knew it when I was when I was doing this first of all Jordan Peterson you know I'll have that guy on anytime you know he's one of my favorite people to talk to her just a fascinating guy but I knew that Kevin do you two back-to-back it's like oh it's the fucking all right so much it's just embracing it what do you know - no but you're definitely well I wanted to talk to you guys about is some of my favorite stuff that you've done and so my favorite stuff you've done is the undercover shit and one of the things that I found the most disturbing was when you two posed as a gay couple and you went to that place where they were advocating transgender children and transitioning children as young as three years old right well it was three years old but puberty blockers yeah they were talking yeah but I think it was really fucking yeah no no no you know what actually three years old was owned Benjamin gotten an argument on Twitter and lost his manager because he was saying that someone is fucking insane for giving puberty blockers to a three-year-old kid for giving hormone blockers to a baby yeah which I am fuck yeah that's not even a strong enough word I mean it's insanity fucking insanity I mean your your body's not even developed you're not even close we're not talking about 18 we're not even talking about 21 which is argue crazy like you really try waiting to your fucking frontal cortex fully developed you figure out who you are but the idea that you're gonna know at 3 who are you gonna be when you're 30 well they present the other side bananas they act as though you're crazy no they were like well you know the things with the puberty where that person looked likes me whether look likes me from hook let's play anyway some of it because it's it's fucking nuts when I watched it I was like oh my god like what are these people saying and it's been taken down since you asked me about that - really yeah we have to set the blurt the guy well I'm not afraid who drags do not dress but dr. Rex but who shows up in price rain and his rigs but that is cajun arias kid you not real world we're in a goddamn simulation with the town hall we're in a simulation this can't be real a guy his name is Rex but and he got you you know you to back your life son okay let's play some of this and if there's for most of the people are listening rather than watching so in turn so what was this okay it was will knock a Jared and I so we here's one let me can I preface this with something guess we don't like we're not undercover journalist we do a late night show that we do we do copy does Moloch would you joke sketches and we do interviews and then every now and then we stumble across something and when you're doing for example I can to fun they hand you a knife and they talk about shooting been talking about that too but the point is and then when the media just lies about it like we feel compelled to this isn't our thing right just this is what this particular one was , throw away the throat we were joking okay bother the costumes we just walked in cyber queer it was what the healthcare transgender town hall was like oh my exact transgender town hall transgender town where wasn't it Vermont Burlington Vermont that place is crazy oh I wasn't a plane with Bernie Sanders on the way there to it was give me your money I'm gonna give it to the black let's play all right he has said that it feels like a girl her first playing with dolls and of course we don't want to discourage it we spoke with our primary care physician he said wait until the boys fully developed we made a little thing that's mean I would say a little the kid 18 to lists it was just like okay get rid of the poker Bernie blockers they just go through late puberty not so everything's still lined up there's no indication there's any day that's not true no QT blockers are not reversible that's the entire not the point Shia it's the top of it the young and someone at the pre adolescent age going into those adilyn it's gonna change the way your body develops no I mean there's no way giving a kid a puberty blocker letting them go through life with a puberty blocker and then it's 17 or whatever the fuck it is decide to take that shit off you're gonna be the exact same human being you would have been without you just same people worried about little estrogen in milk cartons free plastic because I don't want it to alter my hormones by the way I'm gonna chop off my balls and do puberty blockers at eight but this is I mean your kid you can't let a kid make those decisions you can't make those decisions for a kid they're too young kids remember he had a wiener five minutes ago yeah I was not thinking about these things no no just his nose in women the his booger off on the couch three minutes ago and now you're letting him decide is hormonal profile yeah the idea that a child who's six years old or whatever would know the consequences but them saying that 18 is too late and that it's not that they would disagree with your primary care physician that it's too young based on the research that I've done what fucking research have you done well you you can clearly point that it's a good idea to transition a six-year-old well yeah that's a problem here's another problem we don't know if the YouTube is gonna pay in this video because of what you just said TMT you this video is gonna get marked for D monetization well yeah the deed the Jordan Pederson one just got flagged and we talked about this book we talked about the 12 rules for I talked about guidelines for living a hell just reading it it's great book let's keep going officers play a little amorous to understand themselves and the testicle reads a particular dynamic diameter and the penis is developing up then they'll be enough if if if you're gonna check it you're gonna transition the other way it's really large we eat of the chest oh that's the problem you know jazz be a noble material of creative vagina if the testicles and the penis are developed enough did you know this did you know that unless your penis gets big enough you can't get a fake vagina because there's not enough tissue to invert so he's like this is him he's like now if you decide to go transition the other way meaning if you decide to not transition murder how everyone make fun of this uh the beauty pageant girl when she was asked about gay marriage she's like an and a gay marriage or opposite marriage and everyone laughed it was silly you know I mean she was conservative it was silly but he's doing that right here like should you choose to transition or transition the other way you mean should you choose to not cut off your penis that's transition the other way now not only that there's a lot of people in the transgender community to think it's offensive to assume that you have to get an operation get your penis removed in order to be transgender uh most of those guys making this big assumption that this is what you have to do in order to transition I know a lot of people that are transgender that do not have the operation I don't know a lot of people I should say community focus group with transgender people by the way - I'm a hundred percent in favor of grown adults deciding to transition I know I think you should that be able to tattoo your face get nose rings I don't give a fuck what you do I really don't you're also not asking the government to pay for your face tattoo yes that's true well and there was another thing here I'll send this to you Jamie that was some research today that someone put out here I'll let's play this and I'll forward this to you Jamie I'll text this to keep playing that's it okay I don't know but yeah I mean that was the thing is that's a good example it's a public town hall yeah which we attend and it gets removed from YouTube because someone who handed us his business card wrecks but this is hilarious by the way like we need the rest of us we weren't nearly as mad about this as we were just just just in in double laughter the guys named Rex you had trouble securing the URL rights to his own nation I just sent this to you Jamie if you follow the tweet it is by dr. Debra so and it is article from the National Institute of Health Study dr. zero van Meter a pediatric endocrinologist well she's anti all this they don't give any leeway to Asians like it's the minority group that they actually get more crap it's like well you're up you have to be better than everyone to get into a good college there's so many really good ones okay dr. Q van Meter a pediatric endocrinologist with extensive experience in gender dysphoria which by the way is hate speech says there is zero point zero evidence that the concepts of gender fluidity and gender identity have any scientific basis yeah so this is include zero point zero zero that's the second zero there she's money she's thinking about cash doesn't mean anything she's thinking about cash money well I guess you could have 0.01% you could have 100 you wanted to make sure there's no doubt yeah earning those extra characters you say like hate speech gender dysphoria still in the dsm-5 this is actual like the Psychiatric Journal and I look but they literally call it hate speech now yeah I know but it's the actual medical condition right what's crazing that undercover god-blessed my wife she went with us cuz we need other people to have hidden cameras and so she posed as a lesbian a movie kind of lesbian you're like really you exist she's a pretty not be fooled they wouldn't say anything well she remember said like i feei identify as someone with bigger breasts and she was asking how to get is covered under you know medicare medicaid cuz they're talking again all these operations and in mister recht god bless the regrets but the only straight I think we should mention that you know talk about that gender dysphoria so for her they use gender dysphoria to try and file it medically to get new tits on taxpayer dime but is considered hate speech to say it to the Trant and the transgenders in the room it's just crazy like you can't make sense of it but I don't need to make sense of it I just need to not be banned for this one would be the woman she was meant to be right well I mean anything that you can mock is bullshit I mean if you can mock at that openly if that's that obvious like getting getting bigger tits because you identify as someone with bigger tits I mean that's bullshit that's why it's so funny I've don't think I've ever been more in love with my wife someone who has bigger breasts well did you see that guy that got busted molesting children and said he identifies it being a six-year-old boy that was a really recent case I mean people are trying this out when they get caught doing things and I'm not saying that there's not people out there that identify with being a man when they're actually a woman or vice versa that's not what I'm saying but what I'm saying is there's a lot of fucking crazy people out there a lot and to deny that and just because it's dealing with gender you know you're you're in we're in Narnia now we're in la-la land you're you're you're not being real no well let me ask you this because you like you said you're you're not right-wing I'm pretty open about the fact that I'm right-wing I remember watching a show a while back and you had a little little guy little guy angel yeah little guy that used to be a gal yes exactly and then I don't know what I said but it's the same kind of conversation we have here like I don't just go and screw you you're training us and I just don't buy it and he wanted to get into a fight with me you wanted have a fight like what it was years ago when kind of a fresh shot of test jacked but you know what's huge at one time though was he yo ya got up to like 185 like super jacked cuz just bangin tests in there and they're fuckin lifting but he was saying that his joints hurt really bad when he was doing that it's almost like it's unnatural so raising but back then Aaron look at him on jacked jacked I had a role with that guy fuck be kind did you realize who's gonna get us insane like where do you think this is an interesting guest well he's a nice guy right you know I'm more than willing to call him a man and I was one of the things that I said I said look man you're a person I'm whatever your name is wits buck or Fred or Wilma I don't care I just whatever you want to be called I'll call you whatever noise that you connect with you as a being yeah I'm fine with that and if you can explain to me where you feel happier being a man I'm a hundred percent in support are you doing that what drives me crazy it's people making decisions for six-year-olds people pushing six-year-olds in certain directions and I know that this does happen and I just can't get too personal about this but I have a friend who has an ex-wife that turned his child into a girl yeah and like tried this and was was pushing this and kids are very fucking pliable man oh yeah this is this is not I mean maybe some boys would have rejected it maybe he was leaning that way anyway but she was excited about it and this is this is something that a lot of people are excited in we're talking about a fourteen-year-old I mean I just don't think you know who the fuck you are you know what does that cross name Ruby Rose it's her name the attractive lesbian with the tattoos she said that when she was young she wanted to transition and she's very happy that she didn't she wanted to become a man and she's very happy that she didn't and she's a lesbian and she's happy and she's open and super successful but she's advocating this sort of the same thing that I'm saying is like let people become a goddamn adult and then make these in inalterable life-changing decisions this guy saying that hormone blockers can be turned off and then you could go through a normal - Bertie you're out of your fucking mind I'm not a doctor but I have enough understanding of biology to know that that's crazy yeah that's just not true no it's absolutely not true and that's one of those things listen anyone can get lost in the weeds and make someone look stupid something specific you know whether it's it's I mean I you show me that compound bow out there it's fasting I don't know anything about it I'm gonna be a moron you know less than room temperature IQ some doctor can come in who's Pro transgender and explain something and make it sound like we don't know what we're talking about so when it comes to that see I don't the I don't agree with you there well I don't agree with he wants in terms we wouldn't know right as a matter what terms are there that you don't know about a child's biological development well they what they point to well actually there are these studies that show that the you know the the brain alterations occur before across hormone sucks replacement therapy and it's actually it's not true so we had a few transgender people on our show but the point is these whether it's a conspiracy or the say okay I'm not a doctor but I can't just appeal to Authority I can't just say this doctor says X so I do have to at this point accepting that I'm not a doctor except the preponderance of evidence from the overall medical community and combine that with the anecdotal and combine that with is there a motive here is there an agenda here like a lot of conspiracy theories and just doesn't add up because Apple who benefits from telling you you know the world is flat who benefits from it now I can understand how someone might benefit from a conspiracy was like oh they make a lot of money off of this or was it tim kennedy as a hunting Hitler thing I'm not saying it but it's like okay I understand after war they thought maybe they had Hitler and they needed the healing for the country okay I can understand that but with this there's there's it just doesn't add up none of the argument they present at upper millennial parents to whack off turning the age of their children to social experiments that was on Benjamin's take only Benjamin's take was that this guy in Hollywood I don't remember who it is who was talking about transitioning his three-year-old and he was like you're a fucking monster and he was getting in trouble for this he glossed his manager it's turn on our show cuz he writes for our show now we bring him in on skype and we just sit and we kind of you know brainstorm and he wasn't really out of the closet remember at that point I said oh and I don't think you want this cuz I'd lost my manager my agent I don't think you want this kind of conservative in the industry it's a real thing that's hilarious yeah I think you want this kind of heat and he talked about it on a show first and as always like he was fit bawling because because then he tweeted something that was really funny from the show and then this just all hell broke loose I was like I mean I told you that's what was going to happen and so now he's just full bore because he can't you know you can't put that back in the bottle mm-hmm and that's the crazy thing that Owen was the quintessential non-political just sort of happy-go-lucky comedian it's totally changed him now if you see his act oh yeah listen I know Owen kind of did that on this show yeah I mean that's one of the things that happened like well on this show we were just talking about all the various things and also he was talking about his dad being flamboyant and his mom being kind of masculine he grew up in this weird environment and you know he's just he's a great guy yeah I mean he's just this is his take on things you know and he loves to talk shit on Twitter he loves to stir things up yeah and he doesn't too much yeah I've sent him a text the other day I'm like you to go first of all why are your texts coming to me green I could just flip to us yeah yes I go dude like you're fucking crazy like which is great which most comedians are in some way crazy but I'm like you know just you're tweeting too much it's like you're right I gotta walk away from it me this whole thing about your transgenderism or something I'll be tweeting us reality from the left and progress and then I'll respond and then I don't hear anything back and like oh sorry I was out chopping trees yeah yeah his brother's an arborist and he helps his brother it means literally one fucking 20 feet up with the ropes and shit he shipped me maple syrup for Christmas did he yeah but one's a great guy the promise with Owen when we in the same room Jared someone else has to manage us because yeah I love them and I but that happened to him till we you and I have that conversation I just feel that this is so needs to do is do a podcast and get his you know just get his stuff out there more and he'll find his own audience he doesn't need all this other shit you know this is there's an illusion in Hollywood that you need to be cast in things you need to be cast a bowl and this castable thing and I've said this one of the reasons why I have no actor friends is because I have a couple and I'm friendly with but as my inner circle people are hanging around with on a regular basis of comics and fighters and just people that I know they deal in reality the actors are always trying to get cast in things and there's a dynamic that occurs when you're always trying to get cast in things where you never want to say anything that's controversial you don't want to have any opinions that don't fit into the standard acceptable digestible Hollywood dogma whatever it is and it's always left wing oh yeah look what happened with Tim Allen he came out his right wing and they cancelled his fucking shit fuck you and fuck your show he was a John Kasich guy yes I don't have to be alright John Kasich yeah as big of a pussy as the Republican Party as a moderate Republican but still right-wing enough for they're like fuck you just a weiner saying you just like to touch little boys like it just ruins your career it's disappointing here's a video about it what are you talking about house of cards pretty awesome that's oh he's a different animal that's a different animal I guess I didn't I never met him but I guess that has been saying about him forever yeah but here's the thing this is like what Milo talked about okay and this is this is all very taboo stuff but in the gay community it's far more acceptable for a man to be dating a 15 16 17 year-old boy that's openly gay right than it is in a straight community if the straight community if you find out that a 40 year old man is dating a 14 year old girl that guy is a that guy's a piece of shit he should be locked in a fucking cave right but if you find out that in the gay community it's it's not it's different strokes different I mean I can name you several people when we worked in Canadian TV particularly makeup artists who are like no no the careful Michelle likes them young it was a common thing right and I'm not at all saying that's acceptable no Kevin's face but what I am saying is what bothers me the semen with the me to campaign like Meryl Streep coming out everyone coming out with a Harvey when sinning sure right we all gern piece of crap get it we all know we're not but not one person okay they all come yeah you try to do that with me too not one person came out and said yeah I got three Oscars I did it bitch no one no one admitted no one just like no one else is saying yeah you know it's well-known Seeger this happens a lot in Hollywood there are a lot of guys with young 15 year old boys it's super common you go to the guy you go to the right bar yes well the Bryan Singer thing right right Bryan Singer there was photos of his party there's a pool filled with boys like literally and what's fucked up about is there's red lights in the pool and we we had a field day with it you could you could imagine where we imagined the blood came from but there's literally a red Oh filled with young hairless boys they weren't hiding it no that's the thing they didn't have to know it's fully accepted that's why the fake outrage bothers me I'm not I don't think it's a fake outrage I think selectively yes from the left in Hollywood not America yes America is outraged that Kevin Spacey step in fourteen-year-old voice well I think it wasn't just that I think what really got Kevin in trouble was not just the initial story but then that he was grabbing dicks on the set and he was just he would get there's the there's the red pool I mean come on son oh jeez I mean if that was a bunch of gals and you were maybe boldly painting them for YouTube this is all Wolverines next victims let's see what you guys look like was a casting party for the first class yeah but what Milo was saying when he was on the podcast which ultimately got him in a lot of trouble and lost his and and then also he's saying it on that other podcast that he did with the amazing atheist I forget what it whether they call their podcast you know that podcast I just know he got ins [Music] scoundrels or something like yeah Jamie will find it when he comes back from them oh he's just bolted to the bathroom but what he was saying essentially was that when you're a young boy and you're gay you can have a very positive relationship with an older man who acts as a mentor and that was extremely controversial and then ultimately cost him and he was also saying that he had that done to him on my podcast that's what he said that he was young he was molested but he said he goes please he goes I was a predator believe me I was a predator well you know someone hasn't done stand-up I don't know where that line is yes I mean like you know that if you were if you try working that out in the club and I believe me I was a predator the crowds gonna go from laughing - what yeah oh that's the line and I scale it back but he's 14 right if you're 14 and you're saying that you were the predator and you're the guy on stage you're not you're not the man who's talking about a fourteen-year-old boy that you want to fuck you're talking about you being 14 and loving the fact that a priest molested you and that you went after him I was a predator you know and when he was saying that it was there dude it's very off-putting tamiya she's beautiful she's wise she has an amazing smile what he what he does is a lot of it is stick and like it's sort of like a gonzo journalism type thing right like you don't know when where's the stick where's your real feelings on these things and then where is the distinction between how some heterosexual people look at this and some gay people look at this because I think that the spectrum is different like the spectrum of heterosexual people to think it's acceptable for a grown man have sex with a fourteen-year-old is fucking very small like insanely small backwoods yeah there's no straight NAMBLA with radical cloud exactly exactly you know there's no one has a NAMBLA bumper sticker but for it's not real anymore this is real thing yeah someone tried to say I was a member of NAMBLA one point on YouTube and suggest and feed nosing okay all right I don't think that one's gonna stick something and scale it back now it is now they're gonna reason everything we got to them that was the one what is that we meet on Tuesdays oh I always forget every now he's he's the Illuminati I heard yeah yeah yeah Elon Musk meet somebody has to show up secret it is here's one thing I will say so like this is why this is why people say your right wing okay this is I'm not saying you are so let me preface it but okay the reason they are no there is no leftist show after you say which left it shows they're not having this discussion it doesn't exist it does there is the wild progressive left and the people who get in line there is not enough of a contingency today put it this way James d'amour I let go for what he wrote on Google not a single person we asked at the YouTube conference had ever owned a gun or knew someone who owned a gun YouTube Google Facebook NBC ABC CNN CBS all of them none of them are standing up and having this conversation saying even the highly controversial issue of puberty blockers with with which most people disagree they just go puberty blockers a new topic of discussion they go the left can not have this conversation because you have to draw the line before puberty blockers you have to draw the line at how far do we have to play along with your delusion doesn't mean I don't like buck angel doesn't Blair whiten our YouTube Carol video and are very nice with her he's very against sexual purity blockers yeah very good and also untransformed in the nether regions Blair white yeah see that's what we were we were wanted to ask her boyfriend discuss this super cool dudes by the way seems like a nice guy seems like I get this but you're always asking is your asking questions you're not allowed to you're not allowed to can't you ask questions but as soon as as soon as they leave the room you're like okay well why can't you just ask well what the fuck man it's possible you're saying you used to be a man and now your woman gets all on the table now baby what what could possibly be offensive after that or more interesting talked about that sure well the reason is because my mom who did wardrobe for the Just for Laughs a lot of cadence that comes so she does wardrobe for us now as we've grown into these sketches and so Blair White was the ghost of Christmas past and this parody that we did and so my mom had to go in and do wardrobe and fitting so she had some questions grace comes back to me is like no I think she had that I don't think she has that anymore I'm like well wash because she said you know I did all this work I'm a good mom I could just mean you know she clearly has breasts and lips no no I don't I don't know but like no I don't know what the pants when we're tiny that's another hilarious character you do is that socialist french guy oh yeah you know Bernie's like we've had interviews with people did you meet Bernie you said you he's on the flight with you isn't a flight with me no here's a selfie with him I put on my socialism's for FIGS shirt in the bathroom here's what's so funny about Bernice and socialism for fakes figs it says figs because it got banned from Instagram if you know a little it's the Che Guevera thing anyway you'd see it you'll see it if you go to the store point is Bernie gets in a plane this is right after the debate with Ted Cruz the health care debate did not go well for him and he doesn't even have a briefcase so you know he's not doing work he's going from DC to Burlington Vermont and he is I swear to you I took a picture on the absolute last row of Economy Plus Plus where that first class curtain goes by probably ask for that because you know he can claim it like I don't fly first class like you're worth $5,000,000 Idleman sit there 128 gigabyte iPad pro saving all the money to deal with his wife's lawsuit for tanking that college in Vermont I know that college - yeah that story is fuckin crazy that it was a wild purchasing scheme that that tanked the college did they decided to expand the land and buy and they big tank the college because of that one picture that because it's America but what the fuck are you doing you're overspending baby this well it's fine so I put on the shirt and they're like you have to take a picture at this point I was wet I was like 12:30 in the morning I was annoyed at Burlington Trinity Hall and so I get off the plane and Marina gets off the plane first priority plus plus plus but didn't get the free cocktail my house he get off the plane first then after first class first class then him he gives he's plane second back no no first class and then he's economy plus plus plus right be right on this Court sits at first class first class everything but name only and you know he says that every debate unlike my polo I don't suit in first class all right Bernie so he gets out first and I walk behind him and it was like gosh what's the same Brooks in Shawshank Redemption he was so old and everyone's walking down this path and he walks down this one hall by himself with his iPad pro and I remember calling Jarius I can't do it I said I can't get its 12:30 in the morning the guy looks like he's at death's door yeah and I didn't want to be that jerk ooh corn I just wanted to talk with him I wasn't gonna you know sandbag him but he looks so it was so sad well his posture is so awful his neck sits in the middle of his sternum mr. turtle it's crazy it's like man you gotta sit up straight like that's not healthy you're you've got to be in pain all the time if your head is like that low well well we're gonna do economy you gotta give the money the block so they could pay for my physical therapy oh I thought income inequality here yeah but it's but I liked about him was that what he was he he seemed like a uniting for with white people and black people it seemed like he was you know he's doing interviews with killer Mike his anti-gun you know and Mike is super pro-gun you know I bike but I'm like I like the fact that people are compressing this crazy old guy and in the stage that was not the platform I mean if they wanted to have a meeting they should have had a meeting you can't just jump up and just kill Mike sit in the white the white house no office right now that'd be fine this president hi president now I don't know okay you know I think the problem is like you know even if you had people who were economic socialists who were on board with them we have a lot of people who were Pro Bernie who then changed because they just said well then he went full sjw and the black lives matter feminism and that's why I say even if you freezing to the left ition nobody believes that like everything when you're in these town halls and they don't know that you they all agree it really is a monolith and like that's why they say your right wing because the truth is you could be considered right wing just like he could just like I could just like Jordan Peterson could just like Milo could just like Ben sure and always have wildly differing views if you were to check the box off with shank Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton who take your pick they would check the same boxes because they have to and I think that's why they're losing so much ground culture and the boxes are shifting to so where the the right side is expanding all the different boxes you could possibly check the left is shrinking you have to get in line with these things well we made us a real Center and this country does not have a real Center and I think that drives people to the left and to the right I think it's a big issue there's there's just too much toxic tribal thinking here I just think we need truth I would like that something like to me is I don't care if your left or right just don't lie to me yeah and the left has been able to lie to everyone because they've controlled the information delivery for Ryan and that sounds conspiratorial that's right it's like what we're talking about with Tim Allen I mean that is right yeah I mean it's what we're talking about with actors how you talk to most actors when it comes to anything political they're almost all left-wing that doesn't even make sense like a terrified exactly yeah there's definitely there are a few people like with that you know like Gary Sinise in the show have had some bigger name actress where they have screw you money where doesn't matter right but he's just the nicest guy ever where he even talk about politics he just you know builds these smart homes for veterans just because he's like a saint right um but there are other actors we can't even necessarily name who were like I'd really like to do the show but I you know I can't yet what I can use stage in my career I'm sure you've probably heard from those people - yeah they're afraid yeah I'm you know I've had people like that to say I want to go hunting and I'm like yeah well let's uh let's film it no no I'm like you don't want people to know that that's how you get your food I mean do you know ninety seven percent of the country it's meat like really is it that high oh that's that high like what is it you're paying for it right so you're paying for the murder you're cool with that but you're not cool with doing it yourself right he goes no I'm totally cool - tomorrow else - no like okay well that's part of the problem because people don't want anybody else to know that's why it becomes so scary and taboo right and very few people come out you know it's just it's it's a lot of the same thing because it's like you not you're not willing to express your authentic self well that's the worse it's like we're going to be at Virginia Tech is it sixth week from today a week from today and with already people lying getting ready on face book to protest and you haven't even seen the show we don't know what it is is the first time we're going to take the show on the road and broadcast live I mean it's just a powder keg because no one's allowed to think differently right picture collegiate campuses that's what the left that's their utopia listen you brought us something that I think changed the way people look at social justice warriors that lady that was in the audience in Amherst was my old Wrigley puff that was like a gift from the heavens that poor gal it was like somebody created the caricature used to sue her gender I did doing that's a game I'm not the roll of the dice I'm a pig but when she was screaming at you I'm like this is not real weird this is like but Rex this is not real Rex but it's the same shit this is not real this can't be real this woman's not really this is like a caricature this is a this is an Michael J Fox movie from the 80s where you like there's no way that's a real person well you member how stressed I was about that yeah because here's the deal like this is my first time I was there it was Milo and christina hoff sommers now at this point I don't remember you should you like like the knack or a coke account when you would do college shows no back when you so that was my experience with colleges and I hated it but for the first time I know now that people are going to be protesting to a significant degree and I just wanted to go out and do Senate visited yeah do some like I don't know what I call I don't know what I do here because like they're just gonna speak in lecture and I want to do just you know 20 minutes set right now you know it's really tough because if I don't you know if you don't acknowledge heckler if you don't acknowledge the person but then when you come out and it's just trig Lee puffs who doesn't have enough middle fingers to give I've never given anyone the figures in the state I've never gone but I was like there's no I realized immediately I'm not gonna be able to do stand-up and that was the rant that went viral which you know I didn't expect it like I'm just gonna stay I'm just gonna do my set and then afterwards we'll do a QA they wouldn't allow it and I just saw her and I just couldn't she looked like the broad from Monsters Inc at the front desk I was just laughs but like she really did yeah just yeah and it was here's the thing you know I think it was my parents who maybe said this to me when I was young and I got cocky about something at one point and they said don't ever brag because it it dis it keeps us from being able to brag for you let someone else do it that's interesting why it's working way of putting it same thing with truly did I say it with an accent if we don't get to brag for you that she had a famous I don't know so well think about this if true Glee puffs didn't come out there for about a second she took her down pretty well she took her - another salmon eats carbs if she didn't do that we would all he sitting here talking about how if we just saw how we feel bad for her yes like oh man that grow I hope she gets it you know what I feel I would be sympathetic but you prevent you preclude us from being empathetic when you act like an absolute piece of shit your whole life threat like all of a sudden we've shut off this empathy for people because of the way they behave we would all be like oh man poor girl you know I hope she finds a guy I'm sure she'll find a guy who likes him you know bigger and you know she'll she can get it together and you know I've seen some people turn it around but once does that you're just like oh I can't speak bull DS higher see I thought it was so ridiculous that it didn't I didn't even think that way obviously I wasn't in the room while she was screaming at me while I was on the stage I probably been furious but sitting back watching it from the comfort of my house watching it on YouTube I was like what the fuck happened this poor kid like I just like this is it used to be someone you know as a person who has daughters like this is someone's baby and then became this like someone didn't pay attention to her they they fed her bad food and and she's there by herself like the whole thing was crazy keep your hate to me chop I care meanwhile christina hoff sommers by the way couldn't be a nicer person oh yeah like it was so funny watching her with you and Milo and she's like well I wouldn't say that yeah the Islam stuff got she got uncomfortable but he's on there she couldn't be a nicer lady I really love her she's really sweet we'll think about that we're on there she's basically kind of a lifelong Damaris she's branded right wing she's branded all right she is a super feminist but she calls herself the factual feminist and her idea is that when you distort reality when you start biology when you start facts you are doing your cause a disservice which is her cause being an actual feminist she's a real feminist and she doesn't think there's anything wrong with being a woman she's like just think there's anything wrong with wearing dresses putting on makeup or lipstick or what you're a woman you know there's probably two boxes she didn't check in the left column there for yeah right and by the way she doesn't think there's anything wrong with not doing that either right she's very open-minded it but but she calls bullshit and because she calls bullshit on that group she's shoved into this fucking Nazi category which is so crazy to me yeah oh and the danger with that is let's say ten years down the line right you refer to me isn't that so you refer to Joe Rogan as a Nazi not gay Jared isn't Nazi Christina Hoff Sommers you know what happens is when you refer to someone as a Nazi for reasonable views for just long enough they start saying okay you know what let's go with Nazi and people actually go further the pendulum swings further the other way that's what you're seeing with Europe that's what you're seeing with this far-right rise right guys like you know like spend computer who works just we've brought them over from Germany you know there's a certain point where young people don't want to go to every museum and go yeah we suck because they've had nothing to do with it she wasn't germ you pay sixty five percent income tax if you're under the age of thirty school is free think about that for sixty-five percent it's 50 but Sven was telling us there's some additional it's basically sixty five percent and it's entirely based on your age bracket you're under thirty you pay sixty-five percent that's your effective tax rate whoa so you have these key that's a lot of money man you know that hurts yeah but that's what you see you see this far right rise in Europe because if someone a Nazi for so long I'm like one second I'm not a Nazi I just don't want Paris to become a rape then you know well when you go from calling someone a Nazi and then you see Charlotte's ville when you see guys with Nazi tattoos you go oh well that's not exactly this is a real Nazi this is a moron with a swastika tattooed on his chest dad's Challenger yeah all this craziness left and right I just I'm just hoping it settles and what you said truth I like I like the truth I don't think you know that's where I always you know I know people get upset I don't think truth is necessarily in the middle I think truth is truth and sometimes it's really far to the right and sometimes it's in the middle I don't think that there's much truth in today's progressive left no I think there's an ideological war going on and I think especially with Trump in office they feel like the gloves are off and all rules are out the window and anything goes yeah I think people are flabbergasted and while I was telling Jamie before the show like I'm I'm not without my criticisms for Trump but I gotta admit every time stuff just rolls off his back like water on a duck I start fucking laughing like they were like this stormy Daniels thing is gonna sink him who's gay and he's a nicest guy in the world but he's so ridiculous he's like that's our Monica Lewinsky she's our Monica I go dude it's not gonna work I go no one's gonna care it's gonna it's gonna disappear in a couple weeks or we're in a ten hour news cycle do you understand this yeah I go in ten hours some new shit comes along and nobody gives a fuck about Brett Ratner anymore and nobody gives a fuck about this guy nobody and there's a new guy and there's a new thing and there's a new problem and there's a new theory there's a new thing and you're saying that this porn star thing this is not 1994 this porn star thing is not gonna sink him he's gonna deny it fake boobs fake nose and he's gonna keep moving and there's gonna be nothing yeah I don't even even know what happened with that exactly but to me I was remember I just was like I got a disconnect for a bit cuz I've been just going going going so I disconnected and I like kind of popped my head in for half a day just because we're moving to new studio kind of like you've been doing and I pop my head and like what's in there what's this outrage right now do I need to know about Donald Trump and they said no yeah he called Haiti a shithole I just popped my head back I'm like of course it is that's it no one cares me was like of course Haiti is it doesn't mean Haitians said why did these people from these shithole countries want to come here that's what he supposedly said he says he didn't say it some people say did other people say he didn't who cares so we're in a weird quagmire yeah yeah it's not the appropriate thing for a president of the United States to say but does it make sense that Donald Trump would say that because french-canadian to some of the most racist people you will find love you mom but they create these French laws I've talked about this before pure land it means pure wool because I want to get rid of all the Anglophones right and so then they had a huge Haitian immigration because there's a lot of you know French and people from Cameroon a special disease of inbreeding and they were furious so they try to create laws to keep the Haitians out because they were it was just a clash of cultures here's the thing Haiti is whether Donald Trump said it or not as a country a shitty place and I don't think anyone cares anymore if you say it doesn't mean I hate Haitians doesn't mean I'm not empathetic to them but very fortunate that they're in a bad place yeah but how is it racist if especially you're criticizing a government which comprises of black people who are screwing a black citizenry doing it for decades they've never gotten Rainn Wilson took a picture from sandals sandals that is the resort I think Jamaica of those places no locale and come over the other shitholes I mean I just like it's one of those things where I think if nothing else the Donald Trump has allowed people and we weren't Trump people we got so much flak from the alt-right because we didn't support them right I remember that and you were more in support of Ted Cruz right I liked Carly Fiorina and Ben Shapiro I mean Ben Carlson a little bit right I just thought he was hysterical well he's smart guy yeah so thanks so crazy yeah he's like Jim here my favorite thing was him with Jesus the painting Jesus on his shoulder so you know surgeon you're an absolute genius in that but you don't have the sense of like maybe a like I'm a car but well Jordan Peterson said something that's very brilliant he said there is absolutely no correlation with being smart and being wise it's true it's true there's a lot of people that are really fucking smart at things but they are not wise in terms of how they behave and how they think and how they conduct their life and whether or not they pay for a Jesus painting it does looks like a Puerto Rican dude is slinging tacos that's a crazy painting it's so it's so bad I just knew this guy okay yeah yes well everything's new we used to have stars but the the panels were too dark in this room because the lighting is different here so we change them to clouds got the American flag and that's how people also think you're right wing yeah when do you receive a current progressive leftist with patriotic symbolism I usually have a American flag case but I ordered one from the iPhone X and I didn't get it yet look I love America I think America represents a beautiful place of opportunity and it's not perfect but I think it's the best place I've been to a lot of different places you know if you think there's something wrong with being patriotic I think you're fuckin crazy I don't think America represents the worst aspects of us I think it represents possibility and-and-and promise and that you have this ability to do whatever the fuck you want to do that's not a class structure you can literally go from the bottom to the top I mean you could you could do whatever the fuck you want to do in this country there's some restrictions people say it's not a free country hey man go to Canada it's a lot more fucking free than Canada in Canada you even go to jail for not using someone's preferred gender pronouns there's a case that just was out a couple of days ago where some woman had a sign and it was a and they boiled down to like one word but her her sign said that a transgender woman is a man and you're just because you feel something like that it does not overtake biology and it was this like long thing this transgender person wanted to file a human rights violation case against her and get her arrested and said that the only way this person would not would be willing to not do that was B would be this sit down with this woman and have coffee with her explained to her why she's wrong well she doesn't think she's wrong that's we you can't just decide that this person has to act we ask they have to give in to your particular ideology and your line of thinking otherwise it's hate speech that's not the answer like the answer to if you think someone's wrong the answer is proving them wrong is having a conversation about it like some someone deciding that not only is it wrong they're gonna lock you up for it they're gonna sue you like that's crazy and I think especially with that Trudeau guy up there deep in remove a couple of fucks and you could have just run for office with that speech was very inspiring just look I could probably get up there and be if I could be a Canadian like I'm a big fan of Canada I'm a big fan but they've got a few problems well here that's you know the first person neighbor voted for with Stephen Harper right so here's the deal back then ma'am I'm that guy I'm open about a Christian conservative and one who Harper is I see wow it was a prime minister before Trudeau so Stephen Harper is the Canadian equivalent of a conservative so that would be like a little left to John Kasich here in the States he was there Reagan he kind of fertile yeah he was I mean we they didn't have the housing bubble because they didn't do the subprime loans from Canada it was doing really well for the first time was higher in the economic freedom index in the United States I voted for him and everyone hated him why because he was a practicing Christian conservative who believed in some form of limited government well now they have Trudeau it's like surprise I remember Stephen what song was a pastor and I talked about this a lot and this is one slippery slope thing it was a nun oh you're just you're just crazies religious nut bag this guy Stephen Weston was a pastor who I think was jail he certainly was fine just because he said I don't care what the law is in the land I'm not going to marry two men in my congregation I'm not going to recognize that as marriage that's what he said whether you agree with him or not this was years ago and people on the left back then supported it was like well it only affects the Christian pastor doesn't want to marry dudes Beckham well now it doesn't now it affects the person who says if you're born a man you're a man and now it affects mike Ward the comedian who was put before a Human Rights Tribunal for making fun of the make-a-wish kid foundation yeah it a certain point you have to draw the line and we want to decide that we're gonna draw the line when it comes to like for example puberty blockers or do we draw the line when someone tries to strangle ben shapiro on the dr. drew show because he implies that the guy with the penis is still a man still there was that was rough that was a rough one because you know the guy was literally threatening violence and it was okay because Ben had misgendered him and they could have been local Ben pen to be fair you knew that was gonna not only doesn't have touched him but it was like putting his hands on him which is very threatening if someone's threatening me and they're putting their hands on me I'm on DEFCON 9 I'm ready to go like where's this going bitch why are you holding on to me are we fighting yes you're holding me you're gripping me and holding me and you're way bigger than me that guy was way shit way bigger than Ben but Ben's Ben was fucking strong they're they're like oh my gosh but yeah he said if you if you don't be carry some like the Joker you're gonna wind up if you don't you're gonna want your brick gonna go home in an ambulance yeah it's like are you gonna beat me up because I say the wrong word really you'd imagine that's something there's a you were a man right he was like the clubber lang of trainees well like you know that was one of the things that I got into it with someone online about Fallon Fox I said you know someone said she was always a woman I go okay but you know she got a man she she had a penis she use to be man she got a woman pregnant and had a kid with that woman I go what she woman then she goes even then I'm like we're done we're done we're in Narnia again because I didn't expect that I felt like I could say hey I don't think it's cool if you get your penis removed to beat the fuck out of women I just I felt like that's a safe thing people like you're a bigot I was like wow well okay hmm maybe you should at least tell them that you used to be a man no it's a medical procedure and it has no basis whatsoever physical performance well that's not even structurally true that doesn't even make any sense the physical body's built differently you know a humanity of Brock Lesnar decided to be a woman just just just imagine that enough hormone blockers in the world keep diggin tell me about you didn't have to tell anybody no it's a medical procedure they don't want you love doesn't want you tell people you have AIDS as much I mean a penis as much that's wonderful it used to be a felony and now it should be yes if you know you have a fatal disease and you fuck someone in the butt without a condom that's right a red pool party that's C you can't just be transferred by playing spin the bottle did you ever see the guy who authored that yes yeah Folsom Street Fair with a little leather like yes yes like a Bryan Singer pool party it's hilarious it's terrible did that guy pass that through it's people weren't paying attention like that's that's crazy like I don't care if it's I don't care if it's AIDS or if you couldn't give someone cancer you know like right you if you have cancer and you know you have K I mean if it was a communicable disease and you decided to make out with someone who doesn't have cancer and you gave it to them like fuck man you just killed somebody you just smoked the pipe and kiss me and now I have esophageal cancer you know the bigger conversation on that too is they're like obviously it's not fatal anymore because the protease inhibitors and all that stuff but you just compared age the cancer there was once a day where you just compare AIDS to AIDS well usually dad well they used to call AIDS the gay cancer you know that's when when it first came out they called it the gay cancer we did a thing on that where we did offensive we did a skewer that show wishbone we did a parry with her dog hopper we did the AIDS epidemic now the AIDS epidemic was always a hoax there was never an epidemic basically if you were not doing heroin with dirty needles or having a unprotected sex with George Michael you were pretty much safe people got so mad I knew it yeah we used people know it they do you remember the Kinnison bit yeah I remember the Kinnison bit hysterical yeah so we had a guy who came on it was actually very civil who disagreed with by the end of it he just said well I guess it is disagreed because the way you said it was so incendiary nice well on a second why is it in sin dear I am the one actually trying to prevent people from getting AIDS there are very specific patterns of behavior that you avoid don't have gay and protected sex in a truck stop don't do heroin another the East Village like rents where you watch the movie rent you ever see that movie no oh cuz I'm straight crying at rent and like every every single person was doing heroin in the east village and having unprotected sex with each other if you make it past noon without getting AIDS you're on borrowed time like I don't feel bad for you at this point but we had people they give us so much flak over the AIDS epidemic and none of them disagreed with the statistics you're just not supposed to say it think about that for a second though the issue with that Folsom Street Fair uh senator or congressman you know I'm talking abut yes the guy with the beautiful leather vest that's no shirt on underneath it wandered through the streets with a tire on his neck that looks suspiciously like a leash was a hot topic discount so his argument I remember was well this these laws only these disclosure laws and by the way for people who don't know it means you have to disclose that you have AIDS if you're having sex with somebody right these disclosure laws only serve to stigmatize people hold on a second does that mean that we can't stick my ties anyone or anything ever we can't stigmatize aids right but it doesn't mean we hate you and we consciously delivering it into someone I mean that's that's the problem by being aware at what point are we okay stigmatize right I mean what does it take to say like well you know what okay maybe we should stigmatize if I were to use an absurd example in a bit like okay maybe we should stigmatize knowingly transferring aids to somebody through unprotected but sex as a goof but instead we don't want to stigmatize you're not even supposed to say aids right because it's HIV and then HIV gives AIDS you know you get AIDS because your immune system is compromised and what aids is a syndrome acquired immune deficiency syndrome I never got more hate in all the years I did this podcast then one of the early early early episodes what was that doctor's name the the doctor from the University of California Berkeley he is ostracized from the medical community but he's a Duesberg yes dr. Peter Duesberg he wrote an article in Spin Magazine way way way back in the day and his assertion was that HIV is a very weak virus and that HIV is appearing in the systems of these people because they have compromised immune systems it's not AIDS it's not HIV that's giving these people compromised immune systems they already have compromised immune systems and he was saying the reason why there having these compromised immune systems is because of amyl nitrate and crystal meth and party drugs and he showed overwhelming like in his in his mind overwhelming evidence that all these people that got AIDS were getting their immune system was compromised because of partying yeah they were saying this is why it's so prevalent in the gay party community he's like you and he was talking about how you destroy your immune system with amyl nitrate you destroy your immune system with crystal meth and if you check the immune systems of these people of course it's gonna be devastated they're doing hardcore party drugs and they're doing them all the time he he said this and he you know published a bunch of stuff on it people went crazy I mean it was it was it was not a scientific debate it was more of a social issue how dare you stigmatize math like it wasn't but if it wasn't a gay thing here's the thing if AIDS was just something you found truckstop people who were just doing meth and and and shooting heroin and they're all for whatever reason they're getting this disease you would go oh I bet a disease is probably maybe has something to do with the fact they're all doing meth no no unrelated okay but but meth bad right oh it's terrible but amyl nitrate is devastate Oh instant brain damage amyl nitrate causes instant brain damage you pop one of those sated poppers yeah they do them apparently opens you a lot of power lifters would do those before big like setting some smelling salts yeah different female nitrate is a potent drug all right yeah actually somebody talked about that yesterday Ben Greenfield talked about that yesterday some insanely disgusting smelling salt that you barely hold up to your nose and you do lifts like right after yeah exciter your your central nervous system it's fire up lavender but anyway I I don't know what the facts are I'm not a fucking biologist this guy's a he's a tenured professor at the University of California Berkeley can't get funding for anything he's done rock solid research on cancer it's really interesting guy yeah but all the other AIDS researchers denounced him everyone else that's involved in HIV and they might be right they very well could be right I don't know if he's right or he's wrong it seems to me more likely that he's wrong because no one no one has come forward like legitimately yeah on his side in terms of scientific research they said what you're saying from what I hear like my inclination is sounds like he may be wrong with you here's the thing I'm not offended that you brought it up he's a fucking biology yes you know but that's what's crazy about it that that's why I can't think of any shows and the others let's say center-right other side of the political spectrum where they wouldn't be offended by that like you speak so much crap I maybe he's wrong from everything I know about HIV and AIDS seems as though he's wrong I don't know enough to say he's wrong but I've heard enough people that know enough that say he's wrong that I believe them but people are sending me messages bloods on your hands and this now I'm like if you went out and had unprotected but sucks after listening to the Joe Rogan experience you deserve what's coming yeah okay if you listen to me and you're like that's it Peter Duesberg right send it in you can't demonize conversations and I don't know enough about the subject but I listen to that guy's take on it and it's fuel for thought you know I don't think he's right I don't but I I've talked to a lot of people that I don't think are right I think I've talked to some crazy fucking people on the show and I think we've got to be able to have conversations you have to well I mean we might agree on 60% of things me I'm 50 maybe it's somewhere between 40 and 70 I don't know it doesn't matter it should be okay it should be totally fine and that's the thing when we do a you know change my mind segments most time people it's pretty amicable and then you just get someone who comes up and wants to commit assault right at wrigley puffs and it's like I think a big skill we've kind of had to learn this because not gay Jarrod knows when we first had guests if it was if it was a guest we disagreed with I was like listen I will not edit you it will not be taken out of context but I would sit down for three hours with them because they would be like don't cut me off don't coming up and you realize just repeating themselves right so finding the balance of sing there are a lot of people out there now who are open to hearing these points before open to hearing these ideas being able to identify them and then being able to identify the people who are so bought in they won't even listen need to make an example of them for the people you can convince right and understanding the two different kinds of people the the trig Li puffs versus you know I don't know Jordan Pederson you probably never saw himself was even political at all until he came out and said something that would seem to be so benign and caused an uproar um I think being able to identify those two it's not so much just about left and right who can hear who won't and how to handle them right and why why can't you hear can you not hear because it interferes with your ideology or can you not hear because it's what they're saying is illogical like which one is it is it are you honestly listening to what they're saying and can you give factual refute can you give some sort of a factual review of this or is it just it just doesn't jive with your view of the world you you have some rock-solid view of the world that you're not you're not willing to look at it in my perspectives because I sell undercover thing with Nagas doing by the way balls of steel doing this let's talk about that one because we got we got video of that one too you went undercover with an Tifa and that fucking that one was disturbing to me because first of all you look like you've slide right in like a glove buddy like I was almost matching the guy when I got there guy gal we all know um and I thought our costume wardrobe lady had actually just just stolen his clothes because it was almost identical yeah what he was wearing isn't it though that when you're a slender man like people assume Emmanuel wings oh yeah I can get away so much crap yeah weird yeah well like what is it about slender people there's something there right look what is it about slender people that are almost always left wing weakness whoa do you think so sorry see the American flag is right wing they see this this you might will be the Third Reich hmm did I say Third Reich I don't even know what it is yeah Yeah right I don't know I don't know some designs check them out on that is really actually really nice that's your own hit that steel yeah that's pretty cool guy makes them that's it that's it I can usually I can you tell when someone's approaching us if they're friendly or foe by their posture and their body size the guy walks in your body size I'm like oh that's probably friendly we're looking 140 pound man like myself approaches on the cob we got to get out of Dodge he has a shank or screwdriver shotguns and I know I know because I was like I had done to me and now I get made every time I go out after you know you dress like a tranny and you gonna be Wendy Davis my week flies off she still goes along with it I'm on every technical also didn't want to pull the SEAL Team six mission between a Wednesday and Friday show so it's true but what happened is then when you were in you wanted to go back it's true I was juice how did it get like to explain to me how I got set up how you did it like what what what was the meeting balls of stuff uh well I mean these kind of these things were much different in the Burlington Vermont kind of gigs I mean that was a throwaway this one took months of planning as reg - yeah yeah - reg especially - infiltrating the back end of antiva red and reg become urgent we have a guy who does a research for us don't don't make him I won't get into anything specific but he is there my high level professor okay he has a he has a 650 something pound squat she's like bein in real life and brilliant he was the one who found the salon pedophile that's why we broke that she wasn't had a father article yeah he was currently actively a pedophile he sent it to me within ten minutes but he's the man in the chair mistake currently out of wasn't a practicing pedophile right no he was he was he talked about grooming and all that stuff when we wrote about it yeah really double down on it - didn't three more articles yeah yeah anyway the point is reg does reg does brilliant those articles I don't know that maybe they did but they did like two or three but red is a brilliant researcher and so at this point it's plain that though because you were glossing over this four people are just listening please explain like what that was like those articles sorry yeah we're starting off with that so salon.com what was their first articles I'm a pedophile but I'm not a monster yeah and it was talking about how you know the way to deal with US isn't again not to stigmatize us I'm like listen I'm sorry to a certain point I'm empathetic but we send you to therapy you still want to have sex with kids we take you out of village we shoot you we can't take that risk sorry that's it so he was like I'm not a monster and talked about how you know his struggles was his family okay you can kind of understand it but then reg did some research we found all of his online messageboard his his pseudonyms his his usernames and coded language about grooming dreaming like you're grooming us online so he found all of it and we released an article on it and then Salon released another article where he responded and didn't call us up my name was like my week in the right wing hates fear and they read it on salon like we're the bad guys because we found out that you're grooming children and they released a few and like we just realized okay this is the thing kind of like hormone blockers for kids salons cool with an active pedophile let's move on now we're not gonna do it there's no more convincing to be done here so red was the one who found that in reg was the one who infiltrated a lot of the anti-fur groups you know he's that's not his real name but he has so many these guys just brilliant so he'd been doing research on the backend upon request and was so good so we had all this research we knew who these people were we kind of knew what they were planning with ben shapiro going into Utah as a matter of fact we were going to go to Berkeley right before that but then last minute we found out that they weren't going to do it because we know where they meet we were on their cryptic apps mm-hmm where they would text you says these apps that you would download like I don't know if we're allowed to say that I don't know I think yeah the FBI came to us for information afterwards like oh yeah we're tracking their arrests made because of your undercover thing well arrests made on the people seasonal cover same people so they committed crimes again later that day and were arrested so the same person who handed him a shank later that day itself it's a little rest so so reg gets you the information and then you how do you make contact with these people we well we were part of their Facebook grouping so we found out where they wanted to meet when when where and we show up to campus and I walk in as Jason antiphon person new to the organization say I want to be involved blue contacts why blue contacts just because we're on a budget we need to disguise so why why didn't you disguise you didn't think you could slip you thought people would recognize we thought a bit we could have been on their radar we don't know well they well they tried to fight us in in an Austin antiphon did yes requires we tape it any with tim kennedy and they were passing out flyers just there when you got waterboarded no no that was another time now would much money in water yeah he did he did that was no joke and I'd rather do that than the CNN 16 hour livestream that's not a joke I'd rather be waterboarded but anyways yeah so we show up this coffee house there me Starbucks on campus so I found him met up he gives me the cryptic messaging app was it he or she did he find out we don't know I was sure was a he because it was a wedding band and this closure up zur zur sitting there with his wedding band iPhone 7 and his is brought on the side it gives me the app and says we'll see you tomorrow so I say okay see you then it gives me full communication they did roll call later broke on it and is okay everyone roll call we've got Jason in the group it's like yeah it's like Firebird well they went downs like all these like Firebird and rogue two in flamethrower nine and then there was will how can you figure out who was well because the phone numbers are also listed doesn't lie take screenshots but turns out if you have another phone you could take a photo of your screws use a physical camera uh they didn't seem to work out this kink in the plans well then play the snapchat thing when people are sending dick pics like yeah yeah well you can't say you can't excrete eyes it just informs the person which is so much worse than know if someone actually took it so yeah that makes it worse for everybody it with another camera like you said so yeah I'm sorry so go ahead so all these people are role-playing there they're in Dungeons and Dragons exactly so we we go back to our hotel get ready for the next day and show up on campus where they're supposed to to to meet up and get nervous it's more nervous the day before because I shouldn't know what I was walking wanted to do short is if I'm gonna play it first if they are all like thirty seconds okay for mantofa for which one do you want me to start with ads how a fine one you know so these people difference me they were openly advocating violence and they were openly they were they were offering to give you a gun not at first no not at first that's why I said I won't admit because you actually said the funny part before is you said we got into a fight and you said this is not my job description and I said it is exactly in your job description you have to go do this right now and we had security everything but remember you were really and then after the clips you'll see after they gave you the knife and we were finally on reports with the cops hmm at that point he goes I'm gonna go back in I think I can really mess with him like no you can't they just handed you a prison shank and told me they had a sawed-off shotgun you can't go back in there so once he was in it I had to rein him back there's a little Little Joe couple times crazy okay so let's play this is my meeting it's almost like product placement is a guy this is a guy I think I play it tell me how to show her tactics to prepare for what we're planning I have a toolbox full of shit I am did you bring your gun on the border between have like on the Border's we're going to write for what I saw that's a girl yeah I thought so when I showed this one but you know I think Jamie is one where they handed jared was an ice pick you said or what was it it was an ice pick no it was a sharp pointy end but it was like a school that screwdriver said to aks coming okay so here it is I think they were lying though so the shoes rounded yeah and tell me how that guy can procure my own K bars give our sponsor Evangeline now by the way really okay so what they're doing is first of all that person never stabbed anybody in their fucking life right so these are dorks and what they're doing is they're deciding now they're gonna take action and they're gonna enlist the aid of a bunch of other people did you think at that point in time like maybe these people are looking for suckers that are willing to do fucked up shit for them she ain't stabbing anybody I absolutely say when I showed up I met there was like for them when I got there they were all running late the Socialists were all running late and one of them actually said sweetheart they're honey bee I was like yeah that's the beauty of being unemployed I can just show up on time anywhere I want them like there's a silver lining I guess eating still late yeah she's placed so she okay so I get there and I'm first I'm thinking okay this is a bus this is a really sad group of people right I don't know about the weapons at this point I just think okay there's I'm expecting like for these guys in the what they called black bloc all black radicals everything and it just looks like a really sad social club so like get there sit down for a bit and like three minutes in you start telling me they start passing me stuff telling me everything you just saw and I'm thinking oh my lord this is not I I need to get out I need to get out I need to get out meanwhile I'm on the other side of the school cuz Ben Shapiro is being so many other side of school and the eventual peers there so there are a lot of fans so I'm kind of taking pictures and you know I got spots so got spotted some take it baby my phone's everyone huh shut off my phone taking pictures understand I see it engineers like they're handing me knives like quick get out like okay I need it I need it fast anything quick yeah so I told him had to take a dump and I just left with the crazy thing about that is that you bring us the footage so there are cops right there so we tell the cops because like we've got to get him through this whatever it is quad whatever is there I think let's go fire you go circle and they were handing out sharp objects to stab people with so they had someone come with us cover for local wines and take two late night hosts comedians to find this out you know what I wish you guys like yes you just saw correctly even being shown the footage in the presence of police officers to confirm authenticity they walked away also I should note yeah he was on my podcast he mention he gave us a brief spot and when they actually put together weeks later after our video come out so he had to acknowledge it but he put together a small little brief montage of our video that took place not without some controversy what happens is to me what's so crazy it's like again I offered it to the local guy right people who do news you know April O'Neill they're not they want the exclusive I said hey man do you want this like to run this cuz he worked for ABC or local fox or something he's doing Instagram videos with five you know following his easel Oh heart go up on his screen so looking at him like I'm like listen man do you want this and he goes uh what is it so I go and this is we tell him exactly what we had and we show him the cryptic app and I'm like hold on a second we're not here the police so we're showing it to him and he walks away he's like well I got to do my job like this isn't a part of your job this isn't a part he didn't think was and that to me was in st. we weren't looking for it necessarily a school this is why his possibly had a rhyme going down the street with her protests that's what he did well you'll see people peacefully protesting like hold off his insane hey hey he just didn't have authority that he was trying to have didn't fit the narrative same thing with a guy from Nightline didn't fit so the narrative was the anti-trump protesters which is what people were tuning in to the news for it wasn't it was a peaceful ride there were snipers on the rooftops for that little Jew ben shapiro two weeks after every way he's a smarmy little bastard I love but he's like I could see how he pisses people off but he's brilliantly he's very very smart who's my first lawyer he negotiated my contracts he wasn't even entertainment lawyers had been you got a lot of vowels in your last name and I have a contract with money at play can you help this is this I mean this is the heat of the aunt of a fight last summer I right after Berkeley they were really specifically about antiphon trying to downplay the violence and you know the the undercurrent that seemed they picked up given that up they seem to have accepted the fact that there's a lot of some of them some of them some of them but I think this had I mean I hate not to toot our own horn but I think things like this when that got what 15 Lane plays on Facebook and a few million on on on YouTube and the reason we got more mileage is because the news refused to cover it and then was it the Dean someone there some Student Activities Advisor released an official statement saying nothing happened and so we called him so that was a follow-up video we listening that we see with the Washington what we made up something Washington Herald or something this was a stupid name everyone of us and we asked who made the statement that this was entirely peaceful because honey bee he said he's speaking on behalf of the police we never actually quoted a name so he was we figured up real quickly he speaking on behalf of himself and he was opinion we found out he was actually a delegate or some she was actually officially involved - yeah - Clinton he was at he was a Clinton staffer yeah did support of an Tifa this like open supportive it is very confusing it's like do you know this you got like professors hitting people in the head with bike locks like this is not sound absurd it's true it's not a wise group this is not this is not a smartly organized refutable of you know some crazy power structure these it this is chaos right it's your question earlier yeah I do think they were I think they prey on losers of society to become part of I mean they were so quick to welcome me in because they they need the numbers they're willing to accept anybody there was no filtration says that if that was a real faction of ante that's the saddest fucking faction that doesn't matter what le kaise and you're you're as bad as anybody tell him later that so honeybee got arrested mmm for tasty to a guy hazing a guy that somebody could she tase know the guy sucker-punched a different guy it's something happened over the desktop but my character honeybee was the late socialists got arrested Friday XANA dude and then after jail was texting you remember that yes she wanted her knife back because I texted a picture of me sitting next to Shapiro full getup flipping them the bird he texted them a picture in the in the crypt in encryption app oh my god I should've brought the phone you bastard give me the knife thumbs up oh my god we told them like when it was going up on YouTube like keep an eye out tomorrow at 6 o'clock on YouTube so she gets arrested for tasing somebody yeah and then what happens now no heat for her for all this video of her saying she's got a handgun and we don't know yeah I mean I think can be saying now we I was in a lot of phone calls with with the FBI Hobbs on the premise with the FBI and they knew that my footage was not um and terribly surprising to any of them because they were all already on their radar but they did ask how you got in the cryptic app they did at there they were there picking my brain for how they function because they're they are organized to a certain extent I mean that there is ignore organized as the Berkeley faction or as any other faction that's that's called trouble who knows but to some level they are and that's that's where the FBI used us to come help them what's what we're talking about earlier that my my take on it is that if you're trying to suppress people that hardcore and it's just a guy who's talking and that guy turns out to be Ben Shapiro and you're calling him a Nazi like do you see those dangerous again do you see the yarmulke on his head you know Ben Shapiro is a Nazi are you out of your mind like this is you're so far gone that you're like with every single one of these things that diminish is the credibility of this this whole movement like the whole thing just seems preposterous like you're calling everybody a Nazi even a Jewish guy with a yarmulke on he's a Nazi because he's a white supremacist house you know what fuck is he what you listen to what he's saying he's not a white supremacist he said he's a conservative and if you don't think that he's correct go debate him let's practice racist wasn't good enough calling him a bigot wasn't good empty there's escalated to okay well not to get your attention and escalates that way what happened to Jordan Pederson in that shit with that woman who had recorded the conversation between the the professors that were chastising her for showing and just showing a clip of Jordan Peterson discussing gender pronouns she the the professors equated her or equated him to Hitler they literally equated Jordan Peterson the Hitler and Milo universalism which is a big spectrum ILU Nablus hill well not only that Matenopoulos ben shapiro there are no two people who hated each other more yeah you mean and there's like alt writers not mildly innopolis and Ben chagrin like do you realize how much they despise 2016 ben shapiro was the number one recipient of anti-semitic aid online number one doesn't surprise me I mean that's how crazy it is to call a Nazi he's super Jewish to me is it Jewish does it gets I don't even like I don't even send them text if we're getting near Saturday he's like you know they do the shaving thing where you can use an electric trimmer and one important a straight razor might like okay so logical in every other way like oh he's so hardcore with that it's so strange I'd love to talk to him about that such as Jewishness yeah just so hardcore was velocity she wasa wasa T is that you know Ben and I have been friends for a long long time and I think even when I was on the shows like you know listen up but I've never planned to be a debater it just kind of was thrust upon me sometimes with people on the show I think I'm a marginally intelligent person ben shapiro was brilliant it just kind of took a while for people to find him i think on the shows i get Ben is the kind of guy if you want to talk with us and really have someone who goes in the lion's den and he just he just doesn't care he just does not care he's not afraid of any he wasn't afraid of the Milo during that time when listen if taken consideration Ben Shapiro during this time right Ben Shapiro leaves Breitbart their smear in his name he doesn't like you know Steve ban and this is what Breitbart is really powerful Steve ban and is getting cozy with Donald Trump ben shapiro can't stand donald trump miley innopolis is the most popular right-wing sort of commentator and he's going after Ben like there was a period where I'm sure it was pretty rough for him and he still stuck to his guns yeah got to respect that no I and I like him he's a very nice guy I had one show had a great time talking to him I think he's a very nice guy very smart guy yeah um I feel like there's something happening right now culturally there's so many people that are freaking out because Donald Trump is a president that everything is ramped up and no one can be left-wing enough and I think this is probably one of the reasons why someone would justify having an article like that pedophile thing on salon.com and why people just it seems to be that like you can't be progressive enough like everything is getting so over-the-top and so ridiculous that people are calling other progressives out for not being progressive enough and it's they're eating their own thing yes yes the transgender community is very upset that you are and you if you are a white woman wearing a pussy hat you are mocking people that are women that don't have pussies specifically black women black women's well I mean like maybe you've seen a couple but don't say always cuz that that is just wrong internally yeah but you don't know who know okay I'll give you that just a guess I spoke at some of them are dark but the point is like that's how crazy the left wing is gotten like that wearing a pink pussy hat is offensive because it's it's offensive to people who are women who have penises yeah literally that's what they said and people of color who also don't have pink pussies like fuck you like pink is obviously a universal color for women you're wearing a hat it's got cat ears get it got it it's not a vagina you fuck it's not like you have a goddamn vagina I can sum up some people did we actually we just didn't have the budget cuz Lansing was really they were actually I think it was Lansing Michigan one of the places that like a ban on the pussy hat so we just wanted to show up with fitment what yeah there was one thing I don't wanna speak out of turn on/off was laying someplace had a van so was like we just actively discourage it and we just wanted to show up with 50 guys who are like hardcore against that what we didn't know socialists pay for new hats they just bought them last year right in this cat hats it's not like a vagina it's a cat it is but you can't have a double entendre publicly you can't explain that to your kid what's going on there dad Oh little fella that's uh they like cats how hard is that but why they screaming you can't touch my pussy it's your puberty blockers and shut up yeah it's crazy when that happened it was right after the women's March and you and I were talking about him we were kind of talking at that point we were sort of analyzing the idea pussy had economics in the wage gap and we're talking with us and why that wasn't necessarily true now we're so beyond that I just go look they're mad at their own hats that's a joke for the night that really is it there's they're so crazy left-wing progressive over-the-top attacking each other that you can't wear a pussy hat anymore but who defends it as my point let's say like no yeah Ana Kasparian or Shanker who I'm just using them as an example it would behoove them to go on air right must say this is really this is why the left loses right now you're upset about the pussy ads and we make like instead they go along with it yeah no one is good have caught that earlier you know I understand it you know people who are it's just like it's a it's a cat but it's you can't make fun of anything I mean they're in this weird position where if it's a left-wing thing you can't make fun of it even if it's like obviously ridiculous you just ignore it you ignore it and avoid it because to mock it would be to attack your own team and that that's what it feels like to me their own deal this is just this is totally just me kind of asking throwing this to the room maybe two usually but there's no question I'm just asking questions black lives matter an tyfa the pussy it's kind of all disappeared a little bit if you think about it think about the news they're really not very active it's been like a couple of months you think of how exponentially volatile everything was bright doesn't it seem like it's kind of fierce I think I think it's faded because it's it's proof that's not this group huge grassroot movement I think they ran out of budget I think that was I hate to say it but we were talking member than women's March and you youth it was like at that point they're saying the biggest March of all time said watch through watch watch the next one the next one we went to Denton Texas you couldn't find 40 people because they were paid to show up it's like the S yeah the fight for 15 they are these lefties and Denton Texas and LA was giant no no the women's watch was huge everywhere but the point is they did a follow up March and there was no one when you don't pay people to show up and you're not knitting the hats and giving them out no one shows up but beware though in Denton Texas no everywhere la they weren't paying people you think they were paying it was something like 900,000 not a bubble downtown yeah there were a lot of people give them a dollar and have them snow spin all I think I think what's a half a million dollar budget everyone who works for a leftist think tank everyone who works for a leftist nonprofit everyone who works for the SEIU or is a part of the Union this now becomes a part of your job description to show up in solidary and support them it's the same reason they support an tyfa even though it's silly and they support black I don't think you're right about that oh I think there's a lot of people that love to March they love some sort of a cause they think they're doing the right thing they think they're out there protesting they get excited about it it's on a Saturday I don't think any of these people are getting paid these people are excited about it they're out there they're chanting and cheering and this is what they they want to stand proud and be solidified and two weeks later none of them show up what do you mean there were many women's marches after that the follow up nothing like you look at the Tea Party when it started there was to do one you don't have to keep going although of course you see anyway xx that's 10 days ago this oh this is the recent one yeah but it's like every they do it once a year they can gather their troops I think you crazy no I don't think we've we've signed it for the fight for 15 what's that the SEIU were on all the mailing lists so we run all the mailing lists as to where these things meet and when they fight for 15 was a hashtag fight for 15 what does that mean that's the fight for 15 minimum wage oh yeah that's Ahnold down wage yeah okay same thing with women's marches remember when we showed up and we have some the ones outside of the beginning the only people who were there were paid I hate speakers ok well that's different UK that's a different March but I think the woman's March is pretty legit I think these people are doing it because they don't like having this guy in power they wanted a woman there's two things going on one they wanted a woman to be President they thought a woman was gonna be President and then it was snatched from them snatched away and so in a hat you know he's he's just a fucking crazy guy like Donald Trump's a crazy guy but he's gonna be crazy guy the next month when you're doing another ya think no one shows up they think somehow or another that it's gonna have an impact it doesn't it does culturally like people are aware of it but doesn't have any impact on him I don't think mustn't even it was he once said no no what they want to impact on find his tweet cuz it was goddamn tulare about the women's March about what a wonderful day maybe is self-aware you look at pro-life March as he thinks hundreds of thousands all the time yeah all the time here it is Trump tweets in support of women's March that's also protesting him you go to the tweet what was it well there's a great country go ahead get out there how to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success in wealth creation that has taken place over the last twelve months Louis V relative limit in eighteen years come on that's fuckin funny man I don't give a shit 9,000 I don't care if you're supporter or not if you're if you're a person who appreciates comedy that's fucking strong trolling right there that's you know many Whitman trolley what's her name Charlie puff was really tough you know many of them were screaming how many a lot of spices get alive hunched into laptops people are angry at that was that's hilarious well we went to the think about that the March or the the protest we went to in Grand Rapids the socialist March we yeah that was but to your point that they were they were pissed off that these students who were like a lot of people just there for the move we're pissed off but the Union people didn't show up and they're sort to coming in the busloads the union workers then didn't people to know where the people paid by the organization and that's one thing we found so like the Utah ant fo and the reason we say this is every time we show up we found it actually from a leftist activist group it's about what did we average a twelfth of the people who say they're interested and going oh something like a twelfth like reg came up with a number he's like they like Facebook they don't really have to show up yeah if one hundred twenty mean will say attending it'll be it'll be like eight now it's consistent to the partner we have to determine what events we go to or what is funny enough to cover because even if it'll say a few thousand people are going to a March inevitably it's far far less you have to run into the bullshit algorithms yeah we've had so many really does this depend on where you're talking about like if you're in Lansing Michigan maybe but if you're in LA these marches are John well you're in LA no but there are some but for every one that you see that the media says okay we're gonna you know this is all hands on deck there are forty no one shows up oh my we had that even in New York City with a fight for 15 and what we were since though I mean how many times can you get people to March well not even March show up for any protest right you know anytime she can get people to protest I mean you can only get a few of those out of a person in in a year you know I disagree you think people are just down to do it all the times it was hundreds of thousands like every other month like clockwork and then they won an election that's different though the Hawaii j-20 group oh yeah the Hawaii that was another thing we got out of the Hawaii g20 group jjjj twenty to twenty I don't know isn't undercover than we got kicked out not my why jate ones the j-20 is called g20 I don't know why I don't know socialism socialist immigration in resist Trump movement magazine wasn't the balls it takes to be Trump that you got literally a million people out there protesting and you make a tweet like that it's pretty funny pretty funny fucking balls oh yeah you gotta get you got to give him that you gotta give he's got a set up whether you agree with him or not just take that away take all that Sawa and just look at what he just did there and you gotta wonder like if Churchill had Twitter you know would it be this is it just that he has the tools oh yeah oh yeah well this is unprecedented there's never been I mean not only that like he's got a style like sad like this is his style of saying things and then writing set and then a hacking people like who the fuck has ever been the president and has personally attacked lyin Ted crooked Hillary yeah I mean he's what does he call sloppy Steve banning me so he calls him and cause him sloppy Thank You political people either any I went after somebody some rapper or something jay-z jay-z was talking about us he goes jay-z apparently doesn't understand at the lowest unemployment rate for blacks ever what's going on right now that really picky easy life yeah it was a lot of poor black people's any responded to Eminem respond jay-z but not Eminem's too vicious and he's white I think it was a word that's another moment I seen in my life self-aware now that was like so prefab and we're like oh man he just you just got burned wish did a sketch with Owen Benjamin doing the M&M thing oh yeah a Jewish executive writing and stuff like it's gonna kill kid call the president of bitch yeah I felt like he could have been better but if they pissed Eminem off more than you didn't respond right yeah just another moment you got like maybe you self-aware maybe he knows what's good he said he had the next music lights maybe I was like Macaulay Culkin when the criminals were coming to his house he was like if Donald Trump responds I'll be ready and I was like okay yeah good that was it and you know I'm in a bit like already had his next cipher written oh come on yeah I don't know like the pauses and everything or fake it's like you know hold up wait a minute you know I call come on it's like it's like a comic who like I'm gonna take suggestions from the audience oh it's McDonald's and you know you've done this act 50 times yeah I was like I seen the back when you don't mic the audience you ever watch one of those are like that just doesn't work there's a big long pause in its up but this was intentional he had time to post-production my favorite big thing was how he's got a bunch of black people sitting around watchin him yeah that's my favorite part I know they're all sitting around watching and he's he's doing on talking like well and he's not buddies with all of them he wants you to think that they came with straight out of central casting you think some of them I think some of them will they paid by the same people that pay the women to March yeah I think they're pretty I you saw a cipher okay that's one of the best moments ever um when when Alex Jones got high on the podcast and then it came up during his divorce hearing he was I smoked marijuana once a year to find out if George Soros is making it stronger there's there's doing something of the weed I gotta test it for potency Soros is imagine Soros sitting there in his fucking castle somewhere jack up the potency in the weed he not only said that he could remember his kids teachers names so he said well I had a big bowl of chili today I can't remember no it's too much of a liability with my I never month I just wanted for him if his lawyer he just hasn't been in LA he asked me to do his show in Austin and I'm sorry Alex I couldn't do it I was in and out I was in like in two hours before my shows I had two shows that night I had a fly out at 7 a.m. and the next day he's a very hospitable guy oh he's aggressively hospitable cuz he's gonna get us you'd left me a voicemail and you're also a jerk come on come on don't be a pussy just if I was just chasing us around there like if you find this guy punch him and let us know where people snapping pictures of us it's like we got to go so we did we were undercover at South by Southwest yeah Andy and we get a voice like I just don't understand why you know we have studios here and we can protect yours like you don't understand we are halfway to Waco we're out of town it was really trying to be very hospitable but we were just trying to get out of town I got more hate from that episode too but also I was like look don't you see why I love him like you see him when he's drunk and stoned and we're having a great time he's talking about interdimensional child molesters anyway he was Chris great television he's crazy that's great tell it like Alex Jones is a fun guy you know and look I'm not I don't believe everything he believes I don't I mean he believed Sandy Hook was fake you know I think it's a rough one I think he's dropped that since then and he tries to come up with some caveats or something like that or some some some things and we're not shown that we're real or yeah I don't know what the fuck that was all about that I've heard that one from a few careless people I'm like man you can't say that well then there was the Vegas thing was a conspiracy there's a lot of people think that one was a weird one but these really elephant's come up since then that is weird the what here's the Vegas one here's what's weird about the Vegas one it seems like there's differing opinions on timelines there's differing stories rather on timelines there's possibility that someone may have aided him right there's he and he the guy was a fucking evil cunt he covered his tracks I mean it's almost like he wanted people to go crazy search warrant document shows second person of interest after Las Vegas our hours really unsealed documents and a guys named Douglas Haig or something popped up okay well there you go that's it just so that Vegas review I mean who else is reporting this it makes me everywhere everywhere is everywhere okay yeah so I I would imagine that what's going on is there's probably somebody that helped him get the guns and helped him move them up into the room or something like there's a lot of sense yeah no I mean there are people saying like the bodies were faking that kind of stuff I know somebody who got shot there yeah I know somebody who got shot there one of the girls who was a ring-card girl was there while it happened and she escaped narrowly with her life while people were dropping right in front of her as she was running I'm Ashley as she was running people were getting shot right in front of her dan Bilzerian was there Dantonio lady's head blown off that's right he said a lady's head exploded right in front of him yeah that's where that's where let's say there's a conspiracy right let's say okay there's this let's say this is a second person help them let's even say there's a second shooter could have been could have been it doesn't undo the horror doesn't mean there was some conspiracy necessarily to cover up a second shooter maybe the new information has come to light and there's often a grain of truth sometimes and then people go there for and right it's just someone was trying to tell me what they reported shooters and all these other casinos but then the news never covered I know you don't understand when there's 50 people to get murdered by a guy who's shooting out of a fucking mandalay bay window you're gonna have chaos and when you have chaos people run into casinos there's a shooter there's a shooter they'll run into Circus Circus they'll run into MGM they'll scream there's a shooter people get on the phone they call it they call security there's a shooter at the MGM doesn't mean there's a shooter at the MGM it means there's chaos right and you get a lot of bad information let's the lot of echo I'm sure - so there's no chaos you don't know where it's coming from yeah yeah one of the girls that was at the UFC she got her leg blown out because someone got shot and killed right in front of her and the guy fell on her leg and it blew her ACL out yeah one of the fighters no no no one of the girls who was at the at the event Dana White got a bunch of people that got shot and everything in Dana White's the best and he brought these people to the event and you know it's like we did an event that week man I did a comedy show that week you know I did a comedy show at the Mirage that Friday I donated all the money to the Vegas Victims Fund but it was just like it was weird the whole thing was weird yeah that is um and it is weird to that you know saying okay country music festival yeah exactly those are right-wing people I mean so I'm not saying this is a left-wing extremist but it is weird that we didn't really hear a whole lot after that this guy didn't give a fuck who's killing he wasn't trying to kill country music people he did this at other music events too where he showed up and scanned it running and got hotel rooms and overlooked the exact same sort of a scenario he was plotting this he just wanted to kill a bunch of people and then kill himself he said and by the way here's another guy that was on some sort of psychic medication yeah and this is a constant in these mass shooters and this is one of the things that gets ignored and it should be fuckin front and center and everybody's mind they should be thinking what are we doing to people by giving them these pills what the fuck you know just like xanax or something he was on anti-domestic Chris Cornell was on when he hung himself that anti-anxiety medication is no joke and who knows what kind of a weird adverse reaction you're gonna have to that stuff oh yeah people react and they do the genetic testing now and I've done that for I don't know if you've done that like now they do it as a consumer thing 23andme right yeah but actually my doctor actually did genetic testing where we did in the office to check you know for predispositions towards diseases and also you can check to see which medications you might have negative interactions with mmm and they found out from there were certain painkillers that would be really bad that I wouldn't process super effectively and then some that would work same thing as far as even like I think it was celebrex would have been worse for me to take than Advil so things like that like this actually works better with your body chemistry Oh nobody gets a psychotropic medication I mean think of like I had negative interactions with a list of whatever antidepressants run there like do not take there was a green green column yellow column red column and most people don't know and it's not entirely accurate but they're saying that it's increasing the efficacy of medication by like 50 percent using this as a guideline that's fascinating yeah and you know and by the way that guy's whole family is fucking crazy that guy's dad was a serial bank robber the guy's brother got busted for child pornography that's what Whitney Cummings brought up the other day she thought it was the shooter is actually his brother I remembered after the fact I don't some on his computer to burn did they damn the whole family's fucking kids the shooter yes yeah the laptops I was in the room that one of the five laptops had apparently so maybe borrowed it from his brother that's his excuse yeah guarantee that's what he told before he shot himself well apparently this someone fired a gun in the room besides him to who fuck no so that was all in the room-service bill that was something that there was a lot there were a lot of conspiracies and that's like an example where I think people said no one had been to the room for a long time and then there was a room service bill that said someone had been to the room room service and then it looked like I think by the amount of food that they were possibly two people in the room mmm I've known fat people who go to the drive-thru one or two diet cokes hello make me feel less guilty check to see how much I dude I go I'll go to the gym and then I'll order room service and people like how many people Mike one though are you sure like bring it up bitch I ordered two entrees all the time yeah well cuz usually especially to forgetting Lee you want two times the meat or you want to yeah if I'm work if I'm lifting I fucking get hungry man yes episode ordering double meat that one time we went out with him oh my gosh she was just an animal but yeah double meat double no me just just double the meat yes it's like we don't do that like figure it out he's a strength trainer and he's also scientist and he he grows starting strengths and he just was we were somewhere and you just asked the server he goes please double the meat she goes well so you want you want a dollar more you want $2 more ease figure it out bitch but the room service bill that wasn't something where I read it no that's curious right the room service bill yes my points with the the truth of some of these conspiracies but people they go for a second the room service bill has two tuna fish sandwiches and one steak tartar therefore the Jews you know it's like well hold on a second you're making a huge leap and it makes it hard like there's there's a plus side to new media which we talk about this all the time we feel a lot of responsibility especially being more of an entertainment show where it's great because you can do this show and you don't have the same kind of time constraints and you can talk about things authentically but as long as you know for the YouTube stuff they allow us to but on the flip side is anyone can get information out there and there are people when they capitalize on that and proactively lie right and so like I get it that's a problem but the solution is not to have a bunch of people in Silicon Valley determining what's right what's right well I mean it's just like those flat earth fucks you can make a video on anything I mean if you want to make a bit and if it's compelling the same Flat Earth guy he's got a video on dinosaurs not being real nuclear bombs being fake satellites being fake Jitsu doesn't work Wing Chun is the shit fucking mine this guy and people people ignore that they ignore that and just like hey but flutter think pretty compelling man got a look into it Akito I wouldn't be there yeah came at me yeah I would not be there I'd sidestep you oh my god I post those on Instagram left and right yeah hashtag if you just look up hashtag legit as fuck that's my hashtag I put put up with all fake martial arts videos of like I don't know how many of them I posted Illuminati frames somewhere in there and you're set I'm now stop posting them man because now when you repost them I'm my fucking Instagram getting flagged what people are claiming them you know what martial arts but yeah even if they didn't make them they can claim them and say it's theirs and they can get it taken down from Facebook or Instagram shake you down for a few bucks they didn't necessarily film them but if they say it's theirs you have to prove it's not theirs there's a lot of squirrely people out there when it comes to videos online it's push the people who are Flat Earth claims video climbers one one person who tried to argue that with me and you know hold Mandela effect that's another thing yeah they're into he's like it's barren it's barren Stein bears not Berenstein bears like he thought I was gonna convince me I'm going what cuz it was cos I am NOT Shazam that genie movie with Shaq like that's a big thing for that this is the hill they died on but the same person with a flat earther and said something like okay it's an easy test the earth is spinning right if is spinning a thousand miles an hour okay you go up in a helicopter don't move go back down if you're in the same place it's a lie you know it and I said hold a second like I'm not a scientist but I know if I throw it baseball from the back of the bus it's going to the front of the bus because we're starting at the same velocity I mean this is basic physics that you would learn in high school so that's where for me all right Mount st. Helens doesn't volcano this way they just don't understand science they don't understand physics and they're just they say things and it's compelling to people there's photos of the fucking glaciers in Antarctica and they're like look is the ice wall like they really believe there's an ice wall yeah that was pretty badass well to save Donald Trump some money by imagining anybody keeping that secret imagine someone like someone hi well Jamie's got round earth show t-shirts for sale young Jamie calm oh do you sold out bitch but there's no why right like we're not scientists and there's a bunch that you could probably someone could come on and talk about the Earth's core and talk about the gravitational pull that we'd like oh well that's really I didn't know that I feel like an idiot but I can all I can't ask why would anyone want to convince me there's a flat earth yeah what or why would anybody want to convince you that it's round it's actually fun yeah I don't understand the ground earth is property too much people just love bullshit they get off on it an audience for it yeah but they enjoy it I think they really enjoy bullshit like I think people get excited about things that they can try to uncover I think it's like some human thing like like like I think they're gonna attack us you know like there's like a secret sort of like not a secret but like a thing in your head about uncovering secrets yeah yeah you know I think I think it appeals to the contrarians - yeah just like the piss people write it like to be right and a lot of them are just really uneducated I mean super uneducated like would they just don't understand basic physics like just a few things the martial arts thing is a good example with that because now Gojira is starting to do starting to do jujitsu and and weight training and this worker from actually the guy does my security that's true black belt okay and so he's just starting and we're gonna come into this studio do kind of some privates with them this guy's talking he's a crazy insanely sanely strong dude it's one of the guys who you look at you go oh it's the mind if I trained my whole life I wouldn't be that strong you know he walked in in high school to a gym mark Repp doesn't get some of them buck angel no no walked in at 16 16 and I found this corroborated by Mark ripto in Wichita Falls Texas when he found out this guy is no mark we just said he said wait are you talking about so-and-so was a friend of my totally accidental and he goes that man came into my gym it's 16 years old and accidentally snatched 270 pounds she's so this guy is anyways but you're super nice guy was super nice guy like we search going Kristen we always kind of joke about him or he's like you know I know like you know you can see there's something burning beneath the surface he's like you know I know it's not I know it's not good but I wanted to kill him one point he was doing security use like I could see him walking up top you can see just that little bit this shortest fuse but it's always amazing to me that people just deny it and it's like one second show me you turn about the Flat Earth thing Akito show me one video ever in the history of mankind of Aikido winning a fight against a mixed martial arts guy where I had someone who believed that Steven Seagal was a legitimate fighter I said okay that's a claim one video ever in the history of Steven Seagal fighting and unwilling I've never gotten more crap than our Bruce our Bruce Lee oh no we didn't I said he was a good theorist he was one of the early sort of mixed martial arts adopters but the fact is Bruce Lee would get killed by a decent flyweight in the UFC and people like how dare you well that's true and also the reality is the martial arts from 1970 versus the martial arts from 2018 there's been more radical change in martial arts by the understanding of technique since 1993 to 2018 than there's ever been in the history of martial arts and Bruce Lee was responsible for a big shift from 1970 to the UFC you it's very hard to find a single UFC fighter it wasn't a Bruce Lee fan or isn't currently a Bruce Lee fan including me and I think that what he did was introduced this open-minded approach to martial arts right taking what's useful from boxing from wrestling I mean look at you Enter the Dragon he's doing armbar you know he killed somebody killed Chuck Norris with a guillotine wasn't the best but I understand what you're saying but he's doing weird stuff he's doing he's eight he obviously wasn't a black belt in jujitsu no you know we talked about what people got really mad at is they're saying he would cream anybody like in the oppressor and so I said well hold on he's two inches shorter and 25 pounds lighter than not gay Jared and so we had not get jared in the Bruce Lee pancha school look it's like this he's 25 pounds heavier and doing just taller that's an idea as to how small of a man this is yeah it's just not dealing it like doesn't mean that he didn't write a good towel didn't write a good book the books great but it's also plagiarized he told really passages in in full without any acrid ation at all and took I don't want say in a bad way because I think what he was trying to do was just like his whole style he just took big chunks of books on boxing and other different martial arts and took verbatim passages from that maybe plagiarizing is not the right word because what it is what he did was like a collection of martial arts technique and so one of the things he did see it was he wasn't an author you know what he was got was a martial artist and he was collecting different you know writings on different styles see Bruce Lee the Doughty a Oh of jeet kune do-- plagiarized passages again I'm a giant Bruce Lee fan I'm not shitting on them but I'm but I think it's also very important I own the Dow of Jeet Kune Do I think it's very important that he did collect these important works on different martial arts and he was the first dude when I first started out doing martial arts when I was doing Taekwondo you had a just do Taekwondo when I branched out and started doing Muay Thai and started kickboxing they were very against it a lot of the traditionalist was very against it very against trying out other techniques they just didn't they just didn't think it was necessary and I was like that is crazy I'm sparred with these guys getting kicked in the legs it's fucking awful right I'm gonna learn how to do this yeah you guys I'm not I'm not gonna not learn this somebody kicked my leg once I was like oh we got we got a new thing gonna change this I learned that same thing would you Jitsu soon as I did you Jitsu I was like I know how to fight I got fucking raped I mean literally like doll by some guy was exactly the same size me like oh okay now I gotta learn this cuz there's no fucking whack and go through life thinking I know how to fight why this guy's out there guy was a purple belt too he wasn't even like you know it wasn't bigger than me close to my age he killed me and then even you're a black belt you're accomplished and then you roll someone like I rolled with I'm fortunate enough to have rolled some good guys because I travel and you'll be like oh okay here's a black belt this guy's kicking my ass and then I rolled with the worst I've ever had in my life nice guy so please don't mistake this was Lucas Lecce he was not flow like I've rolled with Michelle Garcia we've had Boucher coming Gabriel Vela cyborg like all these different studies guys but Lucas Lecce I think was just like if you're a bigger guy and you go and you roll with him and he actually accidentally he just he did a collar pole was icky that was so hard I put my hand out to post and I popped my shoulder out of the socket oh Jesus first ten seconds and so then he gets my back and I was really able but you can see in the tape I don't know if I still have it I'm doing this and it was so fast I was like oh so that's what that's like so nice you can give more pressure more pressure you always never want to hurt the black right right no there's no chance you I mean you could hurt him but you don't want to go aggro on them well cuz these guys people want to take their head off yeah you know what I mean and so don't want to be that but late che was just super nice but pop my shoulder on 12 seconds just there's a lot of guys that are like that they roll hard or they don't roll at all you know I don't even know that was hard I think it was so Swift from he knows what time I went off right and he just it was a basic he was sitting and you just grabbed the collar and just just like a just pulled that's it I guess you're kind of expecting that he'll go torreón de Mike dragon will know boom old-school collar yank I just posted and felt oh did you find anything on Bruce Lee I started looking it up it's a bunch of like foreign post and whatnot I found one blog post I was like the annotated thing and it sort of shows a quote from it and then says where the quote was from oh okay yeah it's not like the best alright well I hope I'm not wrong cuz this is what somebody who I know and respect very well told me and then I remember reading it somewhere but again it doesn't take anything away from how I feel about Bruce Lee I think he's very important in the history of martial arts maybe one of the most important figures ever outside of hoist Gracie and Ellie Oh Gracie I suppose things where the truth is enough and you wonder why people feel feel like the truth isn't enough right Bruce right if you'd only embellish it like the truth was real worship yeah you know that being said it was a slightly racist caricature of you as Bruce Lee no we did do that once so because we did him doing the Mickey Rooney Breakfast at Tiffany's and so we were like this is so racist like he's literally just doing Mickey Rooney Breakfast at Tiffany's what do you think make you grin he's a white guy what the fuck's wrong with you oh my god it's hilarious yeah well how about when they used to have the guy play Charlie Chan he was the whitest motherfucker that's ever lived he's playing like a six-foot three white guy playing a Chinese detective like they wouldn't let Chinese people act back then like if you were gonna make a major role I'd like the star of a movie you had to be a white guy have you seen the new spider-man though yeah no you kind of wonder if that's something we should I hate to say can you ask could we address the Alpha in the room pretty clear that often Asians are not the best actress I'll stand by it yeah well you never watched one age of Carreras movies that's why I've act you know in the 90s they just said put Dean Cain in there call it a day he's got a nutty tie she did some great work as a porno star it's so embarrassing of his embarrasses you have you ever had Dean Cain in the show but no no I'd love to uh no my god you ever watched his Princeton highlight he set three like all-american records really yeah and football he's only flike 511 ton of points yeah turn of Princeton records but also once I met him once it's something super smart dude he did somewhat Joey Diaz he did a series did those movies like the dog who saves Christmas yeah oh yeah movies yeah Joey says he's a great guy he's very smart good-looking to the point of being aggravated uncomfortable right yeah that fucking face handsome look at his Princeton highlight YouTube Dean Cain highlight he's got he's got an advantage of some of these photos especially what be next to Gillian the only guy that played Superman that didn't get like something really wrong happened to him right there was like a Superman curse George Reeves curse with brows just turned out to suck yeah they just turned up he's too Breton Ralphie Kevin Spacey's lex luthor remember that was a reboot now I was gone by that I just I left the franchise yeah how was it pay attention know that henry cavill now it's like it like when you get to the third different spider-man I'm out yeah I'm kind of done with superhero films now for a while us there's something really interesting no I'll still go see anything with the Hulk oh really come on in a while I love went along to fucking freaks out but I now that Mark Ruffalo who's like super social justice warriors the whole can do it you just separate the armed guards but like that's just that Bernie prick I can't do this well he's also he's just like he's already receipts - which is weird socialist needs like a conspiracy like you know Mark Ruffalo I I don't want to speak out of school but I think he has a brain tumor with a brain tumor almost Mark Ruffalo has brain cancer we've all got a lot I'm sorry I love doing as well as your article talks about his brother's murder and his brain tumor Oh see there you go it's gonna bring you asshole yeah he's got a brain tumor so maybe that's where the conspiracy theories are all coming from what conspiracy theories I don't I don't remember him he was somewhere and it was like you know I couldn't tell you I wouldn't want to speak out of turn but Emerson being surprised because anyone who's far left it was like kind of like big brother government oh my god that's weird for you to think big brother's watching but want a bigger big brother all right right right yeah that's the problem right they think 9/11 truther Oh mark money mark yeah another one of those things it's like you look at it after the fact and you go look at all these connections like okay maybe maybe just chaos and two guys flew planes and a bunch of guys flew planes into buildings well I think the problem is I think they're capitalizing what we were talking about right which is real no one wanted to cover the antiphon issue no one wants to no one wants talk about the puberty blockers to kids and this being considered hate speech there it's true there is a media cover-up but a lot of information certainly I would say instead of a cover-up there is a monopoly on informational distribution right there sure real that's real people when you find that out it kind of opens your eyes you're going okay what else don't I know so people take that and then try and capitalize on it with lies which is you didn't know jay-z's in the Illuminati 9/11 is an inside job and it just goes on because there's there's some truth to it and you but the problem is you want to get people searching but it does it true that if this is gonna run your post office orchestrated the biggest terror attack on America yes yeah I think there's there was some taking advantage of the events in order to pass policy that wasn't passable before the Patriot Act yeah the Patriot Act was drafted long before 9/11 they pushed it through and then there's there's a lot that I think you could contribute to them taking advantage of this tragedy but the idea that they orchestrated it man that's just it doesn't it doesn't the port-a-john the burden of proof is on them to say that well I think they did you see loose change you know there's a lot of people that believe you know what I find that crazy about that is that you know this crazy corrupt government the 9/11 Commission report ok George Bush like a mark ruffalo but then you look at the drone strikes with Barack it's like all of a sudden wears coat all this goes away right there's one that's consistent no I don't hate George Bush I know I'm probably the minority here I don't think he was a great president I don't think he's as bad as a lot of people you know Green Day thinks he was I don't think he was a great president but the point is um I don't want George Bush to have unfettered power right nor Barack Obama nor Donald Trump it's not selective I don't trust any of them yeah Mike Baker who used to be in the CIA told me that those drone strikes are those are designed or rather dictated by lawyers like when what what gets passed and what gets passed through they its lawyers lawyers make the final decision yeah I was like reeling he's like yeah it's lawyers they decide like hey you know what how many people are in this building that are friendlies so doesn't use nations decide who's gonna be going over there wait what what son of a bitch first it was Bruce Lee now it's the Asians and the Jews together well you know they do cause it was speaking hey boys I gotta end this question it's a little bit past 12:00 am I gonna get out of here a little bit of passed off or rather I gotta get out of here okay but um thank you so much thank you and listen thanks for these videos you guys do they're funny they're informative and I think especially that transgender one that really freaked me out I think a lot of stuff you guys do is very important glad we could help a lot of is just ridiculous but keep that up - thanks all right not gay Jerrod on Twitter and of course your s Crowder on Twitter right alright bye everybody Thanks [Music] [Applause] [Music]
