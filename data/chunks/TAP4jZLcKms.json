hello freak bitches that tank is also something that helped you and this is where the connection to this journal comes from while you were going through this breakup you kind of reassessed your whole life it was really interesting to watch you know you you came when you called me up and you were really bummed out and she kicked you out and you were in a hotel room yeah and I'm like hey fucking come live with me and then you moved in you were like just a little frazzled do you really thanks a lot man I really appreciate them okay I'm living by myself this is all good you know Duncan's living with me now we're gonna have some fun it's been yeah dude everything's gonna be fine but you were clearly like lost you know you and you'd you would like God you know when you get dumped man it's like this fucking feeling of shit I don't have a home anymore like where am i sleeping now massive like just torture just and change complete you've been living this certain way long enough to to get used to it and all of a sudden everything absolutely changes like just a huge tour turn that you probably thought could happen but you you know trying to imagine that it wasn't even a possibility and it happens well that yeah that's like you go into shock you're attached to a certain rhythm a certain pattern a certain set of surroundings that massively changes you go into shock and that is the perfect time to get in a fucking flotation tank when everything's discombobulated and floating around inside of you and all the all the weird assemblage of emotions and more than anything though what's cool about that shit is you get a real taste of truth like that's what truth is right there that's like the experience of truth which is change which is dramatic radical change fucking unavoidable happens all the time the isolation tank keeps you from distracting yourself and makes you think about your life yeah it makes you think about what's going on so for me it was so fascinating having you here at a real low point and watching you pull right out of it right out of it like very quickly like you when you got into that tanker within a few weeks man you were laughing about shit and joking around about shit yeah yeah they always cool it was you it definitely definitely helped and that's why your this my friends are so important because like if you don't have friends and you get into that predicament Oh terrible so worse feeling more it feel completely alone yeah yeah and but you know even if you don't have friends you can still pull yourself out of it but you have to I guess really want you know you you have to want to yeah yeah you well it's it's mean it's look anyone can can improve their surroundings so you can improve your situation but it was really interesting for me watching you because it was a such an unusual opportunity for both of us it was an unusual opportunity for me to watch someone who didn't have a lot of experience with the tank but who was such a curious person and psychedelically experience thank you and then have access to this thing on a daily basis you know and for me to watch you go from this like really low point to like like really like gaining ground like you came out of it like stronger it was so fucking cool climbing out of that thing in that state of being in the in the state of like having had because you know there so I could psychedelics are not limited to drugs I get there are many ways to induce a psychedelic state of mind the tank being one of them and another way to induce a psychedelic state of mind is to have dramatic change happen in your life that rips back whatever delusion you are living by and shows you the true universe yeah people turn to the term psychedelic to a lot of people means like seeing things that aren't there hallucinations dancing mice you know shit like that pink elephants flying sky that's not a real psychedelic state the real psychedelic state is the dissolution of cultural conformity and the your ideas of the universe all your predetermined patterns of thinking all your your adopted behavior patterns all that gets stripped away and you're left with the core of you and your decisions and and what what you can and can't change and how you led yourself into a position where you were so weak in the first place that you you know you needed saving from like what what we're why did you have no foundation why did you fall apart what what is it about you know life and about trying to get by in this world that leaves are so fucking vulnerable sometimes and so in need of other human beings is to stack us up and to hold us up and watching you man was really fucking cool it was really cool because you really used it man you got in there all the time you know and you were you were getting out and talking about it and it was it was fucking trip you know I don't know if you wrote it about it in the thing because I didn't read it I've had that thing for years didn't even take a look at that I'd read to him over the phone and then he made me stop and I said alright I won't read any more of it I think it's like 2004 what year was this 2004 or 2005 I believe it was yeah ah it's cool though I mean you're you you got a window into a certain time of your life you know where you were you were in the shits well I'll tell you man that unfortunately happens but you know you say that but I don't think it's unfortunate at all oh right man if you were stuck with that chick now know Jesus Christ think about that think about your situation now and think about your situation then how much happier you are now I could have been stuck mean but if you know if you talked her into taking you back or something gross oh the child or you know I mean it's funny how you're a different human now then yeah and you're so much more confident you know it's one of things that I saw when you went up in Montreal right like even your SATs now you're so much more confident you go up there you so much more you know you're so much more what's the word you you're resigned to who you are yeah not not resigned rather you're you're not ugly but it's not resigned that that's because that sounds like you're giving up it's not that's not what I mean you're you are completely aware of who you are that's the best way of saying it yeah that when you're going onstage now you're going onstage not trying to convince them of anything you're just this is me and this is what I'm doing is what I have to say whereas before you were like hey I hope you like me you do you like me you don't like me well here I'm gonna say something I guess I guess that weird yeah I think the reason the word resigned popped out of your mouth first is because I think there is a certain level of being of and it sounds like it's like I'm giving up but resigned can also be like a kind of surrender where you're like I'm just no longer going to spend time with our onstage or offstage I'm not gonna spend time anymore trying to convince myself or other people that I'm some certain way and I'm gonna start trying to approach people from where I'm at yes which yes which is not a perfect place for most people most most of us are you know have fucked up things that we do why wouldn't you I mean you're gonna look at where you're at like you say we're in a fucking ball flying through fucking space how are you supposed to adapt to this in some brilliant way right off the bat you know you yeah it's a chimp you're in this insane dimension where we're getting rocketed through space where you're gonna die you're surrounded by people who call themselves your family that you're supposed to have attachments to they're gonna die you're in a life where you've just adopted certain modes of being I didn't have a baby I didn't get married but a lot of people do when they weren't ready and they weren't supposed to and they get married and they have a baby and they are theoretically for this incarnation pretty fucking trapped they're in a lot of people are a lot of people have that they have all kinds of weird situations where the relationship they're stuck somehow or another that's because of a mortgage or because of a business they started together until a mental idea of how things are stuck with some person or you give birth to a child that has like a melted brain and you've got to take care of like a little like sick kid for 12 years or like there's so many different ways that your particular DNA can get rivulet it down into a shitty trap where you're just like there's it's like that's why I like that movie you said you didn't want to see it and I'm sorry if you've seen it didn't like it but what was that 127 hours did you see that no I didn't see it because I knew the story and I I don't want to watch them dude hi it's just a torture movie there's no reason to watch everybody says that it's a torture movie like it was fixated on the gore the but it wasn't it's a fucking metaphor which is that sometimes doing the thing you love to do whatever it is and that's for a lot of people's fucking doing the thing you love most you can end up getting your goddamn arm tender you're connecting someone having a baby to cutting your arm off that's funny no if you have a baby for the right reason no I know he's saying for the wrong reason no no I know what you're saying you're you're saying what a lot of single people with no children say and what you're saying is you know we were talking about our friend who tweeted something about having a child is like the exact opposite of winning the lottery yeah I used to think the exact same way until I had children but my situation is very different in that first of all I'm older I've had more experience in life and I'm secure financially and happy in the relationship so it was all good things at a good time but when I look back on past relationships some of them there was a bunch of relationships and I've been in you know like way back in the day when I was younger and I really didn't know what the fuck I was doing I was hanging around with chicks that I probably really didn't even like that much but I was still having sex with them and sometimes you'd have like a crazy fucking breakup or crazy that really to that person could be out there with your kid and then you have to deal with all kinds of the nonsense that comes with that I mean we all know somebody that has kids you know that's in some shit situation yeah so I hear what you're saying man what but that so what yeah what I'm really saying is like the idea and it goes back to what you're being comfortable resigned to who you are yes that's why I didn't like the way I said resign not in meemers eyes my eyes sometimes you have to be resigned you know what I mean not all of us are fucking Charlie Sheen from Mars not all of the sort of freaking rock stars yeah some of us are like you know we all got to pretend I'm not special we're fucked up in a lot of ways man and and that's if you start from it's like you know one thing that I would try to do when I used to work out and it's like when I when I when I first start working out I would try to lift weight that was so much more heavy than what I should have been lifting out of this sense of like I could lift heavy weights and so now I'm like trying to lift like way too well I'm like why should be at the fucking pink weights and I'm like you know what I mean I'm trying to do like really fucking heavy weights cuz it's like this is how I see myself down the line after I've been lifting pink weights for a while that's how you get to the heavy weights right but if you start off right away trying to pump those fucking heavy weights then its disaster you're gonna pull your fucking muscles like people knew how you know like due to lifting weights one guy I think came up to me he's like looking at me like what are you doing he's like that's way too much weight and so this is like having a kid when you're 16 having a kid when you're 16 or deciding that you're a famous comedian before you are young onstage after a couple of months and getting in your fucking head that you're like you've been doing stand-up for 15 years or being a fucking painter when in like just immediately thinking you're a great painter because I have had friends who've gotten into painting right and they've only painted for a year and they show me some of their paintings and the look on their face is like I'm supposed to react to it like I'm seeing a Picasso or something it's like I hate almost everyone that shows me things that I'm supposed to look at that they did almost every time someone does that to me I'm like are you really gonna do this to me man please don't make me read your fucking script don't ask me to read your script you fuck my strip bro it's the worst Oh the worst is when it's bad and then you're obligated to talk to them and go oh here's the situation you know you basically did men in black meets back to the future written by a 12 year old man it's pretty good man it's pretty good well now then you're see that's the thing that's where you get and I think kind of what we're talking about which is like at some point you have to make a decision am I going to spend the rest of my life lying to the world am I gonna spend the rest of my life been trying to manipulate people around me because I'm too lazy to tell them the truth or am I just gonna start telling the truth but what if it though it's a friend that's written something really cool what if someone has got a script and I mean that's the problem with all the shit heads that want you to read their scripts it makes you super skeptical for the occasional rare person actually write something good right I was just like yeah I think this is pretty good you want to read it you know like yeah all right I'll read it you know what I mean how many how many of those are there most people I know who are really good at things they don't ask me to look at it I end up looking at it because I want to yeah like my friend emo Lee just visited like his musics fucking good so like I try to get new CDs of his cuz I want to listen to it that's really fucking good yeah but sometimes somebody else sends you something or somebody be in their car if they're a musician and then they'll put their shit up I never let them get in your car with a CD in your hand cuz you're suddenly you're forced suddenly not just to evaluate how miserable an artist they are how cliche and shitty their music is but also you have to you realize that the fact that they felt comfortable playing this for you means they think it's good so they they're so deluded and so fucked that they're like oh yeah I'm gonna I've even waiting all day to play their music
