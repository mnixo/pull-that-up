five four three two one boom and we're live mr. Bisping how are you sir what's up Joe I'm good he finally did this man Idaho we've been talking about it for years feels like a lifetime it's you know it's been quite a while man yeah yeah but yeah happy to be here quite the setup you have as an Englishman please explain to me the Hawaiian flag what the fuck is that the Hawaiian flag I'm like y'all confused I was looking at the other day when max Holloway won I was like if I didn't if you didn't know any better and you looked at that he's like this is some strange right off the bottom like kills a smart guy I've seen the podcast he goes deep on things I'm like do I need to read some encyclopedias before I come on here and the first thing he says explain the British flag sorry the Hawaiian flag what is that well it's like claim to be an expert on the history of Hawaii I failed that class funnily enough but I would say that we colonized it at one point much like America right don't know if you know this much like yeah you got Australia India yeah Australia's got a funky fuck yeah you know whoo we like to insert the Union Jack in in lots of things and you think about the size of England how much of the world you guys kicked ass on it's pretty goddamn impressive it really is but again I'm no historian no but no it is I'm a proud Englishman I guess our ancestors well not my ancestors I'm my ancestors are polish and Irish but but yeah the British they did okay did a lot of shit got a lot done but they did they did you know I was at a they did a lot of terrible things I'm sure of it yeah I remember once I was in there in Canada at at a party of all things about two o'clock in the morning as well you know as one does and I walk in and some guy starts going crazy at me the things that the British have done over the years you should be ashamed of yourself when he was causing a huge scene really screaming at me right and I mean going crazy and I'm like dude what the fuck nothing to do with me is that you should be ashamed so in the end I said well where's your family from and you're not gonna believe this he said Mongolian Germany your age you're a German and you giving me shit about my heritage okay buddy I suggest you shut the fuck up that's pretty hilarious is a song about the history the Germans way more reason oh yeah just a little bit just a little stuff is in the past come on it's like with swords and arrows and shagged Robin Hood time come on come on you know yeah very much so you know I mean of course you know you miss you miss home you miss friends and family certainly you know as you get older and your parents get older you know you do think about those things but yeah it's great it's great place to live you are your accent has tamed it's all a bit well when you back home do they give you shit about it I get shit all the time yeah all the time and they're like what's this weird accent Mike and it's like this I'm intelligent enough to adapt to the surroundings that I'm in you know like I'll now say tomatoes instead of tomatoes because I don't want a cute little back-and-forth of five minutes with the fucking waitress do you know what I mean I just want to order my breakfast to go bomb with it oh my god you're English you know what it means I'll say tomorrow I'll say coffee but when I go back home it kind of you know and then working on Fox they worked on me for a while they let Mike we like what we think we like what you say the problem is we can't understand what you say it seems like it's good stuff there's lots of energy there but you gotta slow down well for pronounce your words so so yeah it is a little bastardized have you thought about doing commentary on UFC cards have you done yeah I've just done the what is it the content the series that's it yeah that's it but but I think it's well I know it well should be coming ups just negotiated a deal for it so great with Zach so yeah yeah yeah you know cuz you're really excellent as an analyst well thank you very much I appreciate enjoy your insight when you're on the panel that panel is great that is one of the best things UFC's done yes do that post fight show because when the fights are over you're sitting around going fuck holy shit yeah and then have you guys break it down and then break it down beforehand as well but break it down afterwards I really do enjoy that Oh you very much yeah the guys do a good job yeah it's fun you know I mean it's it's nice to be involved with the sport obviously as a martial arts as a fighter and then now retired still you know still have a little hand in there yeah it's it's nice yeah but you've made a smooth transition from being a fighter to retired it seems least from the outside that it seems fairly smooth like some guys have a rocky road it's it's hard for them well it's because you know I mean I I want to tell the truth while I'm on air so I will tell the truth but you know I had eye injuries you know so you know every from from when the eye injuries happened in 2013 I always felt like I was on borrowed time so I was conscious of trying to set myself about side of the Octagon where a lot of fires don't have that luxury you know I'm thinking it could end at any moment so I was actively pursuing a life outside the arc toward a career outside the Octagon so then when that day came I was good you know excuse me some carbonated energy drink that shall remain nameless but yes so so ya know I was working on that for a while and yes you know things are going well you know there's quite a lot of things going on so when you do that podcast with Luis Gomez got the podcasts believe you may I've got a company called play lime it's a it's a gambling it's fancy sports but it's fancy sports simplified basically it's kind of like a sports lottery so if we were focusing on the UFC who's gonna win what round how many takedowns we do five stats you hit them bangun you got a billion dollars we had the analytics groups at Harvard and Yale comin with this league so the top 50 people split every way everything you've you're a billion yet a billion dollars one ba-ba-boom million dollars baby let me give away a million dollars every single day play line combo married it is he's blowing up it's blowing up big time we're just about to sign a deal with a couple of major sports franchises to be their official game so so that's going really well so it's essentially like a fantasy martial arts thing like you just know it's NASCAR football Mme the beauty of play line is you can set a play line to anything like we can set a play line how many times he's Bisping on a burp how many times is gonna get up another pace how many times is rocker gonna roll his eyes at Mike you know what I mean you can set it for anything so it's very applicable how many times how many likes he's Kim Kardashian gonna get in a next post you know what I mean so it's there you beginning a lot of traction it's doing really really well very proud of it I would think if it's a billion dollars I would think it would be like some guy ritchie movie where that some mobsters would get together with some fighters this is how we're gonna do it down three times oh yeah I've never heard an English gangster salad from 1920 Chicago you see this is what I'm gonna do see but yeah yeah I guess know is that has nobody cheated yet you know it's totally undermining the system Joe really appreciate it the reason why I say this is because this will happen with professional pool professional pool had a line at one point in time in Vegas casinos and the pool players all got together and said listen let's fucking put all our money on this guy who's a ten to one favorite to win it or ten to one underdog to win it and we'll all make money and so they all dumped and this one guy I think his name's Mike LeBron he won the whole thing the only way he could do that is if there was no stats no starts right so if it was game of basketball everyone would just have to stand there and do nothing right which I would assume I mean I don't know too much about basketball but I would assume athletic commissions referees somebody would say something if everyone was just standing there doing nothing well they did with pool they you don't can't gamble on pool anymore oh really cool players are too shady mmm well they are there shady the shady guys you know anyone that plays pool in England is because they spent so much time in pubs exactly he spent so much time in pubs you're hanging out with some interesting characters yeah you know yeah I'm savory characters dude you you started at UFC Ultimate Fighter season - how crazy three what's you season three three what what season of the unknown some shit what are they on I think they just did 28 28 but that's but that's only us they have the Brazilian one they have Australian Diego Sanchez is still fucking going on it that's what's insane that's impressive seizing one he's a maniac he's God bless him you know good for him good for him and he fuckin won recently which is you know impressive no I know any fights in a way that isn't conducive to a long career no but he's had one my word I think reading him it really is he really is he warrior such a fuckin character - ah dude he's out of his mind in a good way I mean that's a compliment I do as well yeah ya know he's a maniac but I mean that guy season one and still still faster now I know I know crazy crazy it's been a long ride for myself as well but enjoyed it enjoyed every minute of it it was great nice - nice to leave having won the title though right Oh 100% oh yeah nice is that to cap it off cuz you had such a long career man I mean you fought the best of the best and for you to cap it off knocking out Luke Rockhold and then having that oh no one could take that away from you for know for sure you know I mean I was talking about this recently I'm filming a documentary called built for this and it's about my career and they were asking about that you know how would you feel excuse me this carbonate you get is you drink that shall remain nameless energy drink called creatures I'm like that's creature demon something like that mythological where was it yes scary scary monster there you go um no no they were asking about my fight career how would I have felt had I not won the belt and you know I mean it would have felt like it was unfinished business mmm I wouldn't have been quite as content as walking away when I did how'd I not won the Bell other than winning the belt whoop and winning the ultimate fighter I'm sure but what was your most satisfying victory was it Conley no no I satisfying victory my word Oh Anderson Silva Anderson so yeah for me yeah that was a big one too because the the cheap knee it was cheap it was like I said that it was cheap I mean I'm a giant Anderson Silva fan yeah you know everybody is you don't get any bigger interesting self in than me but right you didn't have your mouthpiece you were pointing to the mouthpiece you were separated and you took a pause and you thought the referee was gonna separate you and give you back your mouthpiece and Anderson comes in with the knee well I know the rules there has to be a lull in the action for the referee to step in you know and I'm backing up and we're not engaging in blows to me that's a little in the action yeah so I take that moment to point down over here and say my mouthpiece and as I'm down there boom he throws a beautiful knee it's beautiful it really was yeah good for him you know I don't hold it against the guy it is what it fucking came back that took every part of my will to continue but yeah you came back and won the next round mm-hmm that was what yeah spectacularly impressive but that's what you said what is the most satisfying win and I said that was one of them of course you know beating buckled and winning the belt nothing's helped stop that a big one too because you came in on short notice as well sure sure but the yeah the end of someone because of that you know it just made the storyline so much better yeah you know to fight through that adversity to you know have to dig deep after winning it um you know I won the first drop to him dropped in the second round third round I was winning then that happened so ya know it felt good it felt good yeah that was uh though I mean that also like to just to get a victory over that guy when it all said and done there's there's some yeah listen I'm aware of that people would say oh but you didn't get Anderson in his prime well maybe it wasn't his prime but with the amount of shit that I talked I certainly see a difference in the way for me to the weights for recently you know and yeah it's funny because people always say oh you don't worry that when you talk shit going into a fight that you're gonna motivate your opponent even more and I always used to say that don't be stupid listen they're gonna try and hit you as hard as they can but I don't know in that one I think it did motivate Anderson because he was certainly not fucking about in that one that's for sure no you it wasn't it wasn't like the Anderson in the Derek Brunson fight that's for sure yeah that was a different fight right Darren Brunson and him almost like look they made an agreement they didn't fight yeah it was a weird fight yeah it's like Derek Bronson didn't want to risk anything didn't want to engage with them too too quickly or go too hard but you see some of his fights he comes at you like a fucking Marauder whoo Dirk grunts oh yeah no absolutely I was talking about this recently with the Israel out of Sonya fight mm-hmm and I think I kind of pissed Israel off with a couple of my comments and that wasn't my intention I said I said I'm not I don't know if I'm completely sold on Israel yet and what I meant by that I didn't mean sold on him being a great fire because he's clearly a great very clearly world class what I meant was sold on him being the future of the division and being the champion that's what I meant because Brunson never showed up in that fight and I mean that were the grace of respect he was like a deer in the headlights you know he was intimidated he'd just been knocked out of Jacare you know a little gun-shy you know and it was a great performance Israel did what he needed to do but as I say you know it takes two to tango and it was only Israel really fighting in that fight so when I said those comments I said I'm not entirely sold on that fight that's what I meant I didn't mean because I don't think he's world-class or excellent fire because he clearly is I just meant not sold on that fight whether or not he's the future of the division well it's a stacked fucking division I mean look you mean you still have your well Romero at the top of the heap I don't know what they're doing with him I mean he was supposed to be fighting boa China oh yeah Paulo Costello Costa Maha Chien yeah who's a fucking monster yes anybody who's not on steroids who looks like they're on steroids it's him Wow it's not that easy these days because you've started but come on some of them are on steroids somebody God probably are Joe but who's on okay you telling me that you don't believe that your Romero ever took a steroid in his life I didn't say that okay oh definitely in school I think it's possible how's that fed you sitting on I get it so chop scenario for you to be in no no see commentary you fucking honest bro I believe it I'll say it and let's not forget he tested positive there was not holes yes anytime somebody says it was a tainted supplement yeah it's bullshit you never tested positive friend never tested positive in my life let me tell you something I'm not a guy that scours the back of everything I've read I'm a careless motherfucker I really am I wish I wasn't but I am I'll just go through my life doing what I do I've been tested a million times never come close okay some of the guys they blow up the lab yeah you know there's no smoke without fire you know what I'm saying I agree with you I agree with you I remember there was talk years back before you sada there was talk of certain camps that would hire guys who knew testing and these guys would orchestrate a program for these fighters to make sure that they didn't get caught right they would figure out ways to you know to taper off but still keep your gains and and make sure that you didn't test positive at all and this was done under the assumption that everyone else was cheating as well and this was for a long time that was how a lot of people viewed the sport there was guys like you BJ Penn there's a few guys that you just knew weren't gonna do anything it was their word they said they were never gonna do anything go and and they never looked like they did anything you always maintained the exact same physique throughout your entire career well the thing is I I think where they started getting a little weird and I don't wanna bang on about steroids too much because that's been a narrative that I've over yeah you know yeah I've said my piece about the writer you know banging on about it too much but I think where the waters really got murky is when TRT came in yes testosterone replacement therapy became a thing and all you had to do was go to a doctor and said hey you know I can't get a hard-on or whatever and all of a sudden they sign you off for CRT no I know even worse you could take steroids first and then come off of it so your testosterone was low I'll really go to a doctor and say I've low testosterone natural production of this is what caused it guys took steroids and then went in afterwards and said they have low testosterone because they were on steroids sure no exactly so then it became legal then you had all these guys coming out there saying you know if I'm not on TRT I'll die I'll die and then the outlawed it and then ten years later some of them are still fighting to this day yes you know so without naming names you know who you are shame on you well we talked about trt Bellefleur trt vitor belfort forever yeah it was when he was on trt he was a different kind of human being he was just completely different than he is in our circumstance oh yeah looking back you can see that I mean cuz when I fought him I fought him on see I'd say you fought him when he was that though the super Victor absolutely look like fucking The Incredible Hulk he had butt muscles on his fucking eyebrows yeah looking back you can see that you know but but at the time as a fighter you gotta be you can't think like that you know what I mean even doing just doesn't do it justice that's supposed to be before and after I'm just recovering from a cold at awake I'm a little congested so keep coughing the real the real key that's better that's way better that's much more accurate and he's a guy who was known to take things took things early in his career everybody fought Randy when you're 19 he was 240 pounds yeah yeah exactly his neck start at the top of his head yeah but yeah I remember there was a picture of us both on the scale in Brazil and you know looking back now you whole shit you know anyone else with you seen this guy he's kind of big ba-ba-ba-ba-ba but you don't think like that at the time you can't as a fight if you start having those thoughts those doubts start looking at a fighter's physique and thinking oh he looks good you've already lost right now but in hindsight you can look back and say holy fuck what was I thinking you know this guy's fuckin bored out of his mind I remember on there I was trying to get a rise out of him and he kept putting his hand in my face I'm not a religious guy and you know God bless anyone that is you know I I mean that I respect everyone's opinions but I'm not as we know Vito is heavenly religious and he kept sticking his thing in my face he was pissing me off so Vito come here come here and he leans you know I said there is no Jesus maybe there is maybe there is no me getting drops with a head kick in the second round maybe that was God for watching me who knows what did he say some fucking Portuguese bullshit [Laughter] this there's the fine line right between talking shit and and backing uh yeah but you know you you you did a great job of pissing people off in your career and that is that plays a factor that whatever you could do to get just them a little bit out of their comfort zone a little bit out of their composure I and you you were really good at that yeah how do you know you know I mean I hate that to be you know the first things people say about me but you know what's one it was it was a thing you know it was what I did and in my mind you know where I come from my background you know if we're gonna fight then we're gonna fight and then it's all-out war you know and until it's all said and done and if I can make you doubt yourself if I can you know it's like at the weigh-ins at the ways that's the last time you're gonna get a chance to stand in front of your opponent send a message to him you know what I mean and if you get in his face and you can just instill a little fear puff your chest that's why animals do it in the wild you know what I mean puffy chest out look intimidating look who's angry as you can you know and and some fighters might just look at that and laugh and said this ain't gonna work on me but some it does yes and then and then they don't fight to the best of their ability because they're slightly doubting themselves and they're not fully committing to the punch or the kick and if they're not fully committing they're not 100% they're not fighting as well as they can be and I'm winning that ball you know so yeah you look like kind of a thug standing up there and pointing your finger and talking shit but it's for a reason you know it works yeah and there was its McGregor McGregor is the best at it you know yeah gets people to fold look at Dustin Poirier did he show up in that first fight it's true you know and yeah I mean don't get me wrong he was great as well you know it wasn't just the trash talk hmm no he's great as well I think the Nate Diaz fight didn't it didn't work in that fight yeah Nate doesn't give a fuck doesn't give a fuck there you go doesn't work exactly it doesn't work and talk shit at him he's like fuck you it doesn't yeah it doesn't make him feel bad at all I enjoyed it and I feel comforting yeah well you know just another day at the office you know it's uh it's the thing like a lot of people would wish that fighters were respectful and just you know we did it well the martial arts way and bow to each other and that's great it is you know it's funny I was working out this morning and the gym manager he said he said you know I said I feel like that side of things kind of you know it's killing the UFC you know I nodded away and like you know respectful to the guy yeah but I I see his point I understand what he's saying but it's entertainment and he gets people that that's another reason why I used to do it you trying to sell the fight you know what you want you want every product you're involved with to be as popular as possible whether it's a podcast whether it's fighting whether it's well whatever it is if no one's watching no one gives a fuck then you're not gonna make much money you're not gonna get bucked again you're not gonna be on the big cards you talk a little I know from a consumer standpoint when watching a fight I mean look at that last week with their fury and Wilder yeah you know I was eating out the palm of their hands and it was an amazing fight but you know it hype shit it's great it's awesome to watch I mean yes it is beautiful to see two fighters walk up there and bow and shake hands and all the rest of it but it's also a little fucking boring if I'm honest when I'm working the way yours I might give me something to talk about ladies you know cuz I don't want to talk about your boring last fight that went to a split decision and with nothing really happened but if you get in their face at the weigh-in great we can pump it up a little bit we can sell the fight we can hype it up yeah when they have these press conferences and no one's being mean raw I mean half the fun stuff yeah shit yeah absolutely you know I'm enjoying myself I'm in my element of them it's like that you know the famous form of GSP when is are you intoxicated you know you don't want to fight until the end of the year and it's January okay if we were fighting in two months I wouldn't mean toxicated but right now I am you know so yeah well there's been some hilarious moments and in press conferences I mean the one the giant one with the UFC where Jeremy Stephens clawed out the Conor and yeah fuck is that guy that was hilarious that was great really good honestly every time I see that I do laughs it was great he had to say yeah he's that guy but I don't know but I think he was actually actually serious he's this guy but I'll let me out talking shit he knows who Jeremy Stephens no you don't think so maybe maybe not maybe not I don't know everybody up there sometimes that press conference is yeah you can't you know in a maimed UFC has more than 500 fighters in their roster exactly yeah especially when they have those giant press conferences and this yeah any levels of design 16 fighters up there yeah it's impossible exactly I like both I like when fighters are respectful and I like when fighters talk shit yeah for sure I mean I did enjoy it was nice to see Bryan Ortega max Holloway they had that nice back and forth where max sorry pardon me Brian was you know he's like listen I hope you well and hope you're over the injuries and all that type of thing that was nice to see him great but they both were exuding confidence at the same time they were both adamant they were gonna win the fight so wasn't they weren't being too overly cordial yes you know yes I don't want to see that right right I don't wanna I don't wanna see two fires pretending like they're in church or meeting the fucking president okay I want to see two guys that want to rip each other's head off call me an animal call me about Perry Como whatever you want but that's what gets my you know yeah engine taking well even when they were at the the final weigh-in and they're staring each other down like even though it was respectful there was a lot of tension there's a lot of tension you know you talk about Madison waiting yeah yeah I never saw that one when they were at the weigh-in and max and Brian they just stood you know couple feet away from each other staring at each other it was intense it was real mmm that was a fucking hell of a fight to me shit he's incredible it really is really is I mean I was kind of not concerned because were the one who initially threw up the red flag when you saw him you just felt like he looked too tired or lately in his words he looked he looked half asleep right he looked like he just got out of bed that's how he looked and then he was slurring his words and then sighs you okay max everything good is like you know yeah he was slowing him here's that and I'm like and of course UFC tonight you have a production meeting we go over questions were gonna ask so you've got them questions there in front of you I can't stick to these questions I'm gonna ask this guy are you okay you know and for you I'm glad you did well you know you know I felt bad afterwards because then I heard that the fight was off and then I thought shit if I'd gone on you know two days three days out from a five I got on fucking UFC tonight or whatever just do my obligations as a fire and then another fire on the roster is calling me out for an injury and now the fight itself I'd have been pissed off with them you know what I mean maybe you know that that's my choice if I want to highlight it so I felt a little bad but I really respected max he sent me a message thanking me you know I said thank you so much it you know he said I appreciate that I needed someone to do that because he knew he was he wasn't 100% so yeah you know so anyway I was saying I wasn't fully convinced that he was okay because it seemed like he was not enough still slurring his words or whatever but he's a mumbler he's a mumbler yeah hi you know so he said even though he was fine though even more than fine dude he looked insane insane so good and ortega fired back or take shots third round a couple of big shots yeah at the end of the third round he's like this is my rap no I saw I told you yeah it's crazy it's crazy and cardia his cardio is incredible through the roof you know excellent footwork combinations cuts angles well reads the fight and that's the main thing you know the main he reads the fight so he reads the fight and he's so good at implementing that strategy of like consistent pressure constant angles switching stances and he switches stances flawlessly fights just as good sound buzz he does Orthodox and he'll switch in the middle of a combination yeah and then turn corners on absolutely that's right he's not there to be counted yeah yeah that's an amazing man really good and when you hit him back you let collapses yeah yeah no short well remember it gets Ricardo Lamas yeah and he just pointed at the floor is that come on let's go right here that's that and then bang it out he's a sucker that was awesome you know it's it's great to see that he is okay too but I'm really happy that you did point that out because there was some issues and I think a lot of that probably had to do I'm just speculating I'm probably ought to do with that massive and he was trying to get down really quickly to 155 which is crazy right because he fights at 145 he's the champion and even struggling to go down from him he was in the 180s you get down to 155 quickly to fight the commedia because they offered it to him on the last minute sure you know when Tony Torrez knee apart was that onset with you guys well you ever heard that wasn't that I wasn't right now in studios yeah what a fucking freak occurrence that was crazy trips over some wires blows his knee apart what was it the fire been matched three times yeah and then they're almost there at the finish line doing the final bit of press yeah it's crazy right now it's insane you can't such bad luck he's like those guys are destined to never fight Oh they've got to fight now Wow if I was the if I could wait wave a wand and any match I want that division that's the one that's the match oh for sure ways to fight the hosta huh yeah you know I mean Tony is am I am I still the interim champion yeah you know I'm going here why they make any sense to me listen Tony's you know he's a character shall we say yeah he's a unique character but he in my mind he fought for the interim title he won the interim title and then he fucking blew his knee out yeah you know so you know listen II out doing press obligations he didn't do any stupid no exact that's why I didn't understand that they stripped him I was like this guy I mean the guys ready to fight yeah I mean and and then a few months later he was ready to go again he beats the shit out of Paris yeah no no I and he looked incredible yes yeah I was kind of concerned in that fight as well because it was so fast coming back and that's so fast and apparently he was doing his own rehab you know these wild techniques and you saw that stuff online that he was doing I thought this guy's gonna hurt himself again but now he went out there looked amazing apparently I didn't even do any sparring oh really yeah interesting I need to find this out for sure him but the word I'm getting for people that know him is that he didn't spar he just got in incredible shape and he said look this knee is healing up it's in the process of healing and during his camp it was continuing to heal and then the way he kept that going is don't do any takedowns don't get your knee right don't get leg kicked well sparring is the hardest part of preparing for fire of course well and the wrestling wrestling inspiring that itself is probably wrestling rings actually but to find a wrestler doesn't know fucked up knees yeah my knees fuck none that I'm arrested far from me but my knees are just destroyed discus mostly well I think I have a torn meniscus on my goodne right now that's my good knee but my bad knee actually GSB the son of a bitch he caused it back here I was training for the Ultimate Fighter 3 final and I was trending of George and we were training you know zoo for the old Zoo for headquarters in a little gym at the bottom with the boxing ring yeah we were wrestling in there and he hit the floor tore my PCL and then just one thing after the other you know that was what 13 12 years ago and it has always been kind of fucked yeah well I'm saying here right now when we finished out when I stand I'll limp like crazy because when I sit here like this it seizes up like crazy so if I'm in a restaurant I stand up and I walk like a moron if I'm going to the bathroom it was like fucking look at this guy Jesus Christ but then I walk back and I'm walking him fine the like this attention-seeking bastard forgot that he put on a fake limb when he went to the bathroom no it's uncie's now it's okay it's just when I first stand up yeah a popliteal cyst I think that's what causing that right most of his assists in there I think so yeah well the way it's rained yeah no I know how cysts on my right knee I've had him drink twice yeah I've got to get that done it's a pain in the ass yeah it is the last time they just went in there and just pulverized it went in there and just kept sticking it with needles oh really yeah yeah I've got to get it done I gotta get that I'm gonna get a lot of shit dose yeah my neck issue remember we were talking years ago in Manchester yeah how about maneger never people didn't know but what I mean it was hard for me to talk about it didn't want to talk about too much blah was commentating your fights and then you had a neck injury that was so bad one of your arms was weaker than the other like if you were doing bench press oh for sure still to this day yeah I mean you could you could take that samurai sword I don't advise it and stick it through the skin there and I wouldn't feel a thing I don't know if I wouldn't feel a thing but I'm totally know totally know my I had a shower after my workout before and then what a gala I get ladi it's like I am yeah but damn the entire right side was in the shower I was a it's happened a few time when I've been working on TV I was doing this show called hyperdrive for Netflix in the summer and we were we were it was night shoots like 4:00 in the morning and all of a sudden I'm doing this

decompression or anything like that this it's all my up my own fault mmm yeah I'm too old school I need to go in and have treatment on my body but it's like it's a whole thing Joe yeah JC I'm a busy man you know I've got an afternoon to go of sit and you know get massaged or decompressed or I need to do I need to do it and this year 2019 is a year that I get all these little because my quality of life is still fine you know what I mean I just I just grin and bear it and whatever and just occasionally have a mini heart attack I'll be okay I'm fine but eventually this is the year I'm gonna get all these little nickels taken care of well there's a company in Santa Monica called lifespan medicine and they do a procedure called Regina keen and that's what Peyton Manning had done right over in Germany : Brian had done and this is how I fixed my bulging disc in my neck well when I saw you there Manchester's any tried 70 Germany yes and I was telling you you don't have to go to jail yeah yeah they do that it's exactly the same procedure I didn't go out to Germany yeah I don't go to German I couldn't be bothered an hour or half my day I don't want to fly to fucking Germany and give it a week or whatever so not that much time you know take you like a couple hours you do it three or four times and they could fix it no I know it'll decrease out the inflammation the other thing is there's a thing that they sell at Amazon you get on amazon.com or a bunch of other stores online and it's a spinal decompression harness I've seen it hanging on the door I've seen the thing where you use that you pump that one too no that's what you would talk no that's a good one too I haven't used that one but I have friends at have used that one they like it a lot it's not bad it's not bad the one that I use you hang from a door it's a little more hard right it's hooked up this harness it clips the top of the door and you crank it click click click click click click click and you're like literally hanging you're hanging yeah I was gonna say chair but it just really good I'm gonna try and get one if you do it consistently it'll decompress really yeah I knew do I need to do yeah you can do it in your house just get up in the morning you know have you come a wife comes in finds me and committed suicide thank you from the fucking door frame thanks Joe yeah it won't kill you it won't kill ya but it's um it does me it does feel good and it's the only way that I know of to really stretch your neck out that way yeah yeah no I do need to do that I try and do it in the sauna was it wrestling the did you you know yeah for sure for sure yeah in fact I remember I was going for a takedown and I think I ended up head-butting the floor yes a lot of it what happened yeah was that there was one of the fighters from alpha male that was shot in for a takedown the guy went for a guillotine and he he spiked himself right and then just now see people get that oh never walked never walked home Wow paralyzed nowhere yeah cuz he shot you know he went in deep on the arm pit the guy went for the guillotine so his head is trapped and all they're waiting to get your you know feet up in the air the whole deal power power double yeah no of course yeah and then you got two body weights yup going head and neck as the you know the pressure point if you will the Derrick Lewis was the funniest Instagram of all time for sure absolutely put one on yesterday of a girl I think she's dead she twerked and she twerked standing on her head and then she twisted her neck and then her whole body seized up stiff as a board I'm glad you and Derrick find it funny I'm sure this poor woman's families I hope she's okay yeah but but you know if she's not there's nothing you do about it now well no there is it no yeah maybe we won't take the piss out of it okay he's got it you got a look at Derek's Instagram on a daily basis because a lot of the stuff gets taken down oh really yeah yeah I'm surprised he hasn't been banned yet you know no this thing is too popular a lot Derek for a while he's awesome he's sour candy wheel areas it doesn't give it down no doesn't care that's the thing I see things people send me things you know guys from back home I got some things this morning you know put the massively offensive right you know I know a little chuckle in private you know I'm not gonna put that shit on Instagram I'm gonna put it for the whole world to see what is this is it doing a movie or something he's doing a movie I think but then I think somebody the other day said when John John sneezes on yeah I saw some of that caption John Jones mm-hmm that's uh he's an interesting character huh oh yeah yeah for sure the big comeback it's gonna be a tough fight man that's a big fight that's a big yeah Gustafson is no joke the way that I love the way these they size up to the way the only see maybe that's why John struggled a little bit the first time because he's not used to fighting somebody with the same frame the same physical attributes that make John so great Alex also has yes what was his last fight was it Teixeira I think it was five seconds were so fast yeah so fast the combinations he put together they were beautiful really really good the final ko was like a video game sequence oh dude it was incredible it really was it really was I mean I think in a lot of ways that was like what we were looking at with Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder like two guys had never fought anybody that size before sure both fighting Giants both tall guys well I know you had both guys on yeah on the show and I listened to a little bit of yesterday's with de'aunte when I was picking my son up from wrestling but when I watched that fight I sorry not when I watched it prior to the fight happening III thought Deonte I was gonna win okay even though Tyson is a very very good technical boxer and for such a big man use a lot of faints and a lot of misdirection and he's very good I thought the answer is probably going to catch him but then when I saw that he weighed in 212 pounds I said it's over there's no way 212 pounds is too much of a weight disparity it's insane but uh yeah so got that knockout power man fuck unbelievable he said when he got into the ring yeah I heard you saying that 209 yeah as a fucking heavyweight it's insane when I thought I thought this guy is too light yeah he's like his twig this six foot seven 2:09 crazy it's crazy it really is that fucking twelfth round KO or the tail the knockdown that was insane it really was he's got like four Teddy Atlas said it best he goes he's like fucking Thor with the hammer but I mean Oh respect and credit to Tyson Fury forget now far I mean I know it was all that talk and Deonte put it on his Instagram about it not actually being ten seconds about it being over ten seconds but still it is what it for ten seconds on the clock but the referee it's not the fighters job no I know the anti-seize Fury's job to to monitor I stopped watching the corner wrath we're at ten no he has I said ten and he gets up yeah fight still on you know there's no telling that he couldn't have got up on an the actual tent he probably could have gone up at the actual count of ten as well but just the way he got up and then managed to win the round well that's what really impressed me yeah I wasn't the biggest fan of Tyson Fury a few years ago he he I don't know we had some stupid back-and-forth on social media on Twitter but that was it about he was saying that some gypsy John whoever is knocked me outside a nightclub in Blackburn but the only problem with that is is supposedly at the time when I was living in America so anyway so so it didn't happen I've never been knocked out had an A cup in my life but apparently according to Tyson it did happen so I wasn't you know overly thrilled right but I got a say over the last six months or even the year you know he really really won me over what he overcame illusion all that way going through that depression or slump whatever you want to call it and then coming back and and looking so good and then afterwards the you know the post fight speech her fall was beautiful yeah donating all his money to charity all of it it's just insane I'm only ten million respect that then that then you've got a serious problem sighs so I applaud the guy and I'm a huge fan yeah I respect the shit out of both of them and I think that what happened with you was during his cocaine days so these coked up and drinking like a fucking fish show black people probably out of his mind he said that yeah you guys he went through a dark time but you know what's fascinating to me is that he pulled himself out of it not just pulled himself out but wants to pull other people out too sure no absolutely and again you know donate you know the hard-earned money hoarder and you know you could be just given a million yeah that was amazing as well that would've been a huge PR stir but no he gave it all yeah and and that speaks volumes about the man I mean he even said I don't need it you know he's a gypsy he doesn't need it he's probably made enough money to retire already yeah he's got some big fights under fire and and the the rematch will be even bigger talking about it somewhere April May June somewhere around then yeah yeah the best boxing fights have ever seen me as well yeah it really was I felt like it was it would looked like Tyson was out boxing them and you know using a lot of faints a lot of movement a lot of misdirection and I let that herky-jerky style that's what he does until he got that's how he confuses people but then he got clipped and drop those like oh you know I thought he was gonna get caught with the left talk because I'm saying because we were there was the UFC a delay card on at the same time yes I'm here with the Fox Studios and when the Fox did sorry the UFC deal with Fox is up they switch to Pacific PCB Pacific Coast boxing of which they aren't a while there is one of their guys so in the room where we were watching watching the Adelaide card they've got the fucking Deonte palliative dad's in fury fight on now I've got to talk about the Adelaide card in detail and break it down and this and that but this is one of the greatest heavyweight boxing fights you've ever seen in your life going on on that screen over there so I'm like this watching it was crazy it was crazy and anyway but as I was watching it obviously Deonte was looking for that big right hand and fury was doing a very very good job of rolling away from it just to Boyd in that shop and I said if he follows that of a left hook he's gonna catch him and eventually that's what how'd that was exactly what it was and you caught him as he was going down which is even more spectacle it's him with the first clipped him with the right hand and caught him with the left hook as he was going down and the fact that he got up after his he was flat on his back his arms are down I think six out of ten referees would have stopped that fight right there hmm they would have waved it off oh for sure yeah no he looked for a moment he looked dead yeah he looked out yeah so I part of me didn't look dead he looked at me looked knocked out he looked unconscious for a few seconds yeah and then the lights came back on I know became it's interesting when I did when a judge or a referee rather has a decision to make whether or not they decide to stop a fight and it's one of the more frustrating things ever when a referee stops the fight prematurely it's rough mmm but then when you look at a fight like the Adonis Stevenson fight this weekend and I don't remember how to pronounce the Russian gentleman's name it's with it jeez yeah yeah so I didn't see this but there Adonis is in hospital in critical condition right now correct yes yeah yes and he's gone undergone brain surgery he's got a apparently he's got bleeding on the brain and it was it was a it was a good knockout but it wasn't particularly it wasn't insanely vicious yeah so when you looked at it you didn't think right this guy have issues yeah see he sat up he got up there like you looks like he's okay and it looked like you know that's the problem with boxing yeah you know I think 12 to 15 deaths per year in boxing around the world it's a very very sad start I guess you know I mean you involved with the UFC you know all the yeah the pro ever may dialogue that's put out there you know what box is more dangerous because it's only punches to the head and they can take more blows but that is the thing yes it is sure blow it is it is true yeah for sure the slightly bigger gloves you can take more shots which has you know well that's the are damaging effect on the brain American football versus rugby as well rugby's a better safer sport yeah which is crazy because there's no pads no helmets no nothing right but yeah but it's a better say I don't know if anyone's ever dad in rugby it's not something that I hear about it's not a narrative I'm sure someone's probably yeah sure exact he's bored but I don't think it's a thing no but unfortunately I mean you see I mean the poor guys you see kids at high school yeah it was one on the news I think a couple years ago close to where I live down here and yeah heartbreaking I would never let my kids play football my kids wanted to fight I'd say look you're gonna learn how to fight correctly but if you want to play football get the fuck out of it yeah yes too many guys running at you full clip clashing helmet the helmet with it well that's the thing because they young kids the young kids and you know I remember when I was that age you think you're invincible yeah part of me you were you think you were invincible and certainly then you put on this giant helmet yeah and you think you can just charge him if you had and you know what I mean and unfortunately that isn't the case well we've gone over some of the most recent statistics that they've released on CTE with football players and they're talking about from Pop Warner to high school to college to professional the number like across the board the number that exhibits CTE symptoms is staggering right it's only a magical vast majority is yeah it's crazy it's a fuckin nutty sport yeah rugby's better it's a better sport and it's a better sport white terms of its but it's to me I used to play book there I you should love rugby I was a pretty good rugby player when I was younger but it surprise you to hear that from an American you know I don't watch football the big American flying behind you and you got the fucking what what are those what is that that's what wildebeest know that is a an Asian water buffalo from yes yes the wildebeest of the Asian water buffalo that's from me good mate Adam green tree yeah who shot that sucker and brought it over for me nice nice decoration yeah but that's an invasive species in Australia they shoot them out of helicopters oh really they have to kill them there's they don't have any any other than crocodiles but there's no meat or flesh on it but if that thing had meat in flesh and bones almost wouldn't got me I'd shit my pants fuck the size of those are horns man two huge animal oh not can only imagine yeah thousand pound yeah yeah cows they're gigantic but they have cows over there that are wild they're called scrub bulls right well you know how like we see a rodeo rider rides a bowl and the Bulls like yeah sure crazy well that's because they've got testosterone in giant paws and they're fucking super aggressive you never see a bull in the wild dude I used to work at a slaughterhouse I used to see more than 500 cows a day the size of those fucking bowls will scare you to death when I was 16 now that I've come from a small town and one of the local employers is the slaughterhouse and anymore any any young loser like myself has done a stint at the slaughterhouse when they need a job you know and I went in and I was squeegee mopping blood into the drains fuck so I said to where the foreman I said listen I could be of more use to you than this he said let me think about it so I went up I'm a break had my bacon sandwich came back and he's like yep you're right you're a good kid I'm gonna make you an apprentice slaughter man I was like holy fuck that's not what I was looking for and talk about shocking oh I'd never seen anything like it in my life it was insane insane and I'm offending all the vegans and animal lovers I'm an animal lover big time you know but you gotta make ends meet when you were a kid living in a small town yeah yeah so how'd you slaughter him well the the the line up single file and eventually the comments like a little cubicle like this and you're standing above them and as they come in you push a button door drops down and they're in this confined environment like a big rectangle like a big cubicle and you're raised up and you have this Bell you touch the head and then you knock it on the head that shoots a bolt it falls down and falls into the wall then you push a button and the door slides up and the cow rolls down so you run down the steps and as you're running down you grab what's called a pin rod it's like a eight foot long flexible piece of plastic it's in sterilized liquid you pull that out as you run down then you put you like neon belly you put your knee on the the head of the cow you feel for the hole you just made in the hair then you get the end of the pin rod you push it into the hole you feed it all the way in so this all the way into like this much at the top of the how long's a rod about 8 foot 8 foot and you feed it all the way because it goes down the spinal column so you killing all that you killing all nerve endings well eyes are popping out of his head things fucking kicking like a mania you've got your knee then you pull that out put it back in the sterilized thing you get a chain put it around the rear foot push your button let's change it up pull out your knife here to hear it good elevator doors like the shining blood everywhere next one one back upstairs next counts goal and if you're not quitting like motherfucker let's go come on 500 a day I was such a positive a little page nightmares when I go home I did it for about two weeks I'm like yeah I'm out I'm out see you buddy too disturbing way too disturbing and and and the people that work there a little disturbed as well you know I would imagine you get a little twisted a couple years I mean I think they were fucking with me because I was a kid right you know like because obviously from there then they get you know the chain saw it in half and they start looking like meat you know and they go up and they take it back yeah take a bite Mike it's in a quiet taste you know everybody eat it wrong dead did we just doing it to fuck with me you know you know what I mean little 16 year old kid wet-behind-the-ears but yeah I didn't know that they stuck a rod through this the hole in the brain all the way through the spine yeah it's pretty shocking yeah I've never heard of something like that yeah - rod as we call Wow I wonder if that standard practice still today so I never never seen I've seen some awful PETA slaughterhouse yeah yeah but yeah they died instantly very very quick yeah you get through enough in one day I couldn't do it now there's no way I could do it now is it when you're young you know yeah you morals changes you get all the feelings or your values change when do you know what if that was the only source of meat so she exhausted me then the motherfuck is dying you know what I mean yeah but I'm not a I know you're a big hunting guy I'm not a bit I've never been hunted in my life but if you've got an easy to live then then then good for you of course you know it serves a purpose yeah well I became a hunter because of those videos which videos those PETA videos of slaughterhouses oh really yeah they don't have any part of that well exactly nah nah I respect that I did I'm not so much into that well my detested trophy hunting and things like that you know I know they say no no I'm not into it either I mean oh well I don't understand the desire to hunt something you're not interested in eating yes I mean these rich businessman flying out to Africa and you know shooting the majestic beasts or an elephant or a lion from a distance there's no honor in that there's no honor in China lion even from close up my dist is hiding in the bushes and pulling a fucking trigger you think that makes you a man you know you know the only way that makes sense to me is if you're in a part of Africa where lions are consistently killing your livestock and you have to protect your livestock which is yep Colorado there's a big issue with mountain lions and Shawn and a lot of it Wyoming there's a lot of places that have hunting seasons on mountain lions yeah absolutely yeah I wouldn't say there's hard and fast rules for everything different environments different situations that you need you know a different approach you know well you know that Cecil the lion thing that whole story that went down and you know what happened I'm pretty if you remind me I think I'd know about it I maybe hear something about it a famous majestic lion that was in this park and the lion left the park and went into this area where it's legal for them to hunt in a hunter who was a dentist from America shot this lion and everyone became very mad at this guy because the lion had a collar on it which meant that there was a line that they were tracking the thing is that they can't see the collar when they're trying to shoot it they have this giant mane there's no way you're gonna see where was this dentist from somewhere in America yeah so he's a fucking asshole you know so what is in my territory where I'm allowed to shoot all right gray area I guess but the fact that you flying out to fucking Africa to shoot majestic bass for me that that's a weak excuse it and these come from a guy that used to fucking kill 500 cows a day his words fucked for a week and I was in apprentice I didn't really do it very often the backlash hit in all these people were furious at that guy and then no one wanted to go over there and hunt lions so because no one wanted to go over there and hunt lions the lion population exploded when the lion population exploded the undulate population all the you know antelope and all the we have dropped radically show the wildlife biologist made an assessment that they had to kill some lions and so they killed I think they wound up killing 200 lions and just dumping their bodies whereas for the money would have gone for those 200 lions they would have gotten fifty thousand dollars for each lion if a hunter taking them and then what they have done they take that money they pour it back into conservation it's a very messy business sure absolutely you know and then there you go there is the the argument for it yeah it is a tricky argument and I don't have the answers and I'm not educated enough to really sit here and debate you or really cast any kind of opinion or anyone really I just shooting an animal from a distance I'm not fond of that she knows them from a distance you kind of have to ya know for sure I converse you to elk up close that's a real problem oh yeah absolutely and I'm not talking about you going out and I've seen your videos on your barbecue it looks fucking delicious I'm sure it's great I'm sure it's awesome I have no issue with that I have no key some please I would love to he'll eat it you go holy shit I'm sure I wouldn't taste like anything else man I love meat I'm a carnivore can't say for sure but yeah yeah no you're right look it's a it's a the argument for it you can make the same argument for people hey we'll keep these people healthy we just kill a couple of what well there you go exactly how about I have these really rich people come over from Germany they spend $100,000 and they'll kill a few poor people and that the rest the poor people they're gonna get all this money there'll be more houses for right now there is enough accommodation for everybody to live in let's just slow let's just call we're just a few hundred thousand let them loose in the hills will chase them with bows and just kill a few of these people it's tricky you know it's not good it's not it's will kill some of the right piece of matter is coming over the border job solved and then the other the other problem is even the animals that make sense I don't think this rabies emerges coming up the board most probably couple most of them are just poor folks and want a better know for sure and no shame on that you're an immigrant my family absolutely I mean we're all product of immigrants this 100 yeah of course you Native American you should probably shut the fuck up 100 percent there you go yeah yeah you know that's specially here yeah no I know that's the funny thing I'm not really here fucking show me a third-generation American in this country they're hard to come across they are you know everybody I meet out here claims to be English when I meet them oh yeah my fucking auntie's English or Irish or they all claim to be out you guys love to claim an Irish descent really oh yeah is this recent this is because of karma you guys fucking love to Claire my mum's Irish my mom has an Irish accent okay she fucking talks like this Michael all right Joe she's a viciously car I've never once claimed to be Irish I is what I say to everybody like oh yeah I'm Swiss I'm Italian I'm this does anybody in your immediate family talk with an Italian accent no well shut the fuck up because you're American okay and that's okay yeah that's okay be proud of that yeah you're not English just because your great-great-great-great grandmother grew up in it switch or a Gloucester share or somewhere does it make you you English love so your kid that's okay your kids kids will be American oh yeah well yeah we got green cards recently so yeah yeah yeah how does that work you have to mind your P's and Q's if you get in trouble over here they ship you back I guess that's tricky right that's why I'm okay I'm okay you know 20 years ago it would have been an issue but these days I'm I'm a gentleman commentator God cast you're doing movie rights all over the place don't have to worry about we're not hanging out in bars getting knocked out by gypsies [Laughter] same of the old days you aren't getting into the movie business right you've been doing a few movies weren't you doing a movie during the time you were doing the rock hole fight that's right yeah I was filming XXX yeah yeah I've been out that for about three months and then I was flying home and I was looking for some walkie-talkies for my seven-year-old good idea turns out getting hold of walkie-talkies isn't very easy these days I've went on a fucking wild goose chase trying to get these fucking walkie-talkie that didn't even get played with it was like yet cool I've got a phone that yeah that but and as I'm looking for them I checked Twitter I've got a coffee and I see Chris Wyman and pulled out so yeah it takes Dana I said listen if this is true you know you know where I am and he was that are great we love that you know blah blah blah blah blah but Jack you raised our first option so I thought for a minute there I thought I was getting a title shot and I thought there's no way Jack ray is gonna turn it down so I went to my buddies Jason's house and watch the basketball game and had a few drinks and you know didn't party as such I was on set the next day but add a few drinks now if I knew I was fighting for a world belt in two weeks you know I would have been on a strict diet not overindulging but I definitely overindulged and then the next day and walking into the gym just have you know this little light workout and my phone starts exploding lighting up like a Christmas tree and I what the hell and then now Ariel Hawaii calls me is that Mike Dana just announced a Sports Center that you're fighting for the belt so where I'm at whole shit so I'm panicking like crazy how much did you weigh sorry that's the first thing I did I've run into the changing rooms got on the scale I was like 215 216 is that rough yeah for sure yeah I liked would you like a week before I like to be 200 pounds so this is two weeks before i'm i'm 215 so my shit screw the weights I need to run so I just run out of the gym throw my backpack on my shoulders and just I'm sprinting through Toronto City Center like a madman of course there's traffic lights every 30 seconds so I don't want to stop at the traffic lights because that's no good so I'm just running out nearly getting run over by taxis jumping up a homeless people falling over talking and diving it was great training and then Dana called some negotiating you know the fight whilst running through Toronto and then carried on going and then I ended up like in the middle of nowhere I just running and running and running and then Jason Perillo gets on the phone and you know all the doubt starts creeping and I started thinking Jesus Christ is so typical of my career I've won a natal fight my whole career you know been through many ups and downs and now here I am I get the title fights on two weeks notice I've been filming a god damn movie I've been near a gym MMA gym for a while doing anything and all this against somebody that's already beaten me so I'm kind of destined to fail this so fucking typical and then Jason got on the phone and you know he talked me around big time you know I said a lot of very positive things Jason's an amazing coach I really is incredible it really is there's a lot of was a lot of trainers out there there's a lot of pad men you know there's a lot of fakers in mixed martial arts certainly these days you know I mean guys that really have true heritage in martial arts or any kind of steep history in combat sports they're few and far between you know you know you can train any guy can watch a video and it's a little bit of coordination how to hold pads and you see them is that all the crazies in it these days getting pads to get fit you know one to left oak whoo you know just cuz you can do that and hope has doesn't make you a coach right does not make you a coach and there's a lot of fakers out there but Jason is not one of them he speaks from the heart and he knows what the fuck he's talking about and we had a good chat and by the end of it I was I was feeling a lot better and there yeah so when you were filming that movie were you working out at all I was doing vanity workouts I like to run certainly when I'm in a city so I was running probably three or four days a week a 4.2 mile run yeah so I was running and I was lifting weights a few times a week you know biceps and shoulders right you know you know yeah chest press look lots of jazz press you know the main and then GSP coach Jorge Blanco you know Jorge no I don't he's very very very good trainer Rashad Evans put me onto him whilst I was up there I went to see him like two or three times you know but no no not training as such but uh yeah I worked out a bit of exercise but sometimes that's good anyway right so it gives your body a chance to recover well that's what I said afterwards because I went into that fight feeling so strong feeling so good I'm like because I insist in the arbitrary every single fight in my career apart from that one and I said oh I'll learn from this I'll learn from this and you don't and it's like Jason Perillo always says it takes confidence to take a day off to rest the body you know you know and now of course there's a fine line between having the confidence to take a day off and being a lazy bastard and saying I'm gonna sit on the couch today right you know but even believe you know listen I'm good I'm gonna take a day or two off because I need it you know so that was one of the mistakes I made with my career I always trained too much and Jason said you know I used to mind fuck myself because it meant so much to me you know my fight career meant so much to I used to overcomplicate it overanalyze the overworked it stress myself out with it you know and that would that was hindering my performances you know I never once fought to the to my ability of what I performed in the gym never once I remember one day I pulled up outside Ruka and Jason was waiting for me outside and I pulled up and he says Mike come here can we have a quick chat I said yeah what's up he said listen bud you go guys in there okay he said but you're a fucking world champion can you go in there inspire these guys and act like a world champion they're here you're up there act like it don't go in lose your fucking temper spaz out stress out out like a dick say things you regret you know when the spine is not quite necessarily going your way you know you get a little pissed off or whatever you know say jiu-jitsu coach is catching you and tapping you out a little bit you start getting a little frustrated you see can you just you know how come we have none on that place and great advice just like when I I was fighting for the belt when I flew home from doing movie I went straight to the gym when I landed and Jason said to me because I was always stressed you know and he said listen we don't know if you're gonna win this fight Mike you know fingers cry by believing now believe you're gonna win this fight but we don't know if you're gonna win this fight so this might be the only time you're ever gonna fight for a world title right I said well yeah possible he said well let's enjoy the process you know let's go through this with a smile on your face he said this is huge he said you're in a position that everyone what it would kill to be in your fighting for the championship you're fighting for the belt you've wanted this whole this your whole life enjoy this you know and it was such amazing advice because I was like yeah you're right and I went through the whole thing with a big smile on my face when you clip Rockhold I remember thinking holy shit when I see Rockhold's legs buckle and I see him stagger backwards I was like holy shit he got him and then when he stumbled against the cage and you bashed him and stopped him I'm gonna help but laugh cuz you know I just bring a smile to my face almost like I couldn't believe it it was like a like a movie it was like it was it was one of those things because you were a big underdog coming to that fight everybody know you took it on short notice yeah everybody knew that you were working on a movie and so for you to land that when you landed that left hand you missed it once before too and I remember thinking yeah and that is fucking close like that's close like you saw this opening for that left hand and you clipped him over the top of the shoulder I didn't see it coming bang you dropped that left hand on his chin and you see like his eyes rolled back and his legs give out fuck man well that was the whole plan the left hook you know Jason's seeing that he was open for that and I'd seen he was open for that and he was even doing this exercise on these bands of like resistance bands whatever he was doing this and his chin was open his right hand was down at the end of it and Jason said he's julienne these moves here and he's finishing here the left hook all day long and you know he's coming forward and we're exchanging punches and nothing really significant as London and I just right hook to the body just whip the left talk and you know as a fire when you when you land a good shot because you get the feedback on your fist there's nothing like it you know when you feel that that solid connection and the knuckles got through the glove you know and you feel it yeah oh that was a good one and then boy falls down on that whole shit oh damn and then he gets back up on that fuck you bomb back down and then he went down and obviously he's got very good jujitsu and he was kind of sat back against the fence and I thought I've got to be careful not to go in his guard but yeah I got the finish felt the best feeling I've ever felt in my life was Big John McCarthy gigantic forearm nearly pulling my head off my shoulders as he wrestled me off him but he knew it was over because I knew it was over it was great would that feel like when you knew you did it it one of the best feelings in the world one of the best because you know for me you know the amount of fights I've had is unbelievable professionally known professionally you know when I was a kid that's all I was you know that was my only identity as being a fire you know I'm just being that that guy you know unfortunately rightly or wrongly well it's wrongly it's wrongly you know of course it is you know I was I was a fucking idiot when I was a kid I was fighting so much but that's what I clung to you know I I was a fire and that was the only thing that I could draw pride from you know and be becoming the world champion knowing that everybody wrote me off knowing that everyone talked shit about me you know other fighters just just you know it was everywhere I heard what people always said about me do you know or remain sorta to win like that in style in the first one yeah yeah felt amazing right there yeah yeah Rock Hall was very upset yeh was yeah you know you talked a lot shit to you and after you beat him well well hold on I know my wife was behind me there and she deserves a shout-out because if it wasn't for her none of this would have happened but with Rockhold with what happened after the fight so I okay there's a few things that I regret that have went after the fire first of all I jump on the fence and I'm just all worked up asking about you whatever no big deal I'm not I'm not too concerned about that one and then as I'm doing my like victory dance if you will I'm I laughs of the Octagon and I crossed paths with with Luke part of me and I'm like hey you know you say whatever you say yeah unlucky birds you know good fight whatever blah blah blah blah blah I said that and I carried on having my mom and I was just out of my mind on adrenaline and just having a great time and then I found myself I'd done an entire lap of the Octagon again and I was passing him again so I just thought I'd extend my courtesy one more time I'm like yeah you know and I put my hand there and he said I already shook your hand am i oh really you're still gonna be a dickhead is that yeah I already shook your hand so then I was like okay well now the gloves are off I said don't worry buddy you're in an octagon you've just been knocked out it's okay you'll figure it out in a minute don't worry about it you'll come to but you'll be good so I kind of look like an asshole because people didn't see that he would even fuse to shake my hand the second time you know I'll go fuck yourself then and then when you gave me the microphone when you gave me the microphone I said the most crude comment ever I'm a I've been fighting ever since I came out of my mother I'm like whoa that is not an image that I want to portray to the world when I win the world well you know what I meant was ever since I've been born right you know but in in the moments you know the words escaped me a little bit and I painted a rather disturbing image of my mother giving birth to me but but yeah yeah I didn't choose my wife too carefully there but yeah though it was great man well you can't be held accountable for that and that's there's no one that's ever gonna be able to understand that other than someone who wins the title yeah no one's gonna know what that felt like it's impossible it seemed it was incredible it really was it really was yeah I can only imagine it was good one names good I'm just happy that for you you know having a chance to see all your fights and and see your career go for as long as it went that you did go out with a title that is that is yeah for sure yeah you know I mean as I say that was for me I'm not sure well I wouldn't have retired I wouldn't have retired yet you know yeah no no because because I I know I could still do it I can still fight now you know I can still but but the time was right you know and then I started having issues with my good eye as well after the Gastelum fight so I'm like you know this is the world's rise now because you had oil in one of your own yeah yeah explain how that was going on yeah so when I detached my retina they did what's called a slayer buccal and if you've watched the surgery it's absolutely disgusting but one of the things that they do they put gas inside your eye and I think if I'm getting this wrong I apologize to all doctors but the kind of kind of helps hold the retina in place but you can't fly with that and I was filming a movie in England a few weeks later I said and I said you can't do that I said I'm filming a movie and they went okay there's another way we can do it a little more unconventional we can put oil inside there but then with that you can fly something okay cool do that so they did that yeah you know it's now and then it we detached and then I got glaucoma I just had a lot of bad luck I did whatever can go wrong with an eye trust me I went through it but it looks different now yeah it does yeah but it looks better than it looked it looks great yeah what did you do looks great don't worry about it yeah oh you know you're good you got it it's okay it's it's a corrective lens oh okay it's a corrective lens it's a prosthetic so can you see well I see a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny bit oh yeah so I don't I don't really see out of it and the vision is very blurred I mean I was able to pass the test to pass to be able to clear by a commission to fight you got to have 20/200 vision which I was able to scrape by with the skin of my teeth you know so I'm a doctor was always amazed that I could still see to that amount if I if I squinted in the right direction and I turned here and the light was just right I could just about make out 2,200 so but what happens is then that then because you see in two different images distorted em you see brain cancels the distorted one you know so but the depth perception remains of saying no depth perception is a real issue yeah yeah you know it was a issue throughout my last few fights for me the main thing I mean as I say you know I was cleared medically bad the doctors and you know the UFC were very very on top of all about the UFC you know sent me to a number of different doctors and whatnot and as I say I passed the test just but it was and every time I did the doctors were like we don't recommend that you fight you know you have coarse 20/200 vision it's still clinically blind really yeah yeah yeah so but but yeah yeah there you go that's fucking crazy yeah but never slow me down that's what's crazy a lot now looking right now if I not that I sit down at nights and get drunk and watch my own fights I've never done that once but if I ever do see some old fights about which occasion just happens by chance you know afterwards I'm always calling for a shot at the belt or whatever I said to my wife so fuck what this guy thank you his mind you know absolutely out of his mind but at that time it quitting and trying to not become the champion did not even occur to me for a split second giving up never even occurred to me for a heartbeat why is that is this how you've always been this is something I still felt that I could I could win it simple as that you know but a lot of guys if they lost most of the use of one of their eyes would have been done yeah for sure no no chance is not worth it yeah no I know and probably the smart thing to do would have would have been one of those guys but for me you know I meant a lot to me out I wanted I wanted to become the champion I knew I could become the champion contrary to popular belief and this is me it was my identity until I won that belt I wasn't happy now when I want it my wife said she wanted me to reset when I fought Luke in in LA she said if you win I want you to retire I said babe if I lose then I'll retire okay cuz fair enough I got my title sharp you know didn't go on my way it is what it is I would have had closure on that I said but if I win yeah do you fuck you come on on the jump into the world are gonna milk it for a little bit finally earn some decent paydays you know so yeah but it all worked out well the big fight with GSP oh yeah that's that's why that took place cuz you had that belt yeah you know I mean I'm enjoy George beat me fair and square that night but there was a lot going on going into that camp that's a the final week and and again I never said anything at the time because god bless George and he's a great guy and I respect the hell out of George I really do how can you not you know I mean I know I'm talked to all that shit leading into the fire but that was just me having a laugh you know I was literally having fun with it you know no Willie wilt was you don't seem like you're enjoying it yeah just having fun just busting balls you know what I mean I think George is incredible I think George is the consummate professional he's an inspiration to all aspiring martial artists out there if there's one man you can model your career on the way trains the way he looks after his body the way cross train George st. Pierre would be that man you know he's an inspiration to myself you know so nothing but the greatest of respect but people as we said at the start of the show that doesn't sell people don't want to see that people don't want to see that so I'll play the bad guy I've been portrayed as a bad guy my my entire career you know by the UFC the editing you know I've fallen foul to some creative editing I've fallen file to my own mouth as well at times so you know come on you know I'm my own worst enemy as well but the week before the phone yeah week before the fire at the best training camp of my life you know [Music] sounds braggy but knocking out multiple sparring partners not on purpose you just felt incredible felt absolutely incredible final sparring session we had my protein they'd flown in for a photo shoot of someone else there for a photo shoot the gyms absolutely packed and we got some guys in there sparring me and you know everybody wants to be the guy you know that gets the takedown or whatever gets the submission on the guy that's you know that's how it is that's why I don't like going to too many MMA gyms when I was fighting because every time you walk in you have a target on your back anyway it was the final round we've done five rounds the Friday before the fight and this guy shoots in shoot a double leg wounds we all the way across the Octagon like his life depending it depended on it picked me up slam me down and his shoulders went right into my ribs and I felt it instantly just all that cartilage just tore completely and I just started swearing and screaming out fucking you know cuz I knew I knew I went I saw a doctor and wanna and yeah it wasn't good house I got treatment every day and I was having ice on me and all that type of stuff but it wasn't working so what we came up with we came up with this plan I was gonna inject myself lidocaine before the fight because it cuz it'll numb Mia but the problem is the area where it was was you can pierce along it's where I have to go in you could piss let him bleed to death cause I'm bleeding yet so I got this doctor him I was gonna had the needle I had the lidocaine and I was gonna fucking go in and sneak into the toilet and FaceTime the doctor and he was like okay and anyway the whole thing just to on top it was it was bullshit I was like fucked is this the stupidest plan ever bollocks to it I'll fire with the sole rib a bit of adrenaline and you know I'm gonna feel it anyway which I didn't underneath you know but people said oh you didn't let yourself in there you weren't moving too much yeah no shit I couldn't move but as I say hey all credit to George god bless him he did great did you there was a sparring partner that you had sparred with regularly no it came at Dean I'm seeing a great guy just came in from England the last couple of weeks soz Dean who took you down yeah yeah Dean firm yeah did you know Dean yeah yeah fuckin day in the press what the fuck dude ya know he's a great guy Dean's also he's great yeah he's great you know it's the way it goes you training and yeah what are you gonna do mark so many fight you went that was a hot fell dos Anjos when he's supposed to fight McGregor like last over the last sparring kicks and elbow breaks his foot oh so that's why ideas came in yeah yeah yeah it's happened to so many guys it's such a fine line because because you feel good you've trained so hard you feel great and you think ah like your coach will say okay let's call it that guys we're good I'm calling that on your line I don't know I feel good come on let's get one good one in because sometimes I normally train spar Monday Wednesday Friday and if the Wednesday spar goes really well you know let's end it there because you want to end on a really good spar you know what I mean because you you feel like a world champion you feel great you know you remember how you handled all your sparring partners and whatever good shots you landed and you didn't really take any damage that's a great that's great momentum to go into the fight with and you don't know if you have another sparring session it's gonna go like that you know you might be tired you might be worn down those guys might be on the game that day and if you get a tough spot section well then you want to do one more because you can't go into a fire after getting your ass kicked in a sparring session you know what I mean that's not good karma or energy to go in there with so it's always a weird one to find it's fine balancing gags but yeah there you go do you when you look back on your career would you have done anything differently in terms of the way you prepared yeah for sure for sure a lot of things yeah yeah you know I mean time machine yeah do way more things well one I wouldn't balloon up in between fights discipline between fights you know I didn't exercise enough of that in between yeah a little too much you know these days I look after my body way more now than when I was fine it's so fucking hypocritical you know it's so silly now I'm focused now I don't have the luxury of going through a fight camp to get in shape right you know what I mean so now go to stay in shape simple as that was in the past I might yeah whatever I love a pizza I love a few beers I have a dessert I'll do I'll eat whatever I want and then when I'm in training camp switching on but but it's not good for the body so that that would be one yeah many things many things you know I I don't really want to throw anyone under the bus or whatever but yeah there's things I would have changed you know though there was a group of people that I was involved with you know England for a while definitely wouldn't have wasted my time with us fucking arseholes you get clear of all that legally now not yet still going on this Friday there's another hearing in the courts yeah lots of lies this has been going on for buddy eight years yeah something like that yes it's 2011 so I remember you tell me about this when we were in England together yeah yeah that was a long time ago man it was a very long time ago yeah what are you gonna do there's a lot of scumbags out that people don't want to take you money and so it's hard for young fighters to when they get contractually obligated to someone that doesn't suit them later in their career but then they start becoming successful and they're still contractually obligated to those men for sure it's a very common issue with fighters yeah well for me I wasn't contractually obligated I kept my mouth shut I did my five years and moved on but they saw a different way so they came out from totally fabricated nonsense about camp Bill's going back to 2006 they just created invoices and just just totally fabricated an entire case not a single email not a single signature nothing it's laughable that it even got this far but if you've got brass balls on you and you're willing to stick to a story and talk a lot of shit and lie you can you can go a long way it seems but I don't want to talk about that too much because there I probably I'm getting fucking shit again you thought about training fighters I would love to yeah I really would love to because I feel this was one of my issues as I was a coach so part of me as a as a fighter because believe it or not you know I mean I retired at 39 years old at the time it had the most fights in the UFC and you know and whatever believe it or not I know a thing or two about how to prepare for a mixed martial arts fight you know so that was one of my conflicting things always with my coaches I not that I didn't respect them but I would always kind of feel maybe I should be doing this or should be doing that and and and that's what I would do a lot of the time I was like kind of like the head coach I mean Jason Perillo was probably the head coach but I would like be the one that did the program need to work on this I'll see that guy on that day right you know so yeah I would love to I would love to you right now I've got a lot of things going on and life is good so I don't really have the time to dedicate myself to it right and actually I'm kind of enjoying just well I'm still working for the UFC doing that you know the the fight coverage stuff but it's enjoyable to be doing something different you know after being submerged in it totally submerged for so long it's refreshing to be doing something else you know yeah so but one day I would love to for sure well you're seeing it with fighters there's some of them that are making those transitions and into training and who better to know what it's like to prepare for a fight than someone like yourself who had so many fights in the UFC I mean if it's almost like that knowledge and experience is almost wasted or at least goes the experience of how to prepare kind of goes away if you if you don't pass it otherwise someone has to go through all the stuff shove in through the lamp solutely Joe and that's partly why I do want to do that when the time comes as I say it wouldn't be fair to anybody right now because I haven't got the time to commit right I'm working on some things and hopefully they all come off and I've got some free time I can sit on my ass you know everyone's always like Oh congrats on the retirement of like fucking retirement I'm working harder than ever these days you know maybe I need to come out of retirement to get some free time back you know but when the time comes I would love to do that that is the best-case scenario though your situation because you you've retired into a very profitable career whereas there's a lot of fighters they're lost when it's over they don't know what to do always scared me yeah always scared good for you for you for thinking like terrified me right from day one so I left school at 16 you know no education like fucking idiot that's one of my big regrets in life small town boy you know northwest of England not a lot going on there beautiful little town but you know tiny little town not a lot of opportunity and just fell into a rut you know working minimum wage in factories you know from 7:00 in the morning till 6:00 o'clock at night just doing mundane medial shit you know and I hate it I hated it I really did and that's why I became a fiery ultimately then it was a very well-planned decision you know the whole whole story to me coming to do this was it didn't happen overnight you know there was steps to it what was your first discipline I started doing Japanese eejit see when I was eight years old and I was obsessed with it so that's how you knew how to clear the sword yeah yeah yeah I was obsessed with Japanese jiu-jitsu really it's a great it's good yeah I was doing see we didn't know it was a mermaid back then but we were fighting MMA we called it knock down sport Budo if you if you google it you can bring it up you can bring up some of my fights knock down sport Budo yeah which is MMA bare-knuckle and we have like these international tournaments against you know men I was about 15 something like that at the time but yeah so we'd do tons of that so for when I was younger you know I was as I say obsessed with martial arts and pretty much won every single tournament I ever went in and then on top of that that was a little shit out and about as well so I was I've been planning a fight experience and then as I said just dead-end job after dead-end job after dead-end job and I got to a phase in my life I met my wife Rebecca and we had kids they say is this all that life is gonna be you know and then my boss at work at the time Mick he said to me my you're pretty intelligent guys this what you want to do for the rest of your life and I'm like fuck no is that what this is wild Fight Club shit I'm even the the seedy dark looking background the weird lighting this is like I seen that movie fire you walk through fire to get here oh Jesus actual fire did oh it's like smoking like yeah there's another one actually did which is true to my scooter headed on this this is wild the way you guys are dressed and everything yeah I to this day think that fight should be held in this sort of a scenario where there's a large open open air place like a basketball court I just feel like the cage is such a factor in fights no it really is it really is and it allows I mean you can use this there's one more on there if you can find it Jamie which is pretty funny Joe got a good laugh I and so will everybody else cuz guess the early Michael Bisping was on display we bow each other and I can keep in the face by off the bar but you know the referee itself I get the cage you can use it as a you know it's it's another weapon you're gonna stall on it you can lean on it you've it usually to stand up it's a factor it's a huge factor in the UFC and an unnecessary one and it's hard to see sometimes if you're in the crowd and you got to post there I'll go for sure eyes a brawl you wind up looking at the screens yeah no absolutely you do yeah obviously I was having at me Louis on one of our episodes recently was saying you know usually when I'm from row the file now hold on a minute when have you ever been front row at the fight for one cuz he was saying I prefer the first riser I'm like okay well that's what everyone says that they can't get front-row tickets okay you all say oh I'd rather be on the first visor you know cuz you ever gonna get a sore neck looking up I said well guess what when you're from Rob it's fucking cool okay you can hear the punches you can see the blood and the sweat the front the first riser was good I'd be doing commentary first wise it was great that's where all the selected boy was this look at this by Jesus Christ that was fine in my opinion he says fine he's wearing wrestling shoes yeah the old headscissors classic there is a there's a video on flow grappling from a recent jujitsu tournament where a guy got a guy in the head says just put him to sleep right yeah right from his guard yeah but I want a couple of our shitty grappling tournaments but yeah yeah yeah yeah it was against the best competition though the guy might have been 55 legit though yeah if you get the knees yeah on the right part of the neck and squeeze like a bitch yeah it hurts and especially if you practice it I feel like the head scissors or something like that think about when you're cinching a Darce right or when when you go under for a darts and you clamp a hold of your hands and you pinch down yeah some guys are expert at all right a little sick squeeze that's six clamp down if you just constantly drill that all the time you could fuck people up with that to get better at UK but I don't want to be the guy going for a headscissors and then you see and it was that funny Lisbon with his British wrestler you let him do that scissors it's like the women going for the head and arm you know in women's MMA you try a head in arm yeah as a man yeah they're gonna take you back to choke you out simple as that but yeah well running man Liz Carmouche she was Rhonda's thing was always get that headlock and then hip toss mm get a girl to the ground and then you don't get her an arm but why does that work on women but not men its next yeah but what their heads and necks are even smaller so they're sure I slide out of it easier you know it really works I think we'll we saw in the Ronda Rousey fight with Liz Carmouche Liz Carmouche took her back and almost choked her out yeah and if Liz was the lives of today she probably would have choked her out she oh no she just wasn't quite experienced enough at the time I think the reason why you're seeing it more in women's MMA is because although the level is very high with like Valentina Shevchenko and you only you know Jay check and cyborg the level the champions is very high there's still the the lower levels absolutely near you could watch a guy on an undercard that's fighting on fight pass who's a fucking world class demon and the UFC shows a man the women you're still there's there's way less of them and yeah but she's not as strong yeah I mean they haven't been doing it as long the talent pool isn't this big right you know the women aren't as interested in that I was just about to say the percentage of men interested in pursuing martial arts and mixed martial arts as opposed to the percentage of women way lower right I don't know what the percentages of mental if we said it's 50 just for the sake of the argument women it's gonna be 5% yeah if that if that it's 5% probably men if my wife said Michael I'm gonna start training because I want to be an MMA afire I said pack your bags get out they shut the hell up make me a sandwich what are you talking about come on you gonna be an MMA fighter Oh wasn't the mother of your children get head kicked it's crazy so my Thai boxing coach actually you mentioned Vinnie Sherman at the start you have to be in business with Vinnie dad's Morris a very very good friend of mine he was my Thai boxing coach he's a very sherman janet does Morris and his uh his girlfriend he was cornering he's you know the mother of his children she was a Thai boxer calcium shall Cassie no disrespect you know but to be cornering your loved one mmm that you're in a relationship and she got knocked out cold in a Thai boxing fan I was like wow that's how do you do that and you know the mental strength to understand that this is a different relationship that she's the student and the teacher and this is just the way it is I mean that takes a lot I don't think I can do that it's incredible well it takes a different kind of woman to want to do that right that kind of woman you go I mean the worst thing I think you could ever do is take a woman who wants to fight and tell her no sure yeah cause she's gonna find a way like if you're dating Vanko without what you're gonna get spinning Kate to the midsection to the balls okay she's a fucking monster isn't she she's great she's awesome quickest spinning bad kicks I've ever seen there's not too many and and I say this with the Great's of respective to women's mixed martial arts and I respect everybody that applies themself and he's willing to get off the couch and make something of their life so you know I'm not being overly judgmental but there isn't too many that I really get excited for and that really thoroughly enjoyed watching you know because as we just said the level of skill isn't quite there yet right you know as I say it's not nothing to do with genders right why do I want to see a watered down product if I can see these guys doing it at such an extreme level I don't really want to watch the smaller people the car hit is hard with less a technique you know what I mean as I say nothing to do with gender but um but obviously there's a few exceptions to the rule and schevchenko Youngjae check Amanda Nunez there's definitely amazing talent there really is it's just a small pool it's a small like that fight this weekend was sensational jerkin and Valentina that was a very very high-level fight oh really watch someone really was yeah yeah Youngjae cake impressed me you know because he had a I think it was a tough three rounds fourth round you know she probably might've edge that fourth round you know so it's impressive that she was still had to fight her so late in the Florentines just too strong to be good of a grappler and yeah yeah and bigger physically bigger like you see we can see it rap you can see when their guess each other young Jake is very slim very slender and she's Shevchenko's muscle on her well Shevchenko was successful at 135 you know he gets a big gap between 35 and 115 the reason young Jake it went up to 125 is because she couldn't get her belt back at 115 I say that with the absolute grace it's backed you know when I was a lot of it was the weight cut was crushing her and then she didn't have to cut weight for 125 but the on the flip side you're fighting a bigger stronger woman show Valentino if she was fighting another strong way went up to 125 yeah maybe things would be different but yeah that was always on paper a bad matchup yes I agree in my opinion yeah it went down the way I thought it was gonna go yes same here this is a lot of fights but the main event man the main event was well as fights where I was like I don't know I don't know Maxon Ortega I was like if Max and if it goes to the ground and Max gets caught up in something I mean Ortegas got the nastiest fucking submissions in that table Georgian absolutely yeah I mean I didn't know I mean as I said my favorite max I thought max was gonna do it but did as well there's just something about Brian Ortega I mean just just looking at him he looks like a fucking killer yeah you know what I mean any shake for the division he's calm he has that presence you know not only is just gonna look on his face that was to snap your neck off well a moment's notice he's gonna learn he's gonna learn from that fight course a lot a lot going on that fight to learn from yeah terms of his movement in terms of just han't trying to handle Max's barrage and it's the pressure that he puts on you well he's only young so that should be a massive multivator Florian because when you go away and you win fights is great there's no better feeling than winning fights and I'm telling you this like you don't know but you know this but you know when you're winning fights it's great and you go when you don't really chain because everything's going good you know but when you'd lose then you're not okay shit I don't wanna make a habit of this was he under field I think it was undefeated that was his first loss so now he's gonna say okay what can I do to ensure that I don't start getting more losses you know he wants to be the champion like my first class was to Rashad Evans and then I remember on the day Dave the weigh-in he was sat in the sauna killing himself in his usual thing and the team that I was with the shall remain nameless back then they all wanted to eat Chinese food so I was like trying to ordered the most healthiest thing in the Chinese restaurant that I could so I was eat eating noodles and drinking fucking sprite you know on the day of the wade Jesus Chris because when I was at 2 or 5 I didn't cut weight at all you know so I remember you know and I still weighed in another time when I thought of a citizen well back in the day it's my first fight at Manchester and I was getting tickets for everybody you know loving it really loving the attendees my first time you know animate ikut talk about a fucking pain in the ass it was a ticket as opinion oh my god because you've got to get the money off the people then you've got to get the ticket then you've got to do the transaction this is day of the fire you know what I mean I remember being on my knees day the fight we've hundreds of tickets and cash everyone like oh my god why did I do this no so over the day the Wayne part of me okay anyway and I was so stressed out with it and I drove home I fell asleep in my own bed night before their neighbor saw it with the night before the way the part of me I'm driving home and I'm so stressed and hungry I hadn't eaten all day because I forgot I was too stressed and as I'm driving along the freeway I don't really eat Burger King but I saw the sign for Burger King and I was starving I thought fuck it so I pull off and I get a triple whopper with cheese and bacon fries in the large coke and I'm sitting there and you know the the noise that it made when you get to the Bob that sound what am i doing on the fucking tomorrow shit cuz I'm so stressed out with the goddamn tickets like crap so voyages I just stepped on the scale no problem I'm with Rashad Evans same thing I just stepped on the scale so after that I was like okay what can I change well I'm not making the sacrifices I could be you know to be as successful as possible so that was you know moved that's a middle way and Ortega you know he's not gonna drop weight he doesn't need to be working some things you know he coulda lied simple as that yeah he most certainly can I mean he's he's got tremendous jujitsu and his boxing is very good as well but you know when you experience that kind of a fighter when you experience that kind of a champion like max Holloway you you understand that there's there's areas where you're exposed there's areas where you have holes and you have areas where you can't compete with him and as successfully as you have been with previous fighters so that's a learning experience and I'm sure he'll be better because of it I would say because of the third round then yet you know he's surely made it competitive in the third round and landed a couple of good shots because I was gonna say you know in some circumstances it doesn't matter you go away work your ass off you're never gonna beat that guy you know remain all the work all the coaches spend all the money dedicate your fucking life go live in a monastery in fucking China do whatever you want you're never gonna be that guy but in the third round you kept him on as he landed some good shots so I wouldn't say that's necessarily applicable you know but certainly gonna do some work you know he's in the striking Department yeah in the striking Department and I'm sure in the wrestling Department as well sure you know he got him down briefly but max did a fantastic job of stuffing it getting back up to his feet you know retaining you know daddy sure I mean I don't to speak out of turn I did find it somewhat curious is it Hannah Gracie yes hello Gracie giving him the the boxing advice in the corner yeah I find that somewhat curious yeah you know when I when I had my first Jason Parrilla off the fight was on the feet he was given the instructions when the fire hit the floor Brady fing talked over you know and if there was elements you know they knew their elements in the corner you know he'd say his bit boom you go you know no disrespect to Hannah grace um he's doing amazing things with Brian Ortega by the by everything I see online you know congratulations you know but when you getting out stroke I don't really want advice from Jitsu coach right no that's a good point it's a very good point you know um it's it's interesting like you you had a great situation with Jason Perillo and the other coaches that you worked with and sometimes a young fighter needs like a master mind right and sure I got Matt Hume or for us a hobby someone who could put it all together for you a John crouch you know I mean yeah absolutely and I was also gonna say and this is probably well by all accounts it is what Hanna is - or take a mentor as well yes he does see my hero's mentor so for that you know maybe I shouldn't quite set it in the words that I did use you know what I maintain a sense that that is his mentor his father figure whatever whatever it is so there's a reason why he is there but for sure bring on an expert you know in those areas a specialist you know yeah it's uh you know so it's a crazy world the world of fights it makes martial arts you know I mean as I said there's a lot of there's a lot of fakes there's a lot of that and there's a lot of it works good now but then when you fight a world-class fighter you realize why there was holes in that yeah you'll find out pretty quick yeah you know when you got a coach that's never now you don't have to have real-life combat experience to be a good coach but it helps it certainly helps it helps the fighter really trust the advice that they're giving you yeah you know for a fire to be standing there telling to throw combinations have you ever been in there you ever experience what it's like to have another guy trying to take your head off every time and you and you're gonna talk shit to me did you see the Mike Perry video no plan to Mike Perry it's no I know it's my Perry is it's a great video I did a people telling him like like when you're fighting and the coach is like go go go go go he's like I'm not trying to get fucking hit right now yeah exactly I know Mike you know he's an intense guy and he's talking about he's like we're faking we're faking were fainting we're trying to make our way in but no one wants to make a move because no one wants to get clipped first yeah well I remember you know I mean when I fought was shot Evans it wasn't the massage impact fire when I watched it back I was like fuck all right why did I just go for it a little bit more and then I'm out cuz I remember because every time took a step forward off felt the wind of the punches nearly taking my head off when you sit even myself when you say I'm watching that while I doing more then you take yourself back to when you were in there and you know ah yeah that was why that was why you know it's such a tricky situation and the the fight game evolves that the Styles evolve and the way guys pursue fights evolves it's just it's really interesting to watch though you see a guy like Mighty Mouse who does things different than anybody else you know oh well look how this motherfucker has it you know in enough char it's it's uh it's a sport where you mean you were incredibly fortunate in that you got to not just be there when it was exploding but you got to got to be a part of the explosion sure you know I mean great no absolutely I mean 1,006 you were you were in the Ultimate Fighter yeah 2005 it was December 2005 yeah yeah crazy right crazy man it really was it really was it was good time see that's when it was just popping oh yeah I remember when the Ultimate Fighter first came out I know it was on Bravo TV in England same as here and I said to my wife as I check this out that I can't watch it likewise if you're on there you'd win the thing so I I don't watch it's not fair a Michael you should be on there and then lo and behold you know about six months later they were looking for two Englishmen and we went down to Earls Court for auditions and the great thing was at that time I was ten and now I was the cage rage champion Cage Warriors champion fx3 champion as well as the British heavyweight kickboxing champion as well and everyone that was auditioning for the light heavyweight I'd knocked them all out in the first round of course you know true to my style that made you know Dana fully aware of that but yeah it was crazy when I couldn't believe it you know it was nuts I've never been to America next minute I'm on some fucking reality TV show and a mansion in Las Vegas you know it was it was a great time it was it really was what was it like being separated from your family for six weeks and doing that show and very hard very difficult of course but I was there for a reason you know and so I was the greater good you know I said yeah of course it sucks it sucks been away sucks missing time missing birthdays all that type of stuff but if you're doing it for a reason then you know he's got to be mature about it my wife always was the kids understand you know yeah it's no good being away from home but I'm working on something here you know Josh says up come on do me a favor understand you know well it worked out yeah they were always great you know yeah it worked out and then they dad not no regrets I mean maybe a few maybe a few yeah but you know what man there's no way to not have them yeah there's no perfect path that's one of the crazy things about fighting you Zig when you should have zagged you get hit down Santa snow that's part of the game that really is the sport you know it's a it's such a cliche thing to say so many ways to win and lose but there really is you know and as you say you Zig when you should have zagged the smaller gloves you know the take downs that's the problem when you find a wrestler such a pain in the ass you know cuz I'm a better strike you the most of these wrestlers but when they're trying to take you down it changes everything right because you go out and you're like okay motherfuckers just trying to take me down that's all he's trying to do so I understand yeah I'm gonna wait for him to shoot and then I'm gonna stuff his takedown because I'm waiting for a takedown I'm not thinking about the hands and and douche then you get caught over the shot you know what the fuck you supposed to be over at a time not punching me in the face and then all of a sudden you're striking is terrible because you're totally thrown off by the wrestling so it's it's a very very difficult sport it really is another one of your most impressive victories was the second fight with Dan Henderson cuz you got hit with some fucking oh yeah arms in that fight but you refused to go out yeah you refused to be stopped in that fight yeah you know I mean that was a that was a display of willpower in a lot of ways because I remember watching those those big shots from Henderson land and I mean they were on the edge you think you were on the edge going out oh for sure absolutely I mean I remember he hit me I went down he was swarming on me hit me with some elbows but I remember I was always fine but I was like holy shit that was what hit me there and then I managed to get myself back to my feet and that blood point I'm a face and whatnot of course second rounds the same thing happened and he had two big moments in the fight two big shots but they were big moments but you know when a 25 minute fire by London too you know but they were big shots fair play to him but you know I refuse to quit there because you know obviously going into that fire talked about the shit like always yeah and you can lie to everybody you can lie to the media you can lie to the press you can lie to your family lighty coaches it's not necessarily lies but you can use bravado and this and that we can't lie to yourself you know when you let him bed at night and your heads on the cushion you know some bullshit yourself you know and day the fight because the fire was at 6:00 in the morning there the fire I'm letting my bed trying to just have a nap because it was gonna be a long night obviously and I couldn't sleep and all I was thinking human nature last time I stepped into an octagon with this guy I was fucking out cold for a long time my brain was scrambled eggs for a long time after that fight and as I say you can lie to everybody else but now the fight was getting close and it's in my hometown and it's my first title defense and all this I might shit shit I know I'm better than this guy but fuck last time last time didn't end well so I was getting a little worked up and I remember I was at the arena and I was kind of you know be a little edgy a little snappy with people and there's not need for it and then I just stopped so I started laughing and Parrilla said was way laughing I said well what's the worse that can happen if I lose what's the word I'm gonna lose a fight it's happened before so why am i stressing myself out over and I just started laughing and after that was fine but yeah yeah though it was a I definitely had a saw face the next day after that one for sure yeah but you you know you got through the fire yeah no I did and I felt great the only problem was in the fifth round because this cheekbone ass wall it was on my good side he shied the cheekbone on my good side and it swelled up so much I could hardly see out of that eye this eyes Fox as well so in the fifth round I'm like trying to like get a certain angle where I could even see the guy do you know what I mean it was it was a nightmare you know but yeah got the job done fortunately is there anything the like he's on the horizon in terms of like medical science that you're looking at in terms of you being able to fix your eyes ah not that I know of I suppose the doctors about it you know because III I was yeah I was always curious what what could be done but I don't think in my lifetime there is but the reason I'm retired was at the Gastelum fight because I was clear to fight and the doctors were always like we don't really advise it but you are cleared you passed the test just by the skin of your teeth and for me that was all well and good you gotta do your medical the most restful part of all of that was when you you could have got to do a full training camp now then fly somewhere and you're gonna see another doctor a commission Doc's read the way right and you don't know what this doctors gonna be like you don't know if he knows anything about eyes you don't know if he wants to be a hero you don't know if he wants to make fuckin press and the guy that pulled the main event you know what I mean oh very very stressful time so for me the fight was always the easy part the hard part was just fuckin making it to the Octagon and I got to the weigh-ins and I get cleared up the feeling was okay well good the fights aren't because I didn't know the fight was on until I got past the Commission doctor how many different fights did you have to go through like that about I was about 12 something like that fights with that I'm not sure he's 12 something like that oh damn belcheck ugly no Belcher Tim Kennedy Kong Lee Rock old Seabee tells lies and this is over Luke Rockhold Dan Henderson GSP Gastelum 11 yeah yeah so that was stressful and then obviously you know I lost the belt and I would in my mind have retired you know I just hadn't made it formal yet and I was driving out for lunch with my wife and my in-laws they were in town and we heard on Sirius XM vehicle of the Luke Thomas show he was talking about understood silver testing positive steroids and they needed a replacement and I said should I do it and then like what were you talking about X Dana right then in there and there we later I'm on a plane to Shanghai no training I didn't know true well I mean I trained she found out about that you know I mean I you know inspired a few times and then got on a plane and went out there and yeah you know god bless him he got me but then I after the fight because you know as I said you know I was clear to fight but the doctors always said we don't recommend it because if anything happens to a good eye you're gonna you're gonna be in a real problem and I was like well so many fires in the UFC have long careers and they don't get detached retinas okay it's it's a very not rare but it's pretty rare pretty 'we don't hear about it too much so I'm thinking okay well distract the Lightning's already struck okay lightning isn't gonna strike twice you know what I mean I'm not that fucking unlucky anyway so we have the Gastelum fight and let me go to an after-party in Shanghai there in some club and I'm in the club and every time I look that way it still does it to this day every time I look that way like a bolt of lightning like I'm asleep right now and when you do that yeah what do you see art like someone's taking Lasher yeah yeah and I was in this club and every time I'm looking he's doing that and I'm I start freaking out cuz I know you know I've got a history of symptoms with eye problems and whatever and I start telling myself I don't believe this I've got a detached retina my good eye and I'm I'm freaking out and I don't want to be in a nightclub around a bunch of fucking dickheads anyway or drinking I hate nightclubs so I said I'm just gonna go to the toilet and restroom and that wasn't I was leaving you know but I just wanted to be by myself and I left there and shed a little tear in the tack said he wouldn't be sat in a fucking nightclub crying because if people see me crying about always crying because blessing me lost a fight - gasps - them was like no I'm not crying because I lost a fight - gasps them crying because I might be going fucking blind here you know what I mean so so I jump in a taxi I go back to my hotel and then later on Perillo and a few guys came back to see if I was okay and you know whatever we just carried on talking and having a few drinks at the room and forgot all about it and you know I turned into a bit of a messy one in Shanghai forgot all about my eye and the next thing I'm on a plane flying home and I'd forgotten all about it a fall asleep on the plane I wake up halfway home problem flying over the Pacific somewhere the planes pitch black and then album they starts doing it again I'm my shit cuz I've forgotten all about it I'm trying to get a Wi-Fi on the plane trying to find something about it trying to google it what it could be and all the rest of it the Wi-Fi wouldn't work and I'm going off on them trying to beg the air hostess you know please please do I need to get a Wi-Fi I nee I have to I didn't tell her why and she said noise it's down right now fuck anyway so I'll land the call my eye doctor straight away I tell him I said listen I think I've got a detached wedding I'm a good eye why do you say that tell the story says don't worry don't worry you know he'd be okay so I go see an eye doctor the next day and he says well tell him the issue and he says why'd he say that and I'll tell him why I said you think it's detached right now he says well it certainly sounds like one of my fuck me he says okay we're gonna put some drops in your eyes everything's gonna go blurry and I only see a tiny bit of this I um I uh I mean I make stupid joke as my defense mechanism on my heart I guess I better get used to this view err ha ha and the doctors like well we don't know that just yet and I'm like fuck me do you know that's not the answer I was expecting anyway turns out didn't have a detached retina I had a bit partial vitreous detachment so you have your cornea here you retina at the back and in between what's called vitreous fluid and millions of fibers connect to the retina to send the message I think I'm getting it wrong I'm sorry doctors and in your sixties that just slides off the retina and detaches naturally maybe you 60 70s who knows but as you get older through old age it just slides off it can detach due to trauma so that's what happened to me so it had partially detached so but the problem was when these fibers are pulling they can cause the retina to tear so they would they were like well we need to keep an eye on this and bah bah bah bah bah so anyway long story short after that oh fuck this no ain't worth it and have they done anything to the I sense no there's nothing to be done there's nothing to be done nothing can be done no yeah and they're fine with it they're happy with it it's ok but but it was for me it was it was a you know step too far yeah I pushed it as far as I you know I was willing to push in fact but I'm a liar I was a supposed to fight we shot in London earlier this year but we couldn't or you know agree on the deal terms with the UFC if I never materialized and I was flying up to New York to do my podcast with Louis and on the plane I'm watching this movie called the journeyman and it's Paddy Considine it's about a boxer was a world champion at the end of it he wins the fire and then he has severe brain damage and it's a very very sad movie she check it out really really powerful very very good anyway I watched that and a fog that's it that was that was it turning off the plane start our podcast I said boom I wouldn't even ask him that's it over good for you it was the best decision I ever made you know I've been very very happy ever since yeah you I mean you have our options I mean you had a long great career you have options yeah I mean as I say no regrets you know I mean it was a wonderful ride I loved it I never thought a young kid doing martial arts and and you know a guy that just like liked to have a scrap when he was a kid could take it this far and that's the beautiful thing about the UFC these days you know if you are of that certain mindset that certain character you like a bit of rough-and-tumble you don't mind getting a punch in the face here and there and you're willing to go for it you can make a living you can make it you know when I was younger I used to do a lot of professional kickboxing but I never looked at it as a career because it wasn't back then but now it's great you know it really is a career a viable career well especially for a guy like you a good talker who understands how to break fights down and you can make this transition it's one of the things that I really like about the UFC they've allowed these fighters like you know I do a lot of commentary now with Paul Felder and Daniel Cormier Dominick Cruz and they've given these guys he's high ends it's great yeah as I was saying before but that was one of the things that scared me as well as a kid because you and gyms all over the world and you see amazing talent everywhere amazing talent and you the sleeping in the cars or the sleeping on a couch at someone's friend's house you know and they're struggling to pay the bills and the driving a shitty beat-up piece of shit you know I need to shame and I see them and my heart goes out to them and for whatever reason they don't get the breaks they don't look right the they can't put it together and find out the nerves get the better of them who knows what it is but they just don't make it you know and find such a cruel vicious sport it really is so that's why would people I get asked all the time do you want your son to do it I might well no not really the way I see so he doesn't have to but if he wants to needs the number for Frank wrestler in in California we've seen the videos he's a beast if he wanted to of course I support my father supported me ridiculously it wasn't for my father I wouldn't be here either but I wouldn't wish it on him I wouldn't wish the life of a fire on anybody because it's so unpredictable and just because you're good and just because you can take a punch and just because you're you're an animal in there doesn't mean you're gonna be a success you know what I tell you to be the perfect storm what I tell young fighters is even when they say I'm thinking about trying named Amerigo don't do it yeah if you're thinking about it don't do it if you tell me you're obsessed with it you want to be a world champion then I say go ahead sure absolutely yeah if you're not obsessed there's some motherfuckers out there that are yeah they're living it 24/7 all day long for sure there and this is a thing you see a lot of young fighters now they're obsessed with the image you know you know I mean because it's on TV it's cool and it's got a lot of popularity now so a lot of people want to do it as I said this pretenders in cochis its pretenders in fighters as well so a lot of people you know they want to be you know they want to be Conor McGregor they want to be Chuck Liddell or whatever and they're all fucking wearing tap out and we're having Mohawks and stuff do you know what I mean and they're talking about or for this camp I'm gonna bring in this guy fucking camp you don't have training camps at the start of your career at the start of your career you win you train Monday to Friday you have a fire at the weekend if you win you're back in the gym fucking Monday you know what I mean you fire every few weeks you know or every you know when I was starting it I think I had six fires in the first year probably five kickboxing fights you try to build momentum you're not doing come I don't want to hear any young fire saying to me for this comp I'm focusing on my wrestling's I shut the fuck up you've got to how much your fights you're not doing the training camp buddy your training that's it
