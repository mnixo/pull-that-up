join my dango rocky block my night all day she was in the I never worked with she was in the great great Percy act a free man free it's crazy how this fucking sport just chews people up you think you're on top and then gone and it's over but the Capitol fan doesn't care that's why that pay-per-view a cell because casual fan goes oh that's the girl who works Ronda Rousey that's the argument from aggregor versus Floyd fucking happen happen anything you really think it is not me but it's going to have to see del Sol McGregor it held a press conference last night sold-out arena 5,000 tickets sold out beyond the Mikey Rose a fuck the UFC luck everything he said fuck boxes punk you yeah any ghost the next fight the next fight me versus Floyd use for get it fucking done and then goes I'm gonna do it with or without the UFC they told Dana letting goes good luck with that yeah good luck getting that done without that he believes me with the Ali Act he can actually do it because it's a different sport he has the money to hire the lawyers to try it well it is an interesting argument because it's not MMA what's boxing so if it's boxing it's not here's how much she should just promoted anyways and work together why did they well does it's not just with Floyd it's with McGregor promotions now as I've got a known thing I want to promote because they don't want it they don't want to have a third middle man is getting a white car McGregor promotions will mate with it and then the UFC and they want to give the it is them it's going to become what boxing is it's going to become that because it's star driven like all things like music hey like comedy like everything it's going to stay star driven and when it starred Riven like that guys like Connor who are legitimate stars they have the leverage and they're going to manipulate that leverage they're going to utilize that leverage and we're going to see what happens especially right now I just started ever had I hate the reality that is star driven but it is a reality why is that why do you hate that because it's always been like that in boxing well right I mean that's how they make 100 million dollar paydays he's a purist and real quick oh my god me too but I would love to see Connor would Robin Robin I were talking about fight this dude said he's never seen a fight he doesn't like loving every every single fight I've hated a lot of fun no let me go Donna okay that means that you you got right to it quick right to the point that maybe there maybe I did see one finding some shitty know about that whole yeah like fighting music I like yeah I'm not talking I am when I tell my food to each other I saw it Gracie last night unbuildable we were talking about I liked it too yeah this is what I liked about that almost forgot how Gracie bought a fucking killer I mean that guy knocked out Joe shilling twice you've knocked him on a kickboxing and he knocked him out in MMA he's a fucking beast he's a very dangerous striker he's a very big guy and he's fucking scary he's a blaster and how it and did nothing no no no he avoided getting knocked down I'm not how about how I'm talking about her boy who's at least didn't do maths because you scared he would have I forget it when I'm down he was scared to get strangled well and he was scared of is what happened in the last minute of the last round when I hollered Kelly did take him down passes garlic-butter fucking mounted him what yeah and had him in a bad spot Halleck was going to fuck him up if that fight kept going if that was in the first minute of the first round how might there's a lotta fight or pewter didn't do it he hit the guy you guys think I was entertaining fight I'm not a father and you hated came over stato that was more hanging and that was but it made it I didn't hate him it was not a high level fight I hated it I hated threw back that people will watch that on TV and both guys were severely unconditioned they were severely out of shape like on a building so I didn't cut his heartbeat stop it on my body no Fester's I said yeah some of that I am over English a legend but no when I think about it honestly I hated what the fight was about but I loved to fight the dynamic of what's happening between these two human beings in combat I mean dot on Kimbo yeah even that one the dynamic between them is different than every other fight in their case totally like because shows much and yeah this is my talents your dream I have a comment about are you intrigued by the by the sight of Gregor Floyd Mayweather as it as if Conor McGregor could actually box before me Ronnie McGregor cannot box with Floyd Mayweather but Conor McGregor's what the only goal that he could have the workable idea as a backdoor hack something where being unwilling to make it a boxing match he is fighting him with two hands but boxing is not the definition of fighting with two hands find a hack find it back to what would Tim Farriss do this temper if you said hey Tim Ferriss how do you beat Floyd Mayweather with a guy who's never pushed him off the stand that's not a good watch someone else's ID and regurgitation yeah yeah it's not that easy no not but McGregor has found disruptions [Music]
