the gyro can experience the older the older I get the more grating it becomes when you realize you're being protected from destroying yourself there's like let me do let me do this if this is what I'm compelled to do well especially when it's been proven that the things are trying to prevent you from doing aren't harmful oftentimes like pot like think about the money that's been spent on keeping pot illegal of course everyone distrust here now they're never gonna listen to a goddamn word you said you try to keep pot from them like why what's one of the dumbest things the government has ever done is try to keep pot from people know you've smoked it you find out it's awesome you don't die and then you start just trusting everything right well masturbation think about how many people thought they were gonna die from masturbation right you lose your mind you get hair on your butt when did that's end that wasn't my time no well a little flick no no I'm talking about earlier times early 20th century now you know I never heard that you were gonna go blind drink oh yeah there there are medical books in the 19th century log it had this whole thing about it you know it causes insanity insanity it causes hair to grow in your palms that you know yes a weird logged isness Kellogg from Kellogg cereal right yeah he had a thing he was very people who masturbate he had a thing about the book I mean the whole thing with cornflakes the reason for flakes were invented was to stop boys from masturbating yeah how is it how is the idea behind that we explain to stuff before yeah the idea is that spicy foods excite the sensibilities and so if you eat something that tastes interesting you're gonna want to come so they head and also graham crackers graham was another these big anti masturbation evangelizers so they invent these really intentionally bland foods you know they like to keep the teenage boys from jerking off so that when they finger their assholes they immediately come exactly it's like veal I'm so fuckin hard and they spin your finger father your cow could milk itself that would be bad climb fences like how that does yoga and can reach its own teats a cow that's so smart it realizes how fucking huge is it can just run through that fence any time these keep cows in with that's unbelievable it goes along lines of what you're saying is this like you know there's all this these people who are conservative morals and stuff they know how you shouldn't do this Shin do that Jim do that cuz you've been told us over these years but yet over the last century so most of those thoughts have been debunked meaning there's places where people allow what you're saying is evil it's gonna ruin society and a society is gonna crumble people allow this happen and it doesn't yeah and so what are you saying about cuz it's like all this stuff were you like you shouldn't pay for sex you shouldn't do drugs you shouldn't do all the shit cuz it's against the that you know though god yeah in Amsterdam all that is legal and there's not fires coming from the skies and monkey flying monkeys t-bag and everybody and you know just like it just it's been proven that that well suppressions not good for people they don't like it it's a bad way to raise children it's a bad way to raise a nation right it's just people don't like suppression it's really that simple they don't like it they upset you you're another person and you're telling the guy what to do you telling the guy can't jerk off what does that guy want to do he wants a jerk off as soon as he gets away from you he wants a bolt doors and just jerk off and privacy and then feel terrible about it and then repent and you know no sense you know Kellogg's the guy from the cereal Kellogg's cereal what the reason what this is you gotta read this book sex at dawn by this guy Chris Ryan's podcast guess fast I've read that book I've done a bunch of podcast with him and Duncan Trussell he's a really interesting guy but one of the things that he sent me hip to was like Kellogg's you can find this online created cornflakes created mild tasting food to keep people from getting sexually aroused said that he lived with his wife like 40 years and bragged about having never having had sex with her but kept a male intern who would give him daily enemas that's fuckin Kellogg's so think about that repressing sexual thoughts on both pressing and actively actively repressing sexual thoughts and yet obviously fighting off the gay tooth claw and Fang right obviously fighting off the gay the guy had a male assistant face boy put a leather Paperboy cap on him and no shirt and cutoff jeans you see it please do now I mean if you see that guy's face just what a gray plug you probably get an even better picture of them before you go full full fuckin body and then go with the color specific thing mate only get an obvious Photoshop make it make it really look real I wonder if she was getting dick on the side mrs. Kellogg oh mrs. Kellogg was fucking her personal trainer they didn't even have personal trainers back then she invented a she'd vented just so she could touch me unbelievable well that's people man people that are suppressing other people are usually doing it to try to suppress him something in themselves if you see a grizzly bear out in the fields and they're eating berries that bear might just look at you go I mean I'm give a fuck it's plenty of food he's not hungry at all so the bill of a bear has a belly full of berries and it's just sitting there chewing along he doesn't give a fuck at all but if a grizzly bear sees you and you're hungry is that the guy and you've been hanging out yeah it looks pretty good me and Kellogg I like your chest tattoo yeah it's a new thing I'm working on um thank you dude Jesus Christ what do you need a cookie there I put yes okay stop that's enough
