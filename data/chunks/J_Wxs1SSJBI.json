hello freak bitches how did you get so how did you get the Alex Jones 1 to be 911 911 I had to plan it out I had ever had a do I to fit some podcasts in I had to do like extra ones the week before just so I could get to number 911 with Alex well yeah that sounds like a long see that black might have had him on earlier and I would have definitely had him on again for 911 but having one the first time for 911 and to this day that's our biggest podcast by really far why maybe 5 million downloads fuck yeah but here's the conspiracy raise up right am i saying correctly what is the actual number it was like said price 16 now I didn't check in last two or three days of it okay so 16 million dot here's what's crazy it never charted on iTunes the iTunes charts magically went down while the Alex Jones podcast was in the queue and they stayed down for over a week experiencing theory and then when it came back up podcast that got way less downloads than Alex's were rated much higher than his and they had happened before and after I do remember the his was the only podcast that was left out of the ratings loop like for sure whatever the number one podcast in the country it was the number one podcast we did by a mile and I had the number one podcast before it's like number one podcast episode that was more than 5 million downloads more than any other podcast I had before crazy so it's for sure probably would have been never watched it was a lot of download unless they had like one of those serial episodes or something that came out that week OS town hmm so there you go and that's it's very likely that someone's trying to hold Alex Jones back and that just Stokes his fucking fact they don't understand Chris Tri County fact since the fire of Alex Jones even Megyn Kelly's fuck now her show is going down the toilet is it like garden in the aftermath she hears that here's the problem here's a problem megyn kelly was a fox news person she left fox news to go to NBC NBC is thought of as CNBC which is thought of his fake news by these right-wing Trump Trump bands what would calm trumpeters Trump errs so as soon as she goes over there they're not going to listen to her and then to the Liberals she's Fox News right so they're not interested in her either and then she does this podcast with Alex Jones or this interview rather with Alex Jones and the interview with Alex Jones she says I'm not going to paint you out as a monster I'm going to give you a fair look she's saying all these things that she's going to throw softballs this way I want people to get to know you and he releases all that he's like hey this is that person and the ratings just keeps vomiting right like but famous but not like Tom Cruise famous really Tom Cruise like connected with that person I can't make it a better story payment remembered it was there's something like that like your level or like or like a mark Duplass or you know I'm saying like a marked applauses well he's guy at your level know it sometimes I know is my pops really knows who everybody is I don't know who the depositors they're back edie they're they made the show together and it's on HBO my point isn't about the applause brothers is like they were just like semi-famous not like okay what did Tom Cruise say doctors got it oh yeah well she's well horny she wants to get to the thighs so she got invited to a Super Bowl party at this person's house right like imagine if comforters come to your house for the super super bowl party he was like asking Tom Cruise and he says yes honey you said yes what we do right and the matter maybe Tom Cruise be like I think I will be among the humans today that's a hunger the barely shows up with a brand new like clearly fresh football that is a system like you know he's like tossing like a literal brand-new football in the air right and they're all talking about marriage at some point in the day English you know what the best part of being married is though right fucking your wife am i right you just fuck your wife and everybody's like but you feel like some cookie girl stuck to the floor sort of like a robot huh like an alien visiting yeah he must be amazing hang out with I would love to hang out with him fucking your wife right I mean when you're that famous your work ethic it's like you just devote everything to that I think because like I have my agents were like they know that the agents who are Tom Cruise agents they said Tom Cruise always gets back within an hour when we send a script because I like keep a script for like three weeks and then by the time I read it the parts we said Tom Cruise will read a script in an hour and get back to them and either like it or not like it like he's just like on the ball he he like he's trying to win he's won and it's an inhuman instinct because our human instinct is to just atrophy in a way I mean you have to kind of fight it but you need to be lazy and to procrastinate it's definitely easy to be lazy but it's not if you're going to be Tom Cruise you really have to be on the ball there's no other way it doesn't just doesn't go times out that's not just what's going on now there's some weird alien sort of behavior patterns that we don't recognize as being normally when you jumped up on Oprah's couch it's like I'm in love them and love them in love and it was like what the fuck is going on here I feel a person no it's like a person who doesn't understand French but you're speaking the French to a French person you're saying all the right words like what the fuck is wrong no this guy it seems like every choice he makes outside of acting is based on what he's assuming normal human beings think is the normal behavior right because love is when you jump on a couch ago I love her which is informed by movies really right like that's more movie like right that's like John Cusack I'd say anything like oh that's what love looks like it's not you know or telling a bunch of the fellas you know we're gonna have sex talk with the fellas oh no I like my wife Rock the friction of her vagina makes me just splooge alright guys everyone's like oh we're sick of fuckin our one remember when people were wearing those Holograms attached to a rubber band around their wrists and do you member these stupid fucking things do you remember him Jamie you remember him right Gweneth culture has got in trouble for seldom on her like well this is Jerry fucking bitch and thing no offence clear its but I might have I might have said some mean things about Quentin I've been a couple of things about her lately in her fucking nutty website she takes you're supposed to wear like a rock inside your vagina oh one of those awesome I call them pussy rocks yeah pussy rocks are hilarious oh I guess it would like strengthen you it's if you want to strengthen it just do kegels around a dick that's my sex s mouse method works out well for temporary lots of rocks a good way to go glass Paltrow wants to heal you with magic stickers change sheeni getting paid though tell you that there's a lot of dummies out there either SOT nomming all the way ATM machine she has proof that bullshit sells way better than science I'm I do not have her hurt salary oh wait a minute I could rebalance the energy frequency I didn't know that hold on a second she discovered something about stickers do you take these stickers and if they're made with the right material you just stick them on your body in the right places and they in quotes rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies yeah hmm now made out of a NASA spacesuit material and NASA said it was a load of BS but hold on a second I don't think that NASA is right when it is and a bunch of movie subsequent Iron Man event of science it says granite Paltrow's goop website a lifestyle business lifestyle which sells all things with advertised these stickers are using NASA spacesuit material which presumably was the source of their magic healing properties jesus fucking christ she's special the stickers are not made this is what NASA says they're not made of spacesuit material not that spacesuit material it has healing properties in the first place it doesn't but the quote from the foreign NASA scientist mark Scholl shell ham shell shell Homer Homer shell Omer sums it up heals Wow what a load of BS this is or that yeah okay she's obviously goop clearly updated its site now it doesn't claim anything about NASA spacesuits and stickers but it didn't dial back and in the magical healing claims here's what goop says now in an article called wearable stickers that promote healing in parentheses really you fuck human bodies operate an ideal energetic frequency but FS a stress is an anxiety you give me stress you bitch I can throw off our internal balance depleting our energy reserves and weakening our immune system fucking imagine thinking that you could put a sticker on you and it's going to heal you body vibes stickers oh my god they're called body vibes come in pre-pro they come pre-programmed I'll fuck their programming program I didn't know that to an ideal frequency allowing them to target imbalances you motherfucker you fuckin crook don't you have enough money bitch it's just hair bright apparently the the residuals on the Iron Man movies just weren't enough for her god damn sixty bucks for a ten per hole shit [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
