the girag and experience yeah I want you to do more movies man I really enjoyed Freddy got fingered Oh areas yeah yeah thank you you went out there with that man you took a crazy chance yeah I think it shocked a lot of people they didn't know what to do with it you know because it was so out there but yeah this is like it was one of the ultimate stoner movies you know if you're a stoner what go get Freddy if you mean people like you know a lot of people haven't haven't really heard enough good reviews of it really fighting it a girl thank you or did that all day I've seen with the baby the one the giving birth fuck I want to say anymore I don't want to ruin it I thought Americans all learned a way to your comedy but yeah yeah no well let me let me just a thing that thank you for saying that because really you know when you wiii you get thrust into this situation where else and i had an opportunity to make a movie you know to write I wrote it obviously was just trying to make the stupidest movie we could think of right now let's make it the stupidest thing ever and then you know the studio at the time I'd all this opportunity to make this they said okay they've had all these directors I said I want to direct it too so then they let me direct it so now I'm swinging blood babies around you know jacking off elephants and stuff and you know getting concise your carcasses and doing all this stuff right and then you know you're working on this thing for like a year right you know you're working on this thing for a year non-stop you know you're casting it you're a rug picking all the props you're making sure all the way the the guts that come out of that deer carcass look like rubber to me and then the the prop guys like well we're gonna put some blood on it and it's gonna I go well let's see what that looks like and they do it and you look at it and you're like no it still looks like some rubber we got to get some real guts and they're like well we don't know how we're gonna make real guts come out of the carcass when you cut it and then they go off and these are like people that are professionals you know and they go off and they come back the next day and they go hey we've rigged up this compressed air that we're gonna put in the back of the taxidermy deer you're gonna run your knife down the slit it's gonna shoot out real pig guts that we've got the butcher stop you know and I'm draped in pig guts and I'm doing all this and doing all this stuff right and you're thinking okay this is crazy this gonna look crazy then the movie comes out everybody like you know basically you know reams you like you know you've never been reamed before in your life at this point you know like mean local papers and people and you and you feel completely kind of confused about it right because you're thinking shit I thought it was pretty fucking funny I don't know what's wrong with me right so then it but the fun thing about it is after that initial weekend and the whole sort of everybody talking about your movie being you know crazy and you know disgusting and all this stuff you you know I've been on tour this year doing stand-up and it's been so much fun because there's a lot of nut jobs out there in the world that like that let that love the movie in there and it's part of my show now and when I do my stand-up I do a little guitar at my show in the middle and sing a couple like daddy would you like some sausage I sing that with everybody sings it with me and then people start shouting out some of their favorite bits but I'm surprised it I went all across Australia Canada next month I'm going to be in a Toronto Belleville Hamilton and London Ontario and people come to the shows and you know our show note all these things from Freddie got it's awesome it feels a lot I guess what I'm saying is thanks for bringing it up this is what I own this oh great to be out and actually getting all this positive feedback about the movie cuz I was made to feel like this is work somebody this is what I feel when you're a victim of a pre-internet review system yeah it was a bunch of fold douche bags and you know the way people looked at things was you know you couldn't just when what year was pretty got fingered it was 2001 yeah who the fuck was on the internet back then you know I'm saying it wasn't the same as 2010 and the thing doesn't attend you get your reviews from a Nakul news.com like that kind of shit like I always go to Fandango or something I get my review online I want to use this moment as a real is real opportunity for me to actually talk about this for a second okay I directed this movie but it all wrote this whole thing I mean everybody freaks out on it it's pre-internet right all right the other day I went and I looked at Netflix okay at the the reviews of the movies right so I did this just two days ago and I looked at the reviews of Freddy got fingered the point of making that movie was to kind of like be Paul rising right it was supposed to be ridiculous it was done in a way where I think that 50% of the people who watch it are definitely going to hate it more than anything they've ever seen in their entire life right and that was the goal - you know in the Joker's obviously that the other 50% of people are laughing and the 50% of the people that hate it and it's that's that's the joke right so yeah good I went on Netflix and you're reading the review since it's pretty much 50/50 people are giving it either you know a good review or the worst review you've ever read in your life back and forth back and forth and these people are just arguing with each other about it and I'm looking at here we are ten years later after I made this thing and looking at these people having these passionate arguments completely on opposite ends of the spectrum that's pretty funny go read the reviews on this sequel I really truly believe that if that movie came out today it would be an internet phenomenon people would be so into it I think it was a fucking fun crazy we make it 3d [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
