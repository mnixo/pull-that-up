what can they possibly say no fucking way down there trolling or retarded you know the one is weird of course it's strong but the one thing that's fucking weird is you would think with all the satellites we have going in and out of our solar system and how come there's no pictures of the earth and like the sort of boy oh boy as so many pictures of look so good why god no I'm wrong hey I don't know oh it's a fact hum Brian oh yeah cord Meyer was one of the top CIA guys back then JFK this was no okay was banging cord wires and wife so when you listen to this he Howard hunt concessional no he said lyndon b johnson orchestrated the whole thing he listened he's telling you a CIA agent famous on his deathbed saying you'd look at it was cord Meyer cord Meyer wanted him dead so lyndon b johnson he had cord Meyer II did look how much time as Eddie Bravo spent smoking weed peering out curtain see you first play that I wasn't gonna know knows Julie no we are you shocked or something dude now people are dying all the time did you know saying like this is some wide-open shade you know how many astronauts died in 1968 to eight and then two more and 69 what happened were they doing flying into space accidents his father Prescott Bush started the CIA his father Prescott Bush financed the Nazis through Union Bank that's not a conspiracy theory though were CIA you know in Sweden for many years they sterilized kids that didn't have symmetric perfectly symmetrical faces that in fact that's actually that's some you job that's why they're so good-looking because they stick Adams already know look into it you think that you think that's crazy wait wait a minute win-win-win when you say look into it did you look into it I got a matter now everything that's coming through the major news networks all have an agenda behind it whether it's destroy because if I was running shit I would if I was running shit and they said hey what do you think we should do I'm like wait a minute are you guys controlling the media first of all if they say no we're not really controlling the media they do whatever they want I would say control the goddamn meeting with the fucker you guys how would I get my information the library guys I go to the live internet who goose Oliver I go to the library you guys get your information from the internet I go to the library I love how you say the Internet is if it's all the same source he did he was in this amazing documentary just a fucking life-changing documentary called the principle you seen that no I'm not fuck and Mitch ikkaku isn't it a bunch of physicists like professor from MIT that's so funny I saw the documentary sugar-coated oh my god have you seen it terrifying holy shit real quick documentary but this is this is one that I've watched over and over it's really really good you see it's a sizable freak oh no it's not it's not but it's really really good because especially for conspiracy there is type out it's called how Big Oil conquered the world there's a documentary called the fence will blow your fuckin mind they never finish that they abandon it it's deserted Mexican dudes are going what do these Americans do and they're interviewing Mexicans are just like this is easy this documentary is called about the birth of oil and how it came in and infected all our lives and how John rockefeller monopolized fucking everything to find it dude it's an incredible actor hey there's a documentary you can watch on YouTube Oh Teddy Oh Jay the untold story his son died doing it i won so I need to hunt old I got our Netflix oh no it's at the library bro in America the sugar Association they didn't want it to be labeled as for what it really was a an addictive toxin they wanted to keep it ain't that bad in moderation ain't that bad it makes things taste sweet it's about love they tell you they tell you we don't know shit we're looking at a bunch of lights and the goddamn sky you're gonna tell me that that light and that light that's two hundred and fifty hundred trillion light years away how the fuck did you figure that out oh you little don't they have an explanation for that shit no exactly that's what every would you just said right now what you just said now is what everyone's natural reaction because anything no one says anything about space you automatically think someone figured it out you don't know the guys name you don't know the name of the experiment you didn't look into it yourself you just think when someone tells you how far is the Earth from the Sun so 93 million miles away like you just right you you Google everybody relies on someone figured that out and someone double-checked it dude it's math science it's math but no one really knows so they they paint according to this documentary they paid off Harvey how because everyone's like I'm science I'm science this I'm science that so it's beautiful when people do that because then all you do is buy off all the scientists and you got everybody I love some sugar though man yeah look at all the bullshit those those documentaries gays are juiced up they're so they're so juicy they seem so good they seem so real you get fired up and then once you get fired up it's tough to get unfired up I want to be in the goddamn it Illuminati if they're goddamn listening of course you do that's why King Solomon yeah that's
