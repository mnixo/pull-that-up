haha hello freak bitches yeah we just about the same ironically I did some magnetic chick to my brain Wow yeah I go I feel like I'm your your your depression correspondent like I go and do crazy shit I did that I'll alright so it's called I talked about it last time I was here I was gonna do it I did I did ketamine which I got to say I cannot recommend really yeah I did three no actually I did six sessions which was crazy did it but the side effects long-term were my eyes burnt for straight-up two to three months every day uh right yeah house is like burnt like I needed drops constantly like um like you stare at the Sun burnt well now like like irritated um like I got something in them yeah more like that uh and I just felt like kind of groggy and out of it for a couple months really yeah then I did let's explain okay so get lost yeah well I talked about last I was here but I do yeah uh dishes I got a lot of talk about you were gonna do it or you I don't maybe I was gonna do I think you had done it yeah I had done it and I was it was still too early to tell but I remember running into you in the hall the Comedy Store and you were super happy was amazing the first time I did it the first two sessions were great and then after that I kind of hit a plateau and and the I just kind of felt like just kind of like groggy for I'm not kidding like a couple months so the first session you did you get this positive benefit from it yes the point in continuing uh your because the the the treatment is six sessions the protocol yeah that's the protocol hmm so hold on I think I'm video of it too whoa yeah I know I have been itching and wah no it's it's not even that if you're just gain of basically in like a hospital room right but and uh experience itself you said was full-blown psychedelic straight up fucking 100% tripping luck tripping balls and this is all fda-approved it's FDA approved as an anesthetic right it's not fda-approved that actually no it's getting that I think it is there actually because otherwise who would be able to talk about it yeah it is approved as an off-label uh depression treatment off labels tricky shit isn't it yes because there's no they don't know yeah maybe I mean that's all of them in some ways especially with antidepressants it's all like yeah this might this might could do something maybe not I like that there's stuff that they can do to you that is definitely beneficial but it's just you know your insurance isn't going to cover it if you have the cash you can pay for it yeah that's that's kind of the situation I was in where it's like nobody was going to pay for it but if you want to roll the dice and I rolled the dice and I got a say mm-hmm but you and do you think that if the initial treatments that you had the first couple that you really had good responses from if you just stopped there you'd have a different opinion of it I don't know that's the thing is vibe just did it once it kind of felt like you ever do acid yes you know that like paying that like super clear feeling you get that's how I felt the day I saw you I did acid for the first time like I was I want to say four months ago oh wow at months ago yeah great what do you think loved it yeah you didn't find it too intense no okay cuz they gave me speediest fuck I'm so used to edibles and float tanks yeah that I think it's uh it's very introspective it was very clean like the ID idea behind it like the the feeling behind it the thought process behind I was like ooh this is like it's a mind clarifier it's like you know Bill Hicks used to call it a squeegee in your third eye like mushrooms that's it felt it felt very uh clarifying if that makes any sense I felt great I felt really good felt really friendly hahaha during yeah man like really must have had good stuff cuz a lot of times it can be speedy and it ends up feeling like mushrooms and I think mushroom meth Oh combined yeah and you end up with this just like intense fucking it's not the goddamn problem is that it's illegal okay getting weird versions of it here is your thing here's the doctor putting the IV in my arm okay oh Jesus I'm just gonna can I say it yeah oh Christ did you take this with the 1980s phone no that's just the way it's saved it whatever why does it seem so little I don't know this is bizarre he's blown okay no can't I so this doctor is he look like a knob Shapiro OJ's counsel OJ's lead counsel he can clout ya ever get one you know um so we just you just go into a regular doctor's office and sticks this thing sticks of thing in your arm and off you go now the doctor has he tried it himself uh he would not say but it was it he said it with a wink that he had he was like I won't comment either way on whether I've done it myself yeah all those guys didn't want to keep it on the sneak tip yeah but clearly he had and so yeah so I would say for for the first session was amazing that's when I saw you and then after that it got a little dicey now what does it feel like when you're in it I was in a it felt like I was in a pod a pot in like a small it's a small world after all like pod I'm going into the pot now crossing my arms and I would like a little boat just going along through rooms and the rooms I would say were designed like kind of a bit like what's the Clockwork Orange but like the the milk bar thing a bit like white walls white breathing walls man yeah breathing I said everything yeah they were inhaling and exhaling and but I was never freaked out and then there was like kind of digits on it like the matrix it had like a green hue to it hmm um my biggest worry when I was in it was like I'm so out of it if there's an earthquake I'm fucked like I am and I would get like wide shots of California I get like wide shots of California and take but like the hospital crumbling and then on me trying to get out and go like I can't go man you're gonna have to go without me give me 40 minutes and I'll catch up to you guys so that was my biggest worry but for the most part it's just like a fairly Pleasant I just couldn't get over the fact that this was happening in a doctor's office right just like a regular ass fucking doctor like literally waiting room with other physicians and their patients old weirdos met shitty magazines and then you go in and you trip your fucking head off and so you're sitting in like a regular chair you're sitting it's a it's a reclinable bed no that's not accepting is real nice they spared no expense so you're sitting this craftmatic adjustable bed you get the needle in the arm and they leave it in there for how long 40 40 minutes 40 minutes yeah now if an earthquake happened could just pull the needle out of your arm I was so out of it I don't think I could have I think once the drip happened like it's in you for a while mm-hmm so what's the drip happens you probably have however long I mean it's a 40-minute trip apparently but I don't know if it's based on one if it's I don't know how much is going in at once now that stuff ketamine is weird because it's um it was a tranquilizer riot for as a vegetal so yes exactly that's it's a it's a horse tranquilizer and they use it as an anesthesia for humans yeah I've heard of that the guy was an anesthesiologist he was yeah don't they use that in wartime because it's easy to carry around you I believe they have in wartime because you can use very small amounts and it puts people under note that you know that sounds like that sounds like a Joe Rogan fact yeah I don't know for sure but it sounds like yes I think I'm pretty sure that's the case I'm pretty sure I was listening to a podcast where they're talking about various forms of anesthesia and it's sort of the evolution of using anesthesia and that ketamine worked really good in the field because you could have a very small amount and you would you know put someone under pretty deeply yeah I don't know what if it's local do you know I mean like I don't know if you could have done surgery it wasn't like I couldn't feel myself right right it was more like I had no interest in it when you got here following FDA approval in 1971 of that Steve was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War oh there you go uh yeah there's a lot of shit on reddit about about it as an as an antidepressant treatment frantic for depression so for you um you heard about this how I don't know I want to say gives you just Google depression treatments so you just were throwing age-2 or alternative depression treatments is probably what I what I Google now we've had these conversations before you and I abound about depression and different treatments how much exercise do you do uh we talked about this an amount I've run probably three four days a week that's pretty nice yeah that's what we want the best things yeah depressions yeah cardio but like I've never gotten a runner's high that makes sense really I think I have a shortage of dopamine in my brain just naturally like I just think I don't have a ton of dopamine like I don't joy is not a thing I think I've ever experienced what I repeat joy is the thing that I don't think I've ever experienced I'll experience adrenaline rushes and like ego but I'll never be truly like Julius yeah stinks it fucking stinks because it's something I I believe in I just don't die I've accomplished things I've done you know I mean but I never get this sense of like this real you know in very small doses extremely like micro doses so like let me put into perspective like career-wise like yeah you had a nice Comedy Central special I put a lot of hype behind it you did I watched he did really well got a great response how'd you feel well no that was over I felt cool cool do you know your main like everything yeah exactly like alright good shit man keep gonna see what else yeah but I was never like during Chappelle's Show I never got like a I'm the king of the were United mainly I never that sort of like huge uh you know something that would make you want to scream you feel so good right do you get that much all day 24/7 I just hold it and try not to scream if you want to take a break you want to go up on the roof I'm the worst guy to talk to this about because I don't really I don't really get depressed I've been depressed before but answer my question the joint question I'm joyful all the time are you really so that wasn't a joke you've really I'm pretty happy that's great you here's a goodness you seem happy yeah like I don't buy it I'm not laying it fucking Joe Joe Rogan thinks he's happy you seem happy I have a lot of friends yeah like that's a big part of it yeah a lot of cool friends I love I love having a family love what I do yep like my jobs yeah i day is filled with stuff I enjoy doing yeah you know I mean fucking I'm just lucky yeah super low but I have many of the same things yeah I just don't feel that that sense of satisfaction you you have now has it varied have you had higher and lower feelings of satisfaction yeah I think when I'm working a lot I feel pretty satisfied oh um okay so accomplishments or take yeah tasks and goal-oriented a like I like it's satisfying to do a special or direct a commercial or or or write a TV show or you know well I'll tell you one thing I say I'm filled with joy and I'm happy all the time when I'm not working or I'm not accomplishing anything or I'm not doing like if I get like real lazy I can get depressed somebody else tell me that they said that a very very joyous guy told me when he gets injured he just that takes it out of him they can I've been injured gang at times I've had a bunch of surgeries from you know athletic injuries but uh but for me if I go into lulls like if I'm not accomplishing things or in the past I don't allow myself to get into those anymore because it's just not a good feeling and even it doesn't even necessarily have to be like a career like oriented thing but I have to have things that I'm enjoying yeah you could just be like I'm really in doing yoga so and yoga every day and it's I do it I get it done and now I feel great and yeah but if I'm not doing something I my brain for whatever reason needs tasks it needs stuff to do it needs stuff to figure out it needs like puzzles yeah if I don't get that I have real issue yeah agreed do you like big long-term goals yes like yet you do yeah I can deliver micro thing I like like those two I like things that are doing like a week as a post like that's like yeah whenever you're like I'm outlining a movie right now I'm like yeah but I wish it were more like bang bang yeah like I'm a meeting about it tomorrow like specifically - so to like kind of focus myself like you write a joke and then you go up do it to 90 kills yeah yeah yeah oh that's the okay that's something that that's joy that's pretty killer joy yeah darling or just writing a joke writing a joke that it can it kills it's like that feeling man don't you wish you could give that to people who don't do stand-up yep I sure do how much like it's it I've had this conversation with people before they don't do stand-up and I'm like man I wish I could tell you what it's like to crush in front of us and like be binding $100,000 do you know man yeah that's how it feels it feels like oh I just found $100,000 and you know what led me there my personality and my experience all right coming in coming nervous yes so this this TMS thing transcranial magnetic stimulation covered by Blue Cross huh yeah uh so yeah that's what like but it's it's it was really really good like I for a lot of my life I felt like I had a alright I had like I had like a thing like a it almost felt like a metal weight like a bit of like five-pound weight on my upper left forehead my left and then so I went to this whoa dude that sound is like an MRI sound yeah that's what it is it is yes it's basically the same exact magnet as an MRI but it's just a your Hey yeah they put it on your head it's pretty simple the first time they measure it they have to get to like the exact spot there's another video where my finger is pulsing that you'll enjoy and what is it doing to you like what's the benefit uh it's basically magnetizing and electrifying a it's waking up basically dead synapses according to them really yeah so it's it's waking up dead synapses and waking up Dead's waking them up so they're dormant uh that's what they say um you don't even look into it you could shoot me yeah what is it can I do killer 1 and this is the sort I mean I don't have kids man so I'm like yeah I'll give a shit whatever whatever it's gonna cost me I'm happy to do it if you had kids you think you wouldn't do it I think about it kids I'd be like you know sort of more more cautious about it we on yeah probably because I'm not like reckless but I'm not I'm not like I do Risa it's all so vague anyway the research it's also like we think it does this most antidepressants they know they think they know what's happening they don't actually know yeah that's a weird one yeah when you think about how many people are prescribed these things and then there's not really a direct understanding of how it impacts each person like they'll tell you hey we'll try this medication and if it doesn't work we'll try another one yeah is this one work will cycle through it and how do you know if it's working for you or if you're having a good time in your life and so you're feeling better because maybe you start a new relationship and a new job and it's going well and hey it just everything seems pretty good I was on medications that made me nauseous for a year and a half before I was like you know what I literally thought I was nauseous because I was eating too many lifesavers I'm not even fucking kidding Lydia I was like I gotta take it easy on these lifesavers cuz every night I throw up on the way to the Laugh Factory and then I realize like you know Neil you're taking a pretty high dosage of zola you might want to just take it down a notch that zoloft stuff is supposed to be really weird for your discerning of what matters and what doesn't matter like like it's hard to I've never done it so it's hard for me to describe it but yeah people that I've talked to that have done and said one of the issues that they had with it is nothing had the bad things didn't feel bad anymore but the good things didn't feel good either well that's the thing with a lot of antidepressants is they they raise the floor and they also lower the ceiling so that it it narrows your band of experience basically who which but if you're severely depressed it can be very like like ketamine apparently is a lifesaver truly for they may start administering it in uh in emergency rooms for suicide cases really yeah because it does it's a dry I mean it's a basic it's a listen gen so you know hallucinogens will make like you know it see things differently so they're starting to uh they're at least they're talking about administering it as a as a sort of almost like whatever that drug is that you can do almost like an EpiPen for for uh for suicide or suicide thought thinkers theory yeah about to do it yeah so yeah so that TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation half an hour of that of that debt the debt that the debt doesn't feel like much feels like a like a shitty woodpecker like a fucking sleepy woodpeckers sort of going at your head but you're not like a get out of here well you're just kinda like okay okay huh how much longer and you just sit there and watch TV um and how many times you supposed to do it I do do it 40 times four zero four zero times half an hour and how deep are you in right now I'm done I finished it all forty yeah I did all forty in the fall Wow and and I'm telling you it lasted and and you can go back for for like sort of pick-me-ups everything whenever you feel like you need it so I'm telling you like this is the thing that has worked best for me better than get mean if way but better than him zoloft better than feeling I was on uh what's an SSRI is there this strategic Sarah to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and uh and went off it once I did this magnet shit so you know you're off everything yeah Wow yeah and you feel great yeah just no joy well no joy but that's not what I never had it you didn't lose nothing I just look at you guy you kids have fun now yep I'm not miserable and I'm not also there's no physical manifestation that's the biggest thing the the head thing the feeling like there is a plate on my head mm-hmm getting rid of that was really really really great so when you say like a plate on your head like there was a pressure or yeah I have a little weight a little weight and a little pressure did you nervous about something in there now because there were times where I go off of antidepressants and I'd have my jaw muscles and muscles in my temple would be so tight that I'd need to use like a massager well on them so I knew that there was all I was all sort of connected um yeah you do ding on is that was mana pretty sure I was that my ding unless it's me might have been King bro vitamin E bro yep yes you're doing fucking dork um so so that was a big one that was really helpful then I did I was in New York for a couple months did that show 3 mics um which I think I took to the premise the yeah you told to me but tell no so the premise is on stage I put three mics equidistant apart from each other one is for stand-up one is for one-liners that I just couldn't fit anywhere and then one is for true sort of emotional confession II type shit talking about depression talking about shit with my dad like the sort of the I won't spoil the surprise but pretty heavy shit between my dad when he died or right before he died and and then the and then the second monologue is about kind of about like celebrity and and and dealing with with the having a partner and then break it up and become my own guy and all that shit mm-hmm so it's basically like it ends up being probably 40 minutes that stand up 45 to stand up in a half-hour of true stories and then five minutes of one-liners and did you do it after you would complete your treatment I did it yes I did it after yeah and in the middle of it I actually stopped taking everything and in the middle of being active in the middle of no in the middle of the run I'd had a ha had a 8 week run I think in New York and uh and I stopped everything in the middle of it it's not like suddenly just like I don't think I need it Wow yeah now what would it what's the difference when you get off medication what was the the difference in the way your brain was functioning I can almost tell how well my brains functioning if I'm not depressed or not slowed down by depression my associations are much quicker like if you're just like the most simplest thing of like that guy looks like so-and-so like a sort of a little roast like a little like what does that shirt fucking looks like the kind of shirt you like if I'm not depressed I can think of those quickly if I'm depressed there were times where I get depression would affect my memory where I couldn't remember the the the tests I would always do my head is there's a guy who directed gone with a win in The Wizard of Oz back to back Jesus yeah uh and I would try to remember his name his name's Victor Fleming but if I was depressed I couldn't remember it like it affects your fucking I think is a resource thing like your brain is so concentrating on the depression and feeling like shit it just doesn't have the resources I think it I tend to think it's more a dead synapse thing hmm and I think it's a I think it's an energy I think depression is a lack of energy in the brain so in maybe you're right maybe it is it's all going to one place but that's my own personal interpretation of it you
