you know we're early I gotta tweet this Brian tweet it because we're early so while we're on the air I'm gonna tweet because the beginning of this shit no one's on it anyway who's the fair sponsor why don't you talk about your with your website once you plug desk law TV Brian okay doing this hey desk why that TV we do a bunch of podcasts we do one with Kevin Pereira we deal with the airman we do with a bunch of people we have different podcast comic book podcast video game podcast and you can find them all at desk watch TV we're also gonna be at the Aviance next week with Sam Tripoli snotty show and that's Thursday night and you two get in in on that you just get one of the avian passes it's that vinyl it's a new nightclub it's gonna be fun we're gonna have a lot of people there we have live shows all the time we have them almost every Friday here at the Ice House we have them we have a new one that's coming up at improv later this month on Melrose and so go desk watch TV lots of fun shows really funny comics always if you if you see my desk watch show for sure they're funny and the t-shirts that you see everybody wearing those dead squad cat t-shirts those are also available on desk wad got TV then I say that that comes Christ enough and so go there and support and also we're brought to you by Annette calm that's onn I team don't go - oh a nightie because it's a totally different confident ways and I don't know it's like they like cell banks or some shit like that but what we sell we sell manly shit son okay kettlebells battle ropes extreme kettlebell cardio DVDs hemp protein vitamins and supplements all essentially stuff that I use if we find out there's anything really cool out there we try to sell it that's that's I think a good philosophy to have one of the newest additions is the Blendtec blender someone you might have seen online blending iPhones you literally can blend an iPhone with this thing it's it's amazing but it's fantastic for for shakes for protein shakes or kale shakes or for a bulletproof coffee Neil deGrasse Tyson does not know about the bulletproof coffee will have to educate him it's very important stuff but all that stuff is available like the the upgraded coffee Dave Asprey stuff we found out about it so we it's awesome killer V honey why killer bee honey because it sounds cool to have there's the only reason to have I'm sure it's no better than regular honey in fact it's probably worse than regular honey but it sounds gangster as fuck to have killer bee honey in your house so that's why I have it and that's why we sell it and it's a company that is is as ethical as is possible and still run a business it is theirs and all the supplements there is a 100% money-back guarantee of the first 30 pills for 90 days after you buy it for 90 days you can try it try whether it's alpha brain or whether it's shroom tech you can read the science behind all of this all of it and on it and if you have any questions about it there's there's there's always someone who can answer questions about that on forums but the most important thing is if you don't feel like it works you get your money back you don't even have to return the product no one's trying to rip you off use the codename Brogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements alright that's onn IT prime cue the music the Joe Rogan experience without that it would not be official Neil Tyson thank you very much for coming on here man this is an honor this is a blast I think the universe is gonna explode you are sure the most requested podcast guests ever in the history of this podcast so Brian and I have been doing this for three years and we have come full cycle with your appearance here today I have I felt the magnetic force of your fan base pulling me in you sure that wasn't what the Mayans were talking about I'm sure that wasn't the universe aligning I was so happy when I saw you do this I forget what the interview was but someone was talking about the alignment of the stars and the galaxies the first time in your like know it happens all the time yeah it happens every year yeah I told my friend Eddie Bravo who's a beautiful human being but he loves himself a conspiracy theory he loves that when I told him I go dude Neil Tyson says it's bullshit he goes like this oh okay well yeah probably bullshit that I don't want the authority of my academic pedigree to be what makes it bullshit right i mean it's it's i want you i want to give peep I want armed people intellectually so that they can then deduce that there's nothing to it so when someone says planets are going to align and earth is gonna die I I want to encourage them to ask how often do planets align like that and then you get the answer every year so you don't even have to do the calculation well it's that shallow sort of interest in a subject where it only allows you to regurgitate the really juicy shit you heard about the planetary alignments which is so dangerous because when people when people are bullshitting which is most of the conversations we get into we don't get into serious academic discussions with people who have actually done the homework you just bullshit with a dude at work and it's like yeah I heard the fucking planets are gonna line and just like I don't even know what's gonna happen and you're like whoa what cubicle shitting your pants going these are the planets gonna fuck in a line it's something gonna happen that's gonna I tweeted recently that if you're really successful at bullshitting it means you don't hang around enough people who are smarter than you that's a very good point that's a very good point you know I think one of the cool things about you and your approach to science is I think it's very refreshing that if someone doesn't know something you're not condescending about it you you're very enthusiastic about distributing the information but you're not casting a judgment while you do that and that is something that I think has freaked a lot of people out about really intelligent people or scientists or someone who talks about anything where they have no experiences this is a sort of a condescending sort of a carrying of that knowledge that you don't have you make a really important point and I you know there's the anti intellectual movement in society and and I don't blame them entirely for feeling that way because we all know people I have many colleagues where you try to hang out with them and they make you feel bad for not knowing what they know and that's what if that's you if that's how you interact with people why would anyone want to be that well it's a problem of associating with shitty characters like they're like they're not fun to be around and unfortunately you're associating something that's incredible like the the actual measurement of the universe itself you're associating that with annoying people you got to detach the content yeah sigh cremation I dated a girl and she loved Duran Duran okay when I was in high school and you know after the the breakup which always has in every high school relationship those 880 very 80s yeah I was like fuck Duran Duran man Duran Duran sucks I hate I could not enjoy their music because I associated with this young lady oh you know psychologically scarred myself I couldn't enjoy hungry like the wolf bad boys all those classics I removed them from the menu because this one chick but that that can happen with music that you actually would enjoy well forget about like mathematics right right if it yeah if it happens with with that it can happen with everything up the ladder from man right right right you are you're very important I don't know if you know how important like the cool guy scientist is very important so I I have evidence of how important that is I can't tell you how many emails I've got like tweets or they say people say that there's a guy who's like seriously geeked and his girlfriend is not interested in him and he says what he does then shows her videos of me celebrating the universe and she says oh is that what you do oh they resurrect the relationship because she then sees the potential what's a guy can do that's fascinating Wow yeah it's like by any means necessary whatever it takes yeah whatever it ain't ever it takes to stimulation so I'm happy to glue people back together if that's what that's what it what matters here well you were the very the most important person when it came to the 2012 movement because I was talking to so many knuckleheads I had a guy on the remember Pinchbeck I was on the show something's definitely gonna happen it's like he's quoting all these reasons why things gonna happen like people love them some end of the world I mean this I was at a party and the person learned that I was an astrophysicist and walked up to me and I hear you're an asteroid and tell me this is like a year ago right here in the oil is gonna end in 2012 and and then I explained why it's not he walked away dejected and I said to myself why is like there's some people are only happy when they're sad yeah there's a thing where people are trying to uncover mysteries and it becomes more important than the actual mysteries of the universe itself and you can do Lear's simple statistics on this so for example the world has been here for like billions of years and you think it's gonna end in your lifetime that's awfully hubristic of you yeah it's pretty bold and even if it does your world's gonna end eventually anyway I mean we're really if it's it's so silly to do like fixate on so might what I think the most effective encouragement I gave people during the the the Mayan non catastrophe was I said right between now and December 20th just convinced that your Mayan catastrophe people to sign over all their assets into your name that's what's really crazy very simple if they don't do it they don't really believe what they're saying they don't believe I don't know you you get fabulously wealthy they're not gonna give you that cash yeah no one well I'm sure some people did go nutty and like set up shelters in the desert and go underground and all that there's a lot of people that went nutty well every I did a little research on this about every ten years somebody comes up with an end-of-the-world scenario and you keep in mind that end of the world scenarios no one says the world's gonna end in 150 years right Rob doesn't work because you can't get gained adherence to your cult the building it's got to be kind of immediate but far enough in the future so you can prepare but near enough so that you're not gonna forget about it at any time and its really good if you can base it on some old shit that very few people can read and everybody thinks that the old folks really understood the universe when in fact they did not well they understood the little bit of it but to say that they knew more about the fate of the cosmos than modern day astrophysics you must have wanted your path classy of physics classes or something to think that way I don't understand what's going on in those mind it's the same sort of thinking that the same thinking that wants to uncover mysteries and conspiracies there's a there's it's a weird excitement to like hidden things now you're a moon guy for a while right yeah well I listen my issues with not believing that people went on the moon a lot of it had to do with a friend who had an aunt who worked at Rocketdyne and this guy was convinced that there was no way to do it he was an engineer and he said they were so far away from doing it that the fact that they did it and they did it seven times but I since looking at it the weight of all the evidence the road I reserved the possibility that some things were horseshit based on a lot of photographic evidence that they did fuck with well here's a Gemini photos yes but here it is here here if you look at like the fuel that was loaded up into the Saturn five rocket you can calculate where that fuel could take that rocket it's to the moon and back it's not going to the Piggly Wiggly right in the Saturn five no I'm retired listen if anybody has any real sense they would look at it and say there's no way that that was a hoax there's no way but it would be harder you would see people think it was actually hard to get to the moon yes it was it was hard certainly but it would have been way harder to hoax it yes but the thing about hoaxing things back then the thing that was so compelling to me was that hoaxing things back then was really sort of way they did it I mean that's how they got into the gulf of tonkin that's shaken with stories you know there was a lot of fakery going what you're faking news who's the height of the Cold War there's a lot of reasons why I thought some fuckery was afoot and not and especially all these goddamn documentaries okay so you felt justified just because the landscape in which other things had been happening that individual stuff like that was the decade where we lost confidence in our government yeah you know that was well for good reason yeah I mean it was proven with Watergate and it was proven what was over and over know about the Gulf of Tonkin incident over and over and over it was damaging and the idea that they were able to do that in 1969 but haven't been able to repeat it since of course it makes it even more delicious it makes it even more conspiratorial attractive and then the fact that the the rock that they had given to Holland turned out to be a piece of petrified wood you know there was a lot of weirdness to the moon landing conspiracy and there was a lot of not just the people that were alike that admired it but it was almost like a religious thing my friend called it a technological Jesus he said that if you if you if anything is scientific you should be able to question it and someone would give you an answer but there's a bit of emotion and attachment and pride with certain historical accomplishments like one of them being the moon landing that forbid people from actually questioned it went beyond science it wasn't it was a cultural achievement he generally Clinton's quote well was it Clinton Clinton wrote a book my life Quentin man no George let's build the guy was the president comes George Clinton that's the other guy his opinion is equally valid those are two very different Clinton's yeah I'll find it here for the quote was it is what's my life yeah I was in his book and it was it was it was all on the the the time where when it happened he was working with a carpenters well why are you looking at it I the way I reflect on people who say we didn't go to the moon well I say what a compliment it is of our emergent culture technological culture that there are members of our society that are so impressed with what we achieved that they can't believe it well yeah I take it as a compliment that people stand dumbstruck awestruck that it is beyond their capacity to believe it I don't think it's beyond the capacity to believe it I think if you had shown them you know documentaries that didn't have any of the stuff that was in the shit that I saw whether it was we lit the moon did we go or there's another one a funny thing happened on the way to the moon where there is show over and over again all this fucked up footage and it's very confusing to a non scientifically minded person you can get on a long downward spiral and this Quentin Club that Clinton quote this Fox with me just a month before Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague Michael Collins aboard spaceship Columbia and walked on the moon beating by five months President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade the old carpenter asked me if I believed it happened I said sure I saw it on television and he disagreed he said that he didn't believe it for a minute that those television fellers can make things look real that weren't back then I thought he was a crank during my eight years in Washington I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time yeah that's it's horrible quote to hear from the President of the United States if you're a confused young man and you think we maybe didn't land on the moon you read something like there you go what the fuck does that mean well plus people in total give the government way more credit well for organized behavior than they actually ever deserve so I think they believe the government killed Kennedy and I think a lot of people believe that if they did that they could kind of do a lot of things yeah I mean so ok but you know science is gonna move on well you're you know arguing that and so yeah that's what week there's a point where you just say all right I gotta move on that's the other thing that makes a conspiracy so juicy is that science didn't move on when it came to manned space landings that was the end well you have the engineering of it yeah there was the political will it's money at that level right and and and what's what all conspiracy theories have in common is that there's a point where you have to bridge a gap in the absence of actual data mm-hmm and an assertion gets laced upon it once you satisfy the the claim that it's a it's a conspiracy theory so you say well well there's a well this is true and that's true and the only way they can both with you is if this is covered up in between so somebody's always asked to say there's a cover-up when but when there's actual knowledge about the world nobody has to talk about covered up information it's just there and writ large and ready to be absorbed and embraced I agree with you the the reason why the moon theory is so juicy for people is because there's so much of this stuff that you could point to and so much of it that looks like evidence of fuckery you know whether it's what we'll take for example the assertion that the photos from the moon lunar surface since the moon has no atmosphere than a daytime picture if you're there in the daytime in the moon you see a full night night sky of stars mhm even with the Sun in the sky as well you don't see stars in the daytime on earth not because they're not there but because the atmosphere is aglow with scattered light from the Sun if you take away the atmosphere if the Sun still be there but the sky goes dark that's what the folks get when they go to the edge of the atmosphere and the calling at the edge of space but when you get to the edge of the atmosphere the atmosphere is no longer between you and the rest of the universe and the star has reveal themselves just as they would at night so everyone knew this so you see these photos from the moon and there's Neil and Buzz and the lander and there's no stars in the sky it's just dark and they'll say see it's faint and these are people who've never taken photography alright if you are exposed for the bright reflective light of the astronauts in the lunar surface that camera exposure even in the Hasselblad's that they carried to the moon and use is too short to take in the dim light from the stars of the night sky if you turn the camera to the sky a much longer exposure with sensitive film you'll get the start but then you over expose the stuff in the foreground so photography 101 answers that question but there are huge websites given unto this and so what that told me was that people simply wanted to believe that it was a hoax and then made all the information fit that need without actually caring about the scientific truths that with any evidence would disprove all of what they were thinking so at that point I said people just believe what they want and so my task was not to debate moon hoaxers as an educator my task is to get people thinking straight in the first place so you're no longer susceptible to the the kinds of thinking where you become selective about the data that you choose to believe or you yet you get duped by someone who's exploiting the laws of physics for their own financial gain excuse me they're exploiting your ignorance of the financial of the laws of physics for their own financial gain so I see science literacy as a kind of vaccine against all of the world around you that would just simply take advantage of your your good will and good nature certainly with with things that can be easily explained like you're you know talking about the light and the the setting of the camera all that ever they led with that explain that oh well then okay well then how about and they going down a list and you know I'm time to go to dinner you know I'm right so that that is a huge problem where you know and certainly when I watched my first documentary on the the Fox Moon the Fox one when the moon landing it was a big the moon did we go there was all sorts of compelling evidence that was really weird like photographs from different spots in the moon but they had the same backdrop you know and you know and using the you know this idea that they had done these inside some gigantic sound studio and when you see something like that on television you saw like Brian O'Leary who is a an Astra and once again it's on TV yes the authority built into the medium and then talking to this dude's uncle or him telling me is what his uncle said actually it just it was such a you know it's one of those things where you go okay we know they lied about this we know we lied they lied about that they lie about things government attention yeah they'd have to the government have to lie as well as 10,000 scientists and engineers I mean think about think about this just think about this we knew more if there were ever a state secret that the government wanted to keep it would be the behavior of President Clinton's genitals okay but that got out that got out and only three people knew this three all right you're gonna hoax a moon landing by telling 10,000 scientists and engineers to keep it secret for 40 years that's not how humans behave what was it who's it who was it Lemony Snicket who said i forgot who the author was of this quote who said the only the only way you can keep a secret between two people is if one of them is dead but that's not true militarily I mean we can't keep big secrets for long-term well you can keep sure but really delectable secrets don't don't last yeah I can keep a secret that there's a bunker that I'm gonna run too sure but to keep a secret that like aliens landed in or DNA experimenting on us that would get out that's what people do stuff lesser less lesser stuff than that gets out well you like when you hear things about like area 51 and like the Robert Lazar interviews uh very true requires that you say someone is keeping something a secret so you don't worry buddies capable of keeping secrets not on that level oh no I don't know my gosh completely disagree I think that yes I mean they want the quote was that one has to be dead that's an exaggeration inquest of course but beyond a certain number of people the conduct of human beings if the secret is really juicy and really really tantalizing I I think there's zero percent chance that that's likely I disagree there's a diary there be like people telling their families you know like we didn't go to the moon you already know look at the secrets that get out yeah better they'll listen listen I mean for sure most secrets get out however I think it's completely possible for people to keep secrets actually that's a it's an experiment that you can't conduct right it's a say let's make a fake no no no no no no no no the statement most secrets get out all you know that's a hundred percent of secrets it could yeah you're right it's too simple I don't untestable fact don't you have any secrets in your past you got away with sure a lot of people got away with some secrets yeah but I didn't tell it to ten thousand people and say keep it a secret well the idea is that if you're talking about NASA the idea about the moon landings was I said it was compartmentalized and you know the the big one is that Stanley Kubrick was the there's actually a documentary a fascinating documentary again fucks with my head because as I've always said it's terrifying when you're too stupid to know who's dumb and that is often where I find myself when I'm watching these things and there was this documentary that was all about the different sort of techniques that Kubrick Lee used in 2001 and how all brilliant changing yeah he had changed the way you reshot gigantic scenes by some new process called was something about front projection I think that was basically what the name of the process and then he showed all the evidence of front projection footage in the moon landings and again you're fucked you're sitting here and I know you know I'm looking at this I'm like okay well who's right here is this what is what's have you ever seen the video of the astronauts on trampolines no no I never thought in my life that I would be in the position to have a real astrophysicist watch a ridiculous video so I want you to pull up astronauts on trampoline putting this up okay you got to see it it's beautiful I don't think I've seen it it's astronauts and the the conspiracy is that they are either on trampolines or they're on some sort of a wire harness because of the way they're moving and that they're moving behind the the lunar rover and that's to hide either the trampoline or hide the the movement of their feet like the way the shot is positioned and it's a motherfucker I think this one drives me bananas okay so shit I'm playing I'm checking it out now watch this [Music] [Applause] check this out they fell down look at this mmm I mean I mean obviously if you're a person who's not scientifically inclined and you're prone to conspiracy theories guilty of both and you see something like that you go what the fuck is going on there is that really the moon are they're really jumping around like they're on trampolines it looks like a guy's getting yanked up by wires on the moon well I'm just saying you look at the trajectory of the saturn v rocket and so that's nice doesn't mean a person was in it when you watch that doesn't that look weird though well okay you're saying if you don't know what the laws of physics would yeah one-sixth gravity when you're watching this doesn't that look weird okay so I understand that the how susceptible one can be when you're confronted with what is given as evidence yes yes so I and and if I don't otherwise come across that way I am sensitive to that right into I'm I'm if you don't otherwise have the tools to analyze information mm-hmm then then one is susceptible to all manner of forces of thought that go on around you and like I say that but by then for me it's I don't have the energy to fight all of that right I just I just teach people sort of how to think about information hmm and then I walk away and then they they make a life of they vote for whoever they want but they're there they've got intellectual defenses and so so that's that they're other people who take them on head-to-head you know I like Michael Shermer big skeptic yes and more power to him he's got the patience and he's got good analogies and good way and he can present to you the evidence of the psychological evidence of why we're susceptible so this he's got a whole book called why why we believe weird things you know I mean it's a it's if you think it's weird to look at that video and think it's looks odd it'd be weird if you otherwise knew what it looked like a 33 story rocket filled with fuel launched from Cape Canaveral took several orbits around Earth went to the moon took pictures from the front side of the Moon the back side of the Moon images from the surface of the Moon a week later that comes back an aircraft carrier goes into the Pacific to pick up a capsule out of the ocean people get out of the capsule get on the spacecraft the president meets them life magazine writes profiles that is that all that's all emotional well put it all building it all do you get to certain cloud just saying it had a build and then someone shows you a video and says well maybe all of that didn't you know that was all faith well you know the idea is not even that it all didn't happen a lot of the the idea proposed in the Kubrick documentary was that the footage was fucked up and that they made a lot of extra footage and then a lot of what you see is faked footage where they were worried that they weren't gonna be able to do it so they decided to fake it and some to see if they could fake it that there was two schools of thought that's a whole other thing that's all I did go but they just but they they need movie director tell about the the view well they see you ever see though the Michael Collins photos and these are really annoying but I'll show them to you where this was a Gemini Gemini 10 John Iten spacewalk but it wasn't really a spacewalk it was a simulation and they just blacked out the background and used it as NASA use it as like press clippings so when conspiracy people get a hold of that they go uh-huh which is probably just they needed a photo they didn't have one fucking guy really did spacewalk you know and they just decided to just say just do little fucker II just say say the guys walking around space when you slow this photo on the shelf yeah and there's pre photo shot so that's quite a free photo yeah they painted it so you see something like that with your knowledge of physics and with your understanding of vacuums in zero-gravity that doesn't look completely straight it's completely looks totally normal well yeah it depends on how quickly they return to the ground I mean these are you have to sort of judge that and so but you know I'd want to see more I mean this it's this is a pretty tight shot right and other things wanted to look at how far away the horizon is the course earth is smaller the moon is smaller than Earth so I want to see if dust was kicked up and does the dust fall at the slower rate that the astronaut Falls and I don't see the dust in this so I'd say this is not enough information if I was cold presented to sell if somebody because you can't put wires on dust right right and and and and suspend the dust and have it descended slowly as an astronaut bounce right so you mean like the lunar rover dust oh yeah or what every time they step the does came up so huh so you'd look at all of these cues and there's so many cues that would happen naturally if it actually happened that you'd have to think up and get perfectly to to fool an expert who knows what they're looking at if they know what is that like why even been easier to simply go to the moon than to fake all of that that's my point this is the one where it looks like the guy gets yanked up by a wire I've ever seen this Oh check this out oh that's on the ground yeah you fell forward and just back up yeah and now it but people I think especially people like myself would have to wrap their heads around I guess is that this isn't just a vacuum but it's also a vacuum and one six earth gravity grease size dealing with a completely alien environment how much how much do you weigh right now 190 190 you packing it in there huh so you know no Tyson just said I'm fat don't let me show you my six-pack son the Budweiser on the side of the table how rude again this is damaging to my confidence uh so yeah so you have muscles to accommodate your hundred ninety pound box yeah I do all right so now so now let's add a two hundred pound pack on you backpack so now you weigh 400 pounds right well he said 335 but I'll give you that okay yeah just rounded round says let's get big round numbers okay so let's say you now weigh 420 pounds your slugging your way your sluggish here on earth well I put you on the moon your muscles that normally are accustomed into 190 pounds an hour now are carrying our maneuvering are are are are alighting manipulating one-sixth of 420 pounds which is 70 pounds right imagine how awesome you would be how awesome you would be no 875 if you have this musculature and you weighed 70 pounds you'd be Superman you couldn't crack an egg though you'd hit people they'd laughing ya know you would be super may have to have really good tech you would pop up you would just on your toes and you jump to the ceiling so it's cool so what would um what I'm confusing is what would happen in an Earth's environment that's your life experience so this is the bias you bring to it it's an understandable bias and that's what makes the world that the moon an otherworldly place so sounds it's that literally you literally could spring up as if you are pulled by a cord like it's good luck glad you could swing better because the cord has to make you feel like you're 70 pounds mm-hmm but now you are 70 pounds so you just you just do it I really enjoyed mythbuster version of it they went into depth about flag-waving and I thought it was really fascinating to watch when were they actually created a vacuum and had the flag wave in a vacuum and it's it's weird because it doesn't you know we have an idea in our head of what it looks like when a flag waves well that's obviously the wind moving that flag but there's wind here there there's there's nothing there's zero atmosphere now when someone would run by a flag in zero atmosphere does it create any wind is there anything nothing so if a guy hops by a flag and the flag blows in the breeze what's causing that is that of faked footage well Joe it to panic video yeah yeah yes if you walk by a flag in no it's not has nothing to do with zero G it has to do with no atmosphere right right yeah so you walk by a flag there is no breeze that that is left behind you in the word your steps and depending on how much air you displace things next to you might might respond to that if there's no atmosphere no there's no way to get that information to the flag all right fill that up pull it up flag blowing in the breeze I'll tell you the video it is so what you have here is with with the American flag that set up there this sort of residual stiffness to the flag there's residual stiffness to that to the to the beam that has to hold the flag otherwise riding limp yeah it was a shaft through the top of exactly there's a famous quote by arthur c clarke who and at one point i had tweeted this where he said it's in space where there is no air a flag cannot wave so maybe space is not a place where flags belong whoa yeah Apollo 15 is this is the the one it's really fascinating because they stick it into the ground and then the dude hops by it and when he hops by it it Wiggles in the breeze like there you can see clearly that the show is just a socket in the ground yeah exactly the shaft is in it and it's it's in place and it's still sort of reacting to the environment sure now watch what happens when the guy gets behind it now he's sort of moving along and he gets in front of it and when he hops in front of it the flag follows him like it it goes in the breeze maybe how long is this video no his nothing touches anything pull it pull it ahead well if it does move the evidence would suggest that something touched it right ok I'd say right so something how close his foot is to the bay yeah it's not where the video is keep going alright keep going get it to the part where the guy goes around he's taking some pictures here right so here it would have been much better if we queued this up queued up to like right there okay okay but I can't watch that can okay then back it up you missed it you back it's wigglin just get it to right when the guy hops in front of it did you suck at you too you just missed you I don't fuck Jesus Christ the guy goes hopping in front of it here it goes hi mister could you do that stuff on the screen there okay an ad popped up mm-hmm yeah yeah it looks like a breeze blew it yeah so possible that that's fake yes so either either all of this got faked or something touched the flag that was not obvious it's not either could have easily been that the some of the footage didn't come out well or they faked some of the footage or that was and that might not have been even real Apollo footage no no I mean that might have been something that someone made and then put it up as a goof and then everyone like me is saying that exactly so here's my point so here's my point so there's a lot of fakery out there official and otherwise right right and and the most susceptible field of Investigation to fakery is UF ology right okay sure so so here's my point or ghosts okay you're looking at a picture that's relatively low quality that doesn't see the entire zone around the flag that you you don't have full information mm-hmm so someone goes by and the flag Wiggles either this was faked and there is air and the flag is responding to air or there's something and and the whole Apollo 15 mission didn't happen if you want to take it to it yeah that doesn't a stream limit or there's something that didn't make it into this photo right that's all it's not it's not that have been like Ozzie jump maybe a piece of dust piece of something kicked up precisely and we don't see it because it's such low or as equipment touches it looks exactly you don't have our way from it no no you have no depth yeah definitely but look the things in the ground right there let's see the guy go by mm-hmm you do have depth if you watch those it's not good it's not good depth then he's got a backpack and so so I can't lose sleep over that yeah I just died no I'm definitely not losing sleep over I just wanted you to look at a guy hopping in front of a flag blowing in the breeze on an atmosphere less moon yeah I mean these videos are one of the reasons yes it's so shoot Barry yeah and so so I with some of that but it doesn't necessarily mean that that no one I mean if some piece of footage is faked it doesn't mean the whole mission was faked um yeah not only that but I would say that it is so hard to fake every little thing that would need to happen it's just it's it's easier to just go to the moon really would it be why would it be so hard to make video footage and photographer graphic footage and then release it okay another reason why you can't put the Sun for all intents and purposes in a photograph is at infinity mm-hmm which means all shadows are parallel all right so that if you if you photograph them in the correct way so that you don't have a foreshortening of an angle you'll see that that shadows are parallel okay they point to one point they reference one point at infinity you can't fake that in fact that's how I know in Hollywood if they've artificially lit a scene and pretend that it's the Sun because they can't actually put their light source at infinity and so I give I let it go because it's Hollywood and they got a it's pretend that it stays when they're filming at three o'clock in the morning when there's no traffic that's a hilarious statement though I let it go I pretend you know I have to equate in my head Suns infinity these dire they wanna bullshit people because I'm trying but you had talked about suspension of disbelief with me I'm like maybe she really couldn't kill that dragon what sword but fuck it I'm at the movies with you it's like this I look for you know they can't control the Sun so if I head home one part of the scene in the morning another part in the afternoon the shadow is pointing in a different direction right and they want you to think it just happened 10 minutes later they can't control the Sun so they fake the Sun in a sound studio and you and they have the right color color temperature of the Sun so it feels like sunlight and it has that sort of brightness they bright you get so I let that go it's just so much you'd have to fake I just wear to you it's easier to just go to the damn moon that sounds - I understand exactly what you're saying but it sounds crazy if you think that people actually couldn't get to the moon then know that if they actually physically couldn't survive out in the atmosphere of deep space it couldn't survive the the with the the the the talk is that the solar radiation any solar flares any solar activity would be instant death and this has sort of been kind of acknowledged by NASA that they roll the dice with with solar radiation so the people that are believing that it's impossible to get through the Van Allen radiation belts for you to say - that it would be just it is false it's just it you could yes however I don't spend much time getting through them so radiation doses not simply is it there it's how much time but yes it's time exposure to it the intensity plus time gives you total dose right but these these people that believe that no humans have ever done it before because the only people that did it were the Apollo astronauts and there's no one's been able to do it since and every single Space Station flight every space shuttle fly all of them are within what 400 miles easily yeah I mean Space Station two days to something Hubble is a little higher right three right right but these miles the right these are the only times where human beings have ever been passed that was the Apollo program so for the conspiracy minded of course that comes up well no you can't survive in deep space no one's ever done it except some people in the 60s and no one believes that today and the reason why you can't get out there is because of solar flares and radiation all this jazz so if they're right it would be easier to fake it you say they're not right because Van Alen says it's it's safe to go through the belts and then they went through the top that doughnut hole but realistically when when people look at human beings that have actually been through the last time someone did it was 1972 as the last time a human being has been more than 400 miles from the Earth's surface that freaks people out every single technological achievement from 1969 is easier cheaper and faster to reproduce today except well no no it had its own trajectory I mean in 1969 the computer was still half the size of the room so and that's one thing the same computer that was like not even an iPhone but exactly an Edward the the computing power that's in a birthday singing birthday card so what Kubrick got wrong in 2001 in the midst of all the rest that was visionary was the assumption that the future would be one big computer controlling the one big ship the notion of distributed computing where you would have the power of a mainframe sitting on your hip was unimaginably more powerful but that's I mean this was that's a natural progression of technology that's been going on since the Industrial Revolution right that alone doesn't shouldn't surprise anybody no that doesn't surprise anyone the argument is that the the manned space flight is the only thing that has it advanced if you watch these movies from the 1970s they talked about 2010 my god who's gonna be Space Station's on the moon and there was space 1999 remember that yeah of course yeah I mean but the reality is our manned space operation ended I'll tell you why money yes that's the that's the clean that's the clean clear answer but there's a more subtle answer all right when we went to the moon everyone assumed because of the way it was marketed there was the the the the the profiles in Life magazine of each of the astronauts and you saw their families and when the president said we should do it and and it was this grand mission from NASA a civilian space agency and and the World's Fair in New York 1964 was all about inventing a future so we were living that romance alright what we were not reminding ourselves is that the only reason why we went to the moon is because we were at war with Russia with the Soviet Union that is the only reason at all if you don't carry that motivation with you and you're only thinking that this is simply the next technological thing to do that when we learn that Russia is not going to the moon therefore we have no reason to continue and we stop you then you cry foul and you say well wait a minute how about the future how about Mars and how about the rest of that well the rest of that was not ever in the plan unless Mars had planned unless Russia had planned to do it and so it was not a natural flow of what our technology would have done because it didn't flow out of our economic creativity it came out of our urge to not die and so when you have that scenario of course we didn't go past the moon after 1972 we were no longer competing with Russia to do that I understand what you're saying and if I was more conspiratorial minded mmm-hmm I would argue that that's a nice convenient thing to say but the reality is we still kept up as far as other avenues of military whether it's building better bombs or faster planes of course it was all about military superiority of course wouldn't least be the first to set up a base on the moon wouldn't we be the first to it's not necessary unless Russia does right in fact most of what we did in space was reactive to Russia mmm-hmm we were not the first in space Russia was we weren't the first to send a life-form into space Russia was Russia spent sent a dog we weren't the first humans in space Russia's Russians were Russians even put the first black person in space it was a Cuban acumen cosmonaut the achievements in space or what we did we got to the moon first and then we say we win and so we have repainted that era in our memory as we are the pioneers and we did it because we explore no we did it because wit that's a nice after-the-fact window-dressing you can put on that achievement but we did it because we were at war there is no once you understand that it allows you to understand why we stopped I completely hear what you're saying but you are fueling the conspiracy fires and the people right now are thinking Neil Tyson is working for the man what's going on let's come on this show to try to explain things I'm not neurotic away look at him with his tricky facts and logic the muttering of information about history the I agree with you but I still see room digital so it means the room for fucker it means Mars is not in our future no unless unless one of two conditions are satisfied either China says they want to put military bases on Mars we're on Mars nine months ten months after that one month the design build and and and and and launch a Mars worthy craft and nine months to get there all right that's if China says they want to put military bases on Mars where they are tomorrow all right that's one way to get there another way we find some economic justification for doing it we're motivated by I don't want to die and I don't want to die poor but aren't there like massive resources just on the moon I mean haven't they found titanium entirely so that's a frontier and space what's the name of this new venture space room sourcing the space resources incorporated there I think that's their name I think I know if I got it wrong but they just do a google on it you'll find it immediately this is a group of folks they're astronauts and aerospace engineers and scientists and entrepreneurs who say you know an asteroid the size of size of a football field has more mine ibill rare elements than have ever been mined in the history of the world and if you if you if you tow the thing to earth there you go the size of a football field or less less size of a barn so there are platinum group that there at sea nature already did the sorting of for us all right there they were there was something called planetesimals objects that didn't quite grow big enough to become planets and then they were susceptible to being shattered back into asteroids it so when you make a planet and it's still molten the heavy stuff goes to the middle right because it sinks and the light stuff floats well what's heavy iron is heavy platinum is heavy the iridium is heavy uranium is heavy all the heavy stuff is heavy so nature then sorts it the geologist calls it differentiation it sorts it now you have this cosmic object that later on gets shattered you now have asteroids made of crusts and asteroids made of core material and the core material has got all the elements and all those all those rare earth metals that we value an industry that we value in in jewelry it is Capri collected for us so if you get one of these platinum group asteroids and and bring it back to earth there it is it's a whole new market we need like a Wonder Woman jet with a net huh remember when she was in the net shit yeah I remember that or you corral the asteroid and use it for other operations in space which is a much more financially feasible thing to do so that would involve deep space travel deep space not only that space travel or robot will do it huh you can do robots surely if you if we can perfect robot lift the robot look but that's the best way to do it anyway you don't have to feed them they don't you know they don't want to come home after that yeah unless we flee this planet like unless we have to go all Battlestar Galactica uh-huh most likely we're not going to need to send people to explore things we have something like the rover well why take a chance on human biological life right now I want humans to go to Mars I think that's a good thing to do for because you build Heroes that way there's no ticker tape parades for robots they're gonna be heroes they go that far without jerking off because you're on that thing for like nine months you're there and back and you're all being video camera the whole time we're gonna find some real heroes see some real people that really weep the first time you get into a tent under ours what you might do just send couples and then you get rid problem then they fight get out of that that's a terrible sex in space you said new couples so that's even worse you don't have any history together what are the odds and they're gonna work out how many new cup will stick around for nine months yeah yeah that's a hard one that's a hard one they have found plants that are made entirely of diamonds yeah so diamond is pure carbon if anyone didn't remember that a diamond comes in like Carmen eight compression yes we have five or six varieties and one of them is what's in your pencils the graphite it's very soft and that's a diamond smooth no no but it's oh its carbon in a the lattices is layered in invert in the smooth layers that slide off one another that's why a pencil as you touch the pencil to the page and drag it what you're doing is you're dragging layers of carbon lattice off of the graphite and I thought of it that way it's actually pretty cool that's very cool yeah it's almost sensual right yeah layers of grass yeah it's like a sculpture all-male to the page Dody sculpt obeying your every command allowing you to communicate with other humans yeah there is a pencil that's what's going on inside what we call the lead pencil lead is is just the the term for what the graphite that's in a pencil has nothing to do with the element led so other forms of carbon lately we discovered the buckyball its carbon 60 60 carbon atoms that are that are that make a sheet that has curved into a sphere the shell of a sphere and it's essentially the lattice points of a soccer ball there's 60 of them if it's if you do it right and then you get what we call a buckyball because it it's it's bucky balls named after Buckminster Fuller and he you know remember the geodesic dome yeah those okay so this the lattice of this is that is caused to image that what that what the Bucky say that again yes so the the the the the geodesic domes which but but mr. fuller made popular I guess in the 1960s they predated him by the way he's credited with inventing it but he didn't who was invent by zeiss huh the planetarium manufacturers in East Germany there was some engineers there they invented this this is an aside but I think it's a pretty cool aside they invented a new way to project stars on the ceiling it's an first optical projector and they put it on their ceiling and say you know this would be cooler if the ceiling were round you know do we have any round ceilings no okay well here's a couple of dollars go build one or invent one and they invented a that's at the geodesic dome just for the purpose of showing a dome where the stars would be this is in 1923 Wow yeah it was pretty cool that's amazing how so carbon-carbon so you put the carbon atoms at the lattice at the intersection points of a geodesic dome and you basically get something that resembles the buckyball it's a new form of carbon it's one of the forms and one of them is diamond and diamond the lattice is is is very tightly bound so no part of a diamond will slide off of any other part and diamond is the hardest natural substance known and that's why you have diamond drills you have diamond anvils and a diamond because it's transparent and it's also very dense light actually slows down inside of a diamond it is only 40% as fast in a diamond as it is in the vacuum of space and because of that it bends so severely in the cuts of the diamond that you can get double and triple reflections inside so light from one direction comes out in a different direction making the diamond look like it's radiant on your finger it's pure carbon it is the same stuff that's in coal except treated differently there was a man who they wrote an article about him in Wired magazine a few years back where he had acquired some sort of technology from the Soviet Union where they had figured out how to make diamond oh we're making him now yeah I did a I hosted Nova Nova ScienceNOW I don't anymore but in might in my tenure as host we visited they blindfolded me because they don't want in De Beers to know about it they then took me to a secret factory manufacturing where there layering carbon onto a lattice in just the way a diamond is created and they're just building diamonds I folded you oh yeah in fact they took away my iPhone because my iPhone has the track that the you know the inertial memory of where it has been so that had to be turned off and I was blindfold and then we did the interview in the in the factory and we looked inside the you know the special patented devices where they make it now here's what's the real weird thing about that oh but wait then I took some of the samples of diamonds that they made and went onto 47th Street in New York to the diamond capital of the world and I showed it to the guys there and they were purer than any other diamond they had they wouldn't haul from Earth this is how ridiculous chicks are this will only get - my wife says she wouldn't want one of those diamonds why because because they're artificial well so I spoke to the Murnau crazy that is I spoke to the merchants and I said what are you gonna do if there's a flood of these diamonds on the market they said people are not gonna want them hey he sounds like you're right exactly cuz they want to know that it was forged in the fires of the belly of the earth yeah and not just out of somebody's back lab and I said okay but you know these are pure diamonds and anything earth is creating because we can do a better job making diamonds than earth can and so for me I'd take the the artificial diamond back yeah and you know some poor African kid isn't have a chip it out of a you know rock with good point it's very important it's loose technology replacing human labour once again we're doing does it freak you out when I mean obviously you're very technologically minded but when you you realize where these conflict minerals come from and the the actual stuff that's in your iPhone someone might have dug it out of a hill in a poor community in Africa I mean it's incredibly ironic yeah but it the it's not uniquely poor as a community that's exploited for some economic gain so so my issue wouldn't be Oh I'm concerned about these minerals I'm concerned about all the places where that's half sure so so you know how many nights it is ironic that the most technologically advanced shit we have needs to come that way you know that that's where in 2012 you know until they've started reform in these areas that's where it was coming yeah except getting to I wouldn't call a diamond technologically advanced when I think of technology I think as my tumbling minerals I'm in conflict in erode or in lithium ion oh oh yeah it's gonna cold your Anna your cellphone's okay right right right right now yeah so so diamond so so yes getting back to what star diamonds getting back to what started this a carbon is is the fourth fourth most common carbon is the fourth most common ingredient in the cosmos and so in the cosmos is full of places where there's high temperature and high pressure and a lot of time and we are nuts we are delighted but not entirely surprised that there are places in the universe even entire planets where a large part of their composition would be pure diamond how long does it take to create a diamond in the Earth's inside I I'm not up on the very because it pressure matters here as well and the you can change one and that affects what you need for the other and I don't have that map memorized in my head but it takes a long time and way longer than your lifetime so you you once you run out of diamonds in the earth you're not getting any more diamonds you're gonna have to make them yourself or find them elsewhere in the universe and how longs it take their machines to make them you can make one in about a week whoa oh yeah you just lay it down you're done how big is it like a doc it's hard to make a big one they make one yeah I'm not carat fluent but the size of a BB so one that could easily fit in a in a in a in a post earring oh so that's it they can't get a big fat crazy it's harder type bra and Elizabeth Taylor so no they're not there yet no no they're not no Kardashians those are rare anyway those extremely rare anyway the most common diamonds are small so yeah they can certainly compete in that marketplace it doesn't DeBeers have like the rumor is the conspiracy theory is we should play that here's the evening the theme going throughout the podcast the the theory is that there's a warehouse that keep there's so many diamonds that they artificially inflate the price by you know slowly releasing them to the marketplace is that true yeah I think there's not a pure market in diamonds but and I think in in the lingo of economics if there is a market in something it means it is traded often enough so that the price at any given moment is the actual price the actual valuation of that that object in the world at that time and it presupposes that there's a full access to supplies and demand and nothing is being withheld so yes De Beers is withholding if not to be or someone else is withholding diamonds from the marketplace to assure a certain price if they flooded the market the price would drop goddamnit mrs. Rogan you listen to this shit huh need a real diamond well here's the scary part ridiculous the universe here we are killing each other over resources buried in the ground and in the sands when the including sources of energy chemical energy in that case whereas in the universe has an unlimited supply of everything so why is it again er G why isn't that reflected in the budget that we put into space travel it seems ridiculous and short-sighted you know it seems like you can take all this military industrial money and say listen you fuckers want to get really rich let's get crazy let's go space cowboy style and it's go lasso some rock this space resources company is doing exactly that they're marketing these resources they they they're targeting asteroids for economic exploitation how does that work is it like this space is eventually gonna be like the homesteaders back in the 1800s where you would move there and get a plot of land are you gonna be able to claim plots of space currently space law which is an interesting frontier in you know at the UN and in other places space law has certain rules and regulations one of them I think is unrealistic and it has to do with the waging of war and I'll get to that in a minute but the other one is lian's space huh no it did forbids warfare its forbid space from serving as a platform for for war yeah Wow but I think that's completely not even unrealistic and I'll tell you why in a minute but and people say oh space should be peace with a peaceful place I think that is naive that's naive bordering on stupid they obviously haven't seen so so so in in space so the way the laws the books now read that could change with the emerging consensus the way it now reads is you cannot own anything off the earth however no one can stop you from putting a flag on it and no one can stop you from mining resources from it you just can't claim to own it and require that someone else pay you to use it okay so in other words there's no private property and there's no private objects in space but if you do acquire an object and you bring it back can you use it for profit that hasn't been fully explored legally yet yeah if you invested all the money I think the the laws are gonna go in the favor of free-market capitalism and this is why conspiracy theories will step in and say it's that's why Obama's moving towards socialism they're trying to control all the resources and space they want to pull in all those minerals and diamonds except when there's Jews in their marketplace stranglehold on the diamond industry except the rate at which Obama's plan to return to space there's much love is not commensurate with that as a viable unless you take into account the the conspiracy theory to keep the elites alive forever and start killing off people with eugenics and Wars there's a lot of people that that's another very fine conspiracy theory crop circles and chemtrails I don't know if you're familiar with either one of those I don't know about chemtrails but certainly crop circles everybody knows about the crop circles I mean come on don't know about chemtrails know what a chem trail I need to introduce you to Eddie Bravo what chemtrails are is one of the easily the silliest conspiracy theories there's something there's validity to it unfortunately and that first of all cloud seeding has been done in in many cultures it's done like a regular open basis in the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi they made it rain 50 times last year like they're doing it every week they can you can do it we know that scientifically but what they're claiming is that the the government is spraying shit out of planes and these are not regular planes and those contrails that last forever those are actually chemtrails those are fake clouds and there's all sorts of different things they're spraying that control the populace through your house brain what is it telling what is how in what way is it controlling it so what is fast what took too many facts you've already gone too far with this I had to talk to a pilot I said okay look this is drives me crazy because like when we were kids man those clouds in the sky when a plane would fly over they would dissipate really quickly but now they stay forever they're fucking spraying us with shit man this is how crazy people are so then I talked to a pilot and I said okay what is what why is it what's how come sometimes the clouds go away and sometimes a persistence of contrails yes it's amount of how much atmosphere how much water is in the atmosphere which varies yeah oh thank you that's all I need to know so when the jet engine flies through it makes an artificial cloud it really does it's pearls up the water in the wind and in its wake it leaves this temporary cloud and it has to cool in order for the to condense and if you look immediately outside of the engine there's an interval where it is not clouded if it's completely transparent right and then it cools reaching the temperature of the surrounding air and then it condenses out but the the levels of moisture are different at different altitudes so a plane will not leave the same contrail at all altitudes from near an airport up to 40 exactly just as like some areas it rains and some areas are desert there's areas of in it shouldn't it should be it but people and people get really wacky with that one that's a weird one when it's another one where there's very little looking into the possible answers it's like they want it they want they want it to be want it to be they want it to be cancer-causing things that the government spraying on us in order to lower the population numbers because there's too many of us right that's why there's lithium in the water supply Neil Tyson have you like I had its conversation when someone said do you know there's antidepressants in the water supply well that's because people flush their antidepressants and they might pay they pee and some of its Ruth I go but the amount is so tiny this is nothing that you could ever play it's not psychoactive amounts like how do you know that man how do you know that do you know man go get some water and bring it put to a fucking testing you can test this stop freaking me out there's enough real shit to freak me out what drives me nuts is like end of the world people I would I would have conversations with them and they were convinced this mine thing and all the societies all headed towards a certain thing it's really obvious and I'm like do you ever pay attention of supervolcano's yeah the real issues to be contended with here there's some real shit going on in Yellowstone yeah like Yellowstone every six to eight hundred thousand years essentially kills half the continent off do you know that we when we were growing up Old Faithful was called Old Faithful and it was faithful to the clock and then there was some geologic stuff that happened and now it'll still blow but it's not regular I saw this every name sometimes faithful you know well he held it together for a long time yeah you got to get some credit yeah yeah the there was a National Geographic piece on Yellowstone where it was right when they sort of figured out that Yellowstone was a caldera volcano figured out not large it was and they were talking about the the frequency of earthquakes and it was over like a six month period or something like that there was two thousand earthquakes in Yellowstone oh yeah well it depends on what your threshold is for measuring an earthquake yeah most most earthquakes in the world if they happen right under your feet you wouldn't notice it and so because the their energy level is so low that they don't even get past the absorbers in your knee you got new knees or new hips what did you lick immense new ligaments answer yet yeah almost no matter the condition of your knees you wouldn't feel an earthquake up to two or three good knee and in New York City with a subway rumbling underfoot where I live that's like 4.5 on the Richter scale yeah it's something in fact when the World Trade Center collapsed that triggered I made I was four blocks away when it happened that triggered I paid very close attention to everything that was happening including what kind of vibration in the ground cause and was about like the a-train going you know 30 miles an hour just below your so when the train goes you feel it oh yeah yeah and you don't and you ignore it because it's the normal vibrations of life so that's like city living yeah 3 2 3 and 4 so and so you look at the earthquake accounting there are tons of these and so they don't really matter until it can structurally hurt something and then you talk about it becomes a news item so so the count of earthquakes is not interesting you want the number of earthquakes above 7 above 6 and a half above 5 they start getting interesting but not lethal yet you know so yeah you want it's such a threshold then give me the number so are those earthquakes those small ones like the El some ones are they going on everywhere it's just they're measuring in Yellowstone yeah well some there's more goes some places are more geo active geologically active than others places that are geologically active where you get the occasional seven eight nine or seven and eight on the Richter scale or whatever the scale is called today those places you getting these low ones practically all the time yeah all the time ok so freaking out about Yellowstone having mm earth quakes like really should freak out about 2007 yeah that's exactly right and this is another one of these things where it's it's partial information scaled up into a catastrophe scenario that feeds people's fears and and the kind of fear that people delight in hmm people say oh you know Manhattan has a fault line running right down the middle Manhattan where three million people live and work and yeah it does and it's been dead for a million years that's a geologically dead fault okay so it hasn't moved in a million no I don't know the number but it's it's dead I mean it's nothing happening there we've got you know place wings on it there's not and part of it is what created Harlem Heights which overlooks Harlem in fact when Columbia moved in they renamed it it's actually called they call it Morningside Heights but it's actually Harlem Heights and that's a raised part of Manhattan it's a well above the lower areas where the rest of Harlem is it's a cool so it Manhattan has remnant geologic features not all of it has been bulldozed over to put skyscrapers that's fascinating I didn't know that it was actually above it because of a vault because of a fall yeah so it's a fault line a fascinating fault right if some of that was retained in Central Park they left some geologically interesting features there but the point is they're earthquakes down to level two what we're measurable there happen all the time in most places and they have but they happen often in most places and and practically continuously where you are geologically active and for folks don't know what we're talking about earlier when we said a caldera volcano essentially what it is is a volcano that when it blows it leaves like almost like a crater it leaves like a gigantic it's 300 kilometers in a supervolcano you basically repave major land areas of Earth you know Venus has very few craters on it and given its age and the fact that there is no rain or weather systems that could erode them you can ask well what's going on there and further analysis shows that Venus completely repave z-- its surface at regular intervals that if you can pull enough lava which is just liquid rock right it's liquid rock you pull it out of the liquefied layers of the planet and put it on the surface it'll spill out spread around and cover up all craters that might have been there before do you know what week you know the Sea of Tranquility what does that tell everybody spot on the moon it's a place on the moon it's it's called a sea because back before we knew anything about the moon it was a large dark area flat dark area of the moon and we imagined that maybe there's water there and if there's water there and so we there's there regions called seas you know what these actually are they're volcanic basins when the moon was geologically active lava spilled out but spread all over the surface of the Moon as far as it could reach and these became what would today we call seas and you know the Seas happen very late because they have fewer craters than adjacent areas where the lava did not spill in so you could date the surface of the Moon based on how many craters there are within a given area do you ever feel like you mean is since your fascination is space waits up to finish that so on Venus where there are very few craters when we know there should be many that tells us that the entire surface suffers from fresh and volcanic flow unlike the moon where the last time it laid out these seas is billions of years ago so it's being it's just constant superevil sensually yeah when you see something like the moon which is completely covered in in in meteor impacts it's one of the things that really sets in to my mind or gives me a reference point for time because we've we are we aren't seeing these big impacts on a regular basis in fact we've only recorded a few of them what the recent one in Jupiter this massive one was by yeah which was an amateur astronomer right yeah caught it and the the one there's a flash of light on juvenile just by accident car yeah yeah and then there was the other one the one that was observed is 94 yeah the big one yeah when was that yeah so that one was coming shoemaker-levy 9 yeah yeah and that one it was a comet that the tidal forces of Jupiter on a previous pass had broken that solid comet up into two dozen smaller but still significant chunks of comet material and it had a trajectory that was headed straight for Jupiter and we were ready for it and the Hubble telescope was in place and everybody was aiming and each one of these blobs of Comet that fell into Jupiter they plunged into the atmosphere and exploded with more energy than all the atomic all the bombs in the American arsenal and so the the sorry a better way to say that is it plunge with more energy than the impact that rendered the dinosaurs that rendered the dinosaurs extinct on earth and so to get a sense of the energetics of the solar system it's extraordinary and is it so the solar system to get to your point is a shooting gallery and the moon which is sitting right in front of our nose it's our nearest neighbor that writ large is the evidence of what earth plows through daily and we are protected by our atmosphere from most of it and my other point was that when you see that you see all the impacts that there's so many impacts when you try to wrap your head around how many years a million years is how many years a billion people have it's is it's one of the hardest impossible our brains are wired for understanding whether we'll be eaten by a tiger or lion right or whether you know that space and time our minds interact with it in very terrestrial ways hmm with the advent of the telescope and our understandings of the laws of physics we've had to come to an understanding of the depth of time and the expanse of space that completely transcends what it is natural for us to contemplate and so you have to almost grow accustomed to these facts rather than take them into your heart because they fall so far beyond anything we've been trained to think about and that's why it's so hard for anyone to believe that you can go from a microorganism to a giraffe or a human being over the billions of years wave cycle of life do you believe in evolution is just it's not a matter of belief it's what the evidence shows and and when I'm given the choice I'm going with the evidence you're listening silly that's a ridiculous way to live so this depth of time just like a piece of rock like the moon where you see all those impacts you think how long is that what am I looking at yeah how much how much time did it take for all those rocks to fly to space and hit that and as a temporary organism you being a human being who has this sort of terrestrial fascination it's got to be like almost like a mad race to collect information in an infinitely impossible universe we are like mayflies in the cosmos yeah not even that think about it am a flaw not even that that's right think of what doesn't may fly know of a change of seasons yeah for a change of years these are unfathomably long timescales hmm to the lifecycle of a mayfly generations yeah and Salander mom and so here we are were not for the methods and tools of science we would have no clue about the universe of time and the universe of space that exists beyond the the physical accessibility of our biological form so when you sow an interesting analogy to this I think is when you look up at a puffy cloud to you it's just a cloud sitting there and it has a shape but we've all seen time-lapse of clouds particularly rain clouds that's a turbulent place that the bubbles of cloud and particularly the cumulonimbus they're just gurgling up they're boiling up through the center and it keeps regenerating and rain is coming out the bottom and that doesn't take much of a time-lapsed video to capture 10 minutes 15 minutes but that's not our understanding of clouds our understanding is that they're just these things peacefully floating there right and that's just human perception versus a 15 minute time lapse video right imagine human perception versus the billions of years of cosmic evolution then it really is a shooting yet we don't stand a chance when when you you see them you're right over there fella what happens when you see that the potential hazards and catastrophes of space and you think about a temporary lifespan of a human being does it does it frustrate you at all um is it as if there's a seemed like god I'm gonna miss a lot of shit well there's several consequences one of them is we don't know how to understand those dangers if I say a killer asteroid is gonna come every hundred million years you'll say oh don't worry about it but when it comes it'll render you extinct and we don't know when it's going to come Beach 100 million years from now do you even have the the temerity to say well I'd better build a protection plan in on the possibility that it comes in my lifetime or in the lifetime of all my loved generation generations that follow we we don't know how to react we're not wired for some thought let me tell you how badly were not wired for that thought what happens after a hurricane devastates a coastline we rebuilt we rebuilt oh it's not gonna happen to me this is stuff within your lifetime right this is the 20 year hurricane the 30 year hurricane not the not the 200 year 500,000 year hurricane so our unfortunately our brains aren't wired for this so it's a good thing that we have methods and tools that can compensate for this shortcoming do we have any sort of scientific plan to handle asteroid impacts to a funnel paper oh yeah we've got a total solution worked out in paper completely unfunded at the moment when you say on paper is it like you can do the engineering you can do the engineering and it's it's it'll work what are the physics in engineering what do they do they knock it out of orbit or something know if you're macho if you blow the sucker out that's just a loan approach - I forgot I've been talking to an MMA guy here right jiu-jitsu so they're different solutions that the problem is yet we could conceivably blow the thing up but as Americans we're really good at blowing stuff up and we're less good at knowing where the pieces land afterwards so I don't want to blow this thing into six pieces and still have all those six pieces headed towards Earth right all right so the kinder gentler solution is to deflect it from harm's way and there's something called a gravitational tractor beam essentially and that's the poetic way to say the the sci-fi way to say it but really you put a space pod out there that has a gravitational field that attracts slowly attracts the asteroid into a slightly different orbit and if you get there early enough you don't have to deflect it by much because that deflection accumulates and all you needed to do is miss earth mmm no it's still out there to harm you another day but if you get good at this you just have you know just like you have the the block protection nighttime protection force you know in the neighborhood well you'd have the asteroid protection force and that would be protecting Earth from asteroid and Jupiter protects us for most asteroids well for most of the things that haul their way in from outside the solar system comets most asteroids are within the orbit of Jupiter so Jupiter doesn't need to protect us from them well we we would want it to it just doesn't because their orbits don't reach Jupiter for enough to Jupiter to bat it into a new place but comets that come from far far beyond the orbit of Jupiter Jupiter's they when they come near Jupiter they feel Jupiter's Titanic gravitational field and Jupiter basically bends them into a new orbit and so many of them don't even make it past Earth's orbit on its way towards the Sun I mean they so these new orbits clears the space for our survival here on earth and so Jupiter is our friend it's it's our it's our friend that takes care of the bullies in the schoolyard do we know enough about other solar systems to know whether or not this is a typical setup it was our urge given what's called the Copernican principle to say that we're not special we're average and if we're average then other solar systems should look like us because the Sun is kind of average and you know we're not on the littlest planet or the biggest planet you know so you make some some assumptions as the star systems came in to the catalogs as our techniques and methods to observe other planets in the solar system arose we started to learn that our solar system is not typical that most solar system's most star systems have a jupiter-sized object much closer to their host star then our Jupiter is so then we say well way well then why is our star system different from theirs and so it's a frontier it's an active frontier and no one is putting their bets on any one kind of solar system as being the most representative and and we're building the catalog now so so the catalog that has 700 or so exoplanets in it that's only 500 star systems meant we're now building the catalogues of the secondary tertiary planets in the star systems that we've already discovered that's a lot of binary star systems as well right where there's more than one Sun oh well first if you look up at the night sky almost half of all the dots of light you see if you pull out a telescope will reveal themselves to be binary or triple star systems it is a kid as as common as the breeze in the universe well the challenge here is what happens to a planet in orbit around a binary or multiple star system that's the challenge and is the atmosphere stable enough to support all that that would be a concern no matter where the planet is but here's the challenge with a multi star star system as the planet orbits maybe it'll get really close to one star and really far from another and maybe the orbit is entangled between the two of them trying to do figure Eight's the if you have an unstable orbit you are likely to eject the planet forever into interstellar space and in fact data are now showing that interstellar space may have more rogue planets that have been ejected at for having misbehaved orbits from their star system then there are stars within planetary systems themselves so G just blew my fucking mind they're called rogue planets no no let me no no I'm just beginning here so watch so we also know that many planets have still retained their heat of formation long after they've come into existence earth still has heat churning a source of energy that is not traceable to the Sun this is what creates the magma that's sitting below Earth's crust the Sun didn't heat that that's heat generated within the earth some is left over from formation others is created from radioactive decay of elements but we've got an energy source and our biology books from decades ago said life needs sunlight no no no life needs energy it doesn't care if it comes from the Sun and all Kanak vents at the bottom of the sea for sunlight for example the the Juan de Fuca Ridge off of the the coast of of Washington is a vent in the bottom of the ocean that is releasing the heat from below and well it's an energy source it's at the bottom of the ocean where this where the Sun don't shine or the Sun don't reach and yet there's life form thriving there existing on a form of geochemical energy it's got nothing to do with the Sun the fact that we've discovered exotic life on Earth has broadened the net that we have cast into space in our search for life in the universe no longer do we need to look for the 72-degree pond in an oxygen atmosphere planet in our search for life it so this Goldilocks zone where everything had to be perfect we've got life thriving in places that would kill us and we are not to measure the ultimate measure of what the conditions that life requires to survive so now that we're looking with this very broad net we can say to ourselves for these vagabond planets if they still have their source of energy churning within maybe there's life there and if that's the case the galaxy could be teeming with life and the fact that we're focusing our search on planets around stars may simply be limiting all that we can discover in the cosmos so these planets could essentially be spaceships filled with life forms headed our way and they might even slam into us well metaphorical spaceships yeah and the problem is since they're they're homeless there's nothing to illuminate them so they're pitch black flying through the galaxy now if some of the heat reaches the surface you can use infrared telescopes that might pick them up but we don't we wouldn't even know where to look well isn't that the thought about the the object they believe is somewhere outside of the Kuiper belt is that what I say it Hyper yeah yes so this is an astronomer mid 20th century who hypothesized that beyond the outermost planet there would be sort of the leftovers the solar system that didn't collect into a bonafide red-blooded planet but it should still the residues should still be out there because if you're a residue in an orbit where a red-blooded planet exists you're going to collide with that planet eventually you're gonna merge with the planet and make that planet even bigger this is one of the failed criteria for Pluto being classified as a planet because it is in a zone in the solar system that has not cleared its orbit it is in the Kuiper belt in the inner edge of it yes but it is it is it is joined by countless thousands of other icy bodies earth yes we plow through crap in the in our in our orbit but if it is the ratio of the mass of the stuff we plow into to Earth's mass is like gnats flying into an elephant all right that doesn't knock over the elephant it is of no concern to the elephant anything that could still possibly collide with us earth won't even care will care because it will affect the ecosystem but earth the planet is so much more massive than anything we would ever collide with from now to the end of the solar system we have basically cleared our orbit anything dangerous pluto has not so that was a damning fact in the ruling that got it demoted from planets so on meaning that it doesn't have enough mass to attract all the other objects that are nearby I need it as anything else and so it's just a swarm of comets the Kuiper belt of comets so now if you go beyond the Kuiper belt you're so far from the Sun if you're gonna talk to us it would be through reflected sunlight but you're so far away nothing yeah it's the and and these things are really dark objects to begin with so how do they find them well it'd be hard so it's possible you can have a big object well beyond the Kuiper belt there just be really hard to find and I can say without without hesitation that if there's a huge object out there it's gravity is of no consequence to anything that's going on between us and the Kuiper belt I just thought it was fascinating because the idea was that there was a jupiter-sized planet so far outside of our solar system or what we consider our solar system that it was causing some sort of a gravity no effect on the Kuiper belt knows what you might be remembering is the nemesis object what is that okay okay now I'm feeding your my cumin your chili let the record show the man's eyebrows moved up into his forehead so there was an analysis of the extinction episodes in the history of the earth that suggested that perhaps they were episodic or periodic every sort of 20 million years or so there was a little dip in the fossil record and we said well all right you know by the way geologists looked for indicators in the fossil record and in the rock record to Demark where one ERA one period one epoch begins and another one ends so for example the dinosaurs croaked at the beginning at 65 million years ago at the KT boundary it's got some other name lately I haven't kept up with that but that boundary they knew it was a boundary so they dated they called that a different geologic zone that which followed 65 million years ago compared to that which came before it and they did that long before they knew what the hell happened there we would later learn that an asteroid struck and it might have been there surely were some supervolcano activity and they would have called the Deccan Traps and so there's a lot of bad stuff going on in the earth at that time so it was a hostile to life we lost 70% of the world's life species in that period of time right there 65 million years ago devastating so that might this awesome for us because that's how we here right yeah in fact flowering plants so asteroids are our friend yes yeah they reset the world they had a fucked up environment it was a bad neighborhood dinosaurs were everywhere go ahead for us didn't make it we were just rats we were scurrying underfoot as early rodents yes and we were just orders for t-rex basically and you take them out of the ecological niche we can then aspire to to evolve to something more interesting than it's something that can consider the Kuiper belt yes and so so so it was imagined that maybe there's an object that's so far away you can't see it but it's on this huge looping orbit that comes by the Sun every 20 million years because that's the cycle of these extinction episodes and if that's the case no it doesn't hit us it has to stay around for the next cycle so what does it do it has a gravitational field that perturbs these outer comets and sends a rain of comets down into the inner solar system creating impact extinctions on a cycle of every 20 million years this was proposed back in the 1980s but it's not an object that anyone has ever seen it's an object whose existence was in inferred threat or or asserted based on the record of extinction in the fossil record further analysis of the fossil record doesn't actually hold up this cyclical extinction pattern it's more it's more erratic than that and so you can't really so it's it's evaporated as a as an idea but it was clever and and intriguing and got a lot of headlines and I think it's the same thing that I'm what I read what I read was from 2010 it was something about the Oort cloud no RT cloud yes that's a that's a comet a swarm of comets not quite halfway to the nearest star but very far out there that is the sort of the outer reaches of the gravitational grasp of the Sun this is the guys if you go much beyond that your gravitational allegiance is uncertain and you could fall into the next star rather than fall towards the Sun the guys were I don't know if you heard of these guys astrophysicists John Matisse and Daniel Whitmore from the University of Louisiana came up with a theory that said that something smaller than a Jovian mass would not be strong enough to perform this task they believe that there's something up to 25% of them okay it's four times as big as Jupiter could be responsible for sending these objects in our direction this is just a random theory that these guys put together it wasn't completely accepted what they're doing it no no no there's no there's no known such object what you what people are doing and I don't fault them for it it's creative it would make awesome science fiction storytelling is there's something you need to explain here on earth somebody went extinct there is some wave of comets there's some observation that was never repeated there's some thing you got to come up with and so you say well we know the Oort cloud exists we know you can perturb those orbits and and send them careening down towards the inner solar system and those that Jupiter doesn't bat away like batting practice those that get through Jupiter's gravitational shield could wreak havoc on earth yeah yeah but that's it's it's it's it's inventing a lot to explain something you don't know right so it's inventing more of what you don't know that could be true to explain what you don't right that which you don't have any other evidence to support so it's fun speculation fun speculations but beyond that to say oh it's real it must be happening no no it's just let someone write a good sci-fi story on it here's what's fun about it and this is why I bring it up most people I've talked to this about the subject to many many people and I myself personally I'm not immune to this I find it very fascinating however how much have I looked into the actual planets that we absolutely know a real not that much but I'm worried about this fucking fake planet that may or may not exist do they might have found another planet it's this idea of something hidden and mysterious which is so compelling and attractive that's a fascinating psychological observation it's a weird thing we want to believe there's something mysterious that we don't understand and could be there but we don't know anything about yet where there's plenty of things we do know something about but we want to know more why don't you help yes all right and by the way the universe is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine and so so to say I need your creativity and you know to keep your life interesting no we got black holes that are slaying stars layer by layer we've met do you realize that if you fall into a black hole you will see the entire future of the universe unfold in front of you in a matter of moments and you will emerge into another space-time created by the singularity of the black hole you just fell into he just brought to us so so let's talk about that all right yeah you know why are we wasting time talking about whether the Saturn 5 rocket I mean cuz we're fascinated by shit that's unproven ok mysterious shit look I got a broken brain okay there's a reason for me you want some more cool stuff all right Mars once had liquid running water coursing on its surface fun question it has geologic Mars illogic features that are are that the correspond in every way to the geologic features you see when you fly over the Mississippi River you see you see tributaries leading to larger rivers you see me hindering pathways you see river deltas at the at the ED into the river basin you see dried lake beds you see all of this but Mars is bone-dry today something happened to the water we don't know what we're pretty sure it's sunk down beneath the surface and a kind of permafrost my point is if any time in the past Mars had liquid running water every place on earth there's liquid running water there's life there is evidence to think that Mars was habitable with liquid running water before Earth was we'll see then you just started up another conspiracy theory that's the Richard Hoagland group of people that believed that there was pyramids and a face on Mars something there was civilization I have something better than that all right that if Mars was fertile for life before Earth something we learned recently in the last 10 years that asteroid impacts there you go can be strong can be violent enough that they can fling surrounding rocks with escape velocity into interplanetary space where they will drift until they are attracted by the gravity of some other planet and they will then fall and land on its surface if Mars was fertile and formed life microbial though it may only have been it's microbial life that can survive dehydration high radiation absence of can we have found what we call extremophiles on earth like I like I said a moment ago that that thrive under conditions that would kill us high pressure low pressure high temperature low temperature high radiation all of these conditions the microbes would have encountered on Mars Banach thrust into space and making that journey well if that's possible and if that's the case then life on Earth could have been seeded by life on Mars making every life-form on earth a descendant of Martians more importantly why do we have bacteria that could survive high radiation in the first place what business does that have here beneath Earth's protective atmosphere thriving in places where there isn't high radiation we have life forms that can survive what that trip through space would have subject' what a trip through space would have what it would have been subjected to by a trip through space so you have an unsent no by the way life does not evolve the way anyone typically thinks it does you're not some organism that then adapts to a new environment no you just die the variation in organisms allows some to thrive in conditions that would otherwise kill you and it's my genetic offspring that continue nobody adapted to anything nature is selecting that subset of the variation in a generation that has survival properties for that next assault in the environment so if Mars is teeming with life and microbes are flying into the app is the flying into space as stowaways and the nooks and crannies of rocks then that population will be selected for those microbes that can survive that journey through space does a planet need any sort of an atmosphere in order to support life where they just need water I all we know is what can support life as we know it right all right I don't know if we're inventive enough to invent other kinds of life form but life as we know it requires liquid water because that that is allows nutrients to move through our vessel that we call our bodies and right on down to microorganisms we all thrive and use liquid water and we need a heat source and more specifically a heat gradient there has to be a place where there's more energy in one place than somewhere else when you have a gradient then you can create and sustain life as we know it without that there's no known way to do it so the entropy laws work against you to make life so so your point is that these it's possible that organisms could be growing even on asteroids then oh oh sorry so your point was do we need an atmosphere yeah well late recent evidence suggests that possibly more than half of the mass of biology the biomass of Earth lives and thrives beneath Earth's surface not on its surface if that's the case what's going on in the atmosphere is relatively irrelevant if you're thriving deep within a nook and cranny of a rock the mile down you know don't they have some air down yeah yeah there's some air but you know it's not cycling with what's going on in our air you know so the rules become broader right or bored or altered from what you would presume the life requires and so to talk about a planet being habitable we should no longer think only of what the surface of that planet supplies we need to think more broadly about what could go on deep within its surface as well we're pretty sure there are no large macroscopic organisms lumbering around like an Journey to the Center of the Earth of Jules Verne where they're creatures down there you know no Hollow Earth yeah Hollow Earth no there's no evidence that we have huge creatures the and the behavior of material doesn't allow there to be huge cavities that haven't over the billions of years completely been filled in when I say huge I mean you know you know hundreds of miles large no the system would collapse into that rapidly and you can get smaller cavity like Carlsbad Caverns that sort of thing but but nothing you know staggeringly large now when you consider all the possibilities for life in the universe which are you know almost infinite right yeah they're probably more ways to make life than we haven't thought of then the way to make life that is that we know of you know here on earth that we're just not imaginative we just don't you know I'm reminded of if I get a little literate on you for a moment in the late 18th century there's a book published called Cosmo Pharos by Christian Huygens and he was a he was a polymath of that he was a great at math and physics and biology he wrote a book exploring what life might be like on all the planets and listen to this reasoning this is hilarious he said Jupiter well it's clear it's got an atmosphere because through a telescope you see bands of gas moving across its surface well if it has an atmosphere then life forms there would probably exploit that atmosphere the way we do because it has an atmosphere it means it probably has rain because we get rain out of habit our atmosphere if it has rain it must have oceans if it has oceans they must need a means for gather for traveling so they would build ships with sails if those ships have sails they would need rope so they probably have him you know what so this was obviously extrapolation to an extreme right but just it analyzed that for one split second every supposition was founded rooted in what we do as humans and there's no greater hubris than to presume that what we find somewhere else would just like us or act just like us or have the same needs as us I always felt that way about or even have the same number of senses as us they could have fewer they could have more hmm think about how much of our lives are influenced how much of our society is built on services that bring pleasure to our senses our sense of touch we can go you go get a massage damn right you can our our sense of taste there is food brought to high cuisine right our sense of hearing Shore we we make beautiful music our sense of sight we make great art so much of what we do is to satisfy our five traditional senses and imagine if we had ten senses or twenty I have a theory on that it's called the fart principle I had no understanding of how that principle could relate to this but I'm all ears so this is why if you did not have a nose and you could live your whole life without a sense of smell in the year 2012 it's very possible if you if someone farted in front of you you'd have no idea that this terrible gas is you're inhaling it's in your note you wouldn't have that sense of smell so you could exist and not have any idea because gas is invisible okay that's a bad example and I'll tell you what I'm good no no I'll tell you why could be alien life form all around us all the time that we don't have the sense to like it's like worms can't see you'll be able we can so two things so first it's it's a good example in the sense that no pun intended in the sense of that without if who knows what senses we're missing and therefore who knows what there is to measure in our world around us that we are completely missing right all right get back to that in a minute regarding your fart theory yes here's the problem all right the my theories up for peer review that is totally getting peer review the device it's the right thing to call it - it's a legitimate hypothesis thank you it's out on the table now here you go you ready it's my last uh one of the active ingredients in the smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide mm-hmm it turns out hydrogen sulfide is extremely lethal is one of the most lethal gases that exists well why do we have such a good sense of smell for that why don't we smell other get why don't we smell nitrogen mm-hmm well we don't need to smell nitrogen because it's not gonna kill us because it's 78% of what you breathe anyway hmm we have evolved a hypersensitive sense for the smell of hydrogen sulfide if if there was a Jenner if you gave birth to someone who said hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful and let's smell more of it let's get canisters of it they're dead ten minutes later no longer able to propagate the gene that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide we had to not like that smell otherwise we would not have survived the by the way hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the the digestive activity of anaerobic microbes that's why it comes out of your lower intestine with not only where the Sun don't shine where oxygen doesn't exist the microbes they thrive down there they are an aerobic and hydrogen sulfide is one of their byproducts it has been theorized that there have been places and times on earth where the ocean currents stopped and when ocean currents stopped oxygen at the surface of the ocean never makes it to the bottom so you can't sustain oxygen life forms at the bottom of the ocean there are no fish there wouldn't be any fishes down there if the ocean currents stopped because the ocean currents not only go from one place to another in the world they circle they circulate top to bottom right so it's a two-dimensional thing going on three dimensions actually so so if something happens on earth will you stop the Oceanic cycles you can create a condition in the lower ocean where anaerobic life-forms thrive and if they thrive they out gas and one of the out gases is hydrogen sulfide it will gurgle up from the bottom of the ocean rise up near the shores turning shorelines into the smell of cesspools if you were alive at the time and didn't run away from that you would have simply died from it that is all well and good therefore the normal level the nose theory that if we didn't have a nose we could all just fart we didn't have a nose we wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide and humans would not have survived it and some other creature would be having this interview right now I not agree with you and disagree with you at the same time and here's why what you're saying involves real people and real life adaptation to our environment what I'm talking about is aliens that are just like farts and this is why you gave me a crazy long-winded really in-depth explanation but you still don't discredit the possibility that just like the sense of smell it exists but it is invisible there could be many things around us that are also invisible but we have not developed any means to detect them okay you were being metaphor so it works right Wi-Fi yeah well but you as Beach Boys are you being metaphorical with your fart yes Oh God live no one would have had to have it no no I know that's what I overanalyze that's cool oh by the way one global warming scenario is the currents yes do you see the day after tomorrow did you see that unbelievably horrible yeah yeah that one was was that went to blows yo good who was bad where was the cancer baby and everybody else is dead outside but there she's surviving with the cancer baby and she's gonna stay there for the kid meanwhile hundred billion people are dead so no rights at all so then I get back to your nose your partner she's crazy okay so now here's why you're probably not right well definitely not right look it's a ridiculous idea no no no but there's a reason why you're probably not right okay okay because beginning in the 1600s we learned that our senses are not only they not only fool us they and occasionally don't work they're not all that the universe tells us is they are not they don't have the capacity to recognize all that's going on in the universe well certainly at a microscopic level well that's my point that's my point so in the early 1600s two important advances as you late fifteen hundred you had the invention of the microscope and you had the event of the telescope this is really the first steps to enhance our senses beyond what our human biology endowed us with and upon doing so we discovered things about the world that were previously oblivious to us we discovered nose farts when Louie when Leeuwen Hoch brought his telescope out of his microscope to a drop of pond water and saw what we were called anima culés what else were you gonna call the little things paramecia and protozoa thriving in a drop of water that was a nose for it keeping with your vocabulary that was something that previously no one had any idea was there and my point is beginning in 1600 and with an ever improving march forward the methods and tools of science have served to enhance our senses increase our senses increase the range of our senses but more importantly give us whole kinds of senses that your five senses could have never even imagined that our human biology couldn't even approximate so as so so what's an example yeah we don't have senses to detect magnetic field at all that's why you can sit in a MRI chamber and sit there in you know whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea the strength of the magnetic field that's being cast across your body we don't have sensors for it you don't have sensors for radio uh or radio waves what the difference there is we do have sensors for one aspect of the electromagnetic spectrum we have sensors for infrared visible and a delayed sense for ultraviolet sent me oh wow that's really loud and a creative ringtone just like mine I learned that ghosts aren't dangerous he goes old yeah yeah so so the point is the radio waves are part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum we we have access to some of that and we call that for obvious reasons visible light right but outside of the range of visible light you have ultraviolet x-rays gamma rays radio waves microwaves so yes we can't see radio waves but that would just be an extension of our senses in the way Geordi and Star Trek The Next Generation had his visor though that visor allowed him to see the entire East Coast arch I got I got it had to go there just cause I had to and my sideburns are Star Trek sideburns I don't know a few so he puts that what he that visor enabled him to see the entire electromagnetic spectrum if we were thusly equipped you'd walk down the street and the microwave towers would be ablaze with microwaves and you tuned into sort of ultraviolet and if you you think twice about going to the beach because that's the stuff that gives you skin cancer especially people with lighter skin if you if if you want to see what would be a good example if you want to see if there's a burglar entering your house just shift over to infrared if the burglar is warm-blooded they will show up even if all the lights are out like the predator exactly exactly it's another way to detect the light so so we have so science has broadened our senses and given a sense is that our human biology could not have even thought of or invented so the notion at this day and age that something has happened on this tabletop that is eluding us I think is just simply unlikely because we're so good now at finding things that previously escaped our notice right in front of us right now that frontier is that the energy extremes of the CERN accelerator in Switzerland that frontier is at the James Webb Space Telescope where we're gonna look at the earliest formation of matter in the history of the universe these are the extremes of our measurements of nature today the biological limitations of human beings the birth and the death you know the fact that we are all born and we all die do we apply those to the universe for a reason or do we know that there was a birth is that is that a hundred percent sure that before the Big Bang there was no but there was something yes so do we know that yes so we don't know we don't what happened before the Big Bang so that's my first and highest level answer to you that doesn't mean some people don't have some creative ideas but the only real answer is we don't know and we have top people working on it all right so now some of the creative ideas are quantum physics which is the most successful theory of physics there ever was quantum theory tells us that the early universe may have been a fluctuation in the laws of physics allowing other fluctuations at the same time so that we would but one bubble of many comprising an infinite set of bubbles deserving the retrospectively obvious name multiverse the multiverse theories are scarce the multiverse and so if there's a multiverse then then we're just one bubble and this multiverse is just churning them out some of them by the way but we're on a one-way expansion trip other universes the laws of physics might be slightly different with a condition the initial conditions might be slightly altered from ours and it would expand it and we collapse they'd have a big squeeze at the end some universes my crew might be created without any matter at all so you have a universe with no one to contemplate it we happen to have a universe where the matter and energy within it assembled and achieved consciousness so a universe where there's no matter at all but it's infinite and self comprised like it is at the University I can't get here from there not that we know of but there could be a way we might be able to invent a multiverse transport kit where you leave your universe and enter another but I don't recommend that yes because if they've lost it if the laws of physics are even slightly different to charge on the electron the the mass of the neutron if any of these are slightly different then everything that holds you together all the physical laws that come together to make you including all the forces of nature they would just completely collapse in the existence if you stepped into the zone of this other universe or they take on some other form or shape that we can't even imagine so yeah I don't want to I you know that's when he's you flip you send in a probe or something but you send yourself so that's why I joke about this half seriously that if an alien comes to visit I want to make sure in advance that they're not made of antimatter so I flip them a coin and they catch it if they don't explode together annihilation then I'll shake their hand so what it matters they welcome to earth explode just touching the ground then yeah well they might have hover hover glide you know I don't like yes well plus they're touching the atmosphere which is matter so so if I meet him in space let's say so if they're made of antimatter you shake hands everybody does you completely annihilate yeah so that's what happens in our own universe imagine a some other universe there's no telling how our laws of physics would interact with each other so you asked what's before the universe it may be the multiverse but now now now when you play that thing are you nervous so there's there's good there's cogent physics reasons to think that there's a multiverse and quantum physic to take there there's also good philosophical reason to think that there's a multiverse because in our experience discovering the cosmos the universe never makes anything in one's when we thought earth is it no earth is just one of many other planet well the sadhus but now the Sun is one of a hundred billion stars in the galaxy well the Milky Way no no there's a hundred billion in other galaxies in the universe well the universe well we've been there before all right right am I gonna say there's one universe I'm a little ultimately isn't there just one universe consisting of billions and billions of infinite I'm getting there so uh so watch the vocabulary all right so we have this one universe but I don't want to think there's one universe because of the trend line that says differently all right so maybe there's this multiverse well that just continues to push the question a little deeply if the universe never makes if the this entity never makes anything in one's then why would it only make one multiverse so then so so maybe there are multiple multiverses okay so that would so then and then it's you know Turtles all the way down as they say so so we like I said we don't have a handle on it yet but we have we've solved other origin problems because what started this was your question about birth and death there was a time when we didn't know how the earth began we have a good idea of that now and how or that how the moon formed we've got that how the Sun formed we got that no we weren't around five billion years ago to watch it but you don't need to be they're very clever ways to know what happened in the past geologists have been doing it you know ever since the field was born you have there's a there's a record rip for geologists in the rocks telling you where they've been what temperature they were exposed to and how long they've been sitting there we look at the Sun no we can't go back in time with it but we can look at other stars we we look out in the galaxy there's so many stars but catching some being born but catching others dying we're catching some and orbit around each other and we're seeing some that don't exist anymore because by the time their light reaches us they've already faded out there'll be some of them that in fact at this instant no longer exist and that information has yet to reach us that's insane and by the way that happens several hundred times a year we observe what are called supernovae yes ours that ask you about some stars that explode we watch them explode and we date them from when we see them explode but hell they'd exploded long ago depending on their distance if they're a thousand light-years away they exploded a thousand years ago there was you had no knowledge of it until today there was a fantastic documentary on hyper Nova's and it was so mind-boggling because they went back to the birth of the discovery of hyper Nova's and when they initially were theorizing that it was warfare in a space yes I'll tell you what that story was so in the 1970s after the United States and Russia the Soviet Union signed a surface test ban treaty where you couldn't test nuclear weapons on Earth's surface we you know there's the old military a credo trust but verify we said all right we'll sign this treaty but we're gonna keep on eye on you so we got together the engineers and the physicist and we my my brethren of the day invented a telescope detector that was sensitive to gamma rays that's one of these bands in the electromagnetic spectrum the highest energy band for which we have a word to describe it gamma rays by the way that's what dr. banner was exposed to that made oh don't you think I'm not aware big green and ugly so actually that's not actually what would happen to you if exposed but we'll give the comics the the the scientific latitude so so you have this so what happens so they launched this detector and you know seven eight nine ten times a week the this satellite with this detector on board detects bursts of gamma rays and the Pentagon scrambled and they said you know what's what's going on are they actually detonating these weapons and they looked at satellite other satellite secondary tertiary and from in Soviet Union was silent there was no evidence of any nuclear testing at all and that was the birth that day - the day of the publication of that paper that reported on these daily bursts that was the birth of the field of astrophysics called gamma-ray astronomy and we now have other gamma-ray telescopes out there studying these they are explosions and they're happening at the edge of the universe and these are the source the the sources are what you hypernova we needed a word bigger than supernovae and we these are the biggest explosions known in the universe and so we call them hypernova and the amount of power produced by a hypernova oh yeah it's extraordinary what what matters more than that it's a lot of power is that it's very focused it comes out in two beams one in one direction and one in the other and if you happen to be in the beam that's it yeah if there were a hypernova anywhere in our galaxy everybody's done in the entire galaxy and it was being towards Earth we're toast literal and figurative literally wrap your head around that kids there's a hundred billion stars at least right in this galaxy but most I mean a hypernova is a very special and rare kind of star and we times a day we know well know in the universe yeah eight times a week eight times a week yeah yeah between seven times a week once a day in the entire universe so so so that that's but that tells you how rare it is it takes a hundred fifty to a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars to give you eight of these a week ah yeah so oh by the way there's an interesting way that this will render us toast so the first wave of gamma rays will take out our ozone layer the ozone absorbs high-energy radiation that's what protects us from it's what absorb most of the ultraviolet from the Sun otherwise ultraviolet is hostile to life to life on the surface and we wouldn't be life as we know it if without this ozone layer on earth all right so so if but you can overrun the ozone layer the ozone is oxygen it's oh three all right the air you breathe has Oh - in it the molecule o2 ozone is both three and ultraviolet photon comes in slams into o3 breaks it apart into o+ o - there you go it took the ultraviolet light out of the out of the picture it's gone that's why it protects us okay so if there's a gamma-ray burst more high-energy photons will hit us then there are oh three molecules in our ozone layer so they all hit and they break apart the o3 s and it's like the first wave of cat what are the cavalry who the first ones on in the battle the frames they get all shot up right I mean in the old-fashioned battle yeah they get shot up okay the first way comes in when protects us from some of it but it overruns the ozone layer the rest come in and basically starts breaking apart the molecular the complex molecules that exist on earth surface that's how high-energy the light is and generally we think of life as complex chemistry and the most complex form of chemistry we know and so we would not survive that that would be an extinction episode for all life on Earth and now now if you could burrow underground that'd be cool go there I wouldn't wanna yeah rather just stop I think it's too much to ask to survive something grab a beer get out your lawn chair watch it yeah it doesn't seem like anything you want to survive it seems like you have to sort of give in to the reality that the greater good of the universe will be fine it's time for the rats and roaches to rise up in earth or whatever but it's like our own consciousness is so strung up on the idea of staying in this form you know physically alive and keep this thing whatever this is going because of our survival instincts it really sort of confuses and dilutes the whole idea perception that the universe itself is not just infinite but infinitely fractal yeah well you know the average life expectancy of a mammal species is about 3 million years and I'm sure there's some of us out there who are thinking that will live for billions of years and then planet hop in star hop and then there people are saying well we better learn how to terraform Mars because earth is about to be completely messed up and those folks I think are misguided in their in their thinking mmm can I tell you why sure please that's not who doesn't want to terraform Mars okay that's they did it on I got kids you don't want another planet to visit it it'd be fun vacation vacation spot I have no issues but don't do that because you want another place to live to escape the fact that we're destroying our own earth all right did the environment and the oceans and the atmosphere here's why is there a simple argument if we have the power to convert Mars into something that looks like Earth then we have the power to fix our oceans that have our own oceans and our own atmosphere right right if you have the power of geoengineering you don't have to leave the planet your arm turn another one into Earth and move there to fix Earth yes thank you see it seems like just a step in the stage of innovation as long as human beings have access to energy we're gonna figure out how to get energy from pollution and get energy from there's gonna be with the massive amounts of progress that have been made just in the last 200 years I always like to describe to people if they really have a hard time wrapping their head around it that 200 years ago if you wanted a picture something you had to draw it I'll just stop and look at that great great observation it's such a small amount of time that a massive amount of stuff has happened yeah and if you you stop and think about what we're capable of like man who knows I mean I don't know the answer to overpopulation I don't know the answer but I do know that I would have never figured out Wi-Fi on my own and I would have never figured out how to send a satellite signal who the fuck even understands what's going on when you get online you just think about what's going on in your car's GPS right so it's talking to a satellite and mixing your location on Earth's surface with information that's up in the later versions of it on your car updated from the internet about what direction the traffic flows on a street you happen to be driving on and whether the Dunkin Donuts is open late yeah as long as there's money in fixing the environment we're gonna fix the environment well that's the challenge the trick is to make it so that people can actually find some benefit and in a capitalist yeah Greek economy that's that's the driver of it all yeah it pushes things and it also you know it leaves a lot of bullshit and its wake and a lot of pollution and problems that mean I hope we figure it out before we eat up the rainforests I really do but if we don't we could probably make a new rainforest one day we could probably figure out there's no one yeah I mean it's a fucked up way to look at things like we'll figure it out don't worry but I think the doom and gloom analysis of we're doomed there's no way we're gonna we're gonna run out of food I think that's kind of a silly way to look at it - it seems to me that if you fly over just the United States alone god there's a lot of space to do shit I was correct and if you wanted to do some shit on the moon or on Mars you can kind of do it Nevada as well you know you could find some spots of Utah but nobody's there and you could put up a dome and grow some vegetables well what happened if earth keeps warming you saw the news that last year was by far the longest that the warmest year ever by far 2012 the warmest year on earth so if they want warmest year since when uh well I didn't read the full depth of the article but certainly the warmest on record right warmest that we've been keeping records now when the earth has been but not since like Jurassic no no at any time that that situation I've been concerned about this and so if that's unstoppable for whatever reasons political cultural economic whatever what that will do is simply redraw the map of what is arable and what is not in the world so we'll live in Antarctica hope you find it'll it'll redistribute where we're we think of as the heartland and the the wheat you know well we know about in there we know now about Greenland and underneath all that ice the climate that once was yeah but there's a day when earth had no ice balls and no no ice caps at all well there was a day just 15 16 thousand years ago that half of North America was covered in ice I like the way said just 15,000 crazy awesome in the version of the universe yeah that was our silly lives and there's good evidence to say that Earth had in early Earth had was a complete snowball where the ice caps were so large that the North ice cap met the South ice cap at the equator it's called snowball earth when was this very cool I forgot the exact time that they've been it's it's geologists plus you know some if you look at the history of the Sun the Sun wasn't always the same temperature so you have to fold that into what's going on on earth at the time and what the Greek the state of the greenhouse effect is on earth because that also influences the the tracking the how high the temperature is versus what earth is doing with the energy it received when your snowball most of Earth's that the sun's light is reflected rather than absorbed see that and so that's how you can get a runaway snowball right so the ice caps grow a little bit and this is we're this is like global climate change in the other direction yeah that's way worse right it grows a little bit and then less sunlight gets absorbed by the earth because ice is white and so it freezes up a little more oh and then even less sunlight gets kept and then it freezes up a little more so you kind of a runaway ice ball just as you can have a runaway greenhouse that's incredible that's that's interesting yeah that that these two possibilities exist and the the glaciers when they melt and they create water and the water acts as a reflector and the light goes through the water and melt the glaciers quicker and so for example if they're pretty similar if they're greenhouse gases dissolved in the rocks or in the oceans and they're happy and nobody's disturbing them then you maintain your atmospheric temperature and the energy balance of sunlight hitting the earth some getting absorbed others getting other other parts getting reflected but if you tip that balance by the way that can shift that's not a like a razor edge balance I mean there's slop in there restorative forces exist but if you go outside of what a restorative force can give you then you overrun the capacity to bring you back to any place where you once were and then you get a runaway phenomenon and so you heat and when you heat something it out gasses right if you heat your soda the co2 comes out of it it doesn't stay in that's why we'd like drinking cold carbonated beverages so if you heat earth then and greenhouse gases are are dissolved within it then you start releasing those greenhouse gases that makes earth retain even more heat makes it hotter and it makes it hotter even more greenhouse gases come out and so you can imagine a situation where you have a runaway greenhouse where everything goes really hot is that where we're at no does everybody do another boom we're not run away Earth has been this hot before it has recovered from it over time skill is much longer than anybody's life's lifetime that's another problem here right Earth has been much harder than this it just was much hotter before humans or much yeah yeah yeah before human history oh yeah and so we have great evidence for this so the issue is not will earth survive it is whether we as we have set up culture and civilization and economies and and it's all been set up assuming a certain constancy of the conduct of nature hmm and if we now become a force in that in nature's equation creating a cycling of phenomenon that would normally have taken ten thousand or a hundred thousand years and we're doing it on a scale of centuries then we better be prepared to face those consequences much like your analogy of the clouds in a time lapse fashion the idea of living by the beach would be so fucking ridiculous if you ever saw the the actual like Pangaea yeah change into continents and it'll last because that's like why would you live near the water what are you crazy that's 80% of our population exactly yeah yeah yeah on because cities are basically near water support sources on river mouths or where transportation was useful in the days before when you live in New York City in Manhattan lower Manhattan are you concerned out like sandy and the impact that it had that this my flooded zone a and zone a was four blocks from me from my zone which was Zone C I walked four block five blocks away and I was a tire underground parking garages were flooded cars were bobbing out up out of the exit doors of these parking garage have you thought about Utah or maybe perhaps the mountains because if you plan for the end of the world I'm going or you're going I'm gonna call you up dude you better be straight with me tell me where to hide I gotta tell you a cute story a friend of mine Rick benzyl who's a who's a planetary astronomer he also created the risk scale for judging the likelihood of an asteroid that's recently recently been discovered he created the risk scale that will tell you the likelihood of that hitting Earth okay now he and I like to drink wine when we're together so he has so if if he's thinking that an asteroid is gonna come one day what's the first thing you ask him about his wine collection what's the first thing you ask him what are you gonna drink but exactly what bottle of wine do you have that you're gonna pull out the day you know the asteroids right so he was thinking maybe he could attach a little a little a sensor behind that bottle okay and it goes into my place and other friends of his so if he pulls that bottle out red light starts flashing then you know because he would be the first to know this right his calculation that gets sent to the media that gets sent to the press okay speaking of calculations I have to talk to you about the conversation that you had was his the men the man's name Claude Shannon was that the guy knows doc what is the name Claude shot well I'm trying to remember what the the scientist named that was discovering or that was talking to you about the discovery of computers and computer Oh Jim James Jim yeah professor Jim Jim gates oh there is a professor of physics at the University of Maryland College Park correcting computer code found in the computations of quantum physics what the fuck does that mean yeah so he found and I don't claim expertise in everything he said I had a panel we have an annual an annual event at the American Museum of Natural History that's my day job there as a director of the Hayden Planetarium and once a year we have this panel and I bring on my colleagues who are active on the bleeding frontier of some topic and I put them on stage and we all just fight about who's right or is there enough data all right where is it should I believe you should I not and so it's the annual Isaac Asimov panel debate and it's designed to expose an aspect of science that the public hardly ever sees they usually see that the perfectly written paper and the news report on in and everything is tidally discovered they don't see the bloody bleeding edge where the fisticuffs come out and so on this particular case he Jim Gates discovered that there's a certain in our representation of the universe quantum yes yes and in the way we have come to understand the universe and our methods and tools deep down within that is necessary a code written zeros and ones that is a a particular kind of error checking algorithm that we invoke daily and the movement of data from one system to another and it's called a checksum error you might have seen that in an error code any time an error dump happens on your screen go look in there you'll see the word checksum in multiple places it's one word checksum and it's a way that it's it's like the idiot check on did this bulk of data get through this portal alright so you know you're looking at that sort of the gross thing you can check for you know how many total bits were there I don't know if they're the right bits but I know how many total bits should have come so let me check for that so that's the kind of thing you do in a checksum so he asserts that this exists deep within what we need to represent the operations of nature at its deepest most fundamental levels it is the matrix deep and so so alright so that's so I so I was astonished by this and I paused and actually there's a YouTube video of me in Terry asked him yeah I'm interrogating him and and now I don't know that it's seen peer review yet I've got two toys a friend of mine so I can just call them up but for before you start getting excited about it or bent out of shape about it or disturbed about it you want it to see peer review and that the level of expertise in that analysis is above my pay scale so it's got to go to peers who do exactly that kind of mathematical physics and if they come out with the consensus and they agree then I'm good to go and on vest more energy and coming to understand it but for every correct idea of how the universe works there's hundreds and in some cases thousands of ideas that end up in the trash bin of creative thinking and so so I I have to allocate my energies and my my budget of time and so it's intriguing and I'm happy to know that it exists but to take it beyond that and wax philosophically poetic about it maybe over a beer at a bar but no not not in an actual setting where I'm talking about science so it's or maybe when you're hot you know it's great it's great fodder for oh yeah conversation when you think you're being deep right when you get done with your chemtrails talk it's time to talk about computer simulation you that the universe is on a hard drive the multiverse is on a backup Drive like a raid your eyes that's why it doesn't have all the information as the same universe because it only takes the base so it can like back he's gonna make you dumber he will propose some things that will ruin your brain the the computer simulation theory has been bandied about a bunch of different forms and the idea being that one day we'll have infinite amounts of processing power and we will be able to create a reality that is indiscernible from this reality and once that is done how will we know when we're in it and could we be in it right now and this is sounds like more high horseshit nonsense but this is being bandied about by some of the smartest people on the planet yeah I remain unconvinced I mean of what I've read and you're talking about basically Kurzweil and the yeah singularity no not necessarily but it folds in sort of sort of because it requires the acceptance that the day will come where a computing power and our storage power because it's growing exponentially with Moore's law you know doubles every 18 months or so in capacity and speed and and and all the metrics that matter when you're doing and when you're in information technology the hypothesis that one day we can just upload our entire brain into a computer or a computer can simulate your brain in some fundamental way then what do we need you for if we can now just simulate it I mean the here in LA the actors version of that is they've just digitized your body and every angle doing everything what do we need you for exactly they don't and we need to get rid of most actors huh yes I need to be outsourced I don't think the actors union is happy about they can suck it they're unnecessary humans for the most part some of them are beautiful and for every Samuel Jackson you got a million douchebags that's reality so set flawed institution ever see those ads no no I proof this is the all luck there's a broad spectrum of intelligent life on a planet itself you see the ad for blue cigarettes it's a black and white ad where Steven dwarf is telling you how cool it is to smoke electronic cigarettes it's the second douchiest commercial that's ever existed the first is Brad Pitt Chanel number five commercial have you seen that I've only seen the stills and all of them you want to become a dumber person or if you let me show you that can make you dumber that's just slightly dumber like one millionth of one percent dumber oh we're at a time just let's show them that will end with stupidity listen man you're a brilliant person thank you very much for not just being here but for what you do you know even mrs. Rogan was excited that you were on the part thank you it's not big on Sciences you can tell she wants real diamond so I'll work Nixon will smuggle one out blindfold for I'll see what I can do your your passion for knowledge and your passion for distributing it and it's it's so infectious and it's so fascinating and I got a lot of Twitter messages today about you coming on and a lot of them were from people who said that you ignited their passion for science and you made them pursue specific career goals and I got to do something this message about who's an engineer I became an engineer because of listening to you well I'm deeply appreciative of that but let me pose that and let me analyze that in a slightly different way I already know that the universe is an extraordinary place but not everyone else does so part of what I do is serve as a conduit between the curiosity in our culture that is embedded there even if you've forgotten it because I know it's within us all because it's there in all of us when we're children aka you're a bad mother flow no no so also I do is part the curtains for people to recognize the awesomeness of the universe that is there with or without me well you have a beautiful way of looking at it and I really appreciate your humility in that in that respect but that perfect storm of personality and knowledge is very rare and I just appreciate you for being who you are and I thank you very much about trying to say you know why I'm in LA now because we're we're beginning to shoot the things that applause in the corner we are we are creating the next generation cosmos first century yes the Carl Sagan watch them all over but that was from 1980 it's been 33 years so we're doing it now it's gonna be another 13 episodes it's cosmos a spacetime Odyssey is it PBS as well no it's not PBS and have a hugely larger market exposure because it's gonna appear likely in primetime but we're not sure that yet but it's gonna air on Fox holy shit oh fuck that's just wrong that is that's amazing god that's yeah I'm so good we've got Seth MacFarlane who's our it's sort of broker he brought us to Fox I became latter-day friends with him and he's a fan of cosmos and he loves Carl Sagan he's a fan of my work he's a fan of we'd to the council those conversations I've had with him one counselor this conversation as he came to me and I got to talk to you I sorry let's have lunch we have one she asked me all these questions about the Big Bang and the the Cosmic Microwave Background and the early universe and I said okay you're good now yeah I'm good and then three months later there's an episode with Stewie went back to the Big Bang and I get a full card credit at the end of science advisor no I was like lunchtime entertainment for that it was like a science advisor episode one of the greatest things about creating this podcast has been the opportunity to have these kind of conversations I could never corralled you and said hey man yeah and the converse that guy who hosted the UFC and Fear Factor wants to sit down with you for three hours he'd be like yeah tell that dude I got shit to do but the fact that I could pick your brain for this well the fact that you even have this curiosity and it's in you've nurtured it in your fan base is great so great to be on your show thank you sir I really really appreciate it and you can follow Neal on Twitter it's any il Tison on Twitter and follow him you fucks and let them show them some love please thank you very much for being here thanks everybody for all the messages on Twitter and Facebook and all the various comedy shows speaking of which this weekend this Friday night two shows here at the Ice House in Pasadena 8:30 and 10:30 with Ari Shaffir are you coming you want you want
