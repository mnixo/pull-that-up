like you don't trust it hmm well I've oh hello Michael hello Joe good to see you buddy good to see you so there's many things to talk about but one of them is why don't you have a fucking blue check next to your name I I do on Twitter what matters but not on insta mr. Graham doesn't matter well it does not you're hurting like a lock in their shade the fuck I'm just just trying to figure out who we need to contact I came to Los Angeles for sunshine the shade everywhere what the hell is going on well how do they decide who gets a blue checkmark and who doesn't instance the hardest one really yeah what do you have to get I wouldn't know Joe I wouldn't know I don't have an instant clue check okay I'm just curious it hurts my feelings I'm not even verified on Facebook I'm huh yeah Wow I'm a pleb but you've been on television you've published books yeah what in the fuck I I these people this is why we need regulation the social media giants this is outrageous what do you think about that idea that there should be some sort of regulation like rules as to what constitutes something that can pull you off of the social media platform by the law yes it's unconscionable it's unconscionable yeah but is it constable that someone can just decide based on their political affiliation that they don't like the way someone is talking and pull them off the platform I believe in freedom Association which means if you want to disassociate from anyone at any time not only do you can you do it yeah you shouldn't even have to give a reason it's up to you that weapony is that what's happening when you pull someone off of a social media platform is just disassociation yeah but there's also the problem with that is they're not being honest and upfront about why they're doing it right so they're being deceptive because they're saying they're being objective if they want to say look the cost of having this person on outweighs the benefit okay you can wrap your head around it but they twit our face without Twitter especially they say we're not going to tell you what the rules are because then people will be able to exploit them it's like well if you tell us what the rules are maybe we can follow them and you not to live in fear that is a hilarious way of interpreting it people would exploit those rules that's the quote from Jack doors that is a ridiculous quote yeah what about following the rules I mean guidelines are supposed to be there so that you don't step outside of them that's exactly right and they're supposed to that way you can also say we're being objective because it's like we're following these guidelines that we set that are open do you think that's perhaps something that was brought to them by lawyers with lawyers like Muslim the more you tell them what they can and can't do the more difficult it's gonna be to justify kicking someone off no I think they have their hardcore agenda and this way they can cover their tracks I don't think this is lawyers at all because then they blame the lawyers they'd say legally we have to XYZ hmm so you think it's just they have a very strong political leaning and anything that deviates from that they want to just get removed from their plan I wouldn't say political I'd say cultural and philosophical but yeah not that they want to but they regard as having less legitimacy do you see that target Carlson shit yesterday yeah well of course the big victims Jim Acosta yeah you know so there's two scenarios one is you're not allowed to come to my house anymore the other one is my house is being surrounded by the purge but clearly the first ones the nightmare scenario yeah well the Jim Acosta one is strange because Jim Acosta like it wasn't supposed to be talking then right right he was interrupting he was deciding that he was more important than the other person who's talking right and he was also deciding that he was more important than everyone else in the room and he's also deciding that having a White House press two grand show is a human right so basically you know you could do everyone it'll never be taken away but is there's got to be some decorum right well their argument I would guess I can't speak for Jim Acosta because I could speak in normal voice but their argument would be that because the president has made things so lack of decorum which he has therefore they're following suit so I guess that's real leadership but this monsters really kicking in yeah a lot of stuff going on that can it's got the taurine it says yeah so yeah that's it you know it's unfortunate I mean look I think I appreciate the fact that he goes out of his way to question the White House narrative and he goes out of their way that's his job yeah yeah to put the irons to the President and get him to answer but you can't do that while someone else is talking the other guy had the microphone the other guy was supposed to be talking right yeah well this is why I think he's unforgivable because during the Singapore summit when you had President Trump and Kim jong-un from North Korea and they're making signing a piece of paper and they're trying to kind of hopefully go towards a peaceful direction acosta gets up and yells hey what about Otto womb' or marshal Kim jong-un WOM WOM beer it's like you got this guy who's got 25 million hostages he's holed up taking the first step to dropping his gun you're like hey what about that kid you killed what about you know that's there's a time and a place and I don't think Kim jong-un speaks English I'm pretty sure he doesn't so I think the guy took wrestling a little too seriously and I don't know what it is I mean you know a lot of reporters I know that are reporters they don't act like this no I think he likes attention and I think he feels like something there's something very significant about what he's doing and he I think he also wants to be a martyr he wants to be a you know like ever like you know he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders and but for him we'd be facing Nazi Germany yeah it's it's the question is like when does someone get their press credentials removed from the White House when when can they no longer have White House credentials when is what is woody what do you have to do to the point where everyone agrees you're a nuisance and you're interrupting regularly CNN could just get someone else right who's not going to scream out right it's not like they're trying to block CNN it's like they're saying to this guy like you you you're interrupting like you're yelling things out and then what if everyone yelled things out at the same time are you better than everyone else because you're not you're just a person here and if you just decide my opinion and my voice is more significant than anyone elses well you you've thrown everybody else under the bus the entire rest of the room and the whole process well I remember Lesley Stahl had Trump on to 60 minutes not that long ago and you know they were going back and forth and she goes well you know well I don't want to talk about that I'm like this is the fucking president you're a reporter if he wants to talk about it at the very least it's gonna be the president says X Y Z so who are you to be like Nana shut up we're not gonna talk about this and he's like well fuck you I'm the president yeah so I think there is and I'm glad this is happening because I think for a long time the press who has had an agenda since Washington's days is they should have an agenda pretend that they're honest and objective and they use the veneer of politeness and civility to be like look for professional or decent people but now the mask is dropping and you see that there you know often lunatics yeah I was watching this piece on I really wish I remember what it was on but it was on maybe I was listening to it either way it was on the news and when the news started becoming an entertainment program versus when it was just here's the events of the day and this is you know this is what the the significance of these events could be and this is the impact it could have on our society instead it just became this really flamboyant wild crazy if it bleeds it leads and it became entertainment right and they really narrowed it down to 60 minutes there so when 60 minutes became a hugely successful financial show what's that the 70s then somewhere around there yeah right well in 60 minutes it's been around for a long long time long long time but when 60 minutes became a hit it was a hit show like big advertiser money it was you know the entire country would watch it and then that sort of changed the way they viewed the news because now they view the news as a potentially profitable venture and then boy once they've realized that people can clearly affiliate with one side versus another side and they want that in their news coverage then you get the weird Fox News / CNN a bias which is it is one of the weirdest Poehler like it distinctions if you watch the news you watch television during the elections in particular anything that's really significant going on you go back and forth between two of them like are we there's like separate universes oh yeah Scott Adams has that metaphor which is that we're looking at one movie screen and there's two movies on one movie screen then different people see the exact same data and see different conclusions yes and I think that's great I mean I think I don't think we need to be all United I think people should like what they like and the idea that we all got agree and everything is totalitarianism yeah I mean I definitely think that we should be able to enjoy what we enjoy and we should lean whatever way would choose to mean I think the issue with the news though is when it's just straight-up propaganda yeah like when is when is this actually the real objective version of the events or when are they deleting and editing stuff out and adding things to write concentrating on one maybe possibly insignificant thing but pumping it up to be more than it is because then it changes the narrative for their side this morning I went after some dimwit from Emison from excuse me from NBC and he goes this is the worst attack by the White House and the press freedoms in history I go John Adams second president put journalists in jail so did Lincoln a Lincoln of course you could say okay was the Civil War but there are in many cases of attacks on the press but of course because everyone's so narcissistic if it's happening to them it's the worst thing ever and this is basically the gulag even though they can go on Twitter and have their hundred thousand followers I have their good book deals the consequence is anybody criticizing Jim Acosta from the left is anybody saying like hey you're not supposed to do that like what you did what you did is out of line I haven't I have I've been having fun in LA I have not seen that I think they have been running interference because I do think that the press corps like any organization you work with someone side by side every day you're gonna be friendly with them yeah and and I do think they there is very much obviously acrimony between Sarah Sanders and the White House press corps and she's very insulting and hostile to them and you could say it's deserved or not so of course they're gonna kind of team up together be like lady we're just trying to do our job and you're just spinning on our face every single day now the question is do these people should have their faces spittin or not well is it I think they both suck you know I think what she's doing sucks like the way she treats people like some she's some fucking schoolteacher in seventh grade that's that's what it seems like when Sarah's doing those those White House press things I love venom so I love that the venom is flowing in both directions and they like it because I I think people get over politically by saying let's all get along and then people who don't get along are marginalized and those are the ones who innovate things the the troublemakers are the ones who move culture and move politics so whenever everyone gets together like all 90 I must agree then where its venom it's like yeah if this country has been to at least two culture since the beginning and it only stayed one because one conquered the other and held it under martial law for decades there's no reason for us to be one United States when everyone hates each other like why let's have a divorce what do you mean like just if you want to separate out America two different parts I think everyone get along a lot nicer you mean like make separate country yeah out of America yeah really of course like Europe like how like if you looked at the size of Europe and the relative size of countries and how easy it is to travel from one country to another you can make a real honest comparison between Texas and New Jersey I mean they basically are different countries right I mean that it's trickier because we all speak English so it seems like we're what do we united on and like why does this have to be this way well because Texas will start invading everybody just steal New Mexico like whose garden it that's ours now just start marching their way through Phoenix and yeah it's a fucking disaster waiting to happen I think this is a disaster that's happening oh yeah and I think the acrimony which I enjoy on some level because I think it's honest is gonna get much worse really what makes you think it's gonna get worse because I think both sides are just doubling down both sides left and right yeah are very much doubling down the right has become radicalized as function of Trump the left has been radicalized for decades and there's no look here's what happened with Kavanagh hearings either this very innocent family man has been railroaded completely by shameless leftist or someone who was quite possibly a rapist was nominate with the Supreme Court without being and everyone knows it so there's no in-between and when you have one event and to completely obscenely different perspectives meeting each side sees the others obscene I don't see where you get together well don't you have a different perspective on it then either one of those polls burn it all down nobody I mean with Kavanagh I my perspective is I don't agree with the Constitution or regardless Valles so I don't care I I don't know how I would vote if I were sent her to be honest I don't think she was lying dr. Ford obviously sweat Nick I think was lying and the one who's like you know I went to ten parties and kept getting gang-raped at a certain point you know it's just like well there was two different women then had absolutely fabricated story that but that doesn't mean dr. Ford's fabricator so it doesn't but it just shows you that that that whole zoo can get pretty I'd be smelling I can't imagine any job on earth where you need to be talking about your yearbook quotes right it's just like that 30-plus years already for us seriously yes so I mean and here's the issue with Kavanagh this is why I think it's really unfair how come they're not asking him to step if he had why didn't no one asked him to step down from he was already on the court he was one a Supreme Court if you believed all this stuff why are you asking him to resign right it is so serious yeah and then on top of that why didn't they really I mean especially the left why didn't they go whole hog into all of his policy decisions which are much eat fairer more Germanic now dr. Ford I saw her on the side of a milk carton the other day she's vanished yeah like as soon as her purpose was served she's gone you know well she probably wants to vanish yeah but it seemed like she was really enjoying that they outed her she wrote that letter in secret and then there's a whole investigation how did this become public she's like I didn't want this to be public and I believed her she didn't I don't think anyone wants this testifying from the Senate in a hearing like that when the knives are out that's terrifying I would imagine there's a few people that would enjoy it but yeah I see your point not right not her she didn't seem like it and she didn't see but you know I don't think that she was lying either but also boy if what you want to get you want to go into what we understand we actually understand about the human memory yes and you want to stand in front of many many people millions worldwide with incredible consequences online and relay these these memories right 30-plus years ago when you mean you're not even the same human right as you were when you were 17 years old it's just like it's I don't even have memories of being 17 I have memories of things that I've told about my memories I mean that you know what I mean like you of course you've never storyteller yeah you tell stories of what you remember but if I had to like give you the real solid memories that I are unquestionable about my 17th year of life it's fucking shaky as shit real shaky obviously nobody tried to hold my mouth closed I fucked me on a bed in some weird party when I was half drunk I really wanted to go home not that you remember I don't think it happened pretty sure it didn't happen no but it did I wouldn't couldn't testify and in all fairness to her trauma if I'm using a word loosely also things get mixed up things like that there are people who think she's a complete fraud and thought she knew she was gonna get money from go fund me and I'm like no I I don't see it that doesn't make any sense to me yeah I don't think a 55 year old professor knows how growt crowdfunding works yeah you know one thing that I did see that was fascinating though was the the the university that she teaches at is so heavily skewed towards women like it's almost I think it's seventy something percent female students at one and a high percentage of like predominantly female professors as well and their whole thing is social justice it's like their and when you know they're with it lists their objectives as far as education like social justice is number one it's number one it's like the thing that they emphasize the most what's it going to be architecture well education sure I guess but I think universities are there to promulgate an ideology right but they literally framed it as yeah she'll justice and that does that term today is so fraught with peril oh yeah it's the enemy yeah it's such a goofy term like social justice like good it's so it's such a blanket term and so all-encompassing and you know youth you hear it you start thinking about people banging on Tucker Carlson's door and saying we know where you sleep that's what I hear oh yeah no and here's like I was just talking about just couple minutes ago it means 90% of people have agreed the 10% who don't agree need to be shut down because we're talking about social justice yes so there's no such thing as individual justice because that's subordinate yeah well I don't even know I mean what percentage of people would agree with banging on a guy's house like knocking on his door and saying we know where you sleep this is a form of mental terrorism like you're threatening him you're scaring him I don't think most people are capable of empathy by which they mean they can't put themselves in Tucker's shoes so all they see is someone I hate had something bad happen to that him good and they don't understand like when these Republicans are saying that it's okay to torture terrorists right right and the point I make is there's people right now Michael Ian Black or will tell you tweet out every day the NRA is a terrorist organization so what happens when the government defines you as a terrorist you're gonna and then you're gonna say well it never happened to me that's not how it works that's the fear so you we if you're going to have principles you have to apply them to people that you hate right and Tucker Carlson is hardly some Nazi right no I mean Tucker Carlson is if if you think that he has ideas that are questionable the solution is to present better ideas and to debate him and to go back and forth of him but Tucker cross is not leading some hate mom he's not the the centerpiece in Charlottesville right for the extermination of the Jews or he's not that radical no he's just a right-wing guy well what they what what critical theory allows them to do is to say well you can read between the lines and ascribe intent to the person right so if you read a book you can say oh this is race because I can see reason so they can easily say well when he says a B and C he means X Y Z so these are all dog whistles and you can impune whatever motives you want onto a person and and then at that point you could do whatever you want and the thing is he's a dad so not only you have to be comfortable with fucking with Tucker Carlson's house you got to become full with scaring his kids yeah and and I think the history of totalitarian totalitarianism shows us they're more than happy to sacrifice the kids to get their goal it's just really disturbing to me because I think these idealistic kids who are doing this they're mostly young people have a fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to what violence is what causes violence is intentional and how how close that scene was to violence yes cuz you do that to the wrong guy's door he's gonna come out with a baseball bat or a gun and he's gonna kill some people or smash some people right it it absolutely can happen it's not likely to happen with a guy like Tucker Carlson but what if they decide to go after the wrong general or what if they decide to go after though I mean anything can happen in these situations and also those people are all gonna get outed once those people are outed the outrage that they're gonna experience is going to be unhandled ball right it's gonna be unmanageable the amount of people that are furious at that group of 20 or what how many people was it I don't even know it was plenty I'm angry I mean I'm not gonna do anything but I'm angry I think it was disgusting if if I'm angry how many really loosely held people people that are just like really barely keeping it together already buts here's the scary it's not those twenty that are in any other consequences it's gonna be people who think like them who haven't done what they did and now it's gonna be like oh you agree with this then it's I'm gonna do it to you I think it's gonna be them too though let's get any both yeah I think those people don't understand like people are gonna find their names they're gonna find where they live and there's going to be people that have nothing to do with this not Tucker Carlson and it's not them and it's these people gonna seek them out and they're gonna it's gonna get ugly you can't just bang on people's doors like that and scare them right because people get furious especially when there's not enough there's not enough evidence this is not a bad guy Tucker Carlson is not some evil demon you know like if you if you looked at who he is and what he said if you pulled out the worst shit that he said and and taken it in comparison to the woman that we were talking about from MSNBC that's still in the air right try and read who lied about her blog being hacked and Twitter lied yeah just to try to cover up for the fact that she said some blatantly homophobic things in the past and called it and called in the yeah yeah which is fucking insane that should be a federal crime you're removing resources right from people that are already on very serious cases that are already trying to solve real real crimes save people's lives save people's safety and you're deciding that your job at MSNBC is more important than that and she isn't even fired lawrence O'Donnell tweeted out not that long ago something akin to regarding Trump if you're interfering with the FBI that should be a federal crime and I said she works down the hall this he's a co-worker it's like what are you talking about but because she's African American people just they're stepping away from it they're letting it go because they don't want to be called racist I don't know if it's that so much as people cover their own it's a little bit of that but they don't always cover their own they got rid of al al Sharpton on al Sharpton fucking Al Franken they got rid of him pretty quick but that's the Senate I'm talking about like but it's still left-wing oh yeah yeah that they cover their own all MA MSNBC people yeah right but my point is like I don't know if that lady should be fired I think she should be able to say she's sorry for shit that she wrote that was insensitive you know I think there's a lot of people like that Brian Williams guy was completely full of shit it's still in the air you don't just lie once about something like thanks part of in line is my life but it's it's the degree of the lie yeah it's one thing to say okay I did this I did that's nothing to be like you know I was getting shot at it's like I can't imagine I was just talking about lack of empathy I can't imagine being in a situation where I'm on television and I'm saying things that are so removed from the truth right like I I can't wrap my head around that well Hillary did the same thing well she's a congenital iris as she was referred to by the New York Times back in the day and and rightly so but she people forget this she did talk about a firefight that she was involved was under sniper fire and the worst thing about that that people didn't give a shit about she said when she was in Bosnia she was under sniper fire it's like wait a minute we were throwing the Secret Service on the bus cuz what kind of secret surface is gonna let the first lady run under sniper fire and there's been and she just basically did a double talk around that but she's got a lot of whoppers and in her name she said she was named after Hillary Edmund Hillary even though he climbed Mount Everest after she was born so she's I mean amazing I love that woman I love her so much she's the funniest person on earth lady she's like a slinky she's always falling down the stairs how dare you yeah she's uh it's an odd duck it's it's one of those things where women want a woman to be President so bad they want one for the team so bad and then there's so many people from the left I think she has the best chance of beating Trump or whoever is on the right that they want her so about there they're willing to exonerate her right I'm so many different horrendous things one of the things I always point out like people want to talk progressive they want you want to talk you know being left-wing and she didn't even believe in gay marriage until 2013 the best part was she was on NPR which is this far-left far-right fringe organization right NPR Terry Gross and Terry Gross says you used to be against gay marriage you know your husband passed DOMA which made it a federal law that gay marriage won't be recognized by the government and you change your position like how did that happen was it because Americans became Hillary was like well America change their point of view she doesn't know I understand Americans change their point of view what was your mental process and she goes no Terry you're saying that I changed my mind for political purposes and that's not true and I resent she starts yelling at her and it's like holy shit you're on NPR and you think they're to right-wing for you because they're calling you on your bullshit you fucking loon but the worst part is I had one knee to Broderick on my show two weeks ago and she's the one who accused Clinton of raping her mmm and I asked her who's worse Clinton or Hillary she said Hillary she said she's the one who knew what was going on and let him get away with it so that was scary to hear Wow the the the thing that got me was when they were confronting bill recently about Monica Lewinsky and they asked him do you owe her an apology right and he was like anybody thinks about God out of that free you're crazy let me tell you something I was I left the White House millions dollars and dad yeah and they stole the furniture and they had to return it yeah they stole them why they looted the White House they had to return all the shit they stole come on there's a book called final exit written by Barbara Olson who died in 9/11 and it's all about they fucking stole everything real all the staff also popped out all the double use of the keyboards so the George Bush office people couldn't use them yeah they went out there like assholes yeah that's actually that is funny that's actually kind of funny that's a that's a good little fuck you yeah but the idea that this guy would in especially in today's political climate and dealing with me too and all the the the various scandals that have been going on rapists exposed that this guy who if all that shit was going on today we likely either be under indictment or at the very least under heavy investigation yeah for sexual assault but because it's so long ago it seems to be like this weird sort of gray area that he's saying I don't know her an apology you know if anybody thinks that I wasn't punished like you weren't punished like you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars now how there are you worth so much money now one of the greatest things I remember at the time this has been forgotten the press likes to throw this under the rug super under rug they said at first a Monica Lewinsky was a stalker all of Clinton's goons would go on the news channels at the time say she's a lunatic she's a stalker they never had an affair and you're sitting there that she's like 23 how the fuck do you stalk a president like that does make any sense if it wasn't for that dress let's keep that in mind if she didn't have physical evidence nothing would have happened to him and she would be regarded as a loon to this day and she'd be treating a complete pariah they were ready it would have never went public with it it was that other lady she was in werster to go pop no no Ken Starr found her he subpoenaed her yeah but it was because of that woman Linda Tripp Linda Tripp right it was her coaxing her to keep the dress yes just keep the dress but go public with this and talk about she was outed by Drudge remember was that before that before Linda Tripp was doing all this Linda Tripp was she coaching her through the whole thing Linda Tripp was coaching her privately this is all private Drudge broke it because the press wasn't covering it and they didn't know what to do because this is a big moment internet history where they're like this website is revealing information and now we're gonna talk about it I thought that was also coming from Linda Tripp and I thought Linda Tripp either leaping the conversations Linda Tripp was taping the conversations I don't know how I know Drudge was the one who made all this shit public maybe she was being subpoenaed privately thought she was going to Drudge and she was leaking in for me madam is that true can you look that up about that I don't think Linda Tripp was leaking a Drudge well maybe she was I thought the story was I don't know though I thought the story was that she was coaching Monica Lewinsky and trying to get her to go public with it that's possible but Monica didn't go public ROG forced throughout the class and she also did it without Monica's consent as far as the recorded that was trench went to jail for gin she or she was at least arrested something happened yeah she was a very least arrested for recording without consent that my point was like him said on television like the lack of insight the lack of objectivity is a lack of personal objectivity that he's getting asked this question do you owe her apology that he can't say look I made a mistake I shouldn't have done it right it was a bad thing to do and especially a bad thing to do to a 20 year old girl and have her exposed like that I wasn't close to my daughter's age yeah and for him to not say that this like some serious sociopathic shit involved in he's never I mean that's his MO he never ever but also if you're apologizing there can you're probably legally culpable right because they were gonna get in for perjury so Paul an apology is an acknowledgement possibly from I mean they pulled his legal license because of this that was part of the deal you know left the White House that's right that's right I forgot about that yeah the whole thing's a mess and then and then when Hillary's asked about it was that a some sort of abuse of power she's like no cuz they're adults Monica Lewinsky was an adult she was a good person to him but it's also like fucking president no no the only time there's an abuse of power is when children are involved yeah like what the friary talk about is crazy that makes no sense but not only that that is the biggest is that between an intern and the lighter of the world right I mean there's no bigger gap right forget about like studio executive and actress you know like that's that's tiny in comparison to the leader of the world and an intern and at the time all the feminists ran interference for him the only one who did it was the craziest one Andrea Dworkin and she goes we know he's a rapist rucifee Bernita Broderick we know this was sexual harassment assault sexual harassment and everyone's covering for him and you guys are being complete hypocrites crazy it's crazy that they're willing to do that it's less tribalism I know but it's so fascinating when you see it's so blatant yeah and so obvious but yeah I mean you see from the right I mean she will run experience for there sure - oh yeah I think it's the human mind convinces itself it makes double standards if I hate you I'm willing to believe I know they've been studies about this yeah I hate you I'm willing to believe something negative about you if I like you I'm willing to believe a compliment about you and I'm more resistant to hearing something negative about yes and that's just how our brain filters things sure I mean we're all guilty of it I'm guilty of it with my friends for sure you know if someone's mad at my friends and my clothes and it's nothing I can tell you right like yeah I had someone trying to talk shit on one of my friends and I said there's nothing you can say that's gonna make me throw them out of the bus do you yeah so you you're just wasting your breath yeah there's certain friends like yeah they might fuck up but they're still my friends yeah just it I'm not hearing it yeah and that's people I know really well the real problem with this whole tribal thing is like it seems to me when it comes to like political tribes the people are so invested in winning it's so sports like yes it's it's just so it's so strange to see it play out it's it's disturbing to me also that you think your life is a function of who the president is yeah and it's just like this isn't this is that mean things could be good things could be bad this doesn't affect you directly it affects you indirectly yeah it affects you but yeah most day-to-day lives I mean hundreds Thompson talked about that back in the 70s when he was running for sheriff of Pitkin County he's saying local politics really affect you yeah like that's that's something that really changes your life it was but the day-to-day happenings of the White House most of it is just your fixating on these things that really are probably never gonna have any impact but local local stuff who's the mayor that has a direct impact on your life what are they gonna do with the streets well it's not only the impact it's like how much power do you have to affect change at the local level a lot right White House level very little yeah and we're seeing that which is we're really one of the really fascinating things about Trump being president is how much he's trying and how much he's not able to do and how much pushback there is and how much he is able to do and how much outrage there is about it and how much chaos is surrounding the whole situation yeah it's fascinating to watch all the the the safe the checks and balances and the safety procedures that are sort of built into the system of government act out and now that like you see the Senate controlled by the Republicans and the house controlled by the Democrats like oh Jesus this is what I was hoping for chaos as much chaos as possible the shitshow and is gonna be more of a shit show in the house with trying to pick policies number two yeah well and also do you see that Trump was saying nice things about Pelosi hilarious I know it's that woman she does a great job I think she really loves our country no did you see what she said he goes she deserves to be Speaker and if the Democrats won't vote for her will throw her Republican votes Wow he said that I tweeted out it's just like I'm just gonna press some buttons and see what happens they all freak out it's amazing it really is funny you know what I thought it was really hilarious I actually enjoyed it when Alec Baldwin got arrested and they said to Trump you know Alec Baldwin got arrested with how do you feel you goes I wish him luck and you know how I tweeted out a guy I bet you CNN is gonna say Trump refuses to denounce the violence in his hometown [Laughter] that's true I mean the but the fact that he's like I wish him luck I mean yeah look he just knocked a home run out in the parking lot and smashed every window and the cars parked oh yeah I mean with Baldwin getting arrested for punching someone after all those years of him mocking him on CNN s it on and Senate live it's but it's the Trump curse like everyone who goes after him you know they end up getting destroyed like Ruth Bader Ginsburg I mean she just fell and broke three of her hips I hope she gets that's a curse it's a trump card be the old lady just falls down no but these the timing of these things are so perfect and so like hilariously perfect what about stormy Daniels like now you got to pay his legal fees like that is kind of hilarious yeah that she's got to pay his legal fees you know how much strip and you got to do to pay those legal fees his language his legal fees must be through of the worst roof probably millions of dollars yeah I yeah I'm yeah it's gotten crazy yeah he's charged the price sure yeah I mean he has an enormous legal team they've been and then how about all these people they were gonna turn him like Michael Cohen now he's fucked yeah what is he gonna do now what is he gonna say yeah well we already know that you paid her off and now no one cares right because he just won the case right and so she has to pay his legal fees and now you're stuck with nothing you ain't nothing right and no he oh he's trying to say a trump saying Trump used racist language with me it's like really okay well there's supposedly that Mike Mark Burnett tape okay yeah Tom aren't Tom Arnold's trying to find this right that's what Mark Burnett the guy is that Mark Burnett yeah the survivor guy Dannette presently very religious okay and he is inclined to support Trump's positions on many things and he's just not gonna release that no no there's no way Oh Trump who's running a TV show we look at t look at megyn kelly join read he's if he's using racial slurs in front of cameras and a cast of 50 which I'm sure gonna have people of color this is New York there's no way this wouldn't of leaked at the time that's not true if he's using the n-word that's not true no if there's if there is a there's a sound guy and there's a producer and they're collecting tapes and everyone has know if he's doing this publicly in front of all these not doing it publicly he's talking to someone and it was recorded much like the Billy Bush thing when he was on the bus right it's kind of doing it publicly but he's talking to someone I thought he was talking to when the cast members supposedly does someone I heard okay well I this tape is like a Bigfoot yeah it is like it's like it's more like hangar 18 but it the other thing is if he's using this language he would have been using it frequently which he doesn't hit certain words over and over yes but it could be he used it in a very specific way like you know the story about the guy from Netflix right or how about the story about the John Pappajohn yeah that's outrageous well explain it to people that don't know the story well so it's kind of a twist on that conference call with a PR firm with a PR firm and he said he was saying we're not gonna be like Colonel Sanders saying blah blah blah with that van word yeah and he was quoting somebody else as a an example yes don't use this kind of speech it's really bad and oh you invoked that word you're fired literally and he is the CEO of the company and he's saying to them we're not gonna use these words we're not gonna be like these persons like it's not like saying Michael Richards like hey like if I said that like hey I'm not gonna be like Michael Richards and get on stage in front of everybody and drops men bombs right and people just start freaking out Joe Rogan just said the ED work yeah and then all of a sudden that becomes public and then I get fired and then YouTube pulls me off and then iTunes pulls me off literally that's what's like what happened with the Papa John's yes all anybody hears is the Papa John's guy said racist shit no no that's all they hear all they heard was Papa John's refused to support Colin Kaepernick and now they're like all right we're gonna get this fucker and they did that's part of it too right yeah that's part of it too yeah there was a there was already an agenda right because of refusing to support Kaepernick yeah this just the whole thing is just it's then there's the Netflix guy do you know the Netflix I don't think I know this one what is his name well it doesn't matter the gentleman who was like one of the top dogs at Netflix says you shouldn't say the word retard because two people that have someone in their life that has Down syndrome it's like using and he doesn't say the N word he says nigger in front of African Americans and he says this in a room filled with people and some of them happen to be African Americans how many of them were retarded so they freaked out that he's used this word saying that it is just as offensive as using the n-word but he's usually false equivalency they're saying like this is much worse no no no he's just using it in terms of like saying right right it's about my friend Tom my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his last Netflix special and the bit was about you can't use the word retarded right this is what he says and he goes into all these different words that you can't use anymore and because he said why Tom stole this from George Carlin no he did that's the George Carlin bit though how what is it the seven words you can't say on television now they no no yeah I it's very different when he said okay he has a hole it's a very good bit but it's in no way endorsing using that word so but the fact that he uttered it out loud what this guy was saying was this is the same thing as someone uh turing the n-word out loud but he didn't say the n-word he said nigger and because he said that they fired him from Netflix Wow literally saying a noise to represent a word that's an offensive word and this is they said enough is enough you ordered the you said abracadabra that is gone that is a retarded decision is it niggardly they're saving money does a different word yeah are the people people are saying you shouldn't say to anymore because it sounds too much like the n-word even though it means stingy right which is very funny but it's it's moyses but it's not it's not about intent anymore it's just about never without a sense about domination right it's always about domination that's one thing that Carlin said that's absolutely correct political correctness is just fascism with better language yeah it's all about domination and toeing the line and you know picking off the people that you need to pick off and making examples either them for everyone else yes what didn't know you didn't say better language that fascism disguised as being polite or something like that but the fact that they felt like it was a smart decision to just fire someone because he said a noise you should what you should say is like I understand what you're trying to say but let's just not use that word yeah you're right done not no more job you you do bad work you're done no more income public shaming get out of here and the people that were in the room were the ones that turned him in there were some african-americans apparently that heard him say that word out loud and they just saw it as a green light and they just went after him huh well I mean at the same time you have to wonder if those executives are living in fear of course they're you know so they're like shit we better do something really quick cuz now they go now we're gonna have lawsuits or what are boycotts and blah blah well the Rosanne thing the oh yeah trigger and now do you know how much money you can't say children it sounds too close that was my last special no you can't say third yeah yeah but you can't say that word like it sounds too much like they just got a really emphasize that if the ER when the Roseanne thing happened and they they immediately stepped up and said you know this is abhorrent we hate racism you're fired they've lost so much fuckin money that show is hemorrhaging money in this return the Connors yeah has done terrible around the audience not just half the audience but half the audience and then shrinking every week and it's most likely being canceled but this is what I think people don't get ostensibly the point of a business is to make money that's why people go into business for a lot of people it's not the people running these organizations are there to further there are cultural ideology so the profit will be secondary to cultural acceptance well cultural acceptance comes along with future profitability yes the lack of cultural acceptance could be financially devastating I think that's that's the way they're looking at part of it but part of it they were also look if you go to if you live in New York and then you go to a leftie school and then you become an executive and your entire culture is this lefty worldview you're gonna think this is how all right people right thinking people act you're going to act in a certain way accordingly and not even have consideration for any possible other side that's a good point that's a good point but it's fascinating that she was not allowed to apologize Rosanna was not allowed to apologize but that woman from MSNBC was who said much much more awful things Roseanne was near I think she was hysterical or near tears that day because she's like I care about the crew they're the ones who are getting fucked please like I'll do what I want I'm not you know and that's why she let the show go on without her and she didn't fight it right and and kudos to her yeah she's she's a friend of mine and she's an awesome person she really is oh I adore her she's not what anybody is trying to paint her out too but let's talk about tribalism because I remember you remember not that long ago when her show was on she had that whole brouhaha the national anthem okay and all the Republicans were out for blood and now all of a sudden they love her yeah and the memories are very very short I love her because she's controversial and speaks her mind yeah in both cases well she is also legitimately mentally ill had a terrible car accident when she was 15 years old was institutionalized in a mental institution for nine months afterwards like has a personality multiple personality disorder trauma induced multiple personality and disorder has been on a host of medications their whole life because of that like the analogy that I say is they asking her to behave normally it's like asking a person with a broken leg did not limp yeah well and she the other one thing against her that you can't say is she did accuse both her parents of molesting her and then she later later I don't wanna speak for her but I think she backtracked about a little they denied it completely I don't remember that but I wouldn't be surprised dude she got brained by a car when she was 15 like smashed I didn't know some woman was driving through an intersection couldn't see because the Sun glare in the window and clipped her with a car and she was fucked up I mean she was she went from being a straight-a student to being someone who could no longer do math she detailed it like really emotionally and and very honestly and vulnerably she was very vulnerable in discussing it on my podcast it was really scary she she's got such a big heart too it really is very very obvious whenever she talks and she's on Twitter and she's super funny I mean I'm a big fan of her Twitter and I both and that things that she said about that woman you know being a marriage of this and you know you know like it ain't the worst thing to say and the lady looks like the lady from the Planet of the Apes I don't give a fuck what you say even though she was black I thought that bitch was wise to write things she was Jewish she looks like my sister she's running the government you must be Jewish I I thought the thing that's great about Roseanne is she was on I think Tucker Carlson is Sean Hannity she looked he's like do you want apologize to Valerie Jarrett she look at the camera she goes Valerie I'm genuinely sorry I did not want to hurt you this was not acceptable but I also do think you need a better haircut you know like she still had a joke in there but she's such a sweetheart and and I don't think the thing that I have people arguing with me about when Valerie Jarrett was born Iran yes and people were like well they're there for she's not black she was born in Iran you know black people can give birth in Iran right that's the thing and this was rap they couldn't wrap their heads around it that she was black but in Iran her parents were American right yeah yeah the whole thing is a mess but it's also one of those things that's fiercely tribal so you said before and then the our tribe the tribe of the left of the tribe of the right our tribe has decided your tribe is unacceptable unacceptable and what you've done is just beyond the possibility of any sort of apology you need to be removed even at a significant financial loss and apparently the people that were responsible for getting her fired one of them has already been removed oh yeah and now they're realizing there was a horrendous decision they went from having the number one show on television to having this bastard version the Hogan family it's fucking terrible man and nobody wants it so they if they just decided to bring her back and she apologized and everyone sued that over and look there could be money donated to charitable causes it could be a teachable moment or a learning moment for everybody for the whole country a moment also of like like above bonding where we just abandon these ridiculous ideas there was an episode I watched the series like it was like episode 6 her neighbors that moved into the Conners house were from Lanford were Muslims and Roseanne was prejudiced and then she realized she was wrong there was an episode that's like stop being so she's always been very culturally left yeah yeah she she she is in some ways and she's right in some which she's she leans right in some way she's very pro-israel yes like super so much so that she's even talked about moving to Israel yes yeah because I mean I think I think she feels I can't speak for her so yeah well don't know but what are you got here Jamie as their ratings are actually pretty good it's the number two show overall in ABC and it's their top rated comedy round from where it was obviously but writing that Ben though what are you getting this from we're getting this from vulture calm which is a very left-leaning show and it's probably will go to the title of this go to the title of us TV shows right now yeah marquee brand good lord yeah what uh what's that about it's a mummy that comes back to life yeah but this the the ratings are significantly lower more than 50% lower than they were with the other show true but it was also an extreme hit right but it's the same show Jamie okay there's no waste you're gonna tell me 50% is it not a problem yeah but that's the problem you're reading a spin what you're reading is vultures spin on it that says it's not that bad they're circling the wagons not only is it not that bad they did ten episodes they ordered an 11th yes that's unprecedented what you order is look when I was on sitcoms they would do a thing called the back nine right so you would get in 13 episodes and they would order the back nine which would bring you to 22 which is a full order they're not doing a four this shows dead right so it ain't good and the other thing is you keep in mind this show is extremely expensive yeah because you got to pay Laurie Metcalf was probably the best comedic actress out there John got 300,000 Jonathan gets more than $300,000 gets one three and I think you got the others too and you have a million dollars right away just with three members of the cast then you have production fees all these other different fees there must be a billion EPS in that show it's crazy money it's crazy money and it could be the biggest show on television if she was still on it and and the apology was accepted you were you're not gonna lose viewers they could have easily done an episode where they care where the character did that a hundr character gets clowned as an asshole yes a hundred percent they could have done it were the they're interviewing her outside of the polls and she says that my TV yeah what for television yeah they say she says it on television and then she gets labeled as a racist and then a bunch of people say well she really does look like that lady it would end with them coming home dan close the door and goes there she really does look like that the whole thing I didn't know she was black and like how could you not know and then they show different people that look black that aren't black and different people that look white but are black pull up dan boney Nia Bo ng Ino he's on Fox Ellis I'm he's Italian you and he has to stay on Twitter I'm not black you'll see his picture it's just when you go to 23andme I'm Italian too but I my ancestry I'm 1.6 percent African oh okay yeah which is so much more than Elizabeth Warren is Indian so much more yeah oh that guy's bark he's Millie's Italian no don't no don't lie to me it's true that's a black man if that guy just gets looking look at the hair listen bro that guy is so African no he's Italian well this is an Italian first of all so depending upon what part of it the Morris yeah yeah it means yeah I mean he probably had some but also Italy Justin if you look at how close Italy is to northern Africa it's very close like people just came over they fucking fucked around they were real close to each other they got on boats they went back and forth yeah that long-distance relationships I mean Italians in particular especially system but northern Africans aren't African they're not black they're Middle East you're Arabs yeah yeah but it is still Africa sure yeah it's African genetics when also Egypt would like Egypt also had relationship with the Nubians the Nubians eventually conquered Egypt and Ethiopia Zomato yeah so there's a lot of there's a lot of a lot of fucking going around wait so what else were you and your I'm 99.8 I conclude I neither Jewish or white there's like nothing else in there I'm mostly Italian and the the other percent is Irish but it also could be English it's one of those you know Europe but it's Irish which is where Rogan comes from 1.6 percent African and then I think there's a small amount of Asian in there as well you know small amount of Asian like 1% plus or minus Asian yeah no Native American oh yeah unfortunately I love her too still probably have more than Elizabeth Warren the the best thing about Elizabeth Warren stuff there's two things I love about that she takes this test in secret and of course right yeah I wonder why but that no but she took his secret but she revealed it yeah she could have seen the results be like a fuck I'm not gonna talk about this thing because she thought it might say zero right and because it said zero zero zero point one shoe but it's not even Native American it was South America she did like got like Brazilian jeans or whatever it was Mexican jeans yes it wasn't Native American jeans they didn't find Native American DNA to match number one the best part here's the best part here's the best part Trump for a year for two years like Pocahontas Pocahontas bug eyes when you're gonna take the test she goes I took the test motherfucker he goes who cares hey yeah he's like people she said that he was supposed to pay a million dollars towards charity because she took the test but if that's the case and the test actually shows South American janitors and not Native Americans well he said that that's all very squirrely - it's like what is Native American I mean there's there's so many similarities between people from Mexico and Native Americans people from Ecuador and Native Americans Peru I mean there's extreme similarities between what we think of as traditional Native Americans and then people that lived in South America and then also the actual path that they got here in the first place a lot of them have Siberian Janelle yeah Asiatic yeah yeah I mean that's what's really did you know the whole story behind how that got discovered no it was a guy who is a Mormon this is about a decade plus ago who was trying to prove this Mormon doctrine that Jesus Jesus Lost Tribe okay the a the last tribe of Israel I came to American is were the Native Americans so this guy and this is when DNA tests were insanely expensive this guy spent a shitload of money to try to test Native Americans to try to find Israelite genes and he found that they have Siberian genes because it came across the Bering Land Bridge yeah which was excellent because it really did prove that theory that people did migrate on foot through you know that through the Bering Land Bridge so silly but if you look at like like Native Americans and then you look at like some Mexicans you go wow there's a distinct similarity between these two in terms of like their features or colorations like how they looked oh yeah I mean they're they're gonna evolve in similar climates and things like that yeah and I think probably similar origins of ancestors you know and so she's got a point South Americans what kind she's amazing she's amazing I think she's on the spectrum too probably but the number of percentage that she has of this gene is so fucking small one 1,024 that is so small yeah I'm one point six percent right that's literally like what like about ten hundred times as much as her I think she's point O six so you're like thirty times as much as her thirty times as much African and she is Native American and but yet she used that to get a job at Harvard the funny part is she had contributed recipes to a book called powwow Chow and she signed it Elizabeth Warren Navajo but here's the here's the kicker she plagiarized the recipe beautiful so not only was she not a fucking Native American is this like a crab salad recipes like what Native Americans reading fucking crab the fuck you talk ones from Maryland yeah merica Maryland yeah the Baltimore ins Tuesday was Ryan Sickler would say wow that is crazy it's just it's one and but but again because she has potential in terms of like she's a strong woman she's articulate she's very well educated she's been a professional politician for a long time people on the left are not denouncing her yes they have who Oh some people were like okay this that there are articles that go okay this did not go as we planned because they were just like this genetics test yes and a lot of people are uncomfortable with her appropriating set-asides that are for people who are actually suffering minorities be like no no no this is not cool so she's gotta sign this from small blog so I'm not seeing this from anything mainstream correct because mainstream they're always gonna cover for this tabloid 100% of the time yeah they're gonna cover their the thing about those blogs is like a lot of them are basically like Ari Shaffir refers to him is like college papers yeah it's like a lot of these blogs so a college student written yeah but they're often speaking truth oh yeah well I would hope I would hope more would come out and say hey you can't say you're Native American just like like you imagine the outrage if I just started call myself african-american well do you know what did you see what Trump said he said well I can't call her Honus anymore because she's not an Indian and I'm just like oh my god we're not worthy he says some hilarious shit oh yeah he really does he really does he's fucking funny off-the-cuff oh yeah really is you know and the way he goes after people like even though he's the president like he still calls people fucking losers I mean he's still he still caused them losers on Twitter and goes after them the horse face horse face he called star McDaniels horse face just think of how repulsive he is physically he's fat his faces all fucking hanging off of his bones he's got white raccoon eyes and orange skin and yet he's still will mock stormy Daniels and call her horse face someone to tweet it out I forget who and I apologized the thing he said they go imagine what happens that Trump's the first person who fucked a porn star and she had to brag about it and then she paid him yeah well he did pay her right but what he paid her what she's gonna have to pay him is probably like a factor of three or fours I mean how much more she's gonna wanna pain yes for three hundred and fifty K that's all you asked for it oh that's very reasonable yeah that doesn't even cover her book yes it's probably like he just wants just be done get it just yet give me that paper yeah just give me a little something I need a little something from you with this let this slide I want three hundred thousand yeah yeah it's probably her book that's probably all the money no she got more than 350 I'm positive how much think she got for that book seven hundred fifty I would guess yeah but she's got to pay taxes sure and her agents getting fifteen yeah she's probably not even bringing three home so it's all that's money's gone oh yeah that's all gone all gone 100% gone and no one's buying that book it stiffed yeah yeah nobody gives a shit she said it already like I fucked the president that's your book you book as I fucked the president well you know here's the funny part with her remember this people she was making fun of his dish like she'd hit a mushroom deck whatever and people liked this room that's what she said and then people were like that you know as fucked up as he is that's body shaming you really shouldn't make and she's like you know what you're right I'm sorry and then he goes hey horseface he lost his fucking mushroom dick at like the next day she's back on it it was amazing space doesn't matter I know but it's just so weak I mean Ted Cruz really isn't the Unabomber or whatever the fuck he said he was say that that's the name they cease is that Jeff gay fucking's it's also crazy that was the best part so Ted Cruz's work was known as like the best debater in the Senate he had this Harvard or Yale whatever debating team great debater everyone would recognize him for this how did the fuck do you prep for a debate be like oh yeah well your dad shot JFK it's like what the fuck wait what well I didn't have to make sense right people the people that heard Trump supporters don't want to make sense they just want him to win right right exactly and it works yes yeah well he's just had to get zingers in oh yeah yeah I mean it's like roast battle more than right and they don't get that there was this my favorite tweet of his my favorite where he goes whenever I speak of the losers and the haters I do so with great affection it's not their fault they were born fucked-up nation point that's a real Trump tweet it's the best one yeah you know one of my favorite things was him at a speech where he was talking it was 2015 before he even talked about running for president or it was even I don't think he was a hundred percent open about running for president and he said there's two ways to talk to China you could you know could prose things you could propose things and he says like you know normally and then he says or you could say listen motherfucker yeah you heard that no oh my god it's great fucking pull it it's it's fucking great because everybody starts cheering yeah because it's so forbidden in this environment wearing expensive suits standing in front of a podium he says or you could say listen motherfuckers like this is what we're gonna do and everybody started yeah it's so exciting it's so much more exciting then Marco Rubio or you know someone boom Jeb is a waste jam is a big fat mistake I watched those videos which have wasted June of 25th now when he said mother when he's just just not speech when he's talking about China and he said listen I the fuckers China China China yeah that was a thing Puerto Rican when he pronounced literally Kevin dancing a ban on all Muslim immigration Muslim here this is a great one of this because it's leadership this time instead of with his name in gold it's with his words this is discussing Iraq we build a school we build a road they blow up the road they blow up the school we build another school we build another road they blow them up we build again in the meantime we can't get a school built in Brooklyn to the audience's approval talking oil we have nobody in Washington that sits back and said you're not gonna raise that price you understand me this is a long time ago sing Chinese goods here's your mother we're gonna tax you 25% this is 2011 is that what it says over there yeah but here's what's interesting notice the person who posted their name is say no to racists yeah they probably put it up as a negative thing well no 2011 he would have been considered a Democrat right oh no he's endorsed Romney he endorsed Romney Republican race he was a Democrat until what 2010 probably around then cuz he was gonna run us an independent at some point Trump 2012 look at that this is the guy we've been looking for ha ha ha seven years ago but it's just deplorable what changed it they probably damaged it in the future because it says seven years yeah fuck that's the time travel that hack join read uh yeah someone did it someone definitely hacked it yeah just hilarious they didn't give the good version of that either because they believed in it well just that because he also see if you can find the better version because he basically practices it like you know people been saying it like this right he can say it like this or you can say listen you motherfuckers and that's when everybody starts cheering he actually I have one man saying wait attacks you 25% and I can say another listen you motherfuckers man it's like this brutal press lies on the campaign trail he set a point I remember it was the centum he goes you better shut your mouth so he didn't say the word mhm they bleeped it and they bleeped it to make it look like he was cursing and he's like you guys are fucking shady as hell that's very Shady yeah that's Shady you can't just bleep a pause and pretend that there's some sort of an offensive word in there right that's really that's just deceptive right and it's pervasive they do it all the fucking time well who's good out there to challenge him they're fucked okay fuck you know why they're fucked why because we've never had this happen before the whole time all those Democrats are fighting each other for the primary for the nomination he's gonna be tweeting the shit out of those debates he's gonna be live tweeting the debates right and they're not gonna they have to worry about the tax from their colleagues but also from the sitting president it was like look at this dope and he's gonna come up with nicknames from this Danang dick he already did I'm like it's amazing to demand dick Blumenthal senator from Connecticut lied about his Vietnam service oh no Rob has started calling him Danang dick he lied about his Vietnam service got elected yep shameless yeah how did he live what did he say he said he served and he didn't look it up yeah I mean it's it's it is brazen it wasn't some ambiguous area I think he's like he never left America is my understanding oh yeah and he said he was in Nam oh yeah and then he's fucking going after Kavanagh but how do they all get away with it Dennis Hastert was Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was Speaker the house and he fucked how many kids I mean the wrestling team and he only went to jail for 15 months for it yeah yeah he went to jail for 15 months because of a statute of limitations or something ridiculous well I think then you go to jail for lying about paying him off I said yeah yeah that that isn't saying he's out now yeah which is just insane and it's no one talks about him Brooks leads me to think there's plenty of this on both sides of the aisle well there must be he must know where the bodies right of course your speaker the house they just got a they just gotta say listen 15 months not that big a deal we've got a cake was right yeah it's okay we'll get you books right howdy boys you'll be fine read the Hardy Boys oh that's porn yeah and one no not only that like when did he stop fucking kids that's the real question because that is that's a sickness that just doesn't get cured right it's not like quitting cigarettes or something like that the recidivism rate for people that are molesters is insanely high right so who knows look that was one of the creepier things that was a drudge that said or was it Breitbart that's I think was Breitbart that said before he died yeah where he's talking about Podesta I this was the one issue I had was legal for my forthcoming book because I because Drudge said how it between still up Drudge says how John Podesta is not known as an international like child molester cover-up or completely eludes me yeah and no one said anything at the time it wasn't a big deal Podesta never sued and what he might have been referring to was Robert Epstein with pedophile Island we're guys I'll go to like Jeff Epstein excuse me Jeff Epstein yeah you go that Island Clinton's got like nine times and you fuck all these underage girls but then they took it to be as proof of pizza gate or something like that yes yeah but here's the thing here's the Breitbart it wasn't right part Andrew Breitbart sweet but if you like a blood no is my Drudge oh it's bright part yeah okay Breitbart so if I said Roger I apologize but here's the other thing it's that everyone knows historically that young women went to Hollywood and had to do sexual favors if since the 20s in order to get their career ahead right this is very known yeah why wouldn't this happen with young men with older gay executives why would there be any difference well most certainly of course but they like to pretend that you know this is all crazy it's it's all a conspiracy it's like what you know it's true with this one well because it's so blatant and it's so prevalent that it's horrifying right because then it's also the powerlessness like what am I gonna do about it yeah and the just knowing how much it did happen and if they did just uncover every single instance of it and that's the other thing it's just like with it with a Harvey Weinstein how everyone knew we all knew and they all knew about Clinton and all this stuff it's like who knows who's a and whose when you're looking up the other way when it comes to kids that's so beyond the pale yeah it's stark shit and yeah it's very dark so this Danang guy Danang dick what he so what did he actually say and what was like I don't want to misquote him dick richard blumenthal from Connecticut how the fuck did he get reelected is Connecticut's does this tribalism you're gonna vote blue in Connecticut but how would how would they accept him as their candidate cuz he got I think it came out once he was the candidate oh Jesus Christ yeah yeah that's a big one man yeah it is soand valor no that's yeah I mean forget about what Brian Williams did that night way bigger I get shit for having shaped sides of my hair feel like he's not so you know they're like is that stolen valor and I'm like no I'm done with that yes come on a haircut politifact calm about it mmm he listened to Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 until then five deferments had kept him out of the war getting a coveted slot in the reserves reduced the chance of battlefield deployment Blumenthal went through basic training and served six years in the Washington DC area in Connecticut as Connecticut's attorney general Blumenthal regularly attended Memorial Day parades and other events that recognized soldiers and veterans in New York Times wrote in May 17 2010 that in 2003 Blumenthal had spoken at a rally supporting troops overseas the newspaper reported that Blumenthal said when we returned we saw nothing like this that was a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam Blumenthal repeatedly repeated a similar line in 2007 Memorial Day Parade in Milford Connecticut and at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens Blumenthal said we have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam ooh yep and then look at the very bottom line although I did not serve in Vietnam I've seen firsthand the effects of military action uh-huh well that's a story bro he's alive what does he think firsthand means mm yeah well that's he said we have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam if they quoted that and that's a that's a he said that a 2008 ceremony that's a liar yeah I mean that's just that stolen valor but you know it's it's it's a lie as much as it's stolen valor because he does have military service which in I mean he was a part of the reserves which is important part of the military there's no I mean you don't want to diminish that but lying about having actually been in Vietnam is it's as close to stolen valor as you can get with actually being a veteran yeah yeah right yeah it's like shady yeah it's shady but they're dirty people they're dirty people yeah of course so they're already business they're a horrible horrible people so that's why when people are like venerating yeah these monsters I'm like what the fuck is wrong with you these people are horrible just doing that just doing that alone like that's what's hilarious that he got through though oh yeah it's it's funny what people can get away with does he ever said I'm sorry shouldn't have said that yeah what he says hmm made mistakes as I have misspoken about my service and I regret that and I take full responsibility you know full responsibility means resigning does it if you're taking what is responsibility I mean if there's no consequences well that's good question well the consequences are shaming maybe he is the best person for the job despite the fact that a lot decade ago but I still don't know what responsibility means in this context I've taken responsibility I remember Janet I was I had friend of mine Janet Reno when Waco happened and all those kids died nor did you see Janet Reno was a friend of yours no a friend I was talking about general no no I knew Janet Reno pals with Janet Reno was a friend of mine you know and she went on TV after Waco and all those people died and she goes this is my fault I take full responsibility my friends like then you should be in jail if you are responsible you're a murderer dozens of people getting killed you should be in jail yeah Sasquatch yeah how does that work yeah it's just it's dirty business it is a dirty business is North Korea mad at us again I'm glad you're here today there was something this morning that I was reading what happened it's more North Korea's angry at the u.s. so they do cycles North Korea so they'll do good cop bad cop and we saw this happen it was just really amazing so North Korea has this weapon that causes everyone on earth to have amnesia about the river really angry so as tensions as US tensions rise right so they have this weapon that caused everyone to have amnesia right so they'll do something and that people forget what happened six months ago when the Singapore summit was happening and they were making nice and everyone's just like Oh blah blah I go last year they had sentenced President Trump to death they were threatening to nuke Guam and everyone just complete forgot about that and then like okay we're gonna be nice it's like and then he cancels the summit the summit comes back on their it they do this if they've done this for years and it's like if you follow North Korea's I do it's my gig you see it coming but then everyone's like oh my god they're mad at us this has never happened before like this has happened for 70 years motherfuckers this is their shtick mm-hmm so what do you think the purpose of it is just to stay relevant in the news and to alert people that there's still conflict between the u.s. it's very it's very important for them when they make any sort of concessions to say that they're putting up a fight we're not we're doing this because we want to not because you're making us doing it you know he's standing up for themselves we're not going to get pushed around because they can't show submission or weakness in any sense so president Trump's been playing this very intelligently and the rest then and the corporate press won't tell you this because everything's about Trump I don't fucking care about Trump in this context I care about the North Korean people right the point is they are they'll rip their Radle their saber and then they'll be nice the next day and then they rattle the saber in their nights next day it's it's it's as night follows day with them well the cultures of really fascinating culture the culture of Korea in general yeah you know it's there's there's so much to it that we have a really difficult time understanding oh yes in terms of just the formalities in which you're allowed to communicate with people the way that they must say face right and what they're doing anytime there there's any sort of negotiation there has to be some sort of an acknowledgement of their social status right in their position yeah yeah they're very at South Korea too so people think South Korea is like America Junior it's not they're a very different country from us and just because they're our Ally doesn't mean they're all good guys too I was just reading Malcolm Gladwell's outliers okay yeah I'm one of the things about it is how South Korea dealt with they went through a crisis of plane crashes and one of the problems the plane crashes was the way the subordinates were not allowed to question the pilot Wow when the pilots were tired you know the way they fixed it they made them all speak English how would that fix it because English is a different the structure of the syntax the structure of politeness and deferment and all the different things different tenses the way you're not allowed to communicate with people in Korean where there's a very strong tradition of sit like the the Malcolm Gladwell goes into in great detail like superiors when they're around their subordinates the subordinates are not allowed to drink in front of them they can't smoke in front of them they have to turn away if they have a drink in front of them like there's the the way they talk to them they bow to them they they call them sir and I went through all this in Taekwondo Taekwondo is very structured and when I was teaching and when I was when I was working for my Korean instructors like it was always sir it was only have mr. Kim it was always very formal there was always bowing and it was there was you know and this is an Americanized version right English right with their language with the Korean language they were talking about all the different proper forms of communication and the structure that's in place to establish who the dominant person is and who the subordinate person and in North Korea there's a tents that they use only with regards to the leaders yeah so they've changed the language that extent even for them yeah so what they did was they made the South Korean pilots like all of them English was the primary language of communication they had to learn English now and they had to learn on their own dime oh they're to learn English and then I think they went with first names so we and would work together I wouldn't say mr. malleus like because then I would have I would be to sort yeah yeah yeah yeah I would say Mike we got some frost on the wing of this plane we should probably defrost this fucker and you and I would be even though you would be the captain I would be your co-pilot we would still be able to talk to each other as if we're friends and equals not on this traditional Korean social structure and this happened in America to like people freaked out that Trump is vulgar izing the presidency but I was a big deal with JFK didn't wear a hat at his inauguration and even before that Emily yes you didn't have a hat it's like it's a vulgar a hat yeah of a hat was important yes nice if Trump wore a hat today well with that hair I mean he's kind of wearing a hat well he wears the make American Indian hat but I mean like a bolder hat like yeah yeah yeah those wicker ones and an FDR gotten shit because he referred to all his subordinates by their first name and this was a huge deal back then instead of just a Roosevelt or Howard a key so he tried to be informal and the reset that he was being informed yeah it was like so this has been going on for a long time the lock a formality look how people used to dress in airplanes they'd be in suits yeah now they're I had a situation in a plane here these people are just like animals like dogs dogs dress better than some of these people well they bring their dogs - yeah absolutely bringing dogs on play and the subway in New York they started bringing them they always find new ways all you have to do is have a piece of paper from a doctor that says you need help I don't think they need that they are like on the subway they just take them like what are you going to fucking do about it really yeah de Blasio's let it go to shit yeah that's a real problem with people that are scared of dogs what about you have two dogs are gonna get into a fight or they start shitting somewhere we know what do you we're not waiting with San Francisco we don't need shit on the streets that's true yeah wow what happened what do you mean with de Blasio what's he doing he's just basically do what the fuck you want I'm not going to force Giuliani's like quality of life rules so I think the new thing that the cretins have started doing this happens in the gym and this happens I seen on subway they just start playing their music what I mean people have their head there they're little I phone they just start playing music no headphones and I'm just like you need police brutality because obviously if you're this removed from what's appropriate behavior talk is not gonna do for you well if the gym doesn't the gym have its own music yeah it does so people play their music over the gym in the locker room and some fucking do just playing his music I'm like what the fuck are you doing oh yeah I don't my point I'm a small dude you know I can't go over to these beasts at the gym and be like excuse me sir your musics disturbing my workout what kind of music you're dealing with is it rap III almost always know it that's like it's like a gym you're gonna have like heavy metal or raft Oh heavy metal right that kind of shit I'm trying to put your underwear on and you think of peaceful thoughts after a nice workout yeah or I'm trying to drop some sick Birds on Twitter look guys okay I got some good verbiage here dropping sick Birds guys excuse me sir could you please cut down that mumble rap I'm dropping super easy sir I'm dunking on Tucker Carlson you're dunking on him that poor guy he gets a free pass what's my Oh Jamie I've never heard the Kennedy think so I looked it up he actually according to Snopes revived an inaugural hat wearing tradition he did yes Kennedy did not wear that he walked all the way without his hat that's not what this says this is from 2007 on Snopes he was wearing a most day this is like a long like oh yeah look he's wearing it took a rumor that he killed the hat industry well scroll down you can see him wearing it yeah he's wearing him mostly there as he gave his speech he took it off ah okay put it back on interest so there's like a long room it has been going on fucking look at that fella should have had it lined with lead huh I don't think that would've helped wouldn't hurt wouldn't help the shot to the neck he took look at that out of that hat it would him with the hat look at that look at that it's also weird seeing him like talking Truman like there's some such different eras I know right you would think that they weren't alive together yeah well Herbert Hoover he visited at the White House Herbert Hoover visited JFK Wow look at look at Lyndon Johnson thinking three more years man and I'm gonna be President I'm gonna get you shot I'm gonna get you fucker yeah and your brother to fuck your wife when you're dead well Lyndon Johnson used to take shits without ya the press right in front of him oh yeah let them in the bathroom was dropping logs yeah and he would like whip out his dick all the time he was like a horrible person cuz he whipped his dick doesn't make him horrible person no that's just really happy with his dick well that's true that's not does not make him a horrible person the horrible person is the guy's whipping out his dick and playing his music at blaka room that's the art that's a horrible professor if he's playing that lead music and he's stroking his cock at the same time yeah that's the horrible press about yes there's a locker room and you're just trying to drop sick burns I'm trying to ya Joe it's all I want to do I just did my deadlifts pathetically are you gonna leave Tucker Carlson alone for a little while I never know ii-i've been on Tucker's show a few times I've never gotten Tucker face so I'm very shocked her face oh when he gives you that look yeah I've never gotten he's going after you yeah he's never done that so he's been very respectful because very few people know North Korea that's what I'm there to talk about right so they're not I'm not being coming at that from a partisan perspective at all right you're coming to educate right so I've never gotten heat about that at all I wonder what's gonna happen with him and all this stuff cuz now that his house is of it people know where his house is when you come not just gonna move as you know when you conscious someone's family that sets off some part of your brain that's something fierce you know and he's not going to just take lying down yeah I mean I wonder if there's legal action it's gonna be had I don't know it's all fucked up man it's just we've it's we've never had a time where I in my life where I can remember the left and the right being so combative not just disagreeing about things not just debating things but this kind of shit like riots like you know the right was on their knees all this time for a long time and now they're like you know what you people are fucking terrible fuck you mm is that the case mean there's never is it the right was on their knees there was never a left-wing and Tifa type organization me too because the right was being supported to them in many ways like the press had a complete monopoly on speech 2012 2012 Mitt Romney's having this debate with Obama candy Crowley's the moderator right the moderator and she starts arguing with Mitt Romney during the debate you're the fucking moderator sit down and shut up place you're arguing about she's like oh you got these this attacks wrong blah blah blah blah blah and she even before the debate she says I'm gonna correct him if necessary bitch you're the moderator sit down shut the fuck up if she's supposed to if she knows something's out let your poets like a judge if the judge has two sides and someone's the lawyer is lying it's the other lawyer has to make it up that's a good point but as a moderator aren't you also some kind of an I mean you're not necessarily an entertainer but you're moving the thing along if you know something to be incorrect like if someone says you know I'm James Brown shot JFK I am sure that there was a contract that the the Romney team and the Obama team sat down and worked out between them like how much time the forum the location I'm sure that said the moderate we're gonna find an honest objector moderate who's not gonna interfere there's no fucking way they wouldn't mmm was she correct no I don't think she was he look it up I'm 99% sure she was wrong to that's hilarious and he but he took it he's ate it he just ate and then you have in 2016 where they're just telling the fucking reporters fuck you you're not the whole you talk tetra Cruise lost his shit on them he's like what kind of questions are these hmm you know and the audience cheers and that's was a big turning point let's who it is the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror you said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror it was not a spontaneous demonstration is that what you're saying please proceed governor I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror yet the transfer he did in fact sir so let me let me call it an act he did call it an act of terror it did as well take it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea of there being a riot out there about this tape to come out you're right the administration the administration indicated that this was a a reaction to a to a video and was a spontaneous reaction it took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group and and to suggest am i incorrect in that regard on Sunday the that your secretary or excuse me the ambassador the United Nations one of the Sunday television shows and and spoke about how this was a spontaneous hmm but she seemed like she was just agreeing well doesn't seem like she was it's still not her all right it's still not her I'll say you're wrong about this you're right about this in my opinion but anyway that's I don't think she said you're wrong though did she she said that is correct it took two weeks I mean she's basically they're ready for Rahm was there another example of this because I remember that I remember got heated between the two of them so I asked but I could see use your you being correct that even what she did there and saying that he's correct is really out of line right yeah she seemed a little flustered they're not exactly sure what to do and what not to do but but there's been many example people forgot about I can see that Benghazi thing was of the same one there's no volume okay either way yeah it seems like she's doing the same thing but that Benghazi thing that was that was so bizarre people forgot about how that they were trying to blame it on that they didn't your movie yeah your video what was it called something I don't remember and Hillary I think at the time was she was Secretary of State and she refused to go on and they made Susan Rice walk the plank for that one that was a weird one man that movie was weird it was so bad it was almost like a flop did they blame in a loose change was that the one no no no no no it was a movie it was like a terrible movie that someone had made like the tears of the Muslims or something like that I forget the name of it but it was so bad it almost seemed like a parody film or some people it said like this is like this is some CIA production well you know it's interesting how memory works I remembered it being much more combative than it was and we just watched it yeah and I would have sworn on a Bible that it was very very heated and then looking at that it wasn't that heated well this brings us back to what we're talking about with Kavanagh yeah and thinking about things that happen when you're 17 right and tribalism yeah yeah I mean the memory that we have sucks yes it's just shitty it's just being a human being I mean I have some absolute memories about facts that I know to be true in terms of like statistics and things that took place and that I've stored in my memory because of my job because like especially when it comes to fights like I have a pretty good database a fight but even then occasionally I'm like is that how it went right why do I think it was a second round huh yeah yeah yeah memory suck yeah it does you know especially when you drink it booze will be telling me about all that booze you're drinking oh god what are you doing this is such a good Oh the our dress March yeah okay this is really exciting so I went on this rabbit hole I'm not a big drinker right and I did this I have a lied to the live stream and I tried eight different kinds of Heinz ketchup because I love Heinz ketchup and I thought this is eight different kinds I'm like yeah let's I'm like let's dork out I'm gonna try all eight and give my opinion in all eight and I said I went down a rabbit hole and I found all this weird liquor I'm not a big drinker if you guys want to pay for these bottles the super the livestream people the audience I'll buy them and I'll do it and they just kept chipping in I bought 32 bottles November 16th me and six of my buddies are going to be and I'm like how do I return value you guys are chipping in for these bottles they go do it with people so it's me and six of my friends we're doing quarter shots and seeing if we get through all 32 of these weird liquors and you can quit it well 32 times the quarters need shots I know that's what I'm saying that's a lot that's a lot of booze it's a lot of booze and some of them are really exciting some we're not six mouths it's gonna be numb after like shot number five and also the different alcohol by proof they're different everyone's a different flavor they're all crazy mmm so I it's just I'm very very excited with this we're gonna be streaming it from compound and at my house yeah I found there's this one company from this is for cred for people if people want to have cred there's this company from Denmark you probably haven't heard of them called empirical spirits so this guy's like Willy Wonka this former chef and he figured out new ways to make liquor and he made one that's habanero but the capsaicin doesn't get through the distilling process so I can't handle heat I'm a bitch you're drinking the taste that habaneros without any of the heat Wow and then he made one which tastes called Charlene McGee that's the character from fire started Rivera mascara girl it's like drinking smoke but it's smooth so it's really cool what's a habanero one called I hate the name because it's so pedestrian because it's so creative what he's done it's called fuck Trump and his stupid fucking wall no yeah no yeah the wait a minute he's got five of them the whiskey is it a whiskey or bourbon it was like I don't know what to call it cuz it's a new kind of a Gillick or I think look or tech I don't know what the term is because they're distilling it in a crazy sci-fi way and it's called fuck Trump and his stupid fucking wall yeah that's literally the name of it look yeah that's hilarious it sounds delicious it is the idea of I'm really excited about the idea of habanero without the heat although I do like heat there is say unfortunately we cannot shit this is so crazy that that is the actual name of the boo and he's blunt got one which is of what's that monetary what is that K arm Denmark Crocker's dinner crowns yeah he's got one which is called sook blend which is Ra's al hanout which is spices mixed with cocoa shells Jamie order us a bottle this jazz I can get it for you what's it say you can't get it to the States so here's the thing Joe there's like two these two stores in America that have it I have it I'll get you a bottle Dora ones in Brooklyn there's ones in Manhattan I don't know where the other one is it's really fun that is oh and he's making one now out of tuna tuna fish yeah now think how smart you have to be to turn tuna into a drinkable liquor I was on Anthony show and yeah one of my boss one of his boys brought in some beer that's made with weed oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the scientist guy yeah yeah yeah I drank some of that was it heart was very good they all didn't taste bad and it will fuck you up it was a hundred milligrams in the whole bottle and I drank about a third of the bottle and I was like yeah I feel that here we go that's that's just no joke no no joke any edibles are no joke man and that was for me that was post sober October so that we drink was the first marijuana I'd had in a whole month so kick your ass it was pretty good I'm scared of this are just I'm not gonna lie yeah you should be scared all that stuff fuck Trump and his stupid fucking wall you should be scared of that well that's sweet is it yeah that one I tried that one I tried it was it can you compare it to something it's because he cuts it with habanero vinegar also there's a hole so it's got a vinegar kick see the thing is when you're Willy Wonka nothing's like it right so the it's hard for me to have the vocabulary to compare these two it's it's got the bell pepper kind of sweetness Wow it's also it doesn't have a burn so it's it's smooth the fires the Charlie McGee is the one I really like the fire one it's so crazy if you like a dragon what's the alcohol content in something like this the Charlene McGee I think's 40 80 proof this one's I think 54 proof so it's pretty strong yeah let's go kick it's got a kick got something going on there fifty proof means twenty five percent alcohol right yeah yeah man these Wizards today they're doing all kinds of do you think but I love that's this is what drives me crazy when people were like there's nothing interesting out there there's your fan of this there's so many creative people in every field especially nothing interesting out there basic people non content yeah Mickey C's yeah there's a lot of basic yeah and it's some like dude there's so much it's so what does an npc uh you don't know this mean is that a Scientology thing no non-player character non-player don't know about this do I get to tell you the NPC Mia's this is the most importantly for a lifetime yeah okay here we go breaking it down as quickly as possible I'm gonna show my age when you when we were younger we played games like Final Fantasy and Ultima right mhm and in those games you go to like the armor store or the weapons store and you buy your sword or you buy your armor right there's a guy running that store within the game yes he does not exist outside of that store right that character all he does is buy armor and sell armor he doesn't have a wife he doesn't kid you go there at midnight he's there you go there at 8:00 a.m. he's there he's there player characters you're playing he's the non-player character and the point this me makes is the vast majority of humans are non player characters they have no mind outside their programming so they call it MSN PC or they'll call it NPC as the network and you'll go and lick the orc press car they'll be like orange man bad in peach 45 Russia and that's all they know how to say and you see this on Twitter where it's one thing when people say cliched ideas but they'll say cliched ideas in a cliched way yeah and it's like you have no mind you're just repeating what has been programmed to you in your script and as soon as you mentioned certain terms is there's a knee-jerk speech that they give and once you identify it it's like the matrix like you see Agent Smith everywhere yeah there's also a weird laziness to that yes that they there's some people that know that that's what that is and they accept it and they just do it anyway right and they because they know they can get away with it yes yeah see that in journalism too well I mean the white I mean journalism are there they had a pull-up Matthau NPC because there's a picture heard says tonight on MSNBC orange man bad or like the angry intellectual show I think they call her it's it's hilarious and the Twitter freaked the fuck out and started banning a lot of these accounts because this is really calling the bluff on a lot of these people like these why did Twitter ban me because they say it's dehumanizing well they didn't give a reason but that's the sensible reason theoretically sooner never explains it's dehumanizing to call someone a non-player character well in effect in a way if you're saying they have no mind or soul but is it ok to scroll I'm a basic bitch yes apparently that's super similar what about calling someone a fucking Nazi right why is that so easy because when you're calling someone Nazi you are reading them effectively at the human race you're saying this person is not deserving of any semblance of decency yes and that's not a crazy perspective it's the ultimate subhuman designation yeah yeah yeah it's the new n-word right yeah but it's it's it's actually like really easy to say you can't you can't pull it out it's like not the actual thing you asked for but those memes of her yeah that's the one the third one that one that right there oh well the outraged intellectual show it's really hilarious is listening to liberals go off on her like real progressives like Jimmy Dore oh he's great Jimmy Dore Michael Tracy grilling Greenwald none of them follow me that wish they would but they're there I hate when the right things everyone the left's the same yeah there are many people on the Left who are not PC who are brilliant who have left-wing ideas and convictions and they call shit out but the percentage of them in comparison the percentage that just follow the narrative is so small we just talked about earlier ninety ten ninety percent of any population are gonna be NPCs ten percent are gonna be the innovators yeah yeah Jimmy Dore goes off on her when I'm doing there's the arduous March me and the six friends it's jr. one who's a 4chan mod my buddy Michael Wolff strength coach Matt who's an immigrant Matt Savage injure Simon's an immigrant my friend Paul I don't have a name for him so I said you're gonna be Paul and Dave Smith who you know he's gonna be excited from the Romney win and I said Paul I'm just gonna say Paul the NPC and he immediately went out and got a gray sweatshirt and a gray ski mask to wear to just look like the name so that was very proud of Paul what what Romney win I'm not aware Romney's the senator from Utah he just yeah he just got elected Tuesday how does go from Massachusetts to Utah he's got he's a Mormon he's got the magic but did he move there did he have to move there to get that Utah doesn't I think he lived there before Massachusetts cuz he ran the Olympics didn't he out of Salt Lake I'm sure he's got if you're a Mormon you've got Utah roots yeah he's so reasonable in comparison to Trump oh I don't keep me people would vote for him now I think he don't know I think he's completely soulless and I don't think people go away I don't think people vote for reasonability he was for he he attacked he went to the left of Ted Kennedy for gay marriage then he's against it he's saying Romney care works for Massachusetts but it won't work for America what the fuck does that mean wait a minute he was the to the left of Ted Kennedy when it came to game air yeah look up Romney Ted Kennedy gay rights he he was for gay rights then he's against it pro-choice pro-life what was his reasoning for going against it because now he's running as for the Republican presidency the guy's a fucking phony dad's Mexican yeah that's true his dad is like born in Mexico you know what happened with his dad yeah it was governor Michigan and he was gonna probably be the Republican nominee in 68 or 72 and then he said he got brainwashed well yeah and then it was like what the fuck does that mean Romney I'll be better than Ted for gay rights 1994 yep so what happened his dad got brain one his that said he was brainwashed who I don't really I don't remember somebody and they're like are you saying you're crazy yeah yeah this was the thing so that did him in that did it meant yeah you can't say you got brainwashed no you got to be saying you got to be saying I'm impervious yes brainwash me motherfucker good luck 25% tariff yeah that's hilarious that's a great way hey I got brainwashed it's a great way to exonerate yourself it isn't though it's like you know what I talk about this in my next book um when people on the Left are saying Trump is gaslighting you me if you're gas-lit that means you're crazy gas-lit means someone is making you feel insane that's the definition of that yeah I don't think they understand that no that's a weird term gastly I don't know I think I've ever used it I've only read it it's been a movie what movie Gaslight oh you know what the term comes from there's a movie from the 40s where the husband is trying to convince the wife she's going insane so he's like changing the light bulbs and like fucking with their head so two gas lights when you manipulate someone to believe they're going crazy so how can someone say that Trump is manipulating them into believing they're going crazy they think do they think that he's making them crazy because he's just such an asshole that he's making them crazy is that why they no I think they're saying he's such a liar that he's making me lose my sense of reality but but the person who's the recipient of gas lighting is not in a good place no matter how you cut it right you're either losing touch with reality you're doubting things you're losing your mind you don't want to be that guy don't think that guy or that girl don't get Ashley yeah don't get gasoline and don't say you're getting gas lit that's the movie from the 20s 40s 40s I need to go see that it's a brilliant idea yeah it sounds like it yeah it sounds funny it is hilarious it's probably funny to watch it too like the time period oh yeah yeah yeah I think it's Ingmar vert I think Ingrid Bergman yeah this is a major major film Wow what a creative plot yeah that is that's very creative you know it's the most creative show I think like one of the most creative and innovative shows of all time is the Twilight Zone well if you think about all the different premises they covered in the Twilight Zone like good lord what a bounty of creative ideas right and every one of those was in it like it was like a twisting in it yeah yeah I'm night Shyamalan is what one every three years they got to do it every week he nailed it with one he nailed it with a sixth sense and then after that it was like like that the village what right right you find out they're right next to a road you can walk to a road in a day you know how long that's that's 20 miles man it's not that far you're 20 miles from people and you're telling me people never got to your village did you guess the ending for the sixth sense I guessed it right away no I didn't okay I know did you I think when you being like I don't know I was just coming in like I'm and I guess the usual suspects also did you yeah because all those movies when you come in looking at it from a writer perspective it's like okay they have to show their hand in the first two minutes because then you could be like oh it's been a lie the whole time something like watching like that I didn't see the one where the plants come alive and kill people I'm sure it's retarded I'm sure it's bad Mark Wahlberg right yeah yes yes what was in plants who was in plan of the apes Oh was he yeah I mean was it yes he was mom why don't you think no the the guy who played the doctor James Franco he played the doctor oh that's right wasn't it I don't know I never saw it I know Mark Wahlberg's the lead and kill Elena Bonham Carter I believe yeah isn't she the James Franco was the one who was trying to he trained the chimp and that's when the chimp went crazy and he was helping the chimp this was gonna be the first episode of Joe Rogan without chip mentions and here we go yeah yeah it's Marky Mark what year is this oh it's the other one the first one it's the first in there when they brought it back really sure yeah there it is Wow look at the image the 2001 right above that to the one to the right of that look I never look at that and that's good makeup fuck yeah it is probably a little bit of CGI right it's still impressive no it's totally amazing that's crazy that that was 2001 that's right that's right so does that I feel like this was a totally different one than the one that was from like 2010 like almost like it was a reboot like I don't think they were the same probably I think this is I think that's true I don't think that said universe yeah I think it's a totally different thing wasn't this Tim Burton it was Tim Burton yeah yeah so this in this one Marky Mark comes to the future and finds the Planet of the Apes and the whole deal but in the next one the next reboot which was the James Franco one James Franco is a part of the actual medical experiments at turn Caesar Oh like a prequel yeah okay that's what it was there's been a lot of plan of the apes movies peoples are goddamn except there we are we are like really upset with chimpanzees I can't wait for the crossover with the Muslim Brotherhood movie I don't think they're gonna do that I'm gonna call agent Valerie Jarrett I think once they cancer the Conners that they died in the vine yeah in development hell yeah yeah that's what it is the so the the one that took place on 11 look at that for them okay yeah and then that one was the one where they explained Rise of the Planet yeah yeah they give them the injection and the chimp gets super smart and their eyes change color there's like remember his eyes turn blue which is racist that's racist you have to be blue eyed to be smart a lot fuck thank you I am blue I thank you appreciate you some to them right what are we talking about we got to Planet of the Apes look what I'm to Shaun Shamma Lamma ding dong he had a few highlights on you were talking about you know what one movie that he had that's good though that people don't talk about is devil that's when the elevator watching haven't seen it I enjoyed that yeah it's one of my Facebook banner pics it's me in front of the movie poster for devil yeah okay that was not bad yeah a few if you're looking for a dumb horror movie it's like fun though there was that I actually Chrissy Teigen I don't know who she is but she's famous she's got a lot of Twitter she's one of those ones that I couldn't recognize her I don't know I couldn't pick her out of a lineup and this Fame and this isn't a knock on her I just sank personally I don't know who she is but she's I'm out of the loop yeah she tweeted out you know after thinking all this time I'm gonna vote for the Democrats and I just retweeted I go yeah directed by M night Shyamalan there's a fucking twist ending I like Hollywood lady votes for Democrats after thinking all this time I've been thinking for a fourteen minutes yeah what does that mean I wouldn't think of all this time I I watched a few Candice Owen speeches and I'm not totally I'm just not sold did you know then Konya had some good points but I don't know did you see that Candice Owens and Tommy Lehren were getting into it on Twitter today no like a click two weeks ago I missed it was this big catfight really yeah it was hilarious would they say like Tommy's was subtweeting her she would use her name she goes oh you know blah blah blah blah blah and this is like Tommy , like you're jealous cuz your careers a disaster blah blah blah blah yeah it was it was beef but knock down the scenario yeah that's ostensibly Konya turned on Candace oh yeah Oh Kanye turned on Candace oh yeah he says I'm not involved and I'm not involved in politics anymore right how's that turning on Candace because she just her name in the tweets what he said he said Candace whatever I'll find the tweet if you want but so she was I don't want to speak for her but she launched this whole blessed thing and basically implied that he was involved in he's like I'm not I've been used by people in politics I'm not doing it well she went hard oh yeah they both are you gonna turn on Kanye now the ship was doomed to sink from the start but hunger for fame and money was placed over the movement funny how he was a free thinker in quotes before and now he's a traitor in quotes sounds a lot like a tactic of the left I like how she capitalized it yeah and yeah yeah you made your bed now lie in it I think she's late yeah well maybe not yeah maybe it's a double entendre laughs hmm maybe maybe be in factual Tommy I think I can expect on behalf of people on both sides of the political aisle and say we are sorry about your failed career that this is hilarious yeah he's saying this she's literally had a career in this for about eight months yeah and your failed career you know she used to run an anti-trump website a Daxing site you mean yeah yeah yeah the desperation to be relevant again by constantly subbing me and or attacking Kathy Griffin weekly make sure attack hasn't bode well for any movement grow up whenever anyone writes grow up I always hear it in Cartman's voice that Stella it's good is that it did they go out into the further I was I just won a little bit of back and forth yeah that's socially Owens went on the defense of Wednesday after West's rejected claims that he designed or created Alexa t-shirts what is blech said black/black likes it they should have called exit yeah like they mean the blacks are leaving the Democratic yeah why didn't they do that I don't you'd have to ask Candace and or Kanye and or Kathy Griffin yeah well I get they did it because of brexit you have a black sitter yeah yeah but that's not bad black exit yeah but blacks it is also black exit yeah it's called blaxploitation the movies right but exit is spelled e XIT and then EXI t it's actually better if you want to be sure precisely space Elling is better but in terms of how how it's said I think blacks it sounds lacks it I'd look what you have I don't think either you don't have to be a Texan you just keep exit in there and just BL the beginning of it and it works or it flex it also works let's I'm sure Candace think you're married to your idea of blacks it's needed to let it go you're a writer you know how to kill your babies I don't have any black visions no dating writing I'll kill your darlings kill your darlings I D is yeah yeah yeah blacks it's a shitty idea blacks it is worth that is it yeah brexit blex it they were right do you think that there's gonna be a lot of people black people leaving the Democratic Party I don't think so yeah no I think there's gonna be a few that recognize that it's a genuine pathway to attention and I think there's gonna be a lot of people are gonna sit home yeah as well African American there's a few listen there's a few on both sides of the aisle that are contrarians hucksters you know there's just two different types of course the contrarians are people that don't like the fact that they are being told that as an African American I have to vote Democrat and I have to lean left and they like fuck this you know I don't you don't tell me what to do and then they go that way I think we're getting a little bit of that from Kanye West and then there's people that recognize that there's there's a legitimate pathway to stardom to attention to you know you know it's just it's a career and being like reciting conservative talking points in African American oh yeah yeah yes there's I mean it's affirmative action yeah but it's and especially you if you can get a little juice on you know some sort of argument with some Tommy Lauren chick or any of these I always confuse her and Lauren southern they're very different I know but they're both hot they're both hot plates on that's all I say I'm not really paying attention what they're saying no they're said they well I don't think that's fair to Lauren how dare you what do you mean hi is Lauren the superior I'm not gonna I mean if I was it's not fair to Lauren so you mean Lauren is better than Tommy uh I think Lauren Tommy is very much someone who's there to have a standard Republican point of view which he does well and right is that Lauren is more of kind of a filmmaker and she's much edgy er I mean she's she went with Molyneux to Australia there was all this beef being about going Australia like they would they want to stop their talks right she's done she's going to South Africa to do work they want to set up everybody's talk someone stop Tommy's talks to they won't talk she's more controversial really lots more controversial yeah yeah yeah yeah she's very anti issues you know anti-immigrant she went to Europe to see the migrant camps so you're not gonna see Lauren really on these like mainstream outlets well I know Lauren was referenced what in a lot of the discussions that I was having with people on Twitter about people in South Africa who were farmers getting murdered right she had documentary called farmland says yes yeah yeah that was a weird one where people were getting angry at me and saying that I was reciting a racist conspiracy theory I'm like okay but this is a racist conspiracy theory that a black person was talking about in front of Congress I mean this is a black African guy talking about it on television in Africa the problems with farm murders you know and then there was that guy who is the the the one who wants reparations who's in South Africa who's a very controversial character who was he was kicked out of one of their organizations for doing a song singing about killed a boar yes he's doing it in making gun sounds and the audience is cheering around along with this song with gun sounds and it's about killing farmers the term conspiracy theory is a tactic that the press young people use to shut down conversation if you think about it Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy theory Bill Cosby was a conspiracy theory Kevin Spacey was a conspiracy theory everyone knew everyone and everyone kept their mouth shut yeah so the idea that a conspiracy theory is inherently false is itself inherently false and it's just the way to stigmatize the school of thought or an idea that you don't want to talk about well it's also labeling it as a racist ideology yeah that's true too yeah you you're immediately rate and they also it was because of Trump reciting it Trump had repeated it on television talking about something in in terms of the issue with South African farmers it's but it's one of those things that we were talking about before where even if they know that the narrative is not true it supports what they're trying to push right so they run with it and so I just think the other way doubling down I kept posting all these different things about it I was like well what about this guy talking about it what about this what about here's here's some instances of these murders and then there's the also the reality of South Africa in general which is extremely violent there's a lot of violence and there's a lot of crime and some of it has to do with the fact that these people that are in these farms are targets because they're out in the middle of nowhere and whether or not it's racist that they're going after them because they're white that's debatable but black farmers are also getting attacked it's not simply just white farmers there is some of that though but and there's some of them some of them are going after these farmers because they're white and this is the thing that's really disturbing is our people would people be happier if this is black people killing other black people like the Hutu and the Tutsis that was a big genocide yes and so yeah it's a problem when people are being killed regardless of their race right and tribalism cuts across racial lines but on the other side there was also some there's some legitimate claims to land that was stolen stolen during apartheid and that the people who are alive today who might not have been around during the stealing of that land are benefiting from the fact that they're they're living on stolen land like that's all legitimate as well so there's legitimate arguments in terms of like how the land was procured first place and how the person who's owning it today how they came to own it so there's it's it's complex it's very complex but it also has to do with this culture of violence in Africa in general right especially particularly in South Africa where there's a lot of poverty and you know these people who are out in these farms in the middle of nowhere yeah there are targets people don't what politics from both sides wants to teach us is that politics are never complex rights so if you have your little package and some things doesn't fit in that package you don't know what to make of it so you want to dismiss it because you then you're gonna have to do the work of reconsidering your assumptions and certainly don't discuss it publicly where you could be misconstrued or labeled as a racist right and I was looking at all these people labeling me as a racist I was like okay I see what you're doing but I'm just gonna keep posting these things because this is all what I'm saying is all being substantiated by a bunch of different people who are also black in South Africa like this this is a lot of what this discussion revolves around well and what Trump's done is had that word lose a lot of its meaning because like if you just throw that term around willy-nilly then at certain point it's like okay to the boy who cried wolf right and these and the term is a very broad term it's someone's grandma's prejudice and says I don't want my grandkids you know dating a black person that's not the same as advocating genocide and they're both racist but you can't regard them as synonymous and one doesn't necessarily leave you the other you know yeah it's the fact that racism I mean I think that racism is probably diminished somewhat would you agree with that in terms of like between now and say like when we were what year were you born 76 do you think from 1976 to 2018 racism in this country is diminished enormously don't you normally yes I think I I don't think it's exciting right so I don't really have friends who are like waspy white people I can't imagine a situation when people are hanging out and saying like racist things and everyone attitude yeah no but I mean I can't imagine the sitting racist thing everyone looking at them like they're not crazy right like it would just be so shocking yeah and I think 40 years ago that wouldn't be that uncommon it would happen I think there's also the reality of social media is that there are absolutely real repercussions for any sort of races out L yes anything you say anything that's any any outburst anything that you say that in in terms of like this you could if you're somewhere and you say something publicly that's racist someone could tweet that and it will ruin your life so we could post that on Facebook and it would ruin your life and I think that keeps legitimate racists from being as out with it which reduces racism overall because I think when less people are doing it it seems less culturally acceptable and then people change the way they think but it's also it's easier to be racist when you're only talking to people who are like you but if you're interacting with you from all over the world and you're like okay this putz guy's a putz but he's also putz like the people I know it's very hard to maintain that prejudice when you're seeing people who are acting similar to you because it's anonymous behind the screen if they turn out to be black it's like okay this guy's not different from me that's the difference between New York and Los Angeles is the fact that in New York everybody integrates with everybody on the street they're all acting together they're all getting on subways together they're in buildings together everybody's walking around together like it's all black and white and brown and yellow and everybody's together in LA man everybody needs in their cars and they go from cars to their houses they go for their houses to their work and there's a lot of segregation just in terms of people just not interacting with other people in a normal day-to-day commuter type situation my second favorite cities even better than New York about this which is Toronto because when everyone's walking on the street looks like the UN so it's like and they're very very integrated and very cool I love that city that's a great city yeah yeah it's too fucking cold yeah I've never been there in the winter so I've been there in the winter it's that bad okay it's fucking cold but but it's a really great city that's that was the last stop on my tour Oh before my Netflix special was Toronto I when you're in Toronto and you're from Brooklyn you are the coolest person in the whole city everyone I tell you like at least five or six people made a point to tell me like are you from Brooklyn oh I've been to Williamsburg and I'm like do you think this is like you mekka like there's a giant stone cube that you're all worshipping their onion and the Brooklyn pizza in Toronto is excellent I went in there being like you guys are assholes I try to go no excellent and oh speaking of innovation there's this restaurant there called the black hoof did you go no they take awful meat offa L organ meat and they make it all gourmet and amazing and I was there and like the creativity in every dish I was like holy shit this place is amazing Oh interests a great place there's a lot of great restaurants there it's just a great international melting pot like a legit melting pot and it's really funny for me as a troll because they're all passive aggressive right so you can poke their buttons and get them to lose their shit it's hard to do but when you get the Canadians freaking out it's really fun you're one of the rare happy intelligent well-educated successful people who also considers themselves a troll yeah yeah I guess that's pretty rare yeah cuz you do it with a smile on your face and in my heart yes there's a genuine playfulness to it yes right where where is a lot of people if there's a bitterness and resentment if someone doesn't agree with me or I don't agree with them or if I don't like their their music or their TV I wish them well I wish their family we'll just because we can't be friends doesn't mean something bad should happen you and most people can wrap their heads around that like if they think you're a different political person for me I want you to die it's like no I want you to be we'll just we don't to be friends and that's ok so it's fun fucking with people well my favorite one was talking about how Trump wants to build the wall in the south Hitler built the Berlin wall wake up people I don't I can't learn didn't rolled over a wall I'm like well he wrote about it in my comp it had the blueprints in it and they start argue for days they'll argue with me it's amazing well some arguments do go on for days I follow a few arguments and I'm not involved in and I'll just go and dip my toe and still going at like Christ don't you have shit to do yeah it's fun trolling people until also you just take into account the sheer amount of time and constructing these zingers and these these paragraphs and then and then googling the facts and then posting relevant studies and the fact that people just they'll they'll obsess on it you know they're not just obsessing about it when they're sitting right there restaurants talking to their spouse just twisting it up in their head and trying to figure out a way to win I don't argue with people really so if they come at me in the SPL what do you think about this I just go am I being detained like that's all I say and then that's it or I'll just say now and that's it why yeah but you like to fuck with them I do like to fuck with them why do you like to fuck with them is it because they're non player characters and you want to wind them up and have bouncing into the walls in a liquor store you don't have to visit it anymore that's part of it that could be part of it I think it's just it's it makes me it's funny to me how life is a great fun adventure you've more worn many hats in your life so if I write and you never know what's going to happen next and if you have this sense of appreciation and joy for it I think that's the best and right attitude if you take everything so some some if some blue checked asshole speaker myself on Twitter is wrong how does that affect you fine I'm an asshole what do you care so it's very funny to me how easily people flip their shit and this is the one how people who are marginally intelligent think they're brilliant and how quick they are to assume everyone around them is a moron hmm everyone is ignorant of 99% of human knowledge and just because someone's smarter than you doesn't mean they're gonna be right in an argument they might not have the access to data you have or they might not just not see something but people who are smart think they know it all it's like no you don't you know almost nothing and as do all of us yes that's a really good point most people know almost nothing about everything correct yeah and that's okay yeah does it make them bad people you don't know how to spell that's okay that's just such a great point because lack of information does not mean lack of intelligence and and but also a presence of intelligence doesn't mean presence of information right or a presence of information doesn't mean a presence of Intel correct yeah yeah it's this is why my show is misspelled it's called you're welcome while you are and people correct me but they're actually wrong because the first thing I say is I'm Michael malice and let this be your welcome so they're wrong in every level but they still got to jump in Kennedy just retweeted it out you're welcome you know and if people are correcting her I'm like don't you think maybe an author and Brooklyns Spelling Bee champion thank you very much when I thought yes I won Brooklyn I'm the jacket it fits now don't you think maybe I know the difference in your in your maybe what year were you what year was this 85 and you were Brooklyn and what no how old were you uh nine the the jacket still fits it fits now it didn't fit then I was too big yeah okay like I grew a little bit also they gave you a jacket they get a jacket and I'm just hating that you would fit into it eventually no everyone gets the same sized jacket cuz it's from lucky but maybe was ten it was fifth grade so it's like 10 to 14 one size fits all the deals so if you were a football player or if you were a nerd there's no football players in the spelling bee I should set a prejudice on your part against football player no I just I was there and none of the door I have them sure mmm there are no shoulders to be had no no okay there are no broad shoulders at the Madison Square Garden in 1980 what six or don't like that yeah wow you were in Madison Square Garden yeah that's what was Wow not really I mean it was a like a small part I guess yeah you know there's think the big part of mass in summer garden is like a small theater yeah yeah there's a smaller one in one theater in Madison Square Garden yeah there's a tiny one cuz we did my theater we did a theater really small recently where there was a UFC press conference and then away in and that was not that big that was that was that was that with Matt Hughes no okay no that was a different okay that was just last weekend and that was a tiny one I want to say looked like it was no more than maybe a thousand fifteen hundred people it seems small you know it seemed like a small little maybe it's called the hulu okay how many seats is that bad boy I want to say mm okay go at 2,000 cuz I've done the other one which is 6,000 5,500 is it really Wow that's not joke that's crazy so there's more than one theater though but there's the big theater and then there's more than one little theater or am I wrong I think so but the little one that you're talking about doesn't really come up because there's not tons of events at it right it's all the time man it didn't look like 5500 people it looked way smaller than that but still that's pretty dope when fucking spelling-bee it was a good champion yeah did you stick in an embrace face for a couple weeks afterwards they might have had a day in my honor at my elementary school Wow because I was the first one to ever do that Dane your arm the chicks look at you differently do you remember this uh no what's your recollection yeah have any effect it was still total disdain [Laughter] yeah does it help being on Fox News the chicks look at you differently because of that not in a good way here's the here's the problem when you're on TV and doing panels and things like that you're talking to women who are not only beautiful they're also extremely well-spoken and great conversationalist the percent of human beings who are good conversationalist is like 1% mm-hmm so it's very hard to date because it's like I don't care about Sheila in your office and how she's giving you headaches so it fucks you up and it's also hard to meet people because you know you you meet people in green rooms but it's hard for me to meet people day to day yeah it's tough this is hard out there for a pimp hand strong joke it's got to be hard for those gals too right yeah well no they could probably eat The Wall Street guys yeah but do they want to I mean if you're a super smart really articulate woman who's also has a career of her own and then you've got to pretend you're dumber than this dude because because you got to be smart and funny but you can't threaten his male ego hmm I mean they're I mean I'm impressed with so many of those women I mean because they got to look amazing and they're also funny and quick on their feet and in informed they've got the whole fucking that I have to ignore that Brees going in between their legs because it's not wearing any pants I've got to sit in the lecture once yeah it was one the great bucket list moments of my life yeah the lecture yeah yeah yeah my quads aren't points yeah FoxNews switched the fucking game didn't it when it comes to that yeah they can wear pants now well it's not just out I'm saying having really hot women talk about policy talk about employees yeah yeah yeah that was Rogers innovation and that's the big mistake I think they get a bad rap because it's like oh they're just bub like bubbleheads these women are not very smart ya know Kirsten Hagelin she she was Miss America she was on a lot of shows with me you win Miss America because of also being able to speak well it's not just how you look in a bathing suit these women are all type-a overachievers they're still having Miss America now but now they don't wear bathing suits right oh god this is one the jokes that got cut can I tell this year's I just sold it yesterday at Lucky said I was on Kennedy show and they were cutting the meeting suit from Miss Teen USA and I said can you ask the producers if it's okay for me to say Gemini Ramsey's spinning in her grave and candy goes know like it's like no so I couldn't say that joke it's good one I was in Dallas once and me and Joey Diaz and Duncan were there for stand-up and we're staying at this hotel and in the hotel they were having a little kid beauty contest and it was fucking twist oh yeah I'm talking like five six year old girls wearing high heels or paint makeup the full horror paint yeah full war paint yeah they look like drag queens it was so but it was just strange yeah it was like they were impersonating grown women right and it there's a and very sexualized right it's so creepy to see them little tiny girls a little tiny feet trying to walk around in stiletto heels right and bras and super yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's very weird fucking twisted man yes it's twisted is it do they look even more fucked up a person yeah then on TV yeah I'd never seen it in person before and then to be around them like you feel scared it's like I don't I've never seen this in your life I was fucking strange we were passing by this ballroom where it was going on so they were all milling out into the hallways and we were walking through and I was like this is fucking strange there were so many of them and you know and it's like these fat moms they look like what's that yeah mommy Juun that's what they look like they all like that they're all look strange and they have too much lipstick on and you know and they're wearing weird clothes themselves and they got their little kids dressed up like grown women it's like wow yeah it's upsetting and they're also and the thing is else but even if they're not wearing the makeup it's still extremely competitive and you're fucking with the kids emotions yes yeah and it's competitive in a way that you're basically just judging them on their physical presence and maybe some fuckin shitty singing yeah they're doing yeah it's it's it's and for what what are they tap dance or something were they doing this kind of stuff well that's even where she's a tween I think that was hilarious and this but these are real this is a real contest like this did their butt out that bat frosted hair good Lord just highlights for Mom yeah that's one of those weird traditions where people gonna look back in the future and they'll go what the fuck were people thinking do you know when I had her on my show Miss America ass or quiz at Miss America's there used to be a rule that I think was rule like 14 over 4 Miss America had to be of the white race whoa yeah until not that long ago really yep I made her home Ruben I think the 50s or 68 was it wasn't like the 20s no no no yeah and there was drama with Bess Myerson who was the first and only today Jewish Miss America what was the drama like she's Jewish I think they asked her to change her and asked her to change her name yeah this was what something maybe Smith something a little sin yes something a little less ethnic something white yeah yeah what year was that I I mean I think she's the forties I looked up Cheryl brown in 1970 was the first black Miss America after they abolished the rule that rule number seven that was instituted during the 1930s that contestants must be of good health and like a white race her name's brown - you can't change that name I mean that's her name it's what she is the whole package there she is Miss America it is this this time I mean I know you enjoyed chaos oh my love and you you enjoy you enjoy watching ships of fools crash into rocks oh yes you really do yeah so is this time fruitful for you oh my god this it gets better and better every day I wake up and I feel like I'm in the Smurfs village or something I'm so happy all the time but do you have any concerns that this is gonna go horribly wrong and we're gonna wind up in a nuclear war with Russia or nothing no no no I mean there were there many times when we could have been in nuclear war thrust during the Cold War never actually stop there these great stories about that like the submarine and of course the Cuban Missile Crisis I've no concern actually both Reagan and Gorbachev this is a great story of history independently were taken to the bunker and walked through and both of them refused to press the button even a simulation they both said if we get nuked we get nuked up nah fuck immortality and killing millions of people so I think this idea remember the that idea that Trump has his finger the nuclear button he's gonna be nuking people all the time it's like he's never gotten in a fistfight so it's gonna be you know it takes a lot to nukes you know what I mean the only country has ever nuked anyone was us let's remember that do you remember him threatening Joe Barden sort of Joe Biden him yeah and then he said I would knock out Joe Biden Joe Biden would go down fast and hard so he said I talked about in the beginning of my Netflix special because it was so ridiculous I was like I want to get in his ear try to make this happen like you're great at everything you'd be great at fighting do it in there bro don't let her talk watch she's making fun of your kids to old men like Trump and Biden fight ya to the death it would be amazing it would be amazing it probably the biggest pay-per-view event in the history the world of guy being well what's currently the biggest pay-per-view Manny Pacquiao Floyd Mayweather the first fight okay yeah this would clearly win yeah oh I saw these old guys go on it yeah they're so old to think back in Russia my motherland look at these guys is this in Russia this bad grandpa isn't it no this is real fight yeah there's a lot of that in Russia oh yeah that guy fell when he hit him and then the other guys like bitch I got to know he falls that's how Ruth Bader Ginsburg broke her ribs they don't talk about that yeah she fought with some other bitch yes so to my heart try to pull a knife on her all you have to do is have like movement guys got a good job but it's got no balance look whose hips are bad - Oleg kick this let's synchronize no like modern dance this is real old dudes guys got no shoes on - that's probably why he's doing better no she's grounded better I'm calling this fight like UFC yeah he's thinking about sucker-punched him with the right see see I saw that comment see I saw that right karate chop dude in the face oh but you see the guy tightening up with that right side you gotta be real careful when you see a guy moving funny with the right is that car looked like it was a Kia I think it said mmm do you know where this is that man just had like a European man statue yeah this has gotta be some some European country mmm there's a Twitter account like something only in Russia and it's just Russian shit I look at him like fuck this is my jeans oh yeah you got crazy jeans man them Russian people have done some wild shit it's like dance odors joke about Russians of the scariest white people it's he that's his joke he has it's all bit he goes uh I moved to bed I'm gonna butcher it cuz I'm not a professional comedian like Dan but he goes you know I moved to this bad neighborhood and I figured out what to do he goes someone came up to me he's like yeah I'm on the fucking with fuck he doing he goes you think this is a bad neighborhood and he goes I just put on a Russian accent I was scared erase like Russians are the scariest of my people they're definitely not regular white people and the women are the worst are they Russian women yeah they will fucking cut you and laugh at your bleeding whoa they're merciless my mom my grandma they would do not fuck around they're from the old country what about Russian woman that you encountered today they're worse because they're liberated so they're there they're ruthless though they're very hot crazy in the head crazy in the bed yeah but I can't do it I can't do it well that band that the documentary was the Pussy Riot yeah yeah yeah those bitches are loked I got a pussy free Pussy Riot t-shirt I don't even know what they did wrong but some wearing that shirt yeah yeah that's that it's ballsy to criticize Putin oh yeah that is my don't give your a band or you're a journalist like whatever you're doing that guy has killed a lot oh yeah and laughs about it yeah yeah you know the Super Bowl ring story no you don't know I want to hear this Oh fine google it so I don't fuck up the stats cuz Sturgill Simpson actually told me this the there was a Super Bowl winner who visited Putin and as he's talking to Putin Putin asked him to see the ring he's got the Super Bowl ring and Putin holds onto it puts on his finger walks away and then the guy starts going head about in Putin's bodyguards would put their hand on the garlic no it's over oh my got your fucking ring sandy Wow we have just given out our rings I showed sandy my ringing he said while she show it to the president I shouted to him and he put it on and he sort of enjoyed it so he kept it on he's his version of it there there's a version of it in an actual article that's more detailed or he talks about how they you know he asked for it back and they were like no here's what happened the other thing is how he trolled Angela Merkel you know this story no Angela Merkel is a head of German Chancellor Germany she's terrified of dogs so he brings out his giant like black lab which are the sweetest breed and this photos look up Merkel Putin dog and she's sitting there terrified to look at it and the dog sniffing her it's like a lab and he's just sitting there fucking laughing like an asshole he's like oh I didn't know she was scared of dogs like how many world leaders are you bringing your dog out to meet other than her and the body language on her yeah look at her she's freaking the fuck out dogs either by the way at a lab come on yeah fucking weird look at her she's like yeah no it's quite far now that was so funny yeah he's an asshole he's um it's it's very strange what he's been able to do oh yeah did you see the assassination attempt with a guy drove into his car full clip changed lanes on the highway and and went into the oncoming lane into the fast lane on the other side full clips slammed into his car and killed his driver but he wasn't in the car oh my god no oh it's why it's wild it was an assassination attempt and they just didn't know that he wasn't in the car but the fact they were able to cut through the lane yeah get into the center where you know they're there they have access to the oncoming lanes and pick his car right out of all the cars it had to be coordinated with someone right cuz there's got to be a motorcade right because well there oh yeah here Wow oh that's it already oh just keeps running it by oh but just do it from the beginning I the beginning wasn't well there's a better version of it then there's a better version of it out there and the better version of it you see the guy change laughs oh yeah and slam in and had to know that that's where his car was killed him killed the driver but Putin was not in the car but it was Putin's car he's magic well he just knew probably something was up I mean he must have a bunch of people feeding him information on all the cars and how many SAS nation attempts have there been on that guy well I mean what about the assassination of some on the president's that we don't hear about both Obama and Trump there have been plenty really yes like what ones you look at I mean they just Trump yes yes of course cuz they don't want to talk about it mmm is that he's the victim and it's and also you don't want to give these people attention in all fairness so I think that's a good news to be like all right let's not talk about this yeah like you don't want to talk about when terrorist attacks are foiled because then they'll know okay this doesn't work we're gonna try it a different way so that's smart of the press I think hmm yeah but I mean he's been able to run Russia for a long time oh yeah I mean he had his number there was like Teddy Roosevelt and Taft he had his number two there was term limits he goes you're gonna be President I was like okay I'm done now I'm gonna be back in because like okay here you go mr. Putin but that's what's crazy as he got back in in there breeze like okay and his approval rating so like seventy percent something crazy there's some huge number the Russians love them do they love him or do they say they love him because they're scared no Russians love aggression we love someone who is nasty and an asshole why is the assassination attempt on Donald Trump bigger news what was the assassination uh a twenty year old man in Vegas pulled a gun from a Las Vegas police officer and tried to do I don't know it got a rally that guy yeah boy don't tase me bro end of his life I mean that I mean that's come on twenty years old probably you know from Britain I think and yet overstayed his visa or something Wow crazy what's did he Trump just giving a talk and there was a with Trump and so there was a boom and he goes you missed he allegedly tried to pull gum from the holster of the police officer Trump rally in Las Vegas on Saturday he was arrested and later torold Secret Service that he had driven to the event from California and had been planning to kill the candidate for a year so this is before he was president or maybe a 2016 June June yeah so a few months before the election but this there's been other attempts on him mr. president yeah this other one says Isis attempt but this is from The Daily Beast so I don't know well they're not gonna be Pro Trump's if they're saying and I'm sure that's on the truck yeah well it's crazy that he wanted the job well it's scary for I mean and I mean look at Gabby Giffords in Arizona I mean I I'm don't believe in voting but she had this tweet about like how she went on voted and I couldn't think of a better Pro voting argument that she kind of like look you know you don't believe in voting now I just yeah what does that mean I don't believe in voting what do you mean I don't think it's I don't do it I don't I'd never read an article about it for the Guardian I just don't think it's legitimate voting democracy and what were in anyway like the idea that I flick a switch and someone gets to talk to me for four years talk for me for four years doesn't make any sense what do you think the alternative should be freedom if I want a someone to speak for me I'll hire them and the idea that me and my neighbors have to be locked into some polity because we're geographically close to each other is landline technology in a post cell phone world so how do you think things should be run you organize based on how who you want to line with on any given context like I'm aligned with Macy's when it comes to my clothes and I'm aligned with you when it comes to talking you don't have to have one guy speak for you for abortion and for the borders and for taxes I mean I don't believe in any of that stuff this is a very old old model well I agree that it's a very old model but the problem is we don't have any other one sure we do because then what are the other one ninety-nine percent of our interactions are voluntary and you aren't you come together with people as you need to and then you go your separate ways then it's very very dynamic so this idea that you're stuck with this person because a lot of people like him for four years and they speak for you it makes no sense to me it does not make sense but it's also we feel like we need some sort of representation of us if you're gonna have some sort of a summit with a guy like Putin sure or someone Kim jong-un or whatever it is whoever it is someone needs to speak for us sure right and I mean in a sense that is a reaction but the point is I don't vast majority of people in this country not have asked a lot of people say Trump's not my president he doesn't speak for me right and they have a right to say that and the idea that just because someone was a contest therefore he's the boss of me what do you think about voting when it comes to legitimate concerns like raising the speed limit reducing taxes doing this doing that like fixing roads like certain things that we need to get done I don't I don't do it I mean that makes more sense to me because it's a direct representation but even that shouldn't be up to majority rule I mean people who understand the dynamics of speed limits in cars should have an informed say rather than right but then there's influence by insurance companies and this is why rates this is why things change I didn't laws sure but insurance companies are the ones who have the campaign's to force people to vote one way or another it's gonna be one right one side's gonna have much more like marijuana laws you know all these the tobacco and alcohol companies trying to make sure that marijuana is not legal and all these this propaganda you have because they don't want competitors when you rather have people behind and drunk like if dad's coming home from work I'd rather he had a joint than a six-pack I mean the and yet historically it's just cuz outcalls been popular that's what's legal it makes no sense no drug driving versus driving stoned I mean one guy's going to slow the other ones you know well one's guy is probably paranoid too and check every mirror checking that bag actually cool drive slower slow down keep it together right yeah yeah I don't I don't think that the system that we have now is great but to just not participate at all well I do participate obviously if I'm a public figure and I'm talking rise participating so just discourse she's yet to some extent yeah I mean I don't think the idea that you're flicking a switch means you're actually making a difference I think if you're doing something in secret once every four years you're not actually participating that's something people like to tell themselves it's like getting a communion wafer do you think that it's are camped also to have this timeline of four years and especially when it comes to like registering to vote I think that's the most archaic thing ever that you have to go somewhere to do it I mean while you have a driver's license if you're driving around you have a driver's license if you have a driver's license you should be able to vote sure well necessarily have euro citizen no because you have to be a citizen to get the and if your citizen yeah and your what do you think about criminals that's a hot topic I think that there should be more if you've done your time yes for nonviolent crime right I think what I'm really excited about what happened in politics this week was Jeff Sessions getting fired because he's when let me this is one of the reasons I hate the press when Kim Kardashian went to the White House they all cloned her Kim Kardashian saved the lady's life yeah she saved someone's life so unless you save a life shut the fuck up you can let went to the White House to talk about prison reform and to talk about people who are innocent in jail right now and she brought the case to Donald Trump mandatory minimums and you tell that lady's family we saw the footage of them crying you tell no haha Kim Kardashian Kanye West when he went to the White House he talked prison reform he said people who are not viable habla the point is it would be the greatest thing for freedom ever if the Republican Party the tradition in law and order party were in a position to be more liberal about prison sentencing because a lot of people don't need to be in jail even if they need to be punished right and when you send someone to jail they're gonna be terrorized and raped I mean if someone's dealing weed is that really appropriate so sessions was one of the big opponents of this he's not he thinks marijuana and heroin are basically the same so if he's gone this is a great opportunity for both parties to work together and a lot of these people do not need to be in jail and it's expensive as fuck yeah I I couldn't agree more he also said something that was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard good people don't smoke marijuana that's really like have you done a survey like what the fuck what are you talking about but he lives in some 1950s Norman Rockwell painting but in even in 1950s there were good people who smoke marijuana Jack Kerouac is a good person but so I'm saying it's like he lives in an idealistic portrayal of life not life itself but it's an such a blanket statement yeah which is usually a fan of but yeah like fuck you well he was an asshole a long time ago I mean that guy has been a piece of shit for a long time if we go back and some of his choices and some of his decisions what decades ago he was thought to be too creepy for the Supreme Court he was thought to be too creepy for politics he was thought to be I mean he's a scary guy well now he's gone thankfully so my some people are supporting him like the president forced him out good that's the best endorsement of Trump I fucking heard and what's amazing is like different states the Republicans supposedly for the last whatever decades were for states rights let's every state decide they can compete we had that with marijuana legalization some had full-blown some had medicals some had none this is how the mall supposed to work and sessions was the one who's like even though it's still ostensibly illegal at the federal level it says sessions like fuck you federal overrides we're gonna have these raids yeah why leave them alone let them decide in the state level like you said that but they never did it right i I know pushback by Trump good I know Obama actually did yeah have some raids it's just the same like you were part of the choom gang in fight in high school or college right yeah he did have some raids during his administration I was on a grand jury duty and I talked the whole jury to let people off about uh marijuana stuff because I'm like you don't have to indict on this like why why you want to ruin someone's life what was the jury about no you have a bunch of cases you know so and I can't get all specific but I was like people are very from all walks of life a very receptive the idea of when you think about what jail means mm-hmm it's so fucked up and people just like what someone does something wrong he should be punished even if someone should be punished the idea that that punishment should be jail is not the same thing right and if someone's not a wouldn't wouldn't be better if they had house arrest for example why do you need them to be terrorized and locked in with a roommate I don't want a roommate well not only that a roommate who's also locked in a cage yeah yeah and only around other males ya know it's dark and you know it goes back to what you're talking about early about empathy yeah and how important that is and about how easy it is for people to just dismiss people right you know what they call today the cancel culture like people just want things canceled and just one thing shut him down right get rid of them force them out fire them take away his thing take away his gig I mean and then you know put him in jail like this to put him in jail thing to me it's like here's a big one taxes like if you don't pay your taxes that put you in jail support yeah like there was this meme I saw where like a woman doesn't pay child support she gets the government she gets an apartment if a guy doesn't pay child support he goes to jail yeah yeah and you can't earn any money probably you're in jail how all that money when you get out who is that helping yeah and it's gonna help some of their dad's jailbird now is it because the resources aren't available to force the person to pay like there's not another so they try to make the punishment as terrible as possible so that you you motivate them to pay sure but at a certain point it's like it's I don't think it's conscionable to really be sending a jail is so bad it really needs to be someone who's a danger to the society if they're walking around I agree I agree um and again even though Martha Stewart model I would be so much happier for a lot of these people were just locked in their house yeah why do they need to go to jail yeah but afterwards I mean she had an ankle bracelet like why is that like once you start asking those questions what would really matter for you if it's an ankle bracelet or if they're in jail would it matter you've put them on some Island you know and they couldn't do that and then people don't even think of those terms well because you lose your humanity once your criminal it's like you're not a human being right and and it's like it's it's wait and wait and there's a joke that like a conservative as a liberal who's been mugged and a liberal is a conservative who's had interactions with the law it's like once you interact the law my friend Eliza Orel and she's a public defender she's great it's like it's really easy once the Eye of Sauron is on you and you're a criminal shit goes out the window really fucking quick and it's very scary right and there's people that are prosecutors that are trying to win right they're trying to win a case and that's what their job is their job is not to make sure that everything is being done correctly I mean that you're being represented accurately and that no no the the job is there's a case the cases against you you're on trial win the trial right that's my job it's a game and it has to be their job yes well it becomes a game I mean that this is the problem that I've said with law enforcement period when cops see people they think of those people as a possible arrest right and there's a game and they've been lied to by so many you're a cop you're dealing with people all day long that are lying to you you meet some new person you automatically assume they're lying to you as well right and then things get weird there's a great video called cooperate with the police and it was like a law professor I believe and he had the cop standing right next to me told the cop anything I say that's wrong please jump in correct me and his broad point I'll just summon it quickly is you can't talk your way out of an arrest but you could talk your way into one so he's like do not ever talk to them just say thank you I know you're doing your job but I can't cooperate until I have an attorney present because there's no upside and there and they'd say to you explicitly anything you say can and will be used against you if like hey Joe can I borrow that screwdriver I can and we'll use it against you no you cannot borrow my screwdriver I need my eyes yeah the ultimate legal case public legal case or one of the ultimate ones is Julian Assange oh yeah that's a weird he hasn't seen sunlight in months yeah no internet access no internet access yeah and they're trying to kick him out now Ecuador what are you gonna go if he goes he's gonna they want him what Sweden they want him they want him in Britain and I don't think they've been charges filed against him here yet technically but I'm sure they they want his head in a platter but of what they want him for so preposterous it's so nice it's like I wanna be frights just got Capone yeah it's like yeah axe evasion instead of being a mobster right yeah but it's it's interesting because I would think that someone like Trump who is such a conspiracy minded person would actually like Julian Assange because I'm sure there's been a mean I don't know what he's ever said in the past I think he's anti he was anti WikiLeaks from the start no but he said things about Julian Assange that were anti my understanding yeah that's because there was something to Julian Assange tweeted my friend Cassandra Fairbanks she's a big support of him and she's like well there goes the idea of clemency or a pardon oh really yeah Trump tweeted or no Julian I think yeah yes a piece of praise a virtual prisoner yeah it's like where's that end yeah it's not gonna end well he can get visitors though no I don't Canada Anderson oh that's right yeah but they may have taken that away anyway I wonder how long he could stay there that it's been years years it's been years yes yeah yeah to be in one building yeah and he doesn't go outside anymore he can't they won't let him I don't think that I don't think he ever could we're on the balcony okay now I know he doesn't have sunlight that I'm positive that's terrible yep do they give him vitamin D at least no yeah I don't know I don't know I mean he's awfully pale to begin with but if you don't get vitamin D like you can get really sick well that's what they do in North Korea they get their skin starts falling off that's been there since June 19th of 2012 that's six years whoa whoa Christ how much almost six and a half years June how much solitaire can you play mmm and you don't even have internet anymore here's an internet for how many months as I'm looking at time honestly I want to say it's about in about four or five months it's been a while long time eight months for the second times October 2016 fuck who the hell's over at WikiLeaks still running shit yeah the intern who's hanging in there you know god that's crazy look how does that one play out I mean they're they're they're really what they're doing for sure when we talked about punishment being a deterrent in certain situations that is absolutely a deterrent oh they're making an example of him closer oh yeah oh yeah where's Chelsea Manning's out now she just had her surgery what surgery though her transcender she good yeah that one there she tweeted out I have I have a vagina okay yeah well there you go yeah she's out she's out she's out hobnobbin and maybe using that thing I met her as she came to an event she's very nice I'm sure but she's out she's out she's been out for Alabama pardon her could be in her sentence he's locked away forever in the embassy and then there's Snowden who's also hiding right in Russia right what and actually a lot of these yeah holla hmm after almost a decade of fighting through prison the courts a hunger strike and through the insurance company I finally got surgery this week not lasik apparently Oh wearing glasses folks know he's gonna be in Russia Prague forever you know and a lot of these farmers from South Africa that's where they're going Russia yeah Putin's letting them in really yeah so they better learn how to write those R's backward pretty quick oh right they got weird ours yeah yeah well you have to learn the whole the whole language and just a weird arse Russians got a lot of weird ones we do we got a yeah barely literate in Russia the letters look fake all letters are fake but they were very alien language you know ones like so many writing something that's from some piece of metal from a spaceship like Snowden is he's fucked too right I mean he can't even be public in Russia yeah yeah I'm not sure about him I know I know Assange I've been following Snowden he's deep under I mean they must know where he is though I mean there's nowhere the intelligence community is doesn't have a fucking full line on exactly where that guy is about that is the big question do they know all this stuff or are they incompetent and there's examples of both directions yeah I've gotta think they know where Snowden is like you I can't well I mean Glenn Greenwald talks to him all the time lingers in Brazil yeah that was how clean we're all kind of made his name I think who's also a great lefty you know gets it a lot yeah yeah um it's just how does that guy go on like is he just in hiding getting his restaurants you know I go sneaking in like March buses how does he get around yeah I don't know and who was he getting some money from he's got a food right what does he do for food yeah a lot of borscht fuck I just looked him up the Google is like kind of broken here's an example of it it says when did he die and then it just highlights a date and it doesn't say he's not dead mm-hmm so Snowden flew to Hong Kong where he was staying yeah but that was part of his whole trip he had to go through it he'd this whole journey through a bunch of countries yeah I think they attacked him in Thailand or something at some point it is weird it's like is that guy just that's him forever that's that's what he does who Snowden yeah I mean he just has to hide I I think so or maybe he's safe and Russia and Putin's having him there as a fuck you to us yeah I mean it must have something to do with it the Putin's deciding to do this yeah Putin wouldn't do it unless it's some advantage to him yes just it's just strange you know strange these things just these floating like a den like little chapters so these stories they're just you know we all know about what they don't get resolved well right there yeah yeah yeah and it's just thinking I mean this is why I talk about North Korea all the time since I've been there everyone's still there everyone I met and like think about six years a song she's been in that one building six fucking it's it's so and all the people in jail also who have been jail for six years just a we can't wrap our heads around that six fucking year think about what you were six years if you don't think of where I was six it's not just that like six years and things are deteriorating right they want him out of the embassy he's got nowhere to go if he leaves he gets arrested he doesn't have any internet yeah can't see sunlight knowing that the most powerful people in the world we're doing everything they can to fucking put you in jail for life and you're kind of already are in a sense I can't see it Julian Assange is never in the rest of his life probably gonna be able to like take a jog around a park like ever no never we're like walk a dog yeah it's over it's it's scary and the thing is a lot of this shit that almost all the shit that he put out is true you know that's what's crazy it's like he's doing what journalists should be doing instead of getting up in the press corps and just pitching a fit yeah but it is there's real repercussions for doing what he did and that's what they're letting us know yeah and they're letting us in the morning matter what the law is like what are you getting them for secret sex or surprise surprise yeah what all right his Twitter account says he's the president of something called freedom of press which is a website and Twitter also of the same name and they tweeted this out a couple of days ago that story I'd never heard of it says in the latest case in the Trump administration's cracked down on leaks Natalie Edwards US Treasury employee was arrested in charged with giving suspicious bank records involving Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort and Rick gates to a news outlet in the legal complaint the Justice Department cited word-for-word conversations he allegedly had with a reporter over an encrypted messaging app the government claimed it got a hold of her phone and with it her encrypted messages with a reporter now she faces prison time all reporters should be using apps that make all their messages disappear yeah like signaling what's that it yeah that's what he's this website yeah but even then someone can take screenshots no I think something you can't it's disabled automatically really yeah but you could take a picture of your phone with another phone obviously what signal yeah my friend whose dude knows more than anything I know but in res security you signal I can turn signal and secure job and so what is signal what do you do with signal basically it's it's encrypted so if you send messages to me like they before you could set it to vanish at a certain time and I can't do a screenshot Oh interesting yeah hmm and it's it's it's not hackable apparently it's the best one it's the more it's the better version of whatsapp what else Michael well I've discussed we can talk about well exactly 33 o'clock we could talk about my book when it comes out that's coming up yeah when's your book May 14th what's a call to the new right the new right then you right yeah what's the new right then you right arms a nice way of saying all right they're included in that yeah I was Charlottesville and I interviewed some Nazis for it what was that like interesting how stupid were they I know not that's the big myth really these people are effective cuz they're bright it's like anybody get 90% what what the Nazis any trial it's velour bright and then in a hold on any population you can have ninety percent eighty it's ten percent so there are people in that group who are sophisticated this is why they're getting traction sophisticated but fucked up correct okay so evil geniuses I like to refer to myself as an evil genius I know that I want to be lumped in with that term but yeah I mean and I mean they're dangerous in that sense yeah obviously that they are intelligent manipulative and right and the thing is right and as as soon as they start talking you see them as human beings it's very hard to dismiss people and their ideas and if the press won't talk about those ideas and sweep them under the rug and they're saying things you've never heard before right away there's an element of intrigue well the right is such a dirty word now the right like just saying it's always been a dirty word but it's way dirtier now that it's ever been before no no no in the past it was much worse well maybe in my lifetime I should yeah but they mean that there's a vested interest on the part of the corporate press to make it a dirty word because then it's like well all the good people are on the left and then you have to do any persuading do you think that that's a strategy or - it really what would evidence do you have the points to it being a strategy because if you have news articles they will always use the term far right as a pejorative they never use the term far left that's true it's a complete asymmetry and today for sure and different countries you'll have all these nationalist movements and they're always referred to as far-right which is not accurate because they're usually moderates when it comes to things like social security or government spending they're just on one issue nationalist but they're far-right right so that's a way to kind of lump them in with the Nazis and in many cases they aren't at all Nigel Farage is an example of this hit when he took over you Kipp and the whole British independence movement he fought against though not the white supremacists because they wanted to tie together because no no that's not we're about and this was one of his big accomplishments and doesn't get ever getting credit about this well he's just so inexorably connected to brexit yes all anybody thinks about him is racism right that's by intent yeah well it's just it's also just convenient sloppy lazy thinking by a lot of people right it's just too many things to pay attention to right you know and if you just all brexit bad well that's it racist the definition of a racist is something that a progressive doesn't like or someone who's racist or someone who's racist so they're they're using these two things interchangeable right that is a problem that's the problem that you can love I remember when alt used to be all used to be like nerds used to be all left he used to be like alternative music all comedy all this but like Sonic Youth people don't say that anymore like even in comedy they don't use to term all rooms but all comedy was a thing yes but now people stopped using it that's all right yeah they just used the UCB like oh we're going to UCB they don't say I'm going to these alt rooms but sometimes people do refer like it sometimes there's like a little bit of residual leftover or some sometimes comics will still use that word but alt if someone said oh he's alt you would owe to automatically assume they were like really low-key left-wing progressive that was alt now alt is alt right we're like racist Nazi you know Milo well the the NPC script is all right like if a person is to the right of Hillary Clinton then execute all right dot exe and you just give them the whole speech yeah so it's it's uh it's I mean the discourse in this country is completely collapsed and I love it why do you love it though that this course is come on because my rights are enough for discussion let alone a vote so whenever people sit down and have a talk about my life and freedom it's gonna end badly for me so if people can't talk to each other about this maybe we'll go our separate ways and live peacefully so you'd rather not talk about it and just go peacefully is that what you're saying yeah someone's political opinions and preferences should have as much impact in my life as their sexual preferences you want to fuck dudes you want to have a threesome I don't I care if you're my friend and that I'm interested but it's not gonna impact me and it shouldn't impact me and same thing with the oh you want more welfare great go live your life that way instead of it becoming some shouting match on your front door and and exactly yeah instead of you and your buddies coming up and scare the shit out of my kids yeah I mean know what I mean very few people deserve that I was gonna say no one but very few people deserve that yeah so the disengaging from political discourse as a strategy for just overall civility but also worsening political discourse on purpose to make it so that people can't actually form coalition's and get anything done but it is amazing how personal people take other people's opinions on things it's crazy yeah it's like the people JIT you know what it is like when you're dating and you think oh this this girl likes the same kind of music I do so we're going to get along that is a very weak correlation yeah and there's lots of people who are right-wing who are good people and there's lots of people who are left-wing who are good people and there's lots of people who are right-wing who are bad people there's a very weak correlation between this it's a cultural signifier you probably came from the same culture because people just take the culture of where they grew up with but if you're gonna just dismiss entire schools of thought just because they vote differently from you is it as a personal level that's you're missing out a lot of quality people I couldn't agree more we should probably end up with that tell me about your book when's it out may may may 14th 29 okay well that's a long time for me come back on again yeah I love it I love you Jeff you should let me do a buddy thank you all right bye everybody [Music] [Music]
