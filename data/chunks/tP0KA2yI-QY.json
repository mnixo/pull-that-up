three two one boom and we are live with El Guapo as he tries to navigate his phone with his left hand what did you punch with you right now a table a table that I was stronger than me like yeah this ice table our city go why did you punch a table okay so I was in three states in six days I slept four hours per night I just came from Chicago and this whole thing I had to get up at 4:00 and then I had to shoot a commercial shoot for my body action system starting at 10:00 and this happened at 10:30 p.m. so I was 12 and a half hours in and I already said okay yo I'm not gonna do it anymore because I could retain information anymore I had some nice two lines to remember your day were feeding me lines I couldn't do it anymore I said I this is it like III stopped but then I said yeah but if you can do this little thing okay I'll try that one more time and of course you did it work and I said you know what show up my phone my gloves and somehow this is how stupid you are you throw up your globe and two seconds after I took it off I hit the table somehow I still needed to hit something and I decided to do it without a glove instead of a solid thing guess what's gonna lose my pinky knuckle and they incapacitate your entire arm for that pretty much I think just for a pinky knuckle they call it a boxing fracture yeah this these yeah these two are like that's like the old-school bringing us back to karate Kombat old-school karate days I would always recommend that you punch like this you know what I did and I know and I was going to do that but the amount of force that was using at this moment I really fast in milliseconds and you had to go say it's better to spread out the impact even more because I was because you're hitting it so high yeah I knew I was gonna break the big one too if I would do it oh yeah it was just one of those marbles and five seconds because I hit boom they look at me everybody's freaking out and I go nuts over just you don't paint I said no pain but it's broke he said how do you know I said that's me I can't feel it so I was right away I was calm again everything was good nobody died they know that right arms been through hell it been and you know this for me to lose cool like that that happens once every five years or so but I get angry I never get angry I don't have that not that kind of anger that I hit something I mean how old am i right if you go like that stuff you do seem to always be a happy guy that's what I am but I think it's also because I'm happy so when it gets angry that's what the fights that's what always happens I'm nice nice nice nice nice nice nice try to defuse it then I realize wait a minute and then I'm asking them I say you know you don't think I'm afraid right I said I'm doing this for you I'm protecting you right now that's why I don't want to fight and at the moment you say that you know some of them call your bluff and then because he did it for such a long time yeah then much spa smash yeah but those are the old Boston those all buzz there's no more more normal bust like this I like that actually and III don't think it's a healthy buzz either how was your arm doing in terms of like the atrophy is it growing back back yeah it gets a little bit bigger now I have this new stuff that I'm trying I have it at home I need bacteriostatic water for it it's a peptide called BP c 157 did everyone else yeah Ben Greenfield told me about that it's great for tendons and ligaments and stuff yeah even nerves and regrows apparently everything in rats I mean they regrow tendons everything and I'm gonna try I'm gonna try it locally here on the bicep see what it does as soon as I have the water so it seems like the muscles are growing back though like slowly but surely - yeah it's a GU 25 pounds I can do eight times now bicep curls but you're right that's a lot better than it used to be though I couldn't do five hearts yeah not once Pat Miletich is the same thing same thing from his neck you know what you want to hear how crazy Pat's injury was Pat's disc had deteriorated so badly that his discs fused themselves he didn't realize that he didn't even realize it his discs fuse themselves he went to the doctor and they're like well we don't have to fuse infused itself well you can if you talk to him and he looks at you it's like he hasn't fused next right he's always like Batman yeah so I guess grappling man I know they'll blame it on on punching and kicking but all Danny's injury everything my rib that was out my last that's all wrestling is grappling the wrestling wrestlers are all fucked up we were talking about Kurt Angle yesterday it was an Olympic gold medalist fantastic wrestler I mean he's got a neck that literally is like the size of my waist but it's his neck so fucked up both of his arms are tiny and you can see the atrophy in his arms like his his arms don't match his neck oh yeah and you could tell like you mean obviously you know yeah than anybody about neck injuries guys always like their arms shrink yeah because they get atrophy cuts off the nerves Gael manage it so with image both weights then yeah well it looks we should pull up that picture again Jamie see if you could find it this is Ronda Rousey's Instagram you could see it I saw him at the induction at the International Sports all the famous yeah for Ronda was there as well and he was sitting first row but I II was wearing a suit of course I couldn't tell ya well he still looks like a tank yeah his fucking neck is ridiculous it's so big but like look at this what happened that's us that's great yeah see look at his arms oh wow yeah see the size of his neck I mean his neck it looks like his arm should be as big as his fucking legs yeah he just is I mean the guy's been through hell but look at the fucking size of his neck have you seen a neck like that crazy that might build a lot of muscles around it I guess well yeah it's all fucked up it's been fused and as yours right yeah for this fusion front and back well one splint you know it it opens it up and then the other ones are fusions and I have a friend of mine who has five and he can't move like I look with me I have mobility he can't do this again look to the side a little bit yeah I was talking to a buddy of mine about a mutual friend of ours and I didn't realize that he had done this but he had went to Germany and got his whole back fused his whole back is completely rock-solid whew still you know as that do who I was looking at for him in the hospital Don Frye Frye has a ten disk fusion this guy died twice on the operating table he had infections the walls were broke everything man I was in his hospital he had he lost a lot of weight he had a big beard and he said check this out he stood up and from his butt crack all the way to above his shoulder blades one big zipper oh oh damn this fusion turn your back that's fucking crazy how many do you think are in there Jamie I 13 I go you know 15 16 so there's one disc hanging in there Jesus Jesus take me one one disc it's gotta go what they say with fusions if you have a fusion then the disc below or above I'm gonna be next they say because it has this 3308 Bravo has an artificial disc they put artificial discs in now these are I wish I had that masks I couldn't do it at the time yeah yeah if I said the early but Eddie's got no problem with it at all it moves great but that's what I mean because for me I can't do it anymore maybe future you know with the printing that they do now is a 3 3 D printing maybe they can make an exact copy of my spine and then they can still do in there it will be something but that's a scary not to cut your spine out put a fucking titanium one in my one of my oldest daughter just don't be my ex-wife she's gonna have to do it at the lower back she's like two or three fusion isn't gonna need to do but she's gonna do this great placement this wall yeah yeah yeah disc replacement is legit now you know what Braulio Estima Brazilian Jujitsu by very famous jujitsu guy he's got one in his neck he was the first guy that I ever heard about it he fucked his neck up really bad and then won the world's with a fucked-up neck and then right after the worlds went and got it operated on wait what did he do because he's from Brasilia he did it in Europe cuz he lives he lives in England do you ever need will be a I would let the Germans look at my leg they're really good for advanced yeah well you know we got really fucked up with during the Bush administration they they put a ban on all stem-cell research you know they kind of like halted the brakes on funding stem-cell research which is really a shame because now we're realizing stem because they were leads to think that stem cells had to do with babies like fetuses they were thinking people were going to get abortions just so they could use the stem cells but now they realize that mesenchymal stem cells and adults kept stem cells are some of the best and one of the things they're doing in America now is sucking fat out of people taking liposuction and then using the stem cells from your own body to to proliferate injured areas I did a two weeks ago for my knees did you know but yeah I have no fat though so good you have to take it out of my head bone you know they drill a hole in there they take the Mara he had to take the bone marrow and it's unfortunate because in the fat apparently have five times more the amount of stem cells then you have in the bone marrow so people out there that are fatter pump to hear that like got a store of medicine that's like that gap but never got injured even if he did he wouldn't know yeah what is that guy doing these days I have no clue I know he wrote a book it was the last time we had on the inside every way oh you guys had him on yeah I mean that's five years ago that guy my guy was a fucking character I mean if it wasn't for guys like tank Abbott I mean there would have been no early days yeah you know you needed a guy like that yeah that's a fight with him that's a lot of these crazy guys out there so you can do it I can do this yeah that's what you need yeah at a giant Bell and you know people dead yeah he was like a Roy Nelson only with no stamina no black belt yeah yeah well Roy Nelson is a fucking complete anomaly yeah yeah here's looks like if you lose weight how is it possible that he trained so hard I've seen this guy throw her out like a hundred thirty 155 pounds kettlebells like one arm swings waiting wingding like that's nothing maybe you would lose weight right you would think but he would be a 185-pound phenom daddy's a heavyweight he's a kid big contender and maybe it's an implant that he just wants to do that because the Buddha belly implants kick him and not even feel it he's where a chest pad you imagine if someone did that I mean if girls don't have boobs let's think about this because girls do get fake boobs and they fight yeah you know girls of God I won't mention any names when twink we've seen it girls have no boobs and all sudden they have boobs you can get fake boobs and still fight but what about a fake belly what about a guy's eye just like a belly I like looking good you know if if a guy had a fake belly I was gonna try to see if we could hit it to the back I'd say I make a hunchback out of him see if he can move the way to the back way to hook to the back Wow lower back we never had one like that right you know I mean the Hunchback from notre dumb that's a high right no you never saw a hunchback from the bottom right like lower back we can make that like a lumbar pad we work as a lumberjack yeah yeah sleeps all night then he works all day like if you look at Roy Nelson he's like the size of a really good middleweight yet no yes yeah but meanwhile the guy knocked out Cheick Kongo knocked our Brendan Schaub knocked out some big fucking heavyweights yeah knocked out Mitrione I mean fucking best he's announcing knocked out a lot of people yeah yeah staples true ver right oh so did you knock out so I think it was I do not remember that fight Wow and into the worst thing is it's RIT is right hand so you would think that people gonna help the left up yeah but somehow he connects anyway it's like wound up with your arm bars yeah no you know it's gonna happen can stop it not almost knock down over him remember that yeah yeah he heard over him yep Stefan's true BAM Jesus Christ crazy yeah I mean Roy's like six feet tall Stefan Struve seven feet tall yeah I mean fucking animal Roy's an animal and honestly I mean look at his gut right there how much is that it weighs about 250 right he's he I'm not bullshitting yeah then I guess he is fifty pounds overweight and he's a world-class athlete I mean you cannot say that Roy Nelson's on a world-class fighter there's no way a world-class fighter and he's 50 pounds overweight so you drop down 50 pounds now you're 200 pounds you make 85 you cut weight everybody does that cut 15 pounds or 85 you're world champion you know there's no butter bean you know we were somewhere an Atlantic Commissioner told me from all the boxes on the card he had actually the best blood pressure and cholesterol for real he said we were a shock that the guy is in a phenomenal shape yeah that's insane Butterbean made him look like Yair Rodriguez look at him Jesus Christ actually looks good here it's a whole family look exactly like that I hear go upper right hand corner yeah that's what he looks like the news that it's worse meanwhile he's another guy knocked dudes dead man he is so funny at such a good time with him and there was a Prince George in Kennedy he was there he's a player hilarious very funny guy that's funny you know he's a fucking hell of a cook apparently you can't tell but it like I was watching a video of butter bean cooking some ribs and I was like damn that looks legit like yep smoker he was cooking him in a smoker he broke the rule though don't get high of your own supply so tell me about this karate combat thing you're doing we've seen the videos of it yeah like I like the fighting surface alright hit it's a greater and did you watch it I mean that what they do with the callers you know when it's Fighting's like a little radish and turns dark purple when there's a break you're gonna run up that hill out of the pit that's a little bit but I I like it a lot - yeah because you can use the wall as well then the 45 angle degree there to jump up like batters would do you know you can use it to put yourself to improve in the fight so I think it's really great I think the rules as well they keep kept everything on distance long shots long punches the hooks yeah Takamori two keys you know which are prettier so they allow hooks they wanted to stay away from uppercuts elbows and knees just before the cutting and they don't want to make a bloody so they understand that you know you show that everything is technique of course but for people who have been complaining I had mixed martial arts I can't understand the ground and some other arts out there too complicated well this has been around for such a long time everybody knows karate if you find out how many people did karate I mean when they grew up look at this it's a beautiful picture the way it's filmed as well if you the camera this one camera goes behind the people it's almost like a movie the one camera angle they had from a bob I say okay we got to stop with that one that was the only one but they did they stopped and then I get the the heads-up display that is also something that nobody had ever before that environment is perfect it's just like an arena that's how it should be that's how MMA should be fought it should be fought in an open space I feel like the cage is too much of a tool like you could use the cage you pin a guy to the cage you could beat him up in the clinch like Randy Couture owes used to do you could use the cage to get back up if somebody takes you down if you get taken down on this you get taken down like that's it no you're gonna have to get up at skill like real skill to see if he can get up think about this is if you were in the distance if it was quite a distance away it seems like oh you could throw you can throw and then once they hit the ground you can't clinch but the person on top who just threw you can rain down strikes for five seconds from a squatted position so you can't go down there and I already saw fights getting finished like that so it's a very effective technique why only five seconds we're just gonna go back on their feet they just want to keep everything short and and the more attractive for the audience the better it is it's like for instance now the knees are not in but you know we were already talking about knees to the body like who may be a really good thing especially because takedowns out there so now you can use it against the takedown is that a Bitcoin logo yes bitcoin is one of their sponsors really yep bitcoin blowing up now give me a leg kick let kick below the knee and I've been talking to them also this is the good thing about this organization that's why I really enjoyed working with them is that they're open to suggestions you know they're open to the rule changes we're gonna just see what happens right now and if the the urge comes up they said yeah we should add low kicks then we're gonna start adding locusts above the knee as well right now they do it below the knee just like you do in a you see as well you bald us yeah here's everything but I mean we see it a lot in the UFC happening now there was no because actually they break the bones right the fibula that will that will snap and with a low kick that won't happen it will just jam your landing yeah well also you can't condition the lower leg the same way you can condition the upper leg the upper leg gets used to taking a beating and some guys can just take low kicks yeah but not that low calf kick is debilitating it's annoying and especially if you do it just after like a front kick somebody gives you a front kick you tap it to the sighting you immediately kick it so when the muscle is still relaxed it'll go straight through yeah that's that's when something breaks if you can't flex yeah we've seen over the last few years that's a devastating technique now are they wearing shin pads no no shin pads only this tiny gloves you haven't they're in the back so you can check them out with the locates the search rotors will be knockouts by strikes I like to take downs as well that had a heads up X display it's really cool right now is the first one who ever does that it's a biometric nutrition training you know it's a DNA based heads-up display that you can see while the fighters are busy you get a heart rate respiratory what they eat what they trained before it's all gone it's not happening in two weeks it's will become full circle and then the heads what is the display like when is that were that's what wearing something they wear these little tiny things so you can see how fast they hit then what direction they had propelling you can pretty much see everything it's amazing and these gloves are awesome I mean the feel great did you feel great yep yeah there's a lot of padding yep that's pretty patty that's much more than a UFC glove huh it is but it's you know what else - it seems like it gives you a curve to your hand which is great which is an issue with the UFC is the constant poking mmm like if you want to poke some of the eye with this you gotta kind of it's like the pride gloves right yeah the pride gloves you have that curve to them and we saw much less eye pokes and pride than we do in the UFC you know but I'd never got that anyway in bankruptcy just open hand strikes I never poked anybody in the head sometimes you have to think is this on purpose or not I mean sure some it's on purpose right it's hard to differentiate how much of his on purpose it really is you know I said over John Jones at that time be good but but he is so calm so relaxed so everything and then I go like that that's almost it has to be then yeah yeah I know you've said that before and I should have warned that thing that's what you were gonna say you could have punch you could punch something pretty hard with this yeah I mean this is these are great pads yeah man this is almost like a boxing glove it's like a small amount of boxing glove it's like it doesn't cover the whole area but this is this is the same kind of pad as you see the sheikha did the true key you know mawashi tsuki there's still a hit that officially with the side mawashi chewkey and what was his roundhouse and the two keys upon show it comes from the side it's a roundhouse punch it's a long hook right how'd you say that but that was like this is Margaret clothesline yeah yeah closer I rich hand yeah hug punching with the knuckles you're hitting with this part of your hand get to that part of the hands like by the thumb bone yeah I know but that's why you know they keep it long and to make sure that you see the technique once you start doing short hooks then it's gonna be a different story we're gonna have very close you're gonna have knees that people go to be confused together you can't throw hooks you can't throw hooks long hooks what does that mean like it is really close you can't throw a short hook no nuts for the close this and about that think about this now your close distance you would have to remove yourself away it's like your combination I always tell myself uppercut right straight or right uppercut and right straight to the body if I give her a right uppercut I'm too close for the right straight but that look I step backwards with my right uh-huh now right away I create distance why Limit punches that seems silly because they want to keep it as close to karate as possible and as clean as possible I get it but a left hook like a tight hook of a guy's right there they say you could also throw a left elbow you know and they took that out as well yeah so I think house is one of these things that you simply gonna have to get used to and think about it with a fighter it's more difficult for a fighter so what do you do if a guy hits a guy with a short hook and knocks him out I have no clue then the referee is gonna step in well if it's intentionally of course that's a problem he's gonna lose seems crap well how can you make someone lose from a short hook that seems crazy well all the fights that they had talked all the fights that they had before now already right none of it happened so but sightings are pretty close I think did the rules meaning they have a guy who's repeating it like three four or five times and roids I do not do that Plus these guys a karate petitioners right see so they're not even used to it yeah but if they're karate practitioners in 2018 they know how to punch there's no nobody's just karate anymore I mean everybody knows how to throw hooks and uppercuts and but I think J's rules are the closer's rules to the 2020 Olympics is going to happen in Tokyo as well right karate is gonna come back in the Olympics is it into 2020 yeah Tokyo really I'll show in Tokyo and I think this is crazy like yoga shoes like what we showed on the forum I would say enoki now it started there so are they doing but that would be below the neck then like you kick to the head but you can't punch the face we're gonna have to really figure out dose but but that's why I love it with it but the gloves they're probably gonna be allowed to hit the face right but not in the Olympics right I don't know I don't know about that yet yeah because Taekwondo they took it out as well right and you're gonna have the headgear in boxing now you have this optional now I brought before what I believe yeah yeah well if it's the same glove if they make it the same weight why would they what are they willing to listen to you yes talk to those people oh no I'm already talking to that's the greatest or funky fly I'm a very popular guy I think the people was kind of here every time you get a text you get your phone flashes like the light flashes oh I do that on the on the back because many times I have my phone like this right and then now I can't hear it but I can see it now big light flash couple text me text me see when I do that on purpose I keep my phone flat on purpose like leave me the fuck alone I don't want I don't want to look at my phone every five seconds it's flashing yeah and oh and by the way is she that's what I'm looking hook's and aren't penalties anymore oh they changed it yeah thank you thank you very much cuz that seems silly yeah you should be able to hook somebody just I mean it's a great punch it's like me I understand if you want to eliminate elbows glory took out elbows you know Bellator doesn't have elbows belt or kickboxing rather but I think punches should be punches you know any anyone you want to punch yeah back fist everything you can throw everything it was flying as well all the kicks are allowed to get also except for the low key to the thigh but for the rest every kick every jumping kick everything is you know but that's that's again me talking and we'll go to see where this is going to listen to you guys one remember all the way back here with a kickboxing fuck you come on deckers Rob came in from camer-ah daddy still remember that fire man yeah those are the guys yeah yeah so yeah man I'm looking forward to it if you were nowhere on my what is it April 26 in Miami to have the first shot pretty sure they were out of town unfortunately April 26 in Miami huh that's the first show in America where were these other ones filmed overseas they do they do it everywhere they have an effort this will be the first show it's free guys so do that as well also a free watch for you to watch to be there or there was no television oh you go to karate dot-com there's a button where you can click watch it life and it's going to be streamed but you also have an app and they ever really cool app because that happened you the heads-up display you see there a right at the top watch life boom that's where you click sign streaming to our next event don't have the damn thing nice so who's putting this together how do you know these people well they contacted me there's a whole bunch of guys together a lot of karate experts as well and they and I think their site with the 2020 Olympics you know and I've been talking about this also for a while I said why it's not anybody doing this we had Chuck Norris doing it right right for a while at least and I thought I thought that was cool and now this when I saw this with a bit I go man this I truly believe it's gonna take off I think a lot of people gonna enjoy this well I hope so I mean I've been saying for the longest time that striking sports in America like you got boxing and then nobody pays attention to the other shit I mean people barely pay attention to kickboxing yeah just not nearly as popular it doesn't mean I'm a giant fan of Muay Thai I mean I love watching Muay Thai and I never understood why more Thai wasn't more successful United States I know lion fight had some good traction they were doing pretty well but I don't think they're on access TV anymore they stopped and I you know this is the people are asking for it every time you know complaining about mixed martial arts a lot of people because they don't understand what's going on in the ground now we finally have something you know Thai boxing and they're not watching it and a Glory has the best best fighters on the planet I mean it's an unbelievable show but watch it it's not mainstream enough into in terms of like its exposure I mean you get it on UFC fight pass which is amazing and then you get out espn3 which is only online and sometimes espn2 but you know I think you mean you look Rico Verhoeven and you see the jamol been city that was gonna do it like that and Ben said he caught him to him early and density could knocked him out six years ago that was a fucking amazing fight if that was on television that fight was on TV in the end when Rico's pouring it on and Ben city collapsed in the ropes mean and they're big giant fucking guys I mean that was an amazing fire Rico is incredible his cardio for a giant guy you know for a big mistake his ring strategy everything was that Khalid guy and he's a young guy as super-smart Olsen is he like 29 yeah I think shows like oh right got a night as well yeah so I mean he's got a long future ahead of you think over the amount experience he has already how will pull up up Rico Verhoeven glory heavyweight champion see how old he is I think he just had a birthday I think I think he turned 29 he's a fucking beast man was it today turns 29 yeah I just don't understand I really don't understand I don't understand why that's not more popular it's keeping it simple and this now even you take the knees out keep it a little bit more separate so that people can see see the technique but it's not better technique you can see the technique better right I think we'll do a lot of good also a lot of kids when they say hey mom I want to watch mixed martial arts when you were very young yet I don't think the parents are gonna allow that that's still not a little you know they don't know karate oh please go watch did you see this crazy shit they're talking about Conor McGregor fighting Floyd Mayweather with no shoes on in an MMA cage with MMA gloves you can clinch but no takedowns no knees no elbows no kicks no submissions but the clinch you can clinch you can fight from the clinch yeah well you know Mayweather is an animal that also yeah one kick be illegal it would end it if he had kicks that would be the difference that's that but but Connor even fighting from the clinch you could tie him up you could tie him up and hold on to him and hit him like Randy Couture style you remember when Shane Carwin fought Frank Mir and tied him up and just obliterated him with uppercuts just oh yes a monster but then again he chooses to spend there I don't think that may but is gonna choose to stand there if you get out he pops out he needs to well there's no need it's not like he pulls him to the knee it gets needed in the face you see what I mean because he can clinch with them if he can clinch with them and they're standing on the outside and Connor can grab ahold of them maybe way they're gonna shake him off he's not going to like if Connor decides to just wrap a hold of one of his arms just get him in an over hook and just start punching him in the face what Floyd's fucked his whole thing is boxing his whole thing is boxing little buddies his shoulder rolls moves he's not gonna be able to stop Connor from grabbing him Connors a bigger stronger guy if he grabs Floyd by the back of the neck and holds him in place it punches him in the face Floyd's fucked I don't think he understands when you say the clinch is okay if you could strike from the clinch he's fucked I'll put my money on Connor all day if he can strike from the clinch now if they just have MMA fight with boxing gloves or a boxing fight with MMA gloves rather that is a different thing that's a different animal I think Floyd's just so much better than that's what I thought that you meant no no no I mean clinching the what what I read the only difference they're not gonna let him kick they're not gonna let him punch knock on them elbow or knee or takedown or submissions but they'll let them clinch and punch from the clinch just that alone yeah that's a game changer just out alone yeah I don't I don't know I'm gonna have to see that because you know Floyd's gonna know they're gonna work on that as well he's going to work on those defense he's an incredible athlete I mean there's only a few things this is not like he's gonna have to learn the whole game yeah but holding on to someone and punching them is such a different it's just a completely different chapter yeah but as soon as you hold on to somebody that means you didn't get past today at your own arm as well you don't have the defense there as well so right maybe I can start attacking him at all so that's a one hand fight it's literally ice hockey right if you think about the grap but it's not getting each other sort of yeah yeah yeah but smaller gloves Connor will have more impact with his punches that's true and he's so much used to much more used to fighting from the clinch like that where you can hold and hit at the same time I mean I'm interested in that fight what if our foot stomps you know what that's what the last time I heard somebody say do you always super effective footsteps yeah give me one fight they never got stopped with a foot stomp never ever it's annoying it's annoying that you ever fight were somebody's foot stomp too you know never know Jeff would stomp anybody no no I think I'm one of those guys who would do it back and that's why the DeMarco who else was like the first guy to introduced that was yeah yeah yeah yeah Marco foot-stomping so you got a bunch of notes here man yeah I know I do I just this is one of my my pet things I'm throwing it out because you know going back to karate and with the with reading about it to all to get all the terms back that's you know so that's why I'm going here like the marcia gears we knew that oil borgia gears so Toby what she's here all those cakes you see but you shoot know this and you know this you like window background oh that's so you get the Jackie's yeah yeah we got the tack is we got the Geary's so how many events are they gonna do a year this it's all bunch they're gonna spread them out all over the place for the people what I would say here it's just karate dot-com what a great domain name by the way as well I don't have that here that's I was thinking the same that what's been expensive as far I think so too but they have it go there for all your favorite

who what country started this well karate offer did you know I mean this this event no clue I'm gonna meet these people face to face with every members no no because I've been doing commentary and I met some people from the organization because I did some commentary over suffice together with the finished carnivàle a she's great she's doing a lot of stuff for lion fight I met her and her boyfriend in New York not yeah not this last new UFC New York but in the past I got her tickets for the the UFC she's excellent really good fight interviews and she's doing commentary with you yes perfect yep she's very knowledgeable yeah no it was great then and we pulled it off right away so that's why we met these people there we did in in Long Island when I was filming there nice and uh and so there was I'm gonna see him in man in Long Island as well no no we just did it in my hotel so you did commentary like watching it on screen is that watching it on screen that's so people coming in with special microphone so we tuned it up you know there's executive you did that a bunch of times for pride right well you were in America and you were doing commentary for events that were happening in Japan yeah and David Lyfe sir we do it the combat area right over it live what was that like was weird no it's not weird at all man I I hope that the speed was up to me no because if you see an armored coming like that I never knew I never rewatched it again to say you know when our Mars happening I say he's setting open our bar you know if that delay is five seconds at ten sec yeah you have a problem but apparently I don't think it is because they stream it out they shoot it out from the studio so it's like you're watching the fights live that's it it wasn't there some that you guys did where the fights had already happened and you knew the results oh I did that with Steven Quattro's we did the first 10 I believe pride shows you know before 2000 it wasn't sent out on pay-per-view yeah yeah so they asked us to do those shows man I remember sitting there in Holland who are sitting with Red Bull we had stack you remember those spills that makes Jesus we were like heart attack pills we were it was so funny quarter's got so crazy he's so hilarious when he gets in his zone you know he started suddenly I'm watching a fight and I hear oh and I look to the side he's eating a green apple no but it's because this is eight hours in we're watching really boring stuff also this oh this was by the way this was not bright we we did pride but that we did on top of that we did another one as well right we did here that's why we did here in in America with but bratzman and the other show we did in Holland with all these old crazy Russian guys who had like an A and an e in her name and the rest was VPS PRM gee you know I mean I would call the guy with the red air or the guy with the red pants because I could yeah there's some guys in the UFC that when I read their names at the weigh-ins I have to pause and try to put it together like some of them it's our know and you don't want to butcher them and then you have these guys like defense right they say oh you butchered so-and-so his name I said how do you what do you say boss routine yeah you just butchered my name this is button it's not rules yeah another Lester host it's an S to host its Peter axe it's not been an urge you know you see I mean if you really want to start Dutch when we asked a fader one time what does your mother call you he says Fyodor I said we brought in Fuhrer we did that on pride everybody you butchering his name without his mom calls him like that is what we asked well Mauro was the only one that would call him that Mauro always call them fueled door fury Mauro is very precise with the ask the Amaro's excellent yeah yeah it really is he's great at that it's so nice to see him doing all those big-time boxing matches too yeah you know it's good guy that guy if you if you sit next to him it's what many people say oh it's fake is this it's half that's that's what they say no it talks boss room oh he gets in his own bubble and then you know if I look at him it that I could put my hand in front of his face if he's in the zone he doesn't see anything he only sees the fight that he's going to town and everybody steps away it just looks at him because he's going for it he's designed for that love it he's doing WWE too right he's insane he does WWE he's doing Showtime boxing does he do any MMA anymore oh no uh the Bellator but does he still do that I don't believe it a lot of the Bellator yeah so he does some of the Bellator I think so I think like the Big Show's problem because a lot of them Goldbergs doing now yeah yet he got a whole crazy team there and Jimmy is over do you see Jimmy's with us yeah the UFC nice we worked you know first time the Saturday night was great yeah good good guy he's a great guy yeah he's fucking excellent he's an excellent Compton I tried to get the UFC to hire him four years ago so for me to be there Saturday night sitting next to Jimmy I was like look at this man we're like so cool here we are yeah it was perfect too because we're friends is very easy the commentary flowed very nice together you know we had a good time that's that's what happened also with me Amaro yeah you know this is friends and you can shake try it out and it's just a conversation right well that's why me and Goldberg worked so well for so long because we're so tight yeah so easy so easy but whatever the UFC and him didn't see eye to eye for whatever reason it's a bummer yeah but I love Anna to annex great guy yeah yeah notice a lot of good guys and what defense should know is that a play-by-play guy doesn't need to know everything D doesn't need to know the techniques that's why we are the experts the caller guys yeah because there's so many people that say oh why don't you take Goldberg splays they say I'm a play by McCawley guy he's a play by bears a complete different animal that was especially a gig yeah if it's specially for TV yeah gotta go to the commercials and do all that kind of stuff it's it's much harder the anok and Goldberg those guys are Wizards that stuff yeah that is a hard job it's way harder than our job our job of doing color we see the fight we get to it we call it but then we already do it and movie doing martial arts our whole life yeah we know what's happening so we see it we go oh that's a roundhouse kick oh he's gonna get the triangle always getting out because he's freeze out yeah that we're watching in real time they have to prepare I mean they're preparing everything like long in advance and practicing and going over okay turn to page seven you know beat 152 you got to introduce monster energy drink and they're stepping into the monster prep dreaming in the air the whole fucking hard gig there yeah the coordination and traffic cop and making sure that everything runs smoothly check Kenny Kenny rice is insane he does 26 professional sports like at the highest level I mean he the football they never did it my buddy calls me says boss how many times did you do football it show what do you mean he says he could be the best guy ever I say that is the first time he's insane I mean when he came to the International Fight League he never did mixed-martial same as tomorrow never didn't mix martial arts but within two shows it's insane but they learn Mauro got the DVD set Kenny gets the DVD set and they and they actually watch it they start learning about it right and then they get it you know so and they leave it they ask you questions like boss what should he do boss is he in trouble you know what's what's going on here yep ya know you're still doing it for it used to be world combat league I mean know what was the as a fighter what series of fighting and now it's professional artists Lee are you still doing it yes Jun will go to start that's nice and so they still have John is John Fitch and belt or now oh I don't know I think I feel like Fitch might have just went to Bellator that will be not a smart move because they're gonna come at the million dollar price right if you win this season in everyway class you're gonna get a million dollars oh really yeah oh no kid so yeah that's gonna be right I don't think the job if that's a hundred percent still in place I think the John will stay no I think I feel like John just went to Bellator see see if you google John Fitch Bellator I know Benson Henderson Roger hurt obviously they have Rory MacDonald - he's in my opinion that one of the best if not the best Walter Wade in the world yep so that's that's a big big deal for them to have him as is Douglas Leeman Lagasse mmm March 1st some cheddar that's true he's got a big name you know yeah there it is John Fitch signs at Bellator well John's 40 years old now right how old's John if you had to guess February 24 it's a great day to be born is it yeah it was yeah yeah how old 40 yeah look at me I know shit I've been watching John fight since he was in his twenties that's crazy time flies baby I know fuck if I go back crazy it's bad I I had a poster of you from the first time you fought in the UFC they gave me one of those posters who said the world's greatest martial artist yeah and it was you fighting for the UFC when you fought teo sheik osaka yeah they asked me I said they messed up right that I forgot a word I told him specifically the world's grades looking martial artists they forgot that yeah they were hyping it up big time yeah yeah that was cool what a time that was Peretti he came over to Japan at the time as fighting to check me out and he said that they want you in the you see so you know said something online I someone said something about me talking shit about John Peretti which could not be further from the truth some guy he left a comment on Twitter I was like you're out of your fucking mind I never said a bad thing about that guy my life I love John Peretti and I used to love his commentary even what people hated him when they said like we were saying things like right I'm like a pony he was riding something like a pony right he monks him like it was great he called it like he saw it I mean he fucking had a deep background in martial arts world kickboxing champion black belt in jujitsu oh yeah love that you know everything and and he would say whatever he wanted to say he doesn't care you know the fuck politician stuff where do people just throw it out yet things sometimes and then it becomes like a some sort of a weird rumor and I didn't respond to the guys like you know you should stop talking shit about John Peretti like whenever we die do that you remember the boss with an invitation you know we did it a long time it goes a lot of great fighters Nate Marquardt Oh two men I mean yes before everybody was on those cuts it wasn't Colorado was and I think 99 something around that there was one time he had a 16-man tournament you had to fight four times Oh and Pulver actually lost in the finals to a guy who we never heard from it was weird because I Pulver became huge anyway Ron Waterman is fighting this out of shape out of big guy and Peretti is the because I got Peretti as the matchmaker because I knew if I have Peretti as of the referee if I have many of the referee everybody's going to come because they want to show off in front of the senior manager and then they're gonna fight and out another thing the boss with the invitational so he's fighting Ron the Waterman it goes to run water when he says listen this guy doesn't have little skills you know don't go to heart you know could you please don't do too crazy so Ron takes him down right away he's on top and he loads up and he goes very gentle starts hitting him like the gentle giant like really not hard and Peretti walks and breaks it up and he says okay it's over the big iron bottoms jumps up and he gets him parade his face the corner jumps over oh but get him prayer in his face and they start yelling yeah everybody is super aggressive and then he goes suddenly okay okay you want to fight yeah okay okay we start to fight and they restart the fight and he walks through water man he says do anything you want to do oh yeah was a fucking gold he was a gorilla bit he takes that guy down he starts he mounts him like a pony he starts hitting him Peretti looking in the audience he's looking away wow the guy gets hit he gets mauled bong bong and he's looking at an RTF are away and suddenly he looks big egos oh I'm sorry break Rob stop the guy's all bashed up and he walks through the corner he says it's your fault you did this and then you walked up yeah take no prisoners to early days you could do that stuff yeah man it was crazy times never when they had that one just submission only thing and they had Olympic wrestlers versus MMA fighters and I think my met met you more right the first one I think Monday Kenny Monday yeah yep and Frank Shamrock fought Dan Henderson OVF was there was a novio than that one too he was an animal yeah he was in world was it extreme combat that was it that was the Peretti show yeah he was a go tap Mario Sperry at beretti at the time already had weight classes yeah man stud I'd myth in his corner yeah that was that man the old days yeah yeah play this this was interesting because did back then these wrestlers thought that just be and Dan Gable was one of the guys that was doing commentary was really fascinating because Dan Gable thought that if you were on the bottom you should be losing yeah you know they had that restitch mentality well you know you took the guy down that a perm Gary Dell'Abate is the fucking rep for the winged card guy look at that Kenny Monday tank hey Olympic wrestler Kevin Jackson right behind him there yeah so they they go out it and he's got his knuckles up which is weird cuz they're not they're not boxing so he's like trying to wrestle him and Matt Hume barefoot Kenny's wearing shoes they Matt Hume what a fuckin martial artist that guy Oh super smuggler what a coach do hazing could we see it now in what he's done with Mighty Mouse yeah I mean you realize what depth of knowledge this guy has not to take anything away from Mighty Mouse of course he's got a tremendous amount of knowledge to but the fact that Matt Hume was able to take this guy so he just drops down yeah purpose purpose I know he's gonna start working oh yes so he went for it yeah that's not a good guy who knows legs while you're wearing shoes so all really stupid about it's gonna do it told oh yeah are you gonna tell at all night that was that was attacking the ankle and the knee that was both his his knee was twisted up - I saw Jon Hoeber in pancreas with the toe broke his shin bone yeah and remember that Jason de Lucia I just walked into the arena I said did he just broke his shin bone and he walked back and he looks at me because he's up next he says what happened to the word ow he said to me because Lobo just kept on fighting you see the lack of flapping left there right and he jumps on his apartment he was another he's another forgotten got an animal yeah he was the olden days the olden days there was some fucking crazy fights when you go back then and look at those olden days yeah I remember we were talking about Eve Edwards Eve Edwards and there's a podcast last week oh and we were he was underground fighting and I remember it was a tank Evan was there I remember that they interbred okay so this one happened the Atlantic Commission's and the police is they have to check so Jon Hoeber goes into the cage with another guy with their jeans on and they start wrestling so the Atlantic Commission the police sees that and they think that is what's going to happen tonight they leave they lock the doors DJ comes on he says okay they're gone we can fight ladies and gentlemen like people from porn industry start throwing porn DVDs in the audience was the wildest place at so Eve's fighting and he's mounting this guy and he sits next to the the cage and I'm standing I mean I'm a foot away from him because I'm standing next to the cage and the cases the cage is raised and he's raining down straight straight straight straight straight straight so they go is and he stops passing and he looks at me I say hoops trades dude and he goes hook straight out knock them out not only straights he immediately listened hook straight nothing I helped the old days well good days oh yeah man that's well it's amazing to be a part of something that developed like that because there's with a sport where you go back to 1993 and then look at it in 2018 and it's almost unrecognizable you know I mean martial arts mixed martial arts in particular I mean if you look at what martial arts were there was a lot of great Thai boxers back then of course it was a lot of good kick boxers but the difference between the mixed martial arts from 93 to 2018 it's not totally different Wars completely different world in the beginning if you knew it all who are you gonna win you know but there wasn't anybody who knew it all back not a lot yeah there was a few guys that had you know a good base of knowledge in some of the other sports but mostly they were specialists they were the wrestler or karate guy one glove yeah I remember I remember Kent telling me about the event they were in the back and they thought that it was still gonna be a work you know a lot of people and then the first fight went on and it was good to against the sumo guy when he kicked his TT that into the into the crowd he said boss it got really great backstage they thought that any moment still somebody could come in and say hey okay you're gonna lose you're gonna have to win and at that moment that happened everybody was like why didn't he crimp that I don't know I think there was just a couple guys who didn't like that ninja guy they got beat up by Pat Smith remember that guy who's like a ninjutsu god oh yeah but the pressure point guy crazy shit it like in his is like you know they have the preparation reels they showed other preparing he's like throwing guys out hitting them with all this crazy shit and then he got in there with Pat Smith yeah so they're looking badass kickboxer all five six elbows that's where the blood comes back up right I was horrible it was horrible yeah it was back in the day when they didn't just stop the fight yeah but that that's the reason I didn't want to fight in the you see in the first woman can ask me but I said whenever did it he said why I said any of the referee he said everybody can they're the guys who say oh I brought a dye indication okay good luck with that not me dude I have a family I like my life very much I don't like to die I said as soon as there's a referee you could actually step in yeah I wouldn't I would like to do it there was a referee that was there when you tapped to stop it but you had tap but if you got knocked out they just keep beating you up you know and what John said because when John drew the line was I believe it was for thank Abbott tank Abbott got beat up really bad he looked at the corner to throw the towel they turned his back to him later on when he went to them he they said well if we would have stopped it thank was gonna beat us up that's what he told us usually that's why we didn't throw tower and that's the more what he said okay I'm gonna step in here because otherwise someone's gonna die yeah it could have easily happened in those early ones yeah now the early ufc's to kick the first kick girag odo mm-hmm well endo v oh sorry and well not just that well him yeah took him down got him in a scarf old and just elbowed him completely unconscious boom boom boom just kept hitting him I was out but Orlando like was one of the first real legit strikers Oh like I mean he fucking nasty Muay Thai powerful guy and not a big guy either like 180 pounds haleyss crazy had some Wars I forgot the hip elite even hippo elite and Orlando whit I think they bought they fought a whole bunch of times Muay Thai with elbows if those guys were fighting in Holland to new yeah Peter look I got goose bumps we were there man that was flying elbows I mean from the clinch she would jump up and I rain down elbows to this to the collarbones that I mean yeah a complete animal Hipolito because I went back a fourth he would win then we would win and hipolito would win it constantly back and forth so that's why it it was so interesting for us yeah if you're just getting in the more time now and you're just hearing about it the fucking day we live in today where you could just go on YouTube and find hours and out you could fill the rest of your life just watching a man fights it really yes you can fuck yeah just find out about Giorgio Petrosyan just just google Giorgio Petrosyan you know who the fuck is that the two of ugh is that you go watch George you at the doctor baby unreal Italian there's only one right Armenian though Wow yeah yeah that Italy yeah Armenians are fucking crazy yeah that's that's a wild race of people but he's but but you know he is okay but the Italian side of him made him very calculated technical right because the meaning would you think okay I'm gonna go in here I'm gonna get you he was very technical as well I'm well just his mind what's his record at a time like 50 50 400 or something he's saying yeah yeah he got knocked down in glory he who's that he fought that African guy will fuck him trying to remember the homeboy he fought somebody along who was that who knocked him out I forget who it was but Georgia was so good with angles and technique I mean his technique was flawless and if you ever watch him drill you you recognize why he was so good I mean he was so so technical and precise in his drilling but you see what he's doing he's punching right away watch steps to the side is moving while he is punching oh but he lands the punches with two feet on the floor still and then he moved that that's perfect yeah perfect technique yeah he's he's someone to really watch like Giorgio Petrosyan who knocked him out see go to his uh it was a big upset it was in New York and it was when glory was promoting him as you know who he was and he just got caught he got caught by a fucking vicious striker well it's not a Dutch guy but I think is Daniel elugu and you see that's a yeah yeah you got him yeah wrist he's a beast you could find that fight so you find Andy wristy versus Petrosian Giorgio Petrosyan yeah that's who it was that's right Andy wrist he can crack - he's dangerous yeah there it is riding master square garden that was a big deal for them man to get in Madison Square Garden you know like to have that fight a whether they invited Mayweather there you remember I heard they paid him a bunch of money to be there just to be there yeah that's hilarious how much did you have to pay him to be there that's got to be a lot yeah and wrist ease who is a great fighter in his own but wrist he's a guy who's really good for a couple rounds in knew who he would fade and he lost yeah I forget who he lost to but he lost by TKO because he faded he faded in the last round but it's the fast twitch fibers you know once you're explosive you're really good and the first few rounds you're gonna have to really dojust make sure that you spread out yeah all your powers but if your opponent is pushing it and is forcing you to brawl yeah you're gonna run out of gas yeah I don't remember what it was that caught him I believe it was a punch they got kicked nuts yeah a little love tap yeah I remember what happened here there's been so many good fights glory like I said I'm a giant fan and I think it's one of the most underrated underrated organizations in all of combat sports and they have a great like a library of oh there it is oh it is tan left hand boom caught him Wow crazy crazy to see Jorge run that back for a second it didn't even look like that big of a shot look at this just perfect placement boom yeah like sort of a hook uppercut yeah yeah have you stepped into it switched to southpaw caught him on the left hand fuckin'-a who did we pull up Andy wrist ease I think I don't want it wasn't trying to remember who beat him somebody beat him where he was winning early on and then he faded as the fight went on that's a that's a tricky thing for those super explosive guys like a Conor McGregor you know it is hard oh to trainer buddy yes I'm sure I'm just throwing it out there Vaughn Roose Malin beat him but I think Vaughn rue smell and beat him by decision yeah oh that's it Davi Keira but also rose Marlon is known for his stamina you know his father was already William you know he was fighting when I was fighting and he's always coming forward that William was not the most technical guy but dude the guy at heart and stamina and he would come for you and it's very hard to fight somebody who's constantly pushing you backwards and that's what he was doing as well with him 100% makes him run out of gas yeah Vaughn responds an animal it's just like there's such there's such an amazing pool of talent and glory it's just it's an amazing organization to watch so much talent I don't know why it's not catching on because what he sees it yeah but k1 you would think okay all these people at least you're going to watch it I love it I love it but the average person go to fucking 7-eleven to go hey man what do you think of you go somewhere and say woody what do you think about Conor McGregor oh he's really good and he fights buses no people will say crazy they know yeah it's it's the UFC is very mainstream glory right now is still very fringe unfortunately yeah it would have been greater for them better if it at the if to you if she had a channel a TV channel like the WWE do that for a while that will be great because then you see glory will catch on for sure this right I don't know how many people have fight bass do you know that a number I do not know the number I know they're very happy they make a lot of money but I don't know the number you know UFC came real close back in the day to buying a channel but now I doubt they would do that because they spent so much money to buy the UFC I think they could just go by you know you want to buy a TV channel it's wonders and millions of dollars channel one is still available in fact that's the same as a new Bond movie I would double oh one that's what I would do one instead of double Oh 70s the seventh guy yeah I'm number one I'm the original what those when you go back to like those those channels like when people were adding channels was the last time you heard of a new channel like the last new channels like vice like the Vice jail and that was like GQ awesome didn't they by maksim or some shit - I think these are just switch they switch the name like radio station is a switch formats pretty much right like paramount the paramount network used to be Spike TV now it's paramount yeah yeah well look man I'm just happy there's some combat sports on TV I'm happy the Bellator is still around like you know people would say like oh you know you're in competition with Bellator I'm I'm not in competition I'm not in competition I like it I want them to be around I support it I support all of them I wish there was more I wish there was more organ it's good for everybody fuck I want to get better yep it really should but I really wish there was one big Muay Thai organization that's what I wish I wish glory was muy Thai so use elbows and use the real full rules mmm elbows knees clinched the whole deal let them do everything let fight Muay thai-style it's the best style for standing up fighting you know and then put it on TV otherwise have to 1 you have glory glory elbow right right I mean you have special rules I did it in hold on because Thai boxing they did not do with elbows but the special events like he believed in with what I was just talking about they added the elbow oh no shit they use elbows and some of you know no they did everything except the elbows you know that would be a would be one fight on the card Brian they would do that well when you see some guys fight like like John Wayne par or like here's a perfect Nathan Corbett perfect example his whole thing was elbows and then he would fight in glory and they take the elbows away from him well he's I mean he's obviously very good at all aspects of fighting but he's you know now he can't use one of his best weapons I was taking a head watch out and in the UFC but Coleman yeah remember fuck trapping both arms you couldn't stop it yeah yeah when when Mark Hall was in his prime head butts were a real weapon yeah did you had about anybody ever no no no no I'll put my face in there fight do you know if somebody loads up I'll right away go with my forehead into his face I will keep this is close to hold on I'll make sure my forehead is in front of your face right you know my weight with it if they load up that's the fun part right if they did this and then it's last moment you just so they had bought themselves in the face top of your head yeah it worked though who would think that he will be distracted for a moment oh for sure did you watch UFC Saturday night no I did not have no time I was flying all over the place yeah and I had to go to another show not a fight show in the ward show there's this guy that fought on the undercard zja beat Mago med sherry Poff holy shit is this guy and how many times did you rehearse his name many I fucked it up at the lands every was they were saying just call him zabita just sub eat and I'm like no no no I can get it he's he's fucking phenomenal animal he's one of Mark Henry's guys down in New Jersey okay that's good Mike from Dagestan okay where there's just something in the water over there yeah they just trained with bears right but this guy is tall and skinny and he fought Kyle Bach niak and this kid Carlebach me act like he was shorter he had a hard time getting in on them and a bead had more skill in terms of more techniques and more things that he could do but goddamn Bach niak is a fucking animal he is a savage cuz he was there at every second of this fight trying to win never gave up never quit and then to the end of the fight the variant of the fight in the third and final round the last minute of the fight he's pouring it on and he's got the beat up against the cage he's screaming at him he's got fucking blood coming out of his mouth he's chasing after him this is the end of the fight was him standing in front of the Sania there's showing some highlights as all highlights yeah yeah but is a beat that guy is fucking talented like you what is Rogers it's I think he's undefeated that's good he might have won loss maybe early in his career I feel like he's 50 nano though I think so you can find his record does it say oh oh this is the end so the end of the fight and I'm telling you Bach niak is getting his ass kicked the whole fight never said look at this at the end stand it right in front of him hands down fucking teeing off Holloway the whole crowd going crazy this is my favorite part it ends the buzzer goes off and look fucking hugs yeah and they walk around the ring and I'm telling you there was not a person in the fucking Barclays center that was sitting down everybody stood up and went crazy me too I was standing up the only time during the whole night I stood up and I was clapping you have to oh you know if they give it y'all that's is there's nothing cooler than that you know that's what the Holloway when he made that line you know he drew the line oh yeah man and it became a thing now 15100 house my memories you are so good my is a beat look at try seeing that name look at that okay is a bead muggle made - a beetle shut off steady poof shut up Michael my charity pulls a fucking ass well me bug away judge very very talented and Mark Henry's telling me about this kid a long time ago and he was telling me he's like he goes I got a world champion because this guy's gonna be world champion I was like wow when Mark Henry told you that yeah yeah yeah yep I mean he's got it has a good fight coming up with he is uh who's Marlin mirai's is fighting oh fuck was he fighting I love him good yeah great footwork man god damn it I'm trying to remember who he's fighting I see his face right in front of me Frankie go to the UFC bantamweight division Frankie Rivera Jesus Christ that's how he's fighting now I remember yeah who's another animal guy who beat Uriah Faber there there's no rush Jimmie Rivera why does he Frankie Jimmy is an animal yeah oh man he could add I'm just confused there's too many E's too many E's in this world Jimmie Rivera who beat he'd beat a bunch of good guys but you should have stopped at 11:01 a 59 1 Omega yeah yeah Jimmie Rivera he's a he's an interesting guy too because he's one of those Tigers shulman guys yeah I was just gonna say yep yeah when I was a kid when I was living in New York there was a bunch of Tiger showman karate places but we they were always like karate schools we thought of him as like you know like a chain there's like a chain but they developed legit MMA fighters it's like credit to that guy Tiger Schulman because he really embraced MMA yeah and they really develop some real top-level talent well once you're open-minded and you know that every evolution is there you know look at Bruce Lee you book the tower view to know you'll find toeholds he looks infer that he looks knee bars yeah I mean name it everything is in that freakin book that's amazing yeah I remember death he was a game of death or a dragon could have escaped that he could have breached that door but but it was there but that's like you know some pro wrestling moves yeah you see me yeah mmm that was really work because he was flexible in his neck will make you extra flexible from you're not gonna feel the stretch what did you think about that crazy shit with Conor McGregor throwing the dolly at the buck you know I'm giving a Conor a lot of passes and the only reason I'm giving him a lot of passes the same as Mike Tyson it's like you know you're getting a lot of money you have the wrong people around you everybody's a Yeasayer you know if somebody says hey you know what we should we should throw something against the bustard the whole gang is good oh yeah let's do that sounds great idea you know I think he just got caught up in the moment you know be him try to be him he can't go anywhere he can't pump gas he can't do it everybody recognizes he's got a lot of pressure on him I think he just has to figure himself out and it's gonna be okay deep down inside he's a good guy you don't like him and and away with his family and his wife and everything that he does I hope he never loses that because that made him love him yeah me look at it this way like ray Borg was on that bus oh I know he got his eyes cut he got corneal abrasions cuz Connor threw that dolly at the bus and I mean who knows what's gonna happen to raise eyes see if you could find an update on that ray Borg's condition because he was the most one who suffered the most serious injury michael Chiesa got cut on his head and is that but that I think he's okay I think those are just cuts and he'll be fine but Ray Bourque that you know you get a corneal abrasion that's really that's really serious you know what I was gonna say it imagine if the roles were reversed yeah imagine if Connor was on the bus and Ray Bourque threw a fucking thing here UFC ray bored yesterday's show to cut below his eye it's in his eyeball Oh Conor McGregor talking a bus he had a number of other MMA stars he and another number of other MMA stars are seated on so yeah so he's got he's got some seriously ray Porter's only 24 you know I'm a what I was afraid of is that somebody's going just like heaven with Russell Crowe we remember when he hit the guy with the telephone in his face they had to settle it for like six or eight million dollars because otherwise it was going to go to court and if it goes to court he's got a felony can never fight in joy in America again that means for Russell Crowe could have never done a movie in America again so he had to settle with the guy and he had to give him that money that's a lot of money the guys probably bawling right now yeah it's probably right now sitting on a beach somewhere and drinking a margarita go Russell Crowe well it depends if he never had money it's probably gonna blow my fucking fantasy had a beautiful fantasy this guy his feet up on the beach pina colada something with an umbrella in it yeah and it's all gone now and now he said he's cleaning making shoeshine and it's to make his money still in Paradise because he couldn't buy a ticket back what I was gonna say is imagine if the roles were reversed imagine it was ray Borg through the dolly and it cut Conor McGregor's oh oh listen I'm not I'm not saying that it's good I'm not now first of all he's not he didn't do it on purpose but I understand what you're saying I'm just saying I'm looking at not Conor McGregor I look at what happened to him the last two years right and that's a lot to deal with you know and I think he has to sort that out and I think that the picture this morning I with his baby and his life was there you could tell on his face that they don't watch something like he he was polite he was like a shameful you watch the picture you know I've seen so you came out of jail it's entirely possible that they might put him in jail yeah that would be not good and because if it's a felony he's gonna have a problem getting into America right oh yeah that's what I mean it's a very dangerous I mean what do they do here for his career if he he's gotta settle so if he settles with michael Chiesa who already filed a lawsuit against him or you already filed us some sort of a complaint or charges something so him and ray borg for certain is gonna do the same thing so those two were cut everybody else on the bus every other fighter on the bus could sue for emotional damage oh yeah they can one including Rose thug Rose was gonna pull out of the fight yeah she was really considering pulling out of the fight she was so shocking up you know the thing that I I do like it that he at least because when he talked to Dana day he didn't apologize but he apologized for all the people on board right you said no for the fighters I'm so sorry so I'm happy he did that you know but it's something he can't turn back he can you can make it right well you can you can try to make it right like a band-aid on a wound but you know to give them all hell I would say give the guy a little space and then hopefully he'll figure it out and he'll sell it those guys some would say that the only way for him to really learn is to face consequences for his actions then if you just keep giving him space is gonna just keep pushing them needle and he's gonna keep doing more fucked up things like no but that will happen now right he's gonna go he's gonna have to pay he's going to have to pay a hundred percent guarantee he was doesn't want to go to court look he's got a hundred million dollars and he made from that fight yeah but the taxes and everything of and with everything he's buying and all you know I mean let's say he's got 30 million left yeah let's say he's got 30 million left taxes all that other jazz what you really get versus what they say you get it is a lot going on there right yep the training expenses bought a house bought a couple of Bentley's depth or uh he's gonna give out a few million here yep this is gonna cost him a few million that's right I'm minimally but if you the Russell Crowe the whole thing plus if they really were going to do this Floyd Mayweather thing they're not gonna be able to do it now yep I mean if he gets arrested or he is arrested but if he gets convicted and they wind up putting him in jail it's entirely like mean he's got charged with assault mischief a few other different things he's in a felony charges yeah well I mean it's entirely possible that there could be some real serious consequences for this and if they really were gonna do that but how many people would pay to see that Mayweather fight in the Octagon you know but it give us a little bit of stupid rules this comes from the Mayweather fight it's like almost Enochian money for Dali right just before they said no more kicks above the way or no more kicks above the waist yeah no needs no grappling techniques I mean they charge changing the rules just an hour two hours before so so what would you like to see them fight if they need mnh do it with knees knees and elbows kill him I know but that's what I want to say I mean even if there's no grappling Conor I'll kill him it's just with kicks yeah give them kicks he'll take his legs out just no kicks even just low kicks yeah he'll take his legs out all you'd have to do is just I do you remember when Rick Rufus fought that Thai guy and the Thai guy just kept his hands out like this just kicked the shit out of his legs yeah that's all Connor would absolutely but you don't have to box them yes keep his hands out like this whack whack a couple of those and you see Floyd limping around the next thing you know the head kicks coming boom yeah okay but let's say the head cage is not allowed let's say they do the rules like that of Tonio Inoki first is Ollie we don't stop with no leg shakes just that's what I mean yeah I would do yeah low kicks that was a good one you know so he's yeah the next two weeks every time he goes to the restroom he's gonna go oh darn it weeks that Lackey connect from Aldo when I guess you were afraid raises like you've ever seen well Uriah was taking pictures when he was going into the hyperbaric chamber to try to heal up the leg and his leg was giant purple blotch like it was twice the size of his other leg yes find it that you're Iike a burrs leg after josée Aldo fight yeah who's Aldo gonna fight he's fighting someone Oh Jeremy Stephens oh that is fucking crazy that is fucking far first of all your riah favor is a goddamn animal this could not believe because it started early in the fight already and he just kept hanging in there yeah he wouldn't give up he wouldn't give up I mean it's amazing amazing that he made it to the end of the round or the end of the fight yeah I mean although was just taking that leg out and then I remember I was interviewing Uriah after the fight he could barely stand up he could barely just talk he was in such pain but respect for that guy that guy is tough and that shit that is paid at that moment the next day yeah and when Jimmy was there when Jimmie Rivera beat Uriah he beat him with that low leg kick he fucked up your eye his leg a lot of times that happens with guys they get that low leg kick and then the nerves give out if their foot doesn't work right that happens to a bunch of guys they get hit with that low leg kick and then the nerves just stop working right yeah I I think that's a more dangerous kick almost than a low kick you know because she actually can break a bone there with the cake sure especially if you hit the thick part of your shin against that little was it the fibula there's a tibia and the fibula oh yeah the fibula is a little tiny thing yeah that'll snap that's not designed for kicks no shit shitty design the human bones that's a shit design your hand it's a shit design for a guy who punches as hard as you right that's crazy yeah you know I should have I should have taken off the glove definitely check them cuz these gloves are fucking awesome these gloves are good I mean the only thing about these gloves is there may be two good like there's a lot of padding there that's that's very thick especially with a with a knuckle scar like right here that is thick shit that's like solid inch plus of padding maybe even more yeah I mean I like it it's a very even cushion right yeah you don't see that a lot sometimes you just push straight through it but this is really well certainly for the back your hands and even protect your hands better than the UFC gloves I think pride gloves are the best for MMA your big dough but it was cool with their good yeah they curved so did hence weren't open even with the thumb so it didn't stop the grappling if you you're a smart guy and you're creative you ever thought about redesigning boxing our MMA gloves you know something where people don't poke each other you just think yeah no I think people just simply not polka why would you have the anti open I mean you as a fighter if it's your profession you should be able not to poke somebody's like come on now what do you think about this proposition because a lot of people been talking about this me included every time you do a foul whether it's an eye poke or a low kick to the nuts you get a point taken away whether you meant to do it or not you grab the fence point taken away so this way there's no warnings and you never do it because you're always worried you're gonna get penalized a lot in the beginning but once you realize that everybody's gonna get penalized you'll stop so it is you know it's like giving a pedophile the life of a senator death penalty that will stop that disease for 90% as well just get rid of them yeah I think they should stop with the cage I think the cage is a bad environment I think it's too easy for guys to trap people up against the cage it's hard for people to see it's hard for the audience to see I don't think there's a benefit in the cage I think the cage was fun the beginning to those you can't leave you're trapped in the cage but no one wants to leave they want to fight right so if they're gonna fight like that's not the best the best environment for fighting the best environment for fighting is like an open area the area that you know karate combat as that's a nice area because see everything but less you know with the the walls I like the walls because you can't lean against them you know that you're on your back grounded opponent you know because they pull you back to the ground yeah because it karate combat when you're against the wall you're not grounded but if they pull you once you're on the on your back on the ground you are you can get hit yeah so you can't you can't get away you can't run away no like it's not you run out into the audience you would have to go up that ramp but you're you're contained in the area but you're not trapped up against a wall like you are at the UFC with the cage they were gonna do a bit all the way in the beginning right when they were talking about it with emelius weight maintenance John Milius didn't Frank Shamrock do that Frank Shamrock had something that he did shoot did he call it shoot box Frank Shamrock shoot box I feel like Frank Shamrock did something like this where he had and then Bob Meyerowitz came back and did something called the Yama hit fighting that was something like that yeah yeah but that was in a cage to our David came to us to promote arm wrestling with why you could hit your opponent that's right your arms were tied up and do too well into each other oh my god that was the most ridiculous shit ever I forgot about that one guys had their arms taped up taped together yeah and they were punched each other in the head what the fuck was that called extreme arm wrestling I have no clue I mean any name is good for that because that shit was so stupid didn't a couple MMA fighters get involved in that too I I'm pretty sure you know if there were not on the list somewhere what is this what is it called here we go yeah they tape each other at yeah X arm extremely together he's got a glove too my god as soon as you let go of that thing that you're holding in order you know then you don't have that balance you have to feel right-handed you're gonna have to kick so stupid this is why don't they simply push him down and win the fight like that right this is so fucking stupid this isn't this is a fight with the bartender tied up that the bartender's behind the bar your arm is somehow tied you're gonna have to fight this is so stupid I want to see some of this ex arm that's what it was called a new sport is born and not really incredible athletes yeah ready go my punch on your fucking head now what how do you win do you win by on the table that shit's ridiculous that is so ridiculous wait a minute he's on to something this is so Stu the kiss oh my go oh they stopped it but meanwhile they tied up pin his arm you pin his arm you win wait a minute yeah because that's what you work him out this is so fucking stupid why don't they just spin him right away so you don't get hit look at that's doom doom she imagined if you fuck me over safety glasses the ref has like they should just in case blood come secreta in his eyes spit and shit that's a camera the graph game oh my god so dumb that is so I think that's so fucking dumb oh my god I forgot about this I'm so glad you brought this up oh look I got a note and he's hanging on deck oh yeah I got him he's out cold untie me from this dead man I did to a trading partner whoa stupid would you do to training partner I was very angry and uh more angry than you were at the desk you know what he had a fight in two weeks and he said this week my friend is going to go to Vegas for a bachelor party you think I should go and I go you're asking me for advice yeah I said no oh he's gonna go wrong you do drugs you get drunk you do everything right of course it went wrong he did go so now I'm angry because he had to fight going on and I said he wanted to train on he was back on Saturday on Sunday when I said no let's do Monday give you an extra day rest well now I came in and this time I you know normally I never want to knock somebody out but I want to knock him out just now because you couldn't find anyway already with a young angry boss anger it bus no you didn't listen and now you gotta fight constantly complaining about your losing yeah I mean it has a reason and this was one of the reason this was the moment for him to get a lesson so I think first punch it through but I incredible heart and I remember I hit him and I almost didn't feel the impact so you know that I hit him it'll make sure to say I went straight through I remember him falling over the rope and I grabbed my stuff and I walked to my car my car that was in the garage where in the garage and the the the the ring was in there was at the front of my place and I walked over to my car and while I walked over I looked back they were still hanging there's no movement whatsoever and I got I get started get worried because now it was I was already finally two minutes no movement whatsoever so I get in my car and then I Drive by and he still there's no move somebody taking care of him I got out of the car because I want to take care of him and as soon as I've started walking I start he started twitching so I got in my car and I drove off yeah yeah but it was a long time we fought then he lost but it was says he lost you knocked him out two weeks ago no no he was losing already and it was every time it was somebody else's thing and say maybe you shops stop smoking weed for a while maybe that was gonna help them what about that maybe that would hello so if you if you wake up in the morning is mocha bong you do it all day long and you keep doing it I mean maybe that's that's the reason all right well we're not getting really to your potential it could be a finalist Nick Diaz yeah does that seem to affect him there's always exemptions yeah he's he's a real exemption I mean when people people think about pot heads you think about someone who's lazy and you think about people that are bad endurance you would think you'd be lazy but Nick Diaz has phenomenal pterence I mean he does triathlons do you know he swam from Alcatraz five times I said two times and he corrected me he goes no bro five times am i five swam back from Alcatraz five fucking times in the shark-infested waters yeah let's go but there were also they said it was a lot of you know it was not as bad as what they let prisoners know of course my well it's just because athletes are just so much better now but if you didn't swim it's not like to let him prepare in prison like I do laps in the pool like those guys they didn't have any endurance no they didn't have a little pool either right I'm thinking how can you practice swimming but it's a hard one that's a hard one I'm sure some of them made it there's a couple of guys did attempt to swim back from Alcatraz and one guy they found his clothes on the beach and they never found him and they assumed that he got eaten by a shark or some shit and drowned and they just found his clothes but it's entirely possible that guys swam all the way if he was a fucking real animal could swam all the way took his clothes off one fuck you I'm out of here back then didn't have no data babies laughing right now you got a calling number I got three yeah I mean I think nobody I don't think they know of anybody who definitely successfully made it but today people do it all the time it's a like all those triathlete endurance assholes those are serious animals those guys who do like triathlons ultra marathons those motherfuckers they have ridiculous cardio like a 90 year old woman who did it really I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah also from Alcatraz did you go to school right yeah that's pretty cool yeah I have to go to Al Capone's cell and just to see all that stuffed weird the movie the rock remember that that's right Clint Eastwood right no no okay from Alcatraz oh right which one's the rock the rock Nic Cage Nicolas Cage yeah that's a different that's right Escape from Alcatraz any Hopkins those guys they they scheme you know what's his name plate James bought bought church ball color II Sean Connery Sean Connery is also such a badass guy yeah I always loved Sean Connery my favorite interview is him with Barbara Walters was talking about smacking women oh they don't listen you let them have the last word a national enough and they need more and more research after just take your hand and there it is Escape from Alcatraz Clint motherfuckin Eastwood it's an escape yeah yeah so I don't think anybody like definitely escaped and made it across the ocean I don't think like there's one guy that caught in San Francisco still on the FBI's wanted list but there's since around there still on the FBI's most wanted list and what year was it they escaped 62 wow they might be a lot it might be still alive Wow those three guys escaped look at those creeps and they never have found no probably drowned man if you hear us call us we'll be a story motion Google the 90 year old lady a minute that's insane you know what if they would still be alive they should write a book right and then just before they die to say here this is how I escaped Alcatraz and what proceeds goes to the family wherever just write expedition great a novel and go one point this is like a Simpsons yeah yeah did you see the interview where he kind of like a says that he did I saw that I didn't see it oh yeah it's freaky you know you hear I'm saying because sometimes she forgets he doesn't talk in the third person sometimes he talks and then he he took this suddenly he he made this really we have karate stance like he knew karate and that it's quiet he says oh of course you know there will be in my mind you know he would correct himself every time yeah he took a karate pose it's weird that he's out there roaming around now yeah ladies I'm sure there's a lot of crazy bitches out there apparently that parkland shooter that kid that killed all those kids in Florida it just gets fan mail all day long they say ghosts want to marry him girls wanna marry him yeah yeah that was the thing with Richard Ramirez The Night Stalker he just got tons of marriage requests there's a lot of girls who want to marry psychos yeah it's so strange it's something really bad happened to them when they were young I guess you know I mean otherwise how do you get there how do you get to a spot like that I don't know yeah people then it's weird we need bigger penalties for things that's what we need well I like that what you said you know no more warning boom do it one time I think yeah for fights I think I pokes well here's the thing even if you didn't mean to do it the other guy got poked in the eye and that's a significant impact and it could affect the vision and we know many fights that have changed changed the course the fight like Travis Browne Matt Mitrione Mitrione is winning the fight he gets I poked by Travis Browne then he winds up getting beaten up and stopped you know it was a big big moment in the fight and it came from an eye poke you know those kind of situations happen and even if they're at by accident it doesn't matter they happen and when they happened that's a giant impact and that giant impact should be penalized yep because that guy can't see now it's looking like this I got two stabbed in my hand Pro Wrestling are you literally what they say you see three people yeah I couldn't mucuna folks the referee goes fight I get it I can't see anything so Japan yeah it was Pro SX firefighters okay I'll fight but they do some hard pro wrestling in Japan so yeah strong style they call it so that's why it's so good for the mixed martial artists because they use real submission moves if you go here to WWE you know that you see moves that they tap on things that are not even move sometimes right so you know the teacher W guys got mad at me because I was analyzing the figure-four toehold and I was saying the other guy is actually in a better position the guy was getting the toehold has a heel look W he guys were so mad for telling the truth yes they were saying that yet somehow another diminishing their their thing like you guys just did WrestleMania last night it was the biggest fucking thing on TV it's not diminishing it but it's you yeah you can't get mad if someone's pointing out reality it is really you know what if they say hi I'm I think they're amazing guys yeah I mean I was almost about to sign for them a long time ago but I would I thought I was gonna get away with like 20 30 shows no no I mean it was two 2226 you wanted yet this without two traveling so I go you know and these guys take bumps every single night kitchen yeah that's 220 shows you know if you look at the Stone Cold Steve Austin all these guys the rock Dwayne Jones all these guys they did way more year yeah they did two shows in one night they say they were going from town to town that's a crazy life Stone Cold Steve Austin eating potatoes because that no more money what potato's eating in the car driving from event to event cuz he had no money and no money at the time he was building himself up he was eaten raw but he was wrong potatoes yeah what is the raw potato taste I don't know it like a raw potato I not good a little bitter right remember when Ken Shamrock was the world's most dangerous man yeah he did it just jacked yeah he was so jacked back that it was ridiculous remember how big he got holy shit he got big yeah it's 160 pounds oh thank you yeah it's a unbelievably tough way to make a living unbelieving yeah tough what is this just are just here to retire yesterday she got kicked in the back at a house show and snapped her neck but you see how show like a non-televised show one of the 220 says they have to do like not in LA like whenever Kansas huh Wednesday night whoa very injury prone man because it's constantly constantly it's it's really amazing all the faults all these things are real so people can say whatever they want you know and people say of pro wrestling is fake yeah so is acting you got one of your worse injuries from stunts right yeah know where effect lights out the show on FX she remembers bolt McElhaney okay if you by the way when I talk to him he's the lead in mind hunter in that TV show what is mine hunt mine hunter you didn't see your Netflix that's that show about serial killer yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean look man that what they have to do is one of the hardest jobs in all show business 220 shows a year getting slammed and knocked around like that it's one of the hardest jobs in show business but you're a tough guy don't be such a pussy if someone says that a figure four leglock doesn't work don't start that's when the skin is very thin it's just very thin I don't understand instead of constructive criticism yeah yeah but relax she'll take jokes you can't tell jokes anymore I was so on inside ever made right I'm telling at the wrap up but I didn't even know this was the wrap up I don't even remember I set this so I'm busy and I said yeah right who can write hoop knockout we see highlights and I tell Kenny rice I said man and right hook talked out I said I love to see that it's so underused to write hook I said you should really practice that so Kenny says to me how do you practice that I said well if you married you said hey honey cake come over here for a second and right away I'm looking in the camera and I say I'm kidding of course right and I'm I'm literally saying it because I know there's always people but I started laughing it's a joke I don't even remember me saying this on my facebook I had this you know feminist organization attacking me that I couldn't say that I would hit my wife and I go I didn't say I went through the whole show and I go where did I say it it was literally the last 20 seconds where I said it and two seconds later I said I'm just kidding it's a joke you could never do that you know but people are so thin-skinned you can do anything you know these were the same people when they asked me what did I enjoy the most of women fighting I thought I made a joke I said the weigh-ins right I thought it was funny designing the bikinis right yeah shame feminist organization and I told him I said if you're in the MMA business I say get out because we all say they all think like me I'm a nice end right on the nice ending thank

Ronde his face and someone else's body it's like he's raising he's crazy it's funny though he's hilarious at like if his Instagram page is fucking hilarious but I'm always like what how long is it

I'll take you you want to go to the hospital right now you went to the hospital right them in there and they're like holy shit Oh cooked him up with that he got it again I think afterwards like sometimes it can relapse when you get it bad when you get it in your system and you don't really completely get it out of your system sometimes it can come back friend of mine had this boy's blood poisoning yeah from a from a low kick it was all his like there was fluid Sinan - little like a pinky thick purple line started going up on his body like towards the heart oh yeah you got to see that leg I mean they went in that they stapled it close with like 34 of those staples hold five crazy scar yeah from low kicks from low kicks that's didn't treat it man you know just kept on working and something went wrong and not an infection yes that's clot it no whatever that you see how I did that clothing what do you think I need to ask you about some certain shit like what do you think about the John Jones situation like with John Jones testing positive but saying was a tainted supplement what do you think about all that I think s it okay I'll go back all the way back window you could do pretty much anything you wanted right right I brought my own bread on food everything to Japan if I would go to a halt I will bring my own water I wouldn't drink the water they had there I've heard all the war stories and fighting in foreign countries that they might taint it or something to do something make sure every product that you take as a professional athlete is your responsibility you know so once that happens and I thought that thing that supplement that the same thing to supplement as your Romero had I believe it was that same thing to them and they have the same manager so so had their manager didn't say hey wait a minute Joe Romero maybe you shouldn't take this because I don't know 100% here I'm just talking at anyway even if that's not the case as a manager you would say I think from now on you should buy only products that are on a list they don't do anything else anymore just to make sure because people you know where the smoke is fire that's what people think it's always I got a fortune I was very happy with yo Romero when he when he brought a product I say that's the first guy who actually does that right they took the product got it off the market because it wasn't there and he was cleared I said okay finally I would have done means did the same thing Tim means tested positive and then he fired it also they found it on the shelf they did an independent test of it and they said yup it's in this stuff that's a real common thing a lot of baseball players have tested positive for the exact same thing that John tested for apparently it's in a bunch of different supplements but you get it in trace elements or trace amounts you know you're not getting like big amounts and a lot of it comes from they take the same vats in you know China wherever they make that shit and they'll make some steroids and then their way in and out but do a shitty job of cleaning it out and then they'll make some creatine and that's like the gluten free products you know but sometimes they use a machine that you have sprouted with gluten in there right and it's tainted it's like that yeah it definitely can be it definitely can be you know I've heard a bunch of crazy stories one of the the craziest one was they think that cocaine sometimes they cut with creatine and creatine is often infected with this steroid that it's often tainted because you're you know you're getting cheap creatine from China and they use creatine to cut cocaine with I got a good idea don't do cocaine if you're a fighter just crazy that didn't even make sense don't do coke letting Eddie come back when it come back Joe I don't know I don't think they've done his hearing yet oh man what a gallon what a waste you know they did the California hearing but I think the Nevada State Athletic Commission and you sada I think that's in April sometime I really hope we're gonna see him soon I really hope he turns his life alright I truly the best yeah he's the best I mean the impact that he can have on on kits and on everything going out as if he trains for for it fights for more years yeah just beat everybody I then go out I think he can still do it too I think you still come back and maybe you know hopefully it's clear one thing is clear from his test is that whatever he took was a tiny trace amount and it must have been accidental must have been this is according to Jeff Novitzky because if you look at right before that test he tested negative he tests positive for the tiniest amount and then he tests negative again right afterwards yes she is it tiny so it has to be an accident and it definitely didn't have any performance enhancing benefit well the levels that he took they're talking about trace amounts but you see this is where comes in play what he did before and that's why he's getting penalized you see so you're always responsible for your actions that's what's happening now this was the first time - which is so crazy I know but you know if somebody has the chance to do it back what a comeback that will be I think he can do it I get a hundred present I mean you think about his wit his victory over Daniel Cormier the way he did it that left high kick and then puts it away he set it up yeah entire fight he was setting it up yeah and I think that when he came back and the before the last break that I said okay now he can let it fly I think you set him up enough yeah I love that men making a pattern and then breaking to better and that's I love that style of fighting yeah I mean he's such a talent I mean and just but isn't it funny how some of those guys that are so talented are also so self-destructive so common it's because oh no no but it's not only that it's it's talented and because the talent that propels them up in the limelight and suddenly they become somebody and it's like I said what corner you got all the a said nobody says no to you right and if you have that constantly 24/7 around you yeah you start becoming do you think you're God you can start doing things and other people can and you can that's the worst part I mean you look I mean he that he didn't go to jail think about it what he did right hitting the woman and in the drugs out of the car and the woman was pregnant she was injured I mean there's a serious thing a normal person would have been in jail right so and with the money situation and how he changed suddenly with cormier one day well you know where were they filmed them at the interview and they they kept it rolling and they didn't know they were wrong and he started saying how much money you have I got so much more money I got this I got this that I go do what are you doing what is it's a way a thing to say but then again you think of it is the he was the youngest champ you know so ever right I mean the guy is young I mean I was an idiot at that I wasn't idiot I started at 28 right I was still the grown-up completely crazy so that's why I never blame people because I know I wasn't complete idiot right well you have a great perspective on it because of that yeah yeah you've been there you know what it's like and you were a fucking wild man and now you're very calm except for when you occasionally punch at eight oh yeah 13 hours is too long for a commercial shit don't do that I know what that's like though they keep on wanting you do it again you get angry like fuck yeah no it's an ego thing too because they said it's fine but because they said would be good you know that now it's in my head I go I just want to do it for them so I don't feel as bad as I go am i right right it's just pushing it it's just saying no little sooner that's the trick do you miss inside MMA yeah I do I never and I told this always when I had to show there has never been a show when we were that imagine today was Friday I had to film never ever I thought I wish I could stay home tonight I always wanted to go and meet who everybody was there whoever was there I loved that show it was great you saw the new talent that's what Conor McGregor you know comes in and it was just starting and interviewing him it's great and I see the old guys you don't fry and Coleman it was great it was a fun show what happened with it I think just numbers I think it's you know nowadays with everything streaming you can you know there's no breaking news for us so it has to happen on Friday they should come along and reboot it and give you a show just do it online where anybody can get a hold of it do it on YouTube yeah but then also do it every day but make it you can't compete with a good a shirt or get em away we give what you can because that's that's happening now yeah so you need to show a live show it like right like a podcast but you need to do it every day yeah or renters breaking news yeah well every day's I mean fuck man if you did it every day it would just take off if somebody just figured out how to do it and got you into a studio yeah but you know what we're waiting first of all for Kevin can't wait if that goes to a third season I'm gonna have to have that then I got 11 shows with the professional fighters League I just thought of karate Kombat you know so I'm good I would like to keep the free time what do you are you a regular on Kevin can wait yeah well I'm a regular on the show but not a regular of the show that would be if this goes to a third season I become the cast member that done then it will be there when you play on the show his neighbor like last year it exists 16 or 17 episodes that's yes the guy crazy guy root girl from Holland you know he's not a smartest guy not the sharpest knife in the drawer it's very funny that's fucking great yeah that's so cool that Kevin did that that's very cool and it happened because once inside MMA stops he said now you can finally do an appearance on our show because they were filmed Friday nights in front of a live audience right so I could never be on a show so I did a guest appearance the writers liked it they got me back and then I did two more three four shows of the first season at the end and then he called me said do they love you they want you for next year so I said this twenty-one years ago I believe against George gross when he interviewed me for Sherlock was just started sure doc twenty-one years ago and my dream job he asked me about a long story short my dream job would be to work in an American sitcom I said and he said you don't want to fight I said I did all that I just want to make people laugh it's so funny what a what a life that is Manas it come everybody's happy yeah it's such a good time I did that shit for five years yep yeah it's interesting what happened with the we're gonna reboot it what was the de facto Fear Factor they did reboot it with Ludacris oh sure sure they didn't know I wasn't gonna go yeah you're too busy to write you over the place I don't want I was got into a fight remember that poor fuck crazy people oh yeah that's that's the problem with reality show is you're dealing with all these wacky people they're trying to get famous whereas you're on a sitcom you're dealing with the other people that you're working with on a daily basis yeah when I was on news radio you know we were like a weird little dysfunctional family you know that's what happens and those those sitcom sets get very close to each other yeah it's love it's it's a it's a great job man it really is like that was also funny yeah yeah you know yeah I'm laughing the whole time if people would have a camera on me if I'm laying in bed going over the script I mean it's all I didn't realize that almost everything they say is funny you catch that when you're watching but that's why the reruns are so good every time you see new jokes right but pretty much everything is tied in together if your every single line you go my god this comes back from that scene before it's it's all tied in people don't realize what a good stand-up comedian Kevin is - yeah he's a very good writer he's a very very good writer very funny guy yeah a lot of fun he doesn't have enough stand-up specials out where people don't appreciate how good he really is he's gonna do for the Netflix now I'm happy yeah I think you already filmed it did you just do I think should do I went to a few because once we were there he started you know going to some stand-up places you know to start practicing because he was out for a little bit yeah and an album we started out together we have the same manager and I got him hooked up with my manager yeah back in like fuckin 1993 or some shit I don't remember what year it was when Kevin and I were buddies in New York I hope you use a roommates right well Sanaa we never lived together but we were just like we were friends we were both like in our early early 20s we were just yarn now yeah he told me that he will use to watch Pancras with you yeah and that's how he knew me yeah and so when I came to America I had this management right away calling this a hey wants to meet you so let's go that is cool yeah i haven't used to watch all that shit with me we used to watch Pancrase in the early k-1 fights and everything yeah Kevin it's a fucking serious martial artist two people hit man he's got a fucking power there's a cool thing we were shooting here comes the boom he at the end with Christos ocinski when he lifts him up for the armbar right so the scene is going to bring in a crane with a cable so they that because it needs to be controlled of course for the film so he's asking he says oh by the way can I have your attention so all these extras are there and he says Christos lay down so crystal puts him in an armbar he lifts Christoph up above his head puts him back to lifts him up above his head breaks him back there's a three times in a row he says did you see that I just want to bring it out there so people can see because now the cable comes in otherwise everybody says that I can't do it and everybody was like what he just did that he did the three times in a row he's a gorilla and his speed and his punches if you see him that's not sped up no on here comes the boom I mean the way he's hitting what he's doing the very first time I was training him I remember coming home and telling my wife she says and I said may he's a big guy but told he listens to every little thing I say and they will do it immediately
