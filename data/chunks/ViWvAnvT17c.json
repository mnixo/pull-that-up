boom and we're live how are you sir oh brother I'm so blessed to be here man I want to salute you to work that you do and the fact that you were one hell of an artist man I'm telling you thank you very much I'm gonna stand up comedy hey look that's changed times oh we the swing from the political to personal from the animals on do the divisionary it's just a beautiful thing to behold my brother thank you from you that is an honor I've been a huge fan of you for a long time so for you to say that to me means means the world oh it's deep thing I can see your love for Richard Pryor man I walk in your space and I'm just transformed by the guys the spirit there's Bri this place man yeah it's here Pryor here then when you tell me you work with the great Richard Pryor oh my for five weeks I followed him I was a young comedian at the Comedy Store I went on right after him every night he performed it was strange to be in the room with him because when I was a 14 year old boy my parents took me see live at the Sunset Strip and I could not believe that anybody could be so funny just talking that was my first experience with stand-up comedy other than that I had seen like I'd seen people perform on The Tonight Show and things along those lines I opened it was like ha ha ha it was okay you know yeah but when you see Richard in concert in a movie theater I couldn't believe how funny it was it didn't make sense I had seen funny movies before like you know comedy movies that were made you laugh but nothing nothing like that I'm like this guy's just talking it changed my life that's that's up but you can see the power of art yeah and it's connected to freedom because I've always viewed Richard Pryor as the freest men 20th century certain to free as black man along with Muhammad Ali he's the freest black man in the 20th century he is so self determining yeah the choices that he makes has to do with his own sense of self he doesn't care to other people think he done another King looking for other people's approval recognition he's gonna be who he is any pays a major cost for that he asked me anytime you that free in a world of such such on freedom you're gonna pay a major major cost well he had spectacular honesty in he - I feel like what happened was Lenny Bruce open the artform up and then Richard Pryor took it to a new place that's in terms of the the origins the real greats that's exact but then George oh yeah George Carlin Lee he was the most prolific an hour special every year until he died every year you different each one different and mmm but all three but at the but you are in that tradition I was a member when I saw you doing the the dogs and the cats getting inside of their souls you know I found that is don't man as an artist and as a human being that do that I said and it reminded me of prior it so when I walk in and I see your connection I said I'll be mmm I'll be I shouldn't be surprised well it was just being in the room with him was strange I just couldn't believe it was real you know I was in my 20s the you in the 20s he was in his he was at the end and like I said he couldn't walk anymore they used to have to carry him to the stage and but he performed sold out every night sitting in the chair yeah sat in the chair yeah yeah yeah but it was sold out every night because I've never seen I don't believe there's tapes of it I don't believe anybody recorded it if they did record it nobody released it it was just this was in the 90s and this was again this was the end of his life he just decided you know he was dying and he's decided to go back to his love to go out he wanted to go back doing stand-up cuz you got you look at that picture January 1st 1963 brother Pryor my brother just broke down on I didn't even know what he got a road in five days and he had a woman that he knew he moved to Pittsburgh apparently with so names about 22 years old that their prior conviction there it is there's the mugshot Wow what he got a beginning so he had a friend of his which is a woman that was singing in clubs her father was a cop and in his autobiography he wrote that among other things that he or she paid him or she gave him money he admitted to beating her ass so I beat her ass first didn't think about hitting a woman as much as I thought about my own survival that led him to being arrested sentenced to 90 days he served 35 of them and I had a seven dollar fine he had a crazy life man he grew up in a brothel yeah right - in Peoria yeah your you know yeah now what the violence against any sisters wrong but prior definitely man he yeah he was wild free cruel tinder genius crazy wrong as he could be right as he can he's a human being he's a complicated human being no yeah I never met him before but his spirit means the world to me me as well well I think every comic I've never met a single comic that doesn't think he's one of the most important figures in the history of the art probably the most important it's like him and Lenny Bruce in my opinion and then Kinnison later but Kinnison for a much much shorter time who would be the greatest female comic artist I think Roseanne Barr Roseanne yeah Roseanne is profoundly Talent yeah no doubt about she she doesn't get the credit she deserves because she's legitimately mentally ill and that's one of the things I had on the podcast to highlight literally mentally she was hit by a car when she was 15 she knows she spent nine months in a mental hospital yeah she lost her ability to count she was very good at mathematics before that and then after the car accident the severe head injury changed her personality yeah same with Kinison Kennison is hit by a car when he was young as well and changed his personality radically to head injuries make people very impulsive very wild and impulsive and often times a slave to their own impulses and I think Kennison was a big example that as was Roseanne but at Roseanne was the first really loud brash almost male female comedian who could kill like a man you know she was what about the young drivers and so I love great monique gets to me she she touches my soul every time she's on the stage have you ever seen Miss Pat no miss Pat's a monster really she's a monster and she's had a crazy life she's been on this podcast a couple times her life was insane I mean she was selling crack when she was 14 she had a baby when she was 14 it was a 13 she wasn't pregnant at 13 with a married man had a couple kids with him yeah she's she and she is so funny she's so wild and funny yeah there's something about the it goes back to Aristophanes you know it goes back to those early comics in the history of the West who were willing to tell the truth especially as it related to the everyday experiences of ordinary people you know the first plato's text itself you know the Republic was grounded in an imitation of the comic writers who were the first to really delve into everyday people's experiences not the well-to-do that's tragedy tragedy I only had to do it with the nobility and aristocracy but it was comedy that dwelled into the lives of everyday people then Plato takes the whole form and shifts it into the dialogue and makes Socrates of course to grant the grand hero but it was Aristophanes at least in the West who initiated this with the clouds and and frogs and so on and it goes all the way through from Jonathan Swift to Mark Twain's and Nathanael West to the brother-ish from Al Reid I mean these are the great American comic writers Twain Wes read and see comic writers are different in the tragic ones hmm Dostoevsky another couple Kafka's comic in his own deep way to the greatest of course a check off though Anton Chekhov I know you check out check off right no oh brother you haven't for they lived Rasim anton chekhov yeah oh you read three sisters I found you you read the Cherry Orchard any of the short stories he said over six thousand characters in his short stories man whoa - beats Rostand and into the in the ravine or even misery man the greatest one it's called a student it's only two and a half pages it's really a short story oh you read that tonight it blow you're not mine you listen you read that tonight listen - look Curtis may feel okay listen - low Stephen Sondheim okay Stephen out Sondheim no more into the woods Curtis may feel I loved and I lost and then the student check off oh man you'll be ready for some serious serious cardiac on your recommendation oh no no because I know you use serious intellectual to you you do your homework but I'm just saying this in terms of just enhancing you know all of our lives I mean the comic writers the comedian's various sorts be they on the stage a being on the page or I think the Vanguard some of the species in a very deep way you know because we as a species have to objectify our grief and our pain and our sadness and our sorrow and it begins with moans and groans and you transfigure those moans and groans first into song but song then moves into language and the language is not rational language of philosophy and dialectic but it's a language of stories especially the stories that are self-critical we laugh at ourselves and I'd add others we left with others rather than just at others so it's not that sudden glory that Hobbes talks about in regard to the comic when you're looking down and condescending you see that's an aristocratic conception of the comic you laugh and actor ordinary people who are so dirty and filthy it's profoundly anti-democratic right as if you know well-to-do folk don't fart right don't don't don't do number one and number two and falling and I love and act a fool and live lives of consent consistency right but act when you get these democratic forms of the comic see that's you and Pryor and Roseanne and Monique and George Carlin and all that that's free-spirit dope brother and most of our lives you see we're dealing with the whole history of a species of structures of domination oppression that's the history of the species for the most part and there's moments in which there's breakthroughs in which there's a freedom of spirits and then you have some institutionalization of that which is democracy that's why democracies are so fragile and usually don't last that long because it cuts so wrapt could radically against the sense of really wanting to be free I mean those jet skis right most people really are afraid of freedom they want to defer to Authority they want to conform and when they're introduced to freedom and they really caches whole they say oh my god it's tremendous cost to be paid but I like that there's something about that and they can hear it in the music they can see it in your comic art the priors and others and it allows these effects and consequences of people's lives to really enrich their lives before they die why do you think people are afraid of freedom well it's courage I mean there is no freedom without unbelievable unprecedented unstoppable courage and courage it's not widely distributed in the species make informed and complacent they're complicit in their cowardly they well-adjusted injustice and want to smile and walk around as peacocks rather than cut against the grain and have to bear witness and therefore end up on a cross or like Socrates condemned most of the great figures that we know yeah and there's more consequences for that now than ever oh yeah cancel culture that's exactly right yeah oh it's true it's very very true but I mean we live in a culture that's so corporatized commercialized marketized it's all about money money money status that status and you lose any deep sense of honor of character it's all about what appears to be the case it's the culture of superficial spectacle so it's all about image yeah you see yeah and image is just some surface phenomena well I can't recommend your bleep race matters enough and one of the reasons is because of your analysis of that your your understanding of this the superficial aspect of the pursuit that so many people are locked into from cradle to the grave and you just you encapsulated that so well and and the way you worded it and the way you phrased it it's it's so it resonates so well and I I really admire this lifelong pursuit that you have for not just understanding these things but explaining them in such a succinct way where it's absorbable like that book it's in the 25th anniversary I wanted to talk to you about it because that's the one I read and it's so strange when you read something that's so it's so current even though it's 25 years old it rings true and does that sometimes does that feel futile where you you you have the same issues for that you spoke on 25 years ago and it's very little change in those 25 years no wonderful deep question though man I appreciate you times that you spent reading our race matters but no it's never a futile don't man I've never futile because you have a conception of victory that is not messianic or salvific you're not trying to save people you're not trying to be a messiah to bring some kind of grand gospel to people you're simply trying to touch people's lives so when you enrich and enable person's life to win which you've talked about that right there you already talk about the ways in which you were touched mm-hmm that means there's no futility at all yeah no certainly not if you took those via the fecundity of it it's all all we can do you know as human beings is to try to inspire one another and encourage one another and enable one another and Noble one another in that in and of itself was what the great John Coltrane called a force for good how do I become based on a Love Supreme a force for good in a cold and cruel world hey star love supreme absolutely absolutely and love supreme is not loving the abstract right it's a love of beauty in its concrete forms it's the love of goodness in his concrete forms it's the love of truth in its concrete forms now I'm a Christian revolution at Christian so I got a love of God mediated through a Palestinian Jew named Jesus but that's tied to a justice that comes out of prophetic Judaism right and we know Judaism Christianity Islam all of these religions for me I have no wholesale monopoly on how we understand the world because he all emerged various historical moments but when it comes to this love that allows us to persist in a world in which cruelty and Envy contempt manipulation dishonesty and this shot through all of us no we're not finger-point in the name oh no you know I've called up brother Donald Trump a gangster over and over again and I and I say that because there's a gangster inside of me I got to reconquer it every day so I don't know gangsters when I see and gangsters not a subjective expression it's an objective condition mmm if you grab on a woman's parts that's gangster you Steagall somebody's oil in other country that's gangster you lions and these people have said that America's garbage quit lying that's gangster they got a critique of America you did to an American carnage in your inauguration you said or you're talking about the full sisters in Congress saying well evil Jews no Diana said evil Jews they said evil doings of Israel every nation state has done some evil things right if there's a Palestinian state which I hope there is they're gonna do some evil things every nation state has to be accountable us Ethiopia Guatemala Israel China and so forth and so on and every nation state has been associated with certain forms of barbarism we know that but there's some good things some wonderful things about Israel some wonderful things about Palestinians and formations of creating a state that's wonderful things about America I mean a lot of people say even brother Trump's wall they hate America no they love American comics they love American music you ask sister Talia beYOU asks us to Priestly y'all love Aretha I've read the Franklin means the world to me what about marriage a marriage a means the world marriage a and Aretha are as American as Donald Trump even more in some ways they many along their people been that 10 generation yeah Donald Trump's grandfather just arrived his mother straight from Scotland precious Marianne 1930 she arrives right and so in that sense you say wait wait oh well quit lie and let's just be honest and candid just like the comics let's just be honest and candid and recognize coz what is the definition of comedy it is first drama which is conflict emotionally felt and critically reflected upon but it's that conflict that's rooted in incongruity things don't fit so that's the possibility of hypocrisy right and we know Apocrypha is the tribute of Vice to virtue so that just standards and you fall short so you can laugh at it now when it's really deep comedy is talking about the human condition see that's a deeper thing now see that's when you get checked off and Shakespeare and Joyce and the Blues because deep comedy is the recognition of limits and incongruity at the highest levels of the mind heart and soul that's the different thing so I mean you can start with comedy with you know the clown rulers who walk around slipping on bananas or the sophisticated professor who doesn't realize that he got a banana hanging out the back of his pocket when he's lecturing with the students they buddy laughs and he don't know what's going on well that's bodily based comedy you know farts and bananas and so forth and it's important yes but high comedy is the highest levels of human dignity love thought music mathematics metaphysics and then recognize all of those are in congruous they're broken they're fractured there's dramatic conflict of incongruity at the highest levels of who we are as a species now that's deep stuff there's deep Oh Oh Lord Lord and one of the most fundamental questions of Western civilization is how come Socrates never cries and Jesus never laughs ooh that's the question Thomas Moore was wrestling with in the Tower of London before he was executed in his dialogues or tribulation Socrates never shared the tear what does that mean the founder of philosophy in the modern West has a love of wisdom but he never loves people because it's impossible to love human beings and not shed tears you go to your mama's funeral and you're not shedding tears and you're committed to the socratic ideal of self mastery and self control you need to get off the crack pipe get off show her the depths of your love for her through being outside of your self mastery the tears will flow you said and it's the other way it's like your daughter this precious thing that you got when we walk in for your daughter when she graduates you and your wife gonna have tears of joy that ain't the moment for self mastery that's not the moment to be Socratic and so when Socrates is dying his wife walks in Zen tippy and she's crying he's to get her get her away again I can't stand to use that's a problem yeah that's a problem you see I come from Blackpool we start with tears all the mess we had to come terms with you know to me cries and so forth the hebrew scripture begins with the cries of oppressed people - right but then Jesus never laughs wanna see that's a deep one that is the one that's GK Chesterton Justin said Jesus turns over the tables of the moneychangers he does not conceal his rage crucial Jesus does weep that's one of the most profound verses and in the Christian Bible right jesus wept you know unlike Socrates why did Jesus weep he wept for Jerusalem he wept for Lazarus he left what for his friends but Jesus hides and conceals his mirth that's what justesen says is there any laughter in the Bible well Isaac means laughter when you think of the joke of an older Sarah given birth to a young person in a older age and so forth but it's hard to catch Jesus laughing none of the synoptic God the Gospels have Jesus laughing some people thought they discerned a grin somewhere because he turned wine into water he probably had a little little grin exact exactly but but you can never get the full scale and variety of the human condition in any one tradition I think one of the beauties of what you're saying here one of the beautiful things about what you're saying here is the complexity of human beings and when you're dealing with the situation between these girls that called themselves a squad and Donald Trump and you deal with these very simplistic things like these chants of send her back or lock her up or they hate America or you know this this is simplifying things is is so attractive to some people and so attractive during political discourse right dude during these these times are you trying to rally up a campaign and get get the audience behind you this is one of these simplistic things resonate but as a human being we know that things like I don't these I don't subscribe to this idea that human beings are good or bad I think there's other way yeah I'm sure look the way Donald Trump loves his family I'm sure there's love in that kind I'm sure there is on me he's had some you know relations to his mother and his brothers and sisters that were not ones of sheer manipulation of domination there's no doubt as a human being it's important to keep track of his humanity but at the same time what happens is the dominant patterns of behavior this is rise me about brother Trump specially the fact that he's head of the American Empire and and head of the government you see them when you have dominant patterns of behavior that are completely unaccountable see for so long he's been able to get away with things with no accountability at all yes that's what makes him a kind of Peter Pan like figure up buddy till he became president she grew powerful yeah but he hadn't grown up but even as president he hasn't grown up people would had thought that he would grow into the office no he just hasn't grown up he tried to manipulate the office position to change to be what he is that's right and I think people love that there's certain people that resonates with them they think that's so attractive they love it well they I think they love it because it's experience that I mean the first thing that you know Trump was able to do was to expose the prepackaged commodities that we call politicians yes that he came across as somebody who was just himself yes you see just gangster that he is yeah and he just tell the truth oh I was a close friend of Hillary's I was been at the same weddings and so forth cuz that's how the elite circulate yes and in an American Empire but then when they discovered long the whole he's now he's posing himself as some kind of oppositional figure and yet he's tied to big money tied to big military when he gets in he brings in the old-school militarist people he still dropping bombs on the nine countries had been dropping bombs for the last number of years tax cuts sound exactly the same and Mitch McConnell and others warned it we thought we had something different here you see and it has to do with the what woman is the largest origin we have to be honest about this that see we live in both a very fragile and precious experiment in democracy and we live in an empire that is experiencing profound decline decay and deterioration simultaneous so you can from the very beginning United States was really in some ways much more tied to gold and resources and land and so this crucial Democratic experiment is predicated on the monstrous crime against indigenous peoples that we've never come to terms with so you get a lot of neoliberal chatter about America's original swing of slavery that's a lie the original sin was we had to decide whether we were going to coexist with indigenous peoples or dominate them and the decision was for the most part genocidal effect in terms of domination so it's a settler colonial society a colony of Britain you see then we enslaved the Africans who become the basis of our economy and the vast majority of profits made were actually tied to slavery that's why so many of the president's first presidents in American slaveholders and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court slaveholders and so forth that that doesn't mean that certain democratic practices were not being enacted but it was enacted for white brothers with property the white brothers who had no property they couldn't vote at all the women of course couldn't vote until 1920 so he had domestic households in which they had to find some sense of fulfillment that's what history of patriarchy and misogyny in part are connected and then tremendous efforts come to expanding it expanding it and this is why even when brother Trump talks about socialism he doesn't realize the pledge of allegiance was written by Francis Bellamy who was a socialist the song American the Beautiful which is one of the most beautiful sultry child sing that song it take you to a differently I mean he's seeing things that we can't see and you know he's blind you know what I mean America the Beautiful Elizabeth Lee Bates socialist professor Wellesley who was our greatest poet Walt Whitman deep ties to socialism who was our greatest philosopher John Dewey Democratic Socialist his whole life Helen Keller deaf mute blind graduated Radcliffe socialists Reinhold Niebuhr the greatest Christian thinker to twentieth-century democratic socialist moral man and immoral Society Martin Luther King jr. democratic so the Ella Baker Democrat democratic socialism is as American as apple pie but with the Communists and the Communists threat and the Soviet Union and all of his repression and regimentation and violation of liberties and killing of the culottes and so forth in the American mind socialism becomes associated with communism and so you saw brother Lindsey the other day right yes he looked like a cartoonist version of Joseph McCarthy there are all communists they're all communists and you see what happens is in the mail fascist discourse is treating where around the world if you couldn't define a community is pure and then characterize those on the outside who are threatening as impure and didn't view yourself as those coming to the rescue to preserve the purity it can be based on race you can be based on religion you can be based on politics preserve that purity we saw it in the 50s with the hysteria the comments for what Smith Act they're deported or they taken to jail I mean the first the first city councilman from Harlem Benjamin Davis went to jail because he was a communist you see because they were the impure mmm now communism needs to be radically called into question in terms of it nominating forms like the Soviet Union China on the mile and so forth and so on but at the same time when you look at Karl Marx and his critique of capitalism he this is prior to let it prior to Stalin prior he says capitalism is tied to this obsession with profit that puts profit before people and it will generate all Nagappa leads in which there will be grotesque levels of wealth inequality and the only way that poorn working people will be able to gain access to any resources to do organizing and mobilizing now you can accept that Marxist insight without being a Marxist just telling the truth do you think that socialism just hasn't been implemented correctly is that what you think because like the the argument has always been show me a socialist economy or socialist government that ever worked right right but right there's so many people that find the idea of socialism attractive because it it combines this idea of a community with a nation and that we're all tied together and we we obviously have some socialist aspects to our civilization in terms of like utilities and we outsource the military firefighters outside as police there has to be some kind of ER mental control but the the problem is this that if we have to view democratic socialism as a moment in the larger movement of democracy my dear brother Jeff stout is one of the great philosophers and thinkers of democracy calls them egalitarian freedom traditions and that's simply a way of saying that if you look at the world through the lens of the masses of people who are poor and working people what are the conditions under which they can have security from domination what are the conditions under which they can have dignity by holding forms of oppression at arm's length and for me it's not an ism you see in capitalism visa vie feudalism can generate liberal he's in freedoms I'm forward hmm and that's precisely what the middle classes did when they broke from feudalism in Europe or broke from feudalism in other parts of the world right you had to overthrow kings and queens in the name of personal liberties but those personal liberties were confined to often to white brothers with property hmm and the white brothers with no property they either trying to hold on to the white and so they become like the white brothers with property or they make moral choices and said I want to be a person of integrity I want to fight with the folk who are being excluded and this is one of the problems in talking about race and white supremacy in America because you see we think too often in monolithic categories there's never been of white supremacy without fighting against white supremacy and that includes white brothers and sisters there's a tradition from and Breeden from Myles Horton you know of Highlander Center you got that wonderful picture of Rosa Parks she was at Highlander Center four months before she was arrested before she sat down on a bus and order standing up for justice right there hi listen on the mouse horn who was Myles Horton a white brother who brought black folk and white folk together went to Union seminary trained on the Reinhold Niebuhr he had cousins in the Ku Klux Klan Wow so his Thanksgiving dinners were very complicated but that's true for a whole lot of white brothers who fight against white supremacy and Braden Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel me Atwoods ie you have a whole tradition of white brothers been fighting against white supremacy you get it in the music Beks Beiderbecke he's sitting at the feet of Louis Armstrong and he's a great artist Louis genius of geniuses right and that middle class brother from Iowa you asked him about white supremacy u.s. Brubeck about white supremacy you asked any of the Paul Desmond all of these folks who are connected to traditions in which black humanity brown humanity is seen and affirmed you had a point in the book race matters that resonated with me that I never really thought of before and what you said was that because of the fact that the United States has this deep history of slavery and the slavery of African Americans that white people became white people instead of polish and German and Italian instead of it being like most other countries where they the Italians think of themselves as Italians and the Greeks or the Greeks those were white people they're all coldly combined as white people I never thought about that before know what I mean you've got these scholars of American Studies nail pain was one of the towering ones but it goes all the way back to brother Alexander and and David David wrote anger and some others who've been talking about the way in which whiteness was created take for example an Irish brother who caused Ellis Island his people been dealing with 800 years of vicious British colonialism and imperialism vicious attacks various famines that in some ways created or at least enabled and so on they get to New York and they're told that they're white and they say no no because we know the British are white and we're not British right oh oh but then they say yes you are look at brother West look at your mom look at Letitia where you gonna go on the Jim Crow bus I can just get off the boat from Ireland right you go to the front you would vanilla folk you go to the back you with the chocolate fuck what you're gonna do and for our precious Jewish brothers and sisters it was even more complicated more complicated right they get there no we're not with the goy and we're not with the Gentiles y'all been oppressing us for 2,000 years pogroms ghettos holocaust vicious attacks and so on but then they get then say well are we gonna be in the back with the black folk some of them did he says because you got a rich tradition of progressive Jews knowing Chomsky what he got back there Stanley around wit what it got back there with the black folk you say that me but you got some other Jewish folk like any other group well we kind of lukewarm this is kind of moved back and forth and then someone want to simulate completely especially the highbrow German Jews we're actually white as well as the Gentiles you're in America now get beyond that old-world prejudice you say well you better check yourself cuz every Christian civilization we know it's not through with Jewish hatred mmm don't don't believe the hype soonerlater is gonna be manifest you see what I mean and so in that way you can see the discourse of whiteness blackness Brown this redness and so forth becomes so so deeply rooted in American law American structures American perceptions and this is why the arts are so crucial because it's primarily in the music and in the arts where the breakdown of white supremacy begins to take place in the country it's not the politicians it really isn't it really isn't there's no accident that the first massive form of entertainment in the United States is what the minstrels in blackface and you see what was going on with blackface where a lot and others have talked about the love and theft on the one hand there's a fear of black freedom because black freedom somehow means less freedom for whites there is a fear of black creativity because that means maybe white supremacy is a lie maybe they're human just like us maybe they just as creative imaginative and telling it just like us then they hear the music and they say oh they got something going on in the black side of town but we don't know it's like you're going to see Pryor right somebody who told you old brother Joe white supremacy of America tells you that black creativity black intelligence black genius doesn't exist and you go see Pryor with your parents and you go away thinking dis Negros a genius somebody lied to me I got to recognize that and then you recognize those the whole tradition of Prayer and we go on and off from the Coltrane serovar and on and on and on right and so people begin to think especially white buzzin sisters my parents have been lying when it comes to black intelligence imagination and genius and humanity and yet the structures make it difficult for us to come together we're talking about up until 1960 that's a long time though 1776 the 1964 and 5 that's a long time for both slavery and neo slavery to be in place in here we are now fifty-four years later trying to create a multiracial democracy which is a beautiful beautiful thing and it's already been enacted in the in into jazz groups slide stones bands multiracial the combination did the studying of the commies did you chew all have you sit down with comics y'all talk about the genius across race and Jim jr. gene and gender as if it's a natural thing that already shatters the white supremacist internets and male supremacist categories of lightness blackness all in different silos but it's so hard to do it on the ground see part of the problem of talking about race in America so I've been very critical of a number of contemporary black intellectuals because white supremacy cuts so deep in the culture people begin to think it has magical powers and somehow it it just floats above American history as if it's just part of our DNA in a biological way but all conceptions of race in the modern world are grounded in predatory capitalism so that the talk about whiteness and blackness becomes a way of rationalizing social structures like slavery and Jim Crow and it has to do with trying to extract labor resources it's an attack on their humanity and identity but it's tied to economic structure so to talk only about race means we hide and conceal the social structures that are generating unbelievable suffering for everybody mmm everybody you see and so the last thing you want is talk about race I'd say the same thing about gender in the way ginger is much more complex because genders been around for so so long every culture that we know almost but in modern conceptions of race are tied to modern conceptions of predatory capitalism here and abroad which includes imperialism which includes empires such as the United States comes out of the British Empire we engage in a heroic courageous revolt against the British Empire it was a magnificent struggle that's what I like about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson I'm an anti imperialist they were anti imperialist now they're urban guerrillas they picking up guns they fight I don't go that far but they're also white supremacist you see so as soon as they overthrow or push back the British Empire what do you get in the declaration of independence beautiful words about equality but you also get savages we got to take their land and you get an empire of Liberty this is where the comics come in what does an empire of Liberty look like who's not in on the Liberty it's a whole lot of people not in on it no that was Karlin right Karlin had this bit about this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to be free that's right and talk about the American dream you got to be do you think much like this country is an experiment in self democracy a very recent experiment when you look at human history hundreds of thousands of years that we've been human there's really only been a couple of years hundred years of this do you think that that's maybe the lens that we should look at something like democratic socialism through not that it can't work but that it hasn't been implemented correctly before that's exactly that's why we got to get beyond the ISM you're absolutely right see what makes not just United States has been democratic experiments all around the world in various circumstances we become central stage because we become a world power that understands itself as a democracy with all the contradictions that go ahead and an amitab begin as a settler colonial enterprise still got slavery patriarchy workers don't have the right to engage in collective bargaining in the United States in the nineteen thirties hmm Argentina had in the eighteen thirties Argentina's not known to being on the cutting edge for social justice love you down there in Argentina but they know that but they had a collective bargaining why because our robber barons and our power elites was so powerful hmm you see rockefeller and company had private militias that were bigger than a lot of public armies to make sure workers were not able to engage in collective bargain I was in San Francisco just yesterday at the Commonwealth Club which is now lodged it the Longshoremen's Association which is fascinated Commonwealth well-to-do ruling class Harry bridges longshoremen strong unions Jack London another great social is there in Oakland right and what would he trying to do they were just trying to ensure that ordinary people gain access to jobs with a living wage decent education this is one reason why I've spent so much time with my dear brother Bernie Sanders right because it's a democratic project that simply says how come poor children can't have access to some of the things that the children of the well-to-do have they have the same value and of course as a Christian for me they have exactly the same value right so how will they get it well here comes socialist movements that say first thing you want to do is we're gainst child labor laws yes that's the jungle that's Upton Sinclair he's a socialist tried to be governor California right and what were they doing what were these these Capitol is doing they're hiding these kids at six years old seven years old they were dying at 30 there were no laws against child labor end up working seven days a week so the labor movement has brought us to weaken and I'm not talking about the singer from Canada god bless him I'm talking about the two days we have off because if we didn't have that from the socialist moving in the labor movement they'd have been working young kids seven day they did that year after year decade after decade that's greed right and that's that's read there's no accountability that's where that whole idea of the let the market decide falls apart thanks because the market just wants profit right absolutely and that doesn't mean that markets cannot be used in democratic ways but they need to be ethical but they gotta be ethical you got to have some accountability and regulation and child labor laws were very important at a breakthroughs at that time but there are other you had you need to have laws to make sure the water was clean and the food was regulated and clean and so there's a narrative that you get from poor people often or people that are lower middle class that are against the concept of socialism because they equate it with people that want a free ride that's really they equate it with people that don't want to work hard that's right and that that's it's a strange narrative when you consider all the things we talked about already like the what we need with the fire department and the police department and all the different ways that socialism does form utilities and all the different ways of socialism does form a part of our culture and our community why do you think that that is this narrative and how does that narrative get reshaped because that narrative of that the only reason why people want socialism is because they want a free ride right right whoo that's a wonderful question but the one is that you had first we had to listen very closely to our right-wing brothers and sisters and conservatives and Midler's because oftentimes I mean they're human means like anybody else and they had their own arguments I don't think they have strong ones but they have their own arguments so the first thing you say about that is what makes you think that the well-to-do don't have free rides what is inheriting wealth all about well inheriting wealth is free rap salutes all it is what is freq the connection so getting into the prep schools and then Ivy League schools and so forth even though they work is still a kind of free ride so if they're preoccupied with this issue of being free ride we tell them let's make sure that people do work hard yes and sacrifice and therefore in some way deserve what they have now if just based on that Prince the upper echelon of American society would be indicted yes deeply indicted and it's not a matter of hating the rich because I don't believe in hating anybody individually I hate greed yeah I hate injustice I hate white supremacy I hate anti-jewish prejudice I hate anti Palestinian presence I hate patriarchy and so forth but the human beings where these ideologies filter through hmm are still human beings yes you see what I mean so that's the beginning of it now of course part of the question here is has to do with they'll say well we've wasted this money on the poor you said we'll wait a minute Donald Trump just passed the 750 billion dollar military budget Democrats voted for it too how much waste is in the military why is 60 cent of every $1 coming out of the federal budget tied to the military why is it no close oversight and accountability of it how come American people don't know about the four countries that we're bombing or assisting other countries in bombing we can go right down packets down Afghanistan Yemen absolutely Mali Niger Somalia Iraq and we can go on and on and on right how come we don't know about the 48 hundred military units 587 around the world we got US Special Operations in 128 countries only under 97 in the world right what about the soldiers who died hardly any talk about it what about the innocent people we kill hardly and they talk about it what about the drones and we still drop it and not always on military combatants but innocent people almost primarily on innocent people sometimes even disproportionately those are precious people too you know it may have the same value as anybody in Ethiopia America Chicago you feel that don't drones are particularly insidious because it doesn't even seem like it's really happening because it's over about doing it absolutely it's done lonely distance remotely no sensitivity at all apparently the PTSD that suffered by those remote drone operators is pretty profound too you could understand yes yeah II understand yet no serious public conversation about an entire day I was on the plane the other day and the pilot says I hope you all are able to take a few minutes of your time because we got a family outside waiting for the body if someone just killed in Afghanistan's an Italian family in Chicago one of the saddest things you won't see in your life man as a family lined up and they bring in the body out and you say to yourself how come there's no public spotlight on that and you see what I was growing up in the 60s Walter Cronkite Vietnam we saw the bodies well during the Bush administration they made it illegal to take photographs of flag-draped coffins which is unbelievably insane that's exactly right and continued under Obama and company you know you say well wait a minute they they're paying this ultimate cost and the they changed the narrative the tears of the the families and the kidding put a public spotlight on it my god and then of course they lie to us as well well our drones are not in any way killing civilians and end up killing an American and they have a press conference the same day and economic compensation the family the rest of their life I agree with that but what about the drones that are killing folks in Yemen and Somalia in Pakistan and Afghanistan oh they denied her even killing them and you say quit lying that's John Brennan and company using both Bush and Obama administration you see how do we keep track of those in the name of what democratic accountability that's not socialism socialism is democratic accountability but there's been socialism without democratic accountability and what do you get tyranny that's Soviet Union and company but when you get capital with no democratic accountability what do you get you get a predatory capitalism with gross wealth inequality and everyday people the masses are poor and working people fighting for crumbs and there's also this denial of it amongst the most patriotic they don't want to consider it they don't want to factor it in to what we think of when we think of America the great we don't you want you don't want to factor in those innocent people which I what was the last time we checked it was in the 90% right of people that are there killed by drones are actually innocent it's it's some insane numbers but we have to have voices that's part of the problem though you have to have voices that say I don't give a damn for popularity I'm trying to be wedded to integrity I want to put a smile on my Grandmama's face in the grave and she told me as a Christian that if the kingdom of God is within you then everywhere you go you ought to leave a little heaven behind and heaven takes the form of laying bare the humanity of each and every one of us especially the least of these that's a 25th chapter Matthew write what you do to the least of these you do unto me who are the least of these the orphan the widow the poor the children the elderly the workers the gays and lesbians the trans especially the transduce day they just trashed like I don't know what but they're black folk they're brown folk they're white poor they're indigenous peoples not just here but around the world and what does that mean that means that you have a certain kind of calling that will always pitch you over against those who are well adjusted to injustice hmm no matter what color they are well adjusted to injustice it's very very beautiful way of putting it no it's it that's that's part of the suit part part of the problem the American Dream didn't go far enough the American American Dream says I'm gonna work hard sacrifice and get mine and live large and some vanilla suburb maybe with a trophy spouse I didn't feel good about myself you say nothing wrong would want in the gay ancestor resources nothing wrong with working hard nothing wrong with living where you want to live but then the question becomes now you're successful but you're not great greatness has to do what he or she who uses their success for something bigger than them service to others service to the least of these so that the great ones like to Richard Pryor's you see not a matter of how much money he made as a matter of his soul in his comedy and the love that he left in his legacy long as the King jr. died basically a broke man gave every penny that he won from the Nobel Prize to the movement Malcolm X only only had $150 in his pocket who cares about the riches black person in 1968 in 1965 that's ephemera we're talking about deep joe i deep love we will remember those who raised their voices and said in the name of something bigger than my ego with my narcissism and my hedonism and we all have it we all have it so you know we have to always be self-critical in there we go we all fall short you know the great Samuel Beckett number great now the great comic writer try again fail again fail better mm-hmm that's the story of our life yeah try again fell again fail better but even if failing better we can at least raise our voices and try to connect it to movements and organizations and structures and thank God we still do have a a significant number of decent people in the American Empire they just feel powerless well there's this conversation that's happening now right and there's a conversation that's based on the information of recognizing the fact that so many people have wasted deep aspects of their lives long long lives pursuing meaningless things and and recognizing that there is a lot of injustice in this world and that people are afraid of admitting that injustice because then they would somehow another be complicit in the enactment that injustice I think it's one of the things that people are terrified of when you talk about doing something to reinvigorate poor and disenfranchised communities that's right they start talking about the welfare state or well but it's this is not how things should be done then people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps not recognizing that everybody is in started the same starting line absolutely there's a concept that I've been talking about that if you really cared about America you would want less losers like what it was the best way what's the best way to love America what would you want more winners you'd want everybody to be a winner if we have these disenfranchised parts of this country that have been that way forever there's a guy that's been on this podcast who was a police officer in Baltimore stammers Michael would and he talked about how when he was a police officer he recognized the systemic racism and how crippling it was and one of the things that he recognized was they found a piece of paper that was a blotter report of all the different various crimes that were committed from the 1970s it was a some year in 1970 it was the exact same crimes in the exact same communities that he was dealing with them and he was generation after recognizing the redlining about the fact that there was areas where black people were not allowed to buy homes that they kept them in these communities the same crimes kept occurring in the same places and all they were doing was going in there and arresting people and nothing changed and nothing was fixed and as a police officer he was realizing and just becoming aware of the fact that this is he's a part of the system he didn't want to be a part of the system anymore but he was a part of this system that is creating this problem when you address that though the people that don't suffer in those communities that aren't a part of that community there's a natural inclination to resist no that's true and it's because they don't want to do anything they don't they don't want to think they're responsible they don't want to think they're a part of it they don't want to discuss it even discussing it you feel resistance they will in the state of denial yes trying to avoid and trying to evade no it's it's very it's very real that's very real but you know it also works with Ian communities of people of color and this is again why I think we have to resist any monolithic care or homogenious characterizations of people see so they need time to talk about white supremacy you've got the John Brown's and you know Mary Ellen Pleasant who was the a black woman who was worth 347 million dollars in the 1840s whoa she's called the mother of human rights in California rich white brother and he died I wanna look with millions of dollars first thing she did she gave John Brown a million dollars Wow John Brown hadn't even notice from her in his pocket well then he was at Harpers Ferry that's how he survived see now John Brown was killing some people I think that's wrong I don't believe in innocent people no matter who they are no matter what color but at the same time John Brown had a love of black people bunch of deeper too many black people have of themselves as he's willing to die for black people but the same is true within let's say black communities you've got okay one percent of the population in America who owned 41% of the wealth you got three individuals who have wealth equivalent to 160 million fellow citizens but within the black community the top 1% of black folk at what was 70 percent of the wealth so that means you got a lot of precious Jamal's and the teachers out there who don't who are told to live vicariously through the lives of black celebrities so it's all about representation rather than substantive transformation you get that in politicians you know you got a black president all of y'all must be free isn't that a beautiful thing live through him live through the family beautiful achievement magnificent achievement but it's not about symbolic representation only this is about fundamental transformation so it's a challenge Mary Ellen Pleasant and others in Martin King and others are challenges for those of us who do have some resources to still raise our voices because you can be black highly well adjusted to injustice economically terms of race and so forth and the same is true you can be brown you can be red so it's not just a matter of looking for that one individual who represents it's a matter of connecting that representation to fundamental transformation if there's no fundamental transformation you end up with a whole generation of peacocks look at me look at me look at me all about forage and what does that do that falls directly into the culture of superficial spectacle yeah last thing we need is just spectacle with no substance in that way and this is the battle within within the communities of peoples of color because it's not it's not gonna be a matter of just pointing out white supremacy of course white supremacy is fundamental foundation in part of the country it's not the only foundation because you got resistance to white supremacy Lydia Maria child she wrote a book in 1834 called an appeal but that class of Americans called Africans it was deeply influenced by one of the greatest works ever written at that time by David Walker appealed the colored citizens of the world she's a wife sister she is as vanilla as Doris Day in the eighteen thirties fundamental part of the black freedom movement right but you see those folks need to be lifted up because what does that do that exposes our humanity in terms of the choices we make not just the skin color we have and I would say the same thing in terms of gender the brothers who are fundamentally concerned about breaking the back of patriarchy when we know patriarchy is shot to us because we grew up in the 1950s and 60s no man escapes it but you try to recon at all and the same is true or our precious gays and lesbians and trans folk you see to be decent human beings who make moral choices yeah I believe in the primacy of the moral and the spiritual the centrality of the artistic especially the musical and especially the comics as the vanguard who represent a freedom and a courage and a vision to connect us as you and beings because you can't really be a comic with a wholesale Nazi ideology now you can be a Nazi genius like Martin Heidegger who was a great philosopher and a genius and a Doug when it comes to pop when it comes to politics you see but a comic has got to be able to be open enough to deal with the incongruity and inconsistency and the sheer absurdity of it all you talked about moments of freedom earlier and I recognize that is like one of the greatest things you ever see when someone's on stage and they're killing there's moments where everyone's together they're all together locked up in the laughter and they're all together there's a sense of community that you share with the people that are in the room absolutely it does bring people together even if it's for brief moments for a few seconds or yeah the taste buds are not to be trashed life consists of moment yes you know what at me yes definitely and it's in a democracy you see it's those moments that constitute the memory of what could be yeah as opposed to what's in place you know the great August Wilson the great playwright of black playwright deeply influenced he said by the Blues Baraka and beard and a row man be written the great painter but I marry Baraka of course from Newark like yourself like Sarah Vaughan and Philip Roth right different newer he used to say that performance authorizes alternative realities for the audience that gets them to unsettle their conventional perceptions of the world whoa and that's what great artists and great comics but that's what that's what you yeah that's you doing strange times oh brother that you bring in the fact that we're living in such a grim moment what I'd call you know an American Empire in decline and we all need to call for its regeneration its Democratic revitalization and regeneration but how do we do that only by example man because there's a difference between what the great Roberto Unger calls biographical time and historical time all of us are born in circumstance is not of our own choosing we're only here for so long we all have insecurities anxieties and fears knowing that our body's willing to go extinction when they very soon and therefore to deal with those insecurities and fears and anxieties you have to have certain structures of feeling and valued it gives you some sense of worth wildness as you move through time from mother's womb to tomb right and it's only in biographical time because we only got one life decided Jordan and there's no person who's a messiah not days people will tell you they are but you say okay just go at it be self deceived and drink your coffee I can keep moving because there's no messiahs out there there's no saviors out there there's no messiahs in groups there's no messiahs in collectivities there's only lives to be live we back to check off again lies to be lived acknowledging things were in place before we arrives so therefore we ought to have gratitude for the love that we received that's how I begin my my whole life I am Who I am because somebody loved me it's mom it's dad it's my brother's my sisters it's my friends right and I don't deserve it and I have to somehow following ashford wins Astrid and Simpson they say send it like a puff of smoke you got to let it go spread whatever love justice by example examples are the gold cart of justice that's a wonderful line inconsequently cook pure reason examples are the gold cart of judgment the judgments we make are predicated on the examples that we have and we must have examples of greatness if you're gonna be a classical composer you better study some loot later you're gonna be a serious artist of the musical theater you better study a genius who's still alive named Stephen Sondheim from West Side Story the company needs a Sunday in the park with George - passion - Sweeney Todd across the board not to imitate but just to know what greatness is genre few in hip-hop you better study some Rakim mmm woohoo you better study some follow-the-leader laughs put Tupac that's right you best study the folk look great it's the same way you know you study Pryor and Bruce Lenny Bruce and the others and Roseanne Barr and the others but that's one of the more important parts of being a person right is to really your diet of what you take in in terms of what whatever whether it's your art or whether it's your education try to take in the best and most inspirational and the most spectacular versions of human human endeavors absolutely see that's one of reasons why Sports is a young American religion sure because in sports and whatever for I know that you got Taekwondo and thing yeah yeah I mean and you understand the role of excellence with the grid Scott are tazed at that place but to be able just to turn on our television and see brother LeBron James Dean thing that's another context that cuts across race class gender and so forth LeBron how you doing the memories of Mike Jordan it was so important when he sat out those three years in the late 1960s because he wouldn't go to Vietnam courage man Muhammad Ali along with Richard Pryor the Richards it was a freest black black man the 20th century but see that the boxing is so crucial as well as the other the other sports because for black people every other sphere in the society is unfair and unfree but when you get in that ring and the referee is fair hmm you finally get fair competition yeah that's why Jack Johnson was such a threat you remember Johnson walking white brothers out there would be racial riots against black folk killing black folk all across the country don't you get the idea and just because he beat the white man in the context of fairness yeah that you can beat anybody right and that goes all the way to Muhammad Ali it's very stirring you know the time I spent with another genius named Prince could we miss so so so very much just nobody like it but he like Miles Davis view Jack Johnson that's his favorite black me mmm and that interesting well he was a pioneer because there was none before him Jack Johnson was Jack generally the first by him by himself in many way there was born I think but not as famous not as fairy but it turns in a spotlight yeah there was other great boxers a black time but he but he just took it yeah lead the country and so forth yeah see and what Muhammad Ali you know you got someone who was just himself in the context of a social movement that was taking place at the same time so he would associate himself with the black freedom movement called a civil rights movement he joined the Nation of Islam under honorable eyes of Mohammed vain became then we came very close to my comics and had to deal with the split in its own way and ultimately becomes you know AM Orthodox Muslim but at the same time recognizes his political consciousness was tied to the Nation of Islam and so forth and for him to do that I mean to be associated with the art of Elijah Mohammed the Nation of Islam probably had about 0.1 percent approval in the country and probably about four or five percent in the black community because at that time black folk and black Christians were just afraid you know the black Muslims but it was Malcolm X who in it all of his genius made it so broadly conceived that even Christians like myself I'm a Jesus loving free black man but I can't live my life without Malcolm mmm and he's Muslim to the core right he's praying five times a day you know what I mean that's just the beginning of he's also very complicated too because his grandfather was white well he was white his father was a Garvey I his mother was tied to the iteration but fathers Garvey Ida was killed his mother of course puttin us in a sane asylum he's a foster child the great stories he tells in the autobiography of malcolm x one of the great classics really memoirs in history of american civilization was very misunderstood in terms the cultural narrative of who he was absolutely no it's true he used to say sincerity it's my only credential in the powerful damn sincerity so when he said white men and women are Devils and he believed it he's wrong white brother says not Devils then he says I changed my mind they're not Devils they too many got devilish behavior he's right because that's due up too many of all of us out Devils baby I see but when he said the first thing he said what he meant he meant what he said when he said the second thing he said what he meant he meant what you said you know how many folk do we have like that Friday that aren't scared to change their mind and and speak what's deep yeah so see one of the great gifts of the artists and I speak about this especially in the black tradition is what we could call soulful canosa's ke in OS is now canosa's means self giving self donating and self-emptying so if you go to a James Brown concert that brother goes for fo and a half hours and gives everything every fiber of his being and at the end of every concert what does he say I'm an extension of you you're an extension of me can't exist without you did we fail to play a song that somebody came to hear an assister holla you didn't play soft and you say hit it Bootsy that's all because his service you see our green go to our green concert that brother came walk hmm after the concert he's given everything from falsetto to tenant to everything ultimately that's what happened with Prince right I mean Prince had such incredible pain in his hips hips jumping off piano that's on jump off that's how he got hooked on pain pills that's exactly and that's what killed him ultimately John Coltrane blowing his horn as if his neck is gonna snap every night you know and then he gave a concert November 1967 66 right before he died in July 67 he drops the horn start beating on his chest shit at least say what's happening train I'm just giving the people all that I can in the now I'm horde getting in the way oh you know what I mean but don't you feel that when you walk off the stage man when you walk on the stage the strange times man you give it everything all that Joe is at that moment now what is that you see that is the example of a Love Supreme that is there to serve the people now you gonna make a living - they don't get paid you gonna get paid and so forth but that's not the primary thing mmm that's not it right even Curtis Mayfield sings sayings his songs that the radio won't play when he's told not to go to the rallies and he shows up with his guitar anyway in plays we a winner hmm that's self-giving self-emptying and I tell it to the young musicians these days cuz a lot of it you know in the culture spectacled nowadays you get these performers they just show up and think they ought to get a standing ovation for ten minutes say no Negro sang a song first man shit no spectacle because we want you saying something that's gonna stir our souls away say I'm cooking Johnny Taylor and Lou Rawls when the soul stirrers be it it's now we respect that genius and so forth see Beyonce is fascinating this regard because she's a genius there's no doubt about it she's I think she's the greatest entertainer of our day I've been very critical of her because there's a sense in which she's still tied to the culture of superficial spectacle hmm jump the way she looks and girls in formation and so forth but at the same time she's also grounded in the tradition and there's a new movie that she made you see they're no homecoming no I haven't seen oh man you got to see that's one of the greatest performative films ever made man really when she goes she goes to Coachella and she shows up Coachella with all of the bands of black colleges and performs all of her songs with all of them moving hundred fifty two hundred of them Wow and didn't reflections and ninasam my own and a brief of Franklin I don't know beyond city I was wrong about Beyonce in a certain sense now I'm telling you that sister she brings a tradition with her that is the highest level of both respect and of excellence well maybe she changed who she is because of criticism like yours well just how you I've never met her you know it reflects oh for sure to say its ability is hard to say people hear things like that it does make them I think that that think that that could be the case I mean she married to a genius for sure with jay-z - and of course the kids and then her lovely parents and then family and think you never know what goes on in the mind and heart and soul what was a great artist like Beyonce yeah what was it that led you to be critical initially oh just because I'm very concerned by young folk you know I've made three three smoking weird albums with print singing with parentheses up he would not sample any of allow any of his music be sampled by hip-hop artists he was very hard on hip-hop but when we asked him for spoken word he said yes and thank God we did same was true for the greatest soul sing of his generation gerald levert really there's so much more attention who's on the album and so forth so I spent a lot of time with young folk in studios just did a thing with tempo one of the great artists coming out of a Ferguson and American Empire on black Julian to be forty of coming out of lay oh I'm great respect for I've been blessed to do a number of things with with the young folk but I tell them I say I'm hold school yo you need to know that see we into originals not in the copies you see that we into lifting every voice that's soulful so that we stir souls we don't want to just too late bodies hmm we don't want just stimulation of body edges now I'm not a Puritan so you know I believe in body stimulation at the right time you know what I mean ain't got nothing against orgasm but the thing is you know you can't just orgiastic we move to life right you got to have context you got to have tradition you got to stir souls in that way and so I put a lot of pressure on one of the things that I bring a lot of take the bear is the I am deeply shaped by the dramatics the Delfonics the main ingredient the whispers lakeside James Brown's band George Clinton boots his band I'm shaped by the emotions I'm shaped by the Jones girls the miracles the temptations Marvelettes all those were groups that expressed their soulful self-emptying in a form of sweetness see I believe in sweetness and kindness and we're losing that you I go to the young folk where is your dramatics why is it we don't have large numbers of groups that sing in tune with a beauty and a sweetness and a gentleness and a kindness when you hit a voice of David Ruffin sing ain't too proud to beg the vulnerability the flexibility of it the intensity of it and it goes straight to you so that's why do people keep listening to yeah David reference from why not Mississippi I would say the same with Ted meals of Blue Magic I get the young folk just just stop let's just listen to paired meals of the Blue Magic let's just listen to Russell Tompkins jr. at a stylistic oh brother West you just old school you just nostalgic no love sweetness gentleness never goes down as my brother would put it cliff never go out of style everybody needs sweetness kindness gentleness black music used to be the fundamental conveyor of that sweetness so that the Bing Crosby's the Frank Sinatra's these are great great geniuses themselves you ask Frank who were you inspired by Billie Holiday are you talking about the genius from Baltimore City Billy that's right you Italian working-class brother from Hoboken that's right cuz I'm tied to excellence and sweetness mm-hmm now Frank said not to he's saying some sweet gentle songs now yeah but the younger generation these days got him and some others who can who are beautiful don't get me wrong but it's smaller and smaller but it's partly a matter of the oligarchs in the recording industry mmm boys the men in the way is the last great group singing a performative act that connected to the dramatics and Delfonics that I'm talking about you say well what happens well they think they could make more money with just one Negro with a microphone runnin a mouth so you get a genius like Kanye deeply confused politically we won't go into that all this Trump connection we need some serious pushing on that brother but they'd rather have an individual isolated easier to control in the industry and the same Oleg arts run live performance radio and the music and the products you know how they've now undergoing this fundamental transformation an industry specially given a new technology and social media so that I tell the young folk I say you know I could not have grown up without the sweetness of those rhythm and blues groups now I know the circumstances are different but where do you get your sweetness from musically what will be the soundtrack of your freedom movement genius is like Kendrick Lamar Ryan some of the soundtrack there's no doubt about that and then there's others as well but not enough not enough soul stirring music no there's no Curtis Mayfield running near nobody do you think that's that connected to the peacocking Lord yes social media and the loot image spectacles money Instagram push buttons coming into the Bentley always got to be in front of the commodity and so forth and so on jewelry I mean you know Pendergrass he had his sharp cars but when that genius got into the studio in the same love TK Oh mm-hmm you don't give a damn what kind of car he got right don't touch your soul you know what I mean yeah and it's not just on the black side we got we you know you got vanilla blues men like Bruce Springsteen and the Jewish brothers genius up you can learn from Minnesota Robert Zimmerman all of these folk were involved in the canosa's activity of self-emptying but they were deeply shaped by the Sun houses the Robert Johnson yeah muddy water house the more rain is the bestest Smith the blues tradition do you know Gary Clark jr. Gary Clark jr. he is one of those rare musicians were you hear hear a riff and it's a Gary Clark of when he played with my friend Suzanne from honey honey yeah and he they did Midnight Rider from The Allman Brothers but he didn't as Gary Clark jr. he's got a sound of his guitar it reminds me of Hendrix in a way it's very different than Hendrix but it reminds me in that it's so distinctively him well I got to hear this yeah thank you so much he's a brilliant guy and a great guy too but he's uh he's just a unique unique artist like I don't know anyone like him and his sound it's it's one of those things where there's no there's no mistaking who's playing the music when you hear he's got his own oh when he's playing the Nightrider which is a classic of so many people as a song yeah put this up give it put up this is this is them up there there's Gary oh oh yeah gary on guitar this is me filming this is that right yeah I was in the crowd they did this midnight on a Tuesday in the downtown LA how long ago was it year ago or so just recently yeah this motherfucker oh he's one of my favorite artists fish and hid that rabbit Jonathan ate him already he's got everything in them but it's also buddy yeah but a guy once you hear more Gary Clark you realize this is him this is him I hear you [Music] you could feel it in the air in that club there was maybe a hundred people in that club Suzanne is reading the lyrics from her phone she didn't even know the lyrics they did this totally impromptu is right on the spot totally on the spot totally on the spot unprepared they talked about his head let's do Midnight Rider okay yeah so they they weren't even they didn't rehearse this and her sedated at all and it takes off on it like just takes off on it just didn't of it Austin Texas he's he's one of those guys that you watch him and you just get a tingle like he's like there's an energy that comes out of him undeniable greatness that's part of that selfie yes yes but he's also a incredibly humble guy no peacocking at all he's not he's a that's a sign of spiritual maturity ends moral security yes yes he's in secured it makes you want to peek yes yes he's just devoted to the work devoted to the art how old brother is Gary he's probably the start he's very young yeah he's he's still getting better who's his latest shit as his best shit he lives here in LA it goes back and forth it takes around here all the time 35 yeah I don't know I think he's out here now right isn't he out here it was just he Susanne just sent me a text message they were just jamming at his house last week so he must be out here he's got some shows here in September it's opening for the Rolling Stone oh shit oh shit caught my teeth that's a hell of a show right there yeah he's there's a signed poster him over by the kitchen he signed something for me brother yeah gotta get something I'll check I'll tell you which one to get it's uh he's got some great great work but there's there's those artists that when you hear their thing whatever it is it literally gives you energy if you feel it in your body it's like a drug it changes your state absolutely no I mean wins but when you have the very creative marriage of technique and vision of craft and imagination mediated through sound the vibration that I sent are just beyond link but you know the great John Coltrane had a whole philosophy of vibrations son raw was part of that dialogue as well Eric Dolphy some of the rural geniuses at that time you know and these vibrations are just they're as real as a heart attack but you can never see them yeah Charles Baudelaire defined the materialists as someone who was obsessed with utensils and afraid of perfume because perfume you can't touch it but it's as real as our heart attack yeah well the vibrations of deep music Mozart to the miles or Mary Lou Williams Jerry Allen or any of the great artists it just goes through you yes and it's not simply cerebro it doesn't bypass the brain but it doesn't stay in the brain it goes through your whole body yeah it's like a drug changes your stage Hank yeah if there was a drug that you could take that made you feel the way you feel when a great song comes on you'd want to take that all the time dad all the time yeah if it had no side effects well in a way you can play that song over yes you can I mean did eventually get a little bit tolerant of it unfortunately but what you were just one of them but who would have made your musicians that was shaping your sensibility I was always in the rock and roll was always in the classic rock when I was young you know I was always into God from everyone from Queen I was a big Queen fan when I was a kid definitely got into Boston yet no well I left New Jersey when I was seven oh no no this was boss I lived in San Francisco from 7 to 11 that I lived in Florida from seven to 13 and then Boston from 13 to 24 she was mainly that Boston context we had a classic rock yeah Oh Smith which is a Boston bear of course you know a lot of Van Halen yeah see I didn't get into classic rock as much as I probably should have it's only so much time yeah there's only so much time to listen to music that is an issue right there's so much great work and every year new great work gets created track of all love it was mainly rhythm and blues when I signed it down you know what I mean yeah Sacramento California jazz came later and then for me musical theater came and in classical music I played classical violin nearly 20 years oh wow and so uh classical music was always important must absorb a lot of time right here what when I was first violin man I used to conduct - oh man I decline of Nachtmusik with Mozart we play egg Martin but Beethoven and so forth and as soon as it was over home and you know Rockwood Otis red and man and and when Isaac Hayes the black Moses and great Barry White and others but it's fascinating how you began to see these connections the broader connections and so classic rock was something that I got to real late when late as in you know 21 22 right and in that sense very very much so but a world without music oh it suck well it's interesting to when you it's all about the context of when the music was created - because if you go and listen to Robert Johnson today it's still undeniably brilliant but what's interesting is it was so good back then the people thought he sold his soul to the devil I mean that was the narrative that's it that was the legend but if you listen to it today in comparison to something like Gary Clark it's so simplistic it's the truth if Gary Clark go back in time to when Robert Johnson was alive they would think he was from another planet but that's the truth they wouldn't even understand it they wouldn't even understand what he was doing that's very you know I used I was blessed to have dialogue with BB King on a number of occasions it was really the king in a lot of ways King not because he was the greatest blues artists but because he was a great blues artist you know through his personality and through his generosity was able to create such a presence that he becomes the king in that way I had a chance to see him live you saw him yes you started I was that at the very end when he was sitting most of the time no he was still staring standards in late 90s oh yeah no no you absolutely the power out of his voice and me but he used to say that the Blues was a kind of high school visa Vee the Jazz who are those who went to college hmm and by college he meant just studying with yeah but Armstrong would do could ruffle foot in the really Williams and the others and I always tell myself I don't know about that because you know the genius and excellence comes in a number of different forms most jazz musicians don't have the genius of a Robert Johnson and yet you know Charlie Christians guitar is more complicated in a variety of different ways in Robert Johnson too so that you had to be able to be flexible enough to see the difference is the development building on the genius of those who came before so you can end up being a very good guitar player who plays some unbelievable chords that Jimi Hendrix created yes but you build it on Jimmy right and it becomes almost not taken for granted but something you can use as a launching pad like Stevie Ray Vaughan did he rose vibration that's a great examine added his own feel to it absolutely absolutely and here again you see you have the that common humanity that cuts across color and there's a lot of controversy these days about cultural appropriation you know can white bows and sisters really be part of a black genre and so forth and so on I had a dialogue at my class at Harvard uh this spring I teach a course on black intellectual tradition and I include some white intellectuals as part of it it was a strange career of Jim Crow for example by the great C Vann Woodward history of Jim Crow to the Bible among Luther King said was the Bible to summarize a movement Woodward was a white southern brother and I have to miss what we don't understand completely brother West I said well let me ask you this it's M&E and a part of the hip-hop tradition at the highest level yes he is yes he is that's what we talk about hmm you had to be a fool to deny the genius of M&E yeah Eminem you see there's no a man without dr. Dre and so forth so he immerses and soaks himself in it but he puts his own distinctive stamp on it Halla Noakes would be another Righteous Brothers another average white band mm-hmm from Scotland well you know that was way bigger and the funk that David Jenner yeah oh my god now of course no average white band without James Brown James Brown I took it to places nobody took right but right you let those guys brothers play person-to-person on you yeah Oh Lord pick up the pieces oh why and it's slow my I mean it's just soulful man you see Scotland Scotland Robbie Burns mm-hmm David Hume colonized by the British Empire responding in their own creative ways and by the 20th century they soaked in rhythm and blues Wow Korea's like that today really oh man you know Korean pop kpop and catering boy no they've got a lot of break dancers over there was not just BTS nah BTS is something else they they packed Madison Square zone but I'm talking about like urban versus a cop man oh they you put on coffee man oh lord have mercy I played that too damn Danny Glover another day on the Bernie Sanders campaign we traveled way off in the country and South Carolina for brother Bernie I say Danny is Sam Cisco I said listen these young Korean brothers man they gonna remind you the natural for Richmond I put it on oh man here could came to Korea what you talk about those Koreans got a soulful sound man at I blow your mind I've just reading a book called the birth of Korean cool well it's just a wall I don't know and it shows again how you know that human spirit has always grounded in something local and particular like black music but it travels it's it's it's the roots and the routes yeah so the roots are black but the RO Utes is global rights just immersing themselves they immerse dishing and the culture of like Japanese jazz right you just got back from Thailand yeah last year last year yeah but now man it's it's it's a it's a human thing it's the momentum of the whole surfing the momentum of culture so strange because it's a Thailand's a great example that it's like they're so different they're so thin the momentum of culture like I just got back from Italy they're so different but yet they're so similar yeah but there's so that there's there's a momentum of the way they live their lives it's very unique and unusual and I think that's one of the great things about traveling is you need to see oh well the way we live here is that especially here in Los Angeles which is preposterous I grew up but I never lived it I live in Cambridge yeah it's fine until four months of the year when it's just a frozen wasteland it's I used to perform a catcher izing star oh yeah yeah in Harvard Square absolutely right yeah it's Cambridge's you mean it's a great place it's wonderful it's like intellectually yeah it's a wonderful thing and hang out there's a lot of gates and yes Brendan Terry and well Bob they'll be Boston's a strange place it really is so many different flavors to it you know but it's um so goddamn cold but it gets cold but that's what it's time to go in the library read some books yeah it also builds character but that's true too there's something about people that grow up in cold climates to come to terms yeah Chicago yeah Chicago's a perfect example there's great people there because they have character absolute Detroit they deal with that shit got it I deal with in terms yeah right about that told me I mean one of the sadder features of our our moment given a whole are the joy of reveling in each other's humanity and music and so forth is that you know you got impending ecological catastrophe mmm-hmm escalating nuclear catastrophe economic catastrophe the grotesque wealth inequality all around the world spiritual catastrophe in terms of intensifying forms of depression suicide wasted lies lack of self-respect not believing in oneself and thinking that the only way you can really make it is by imitating the mainstream forms of conformity hmm and in the political catastrophes of right-wing movements all around the world yeah and by right-wing movements what I mean is the rule of big money big military and then scapegoat the most vulnerable and try to convince the most vulnerable that it's their fault that they're in the subordinate positions that they are rather than giving them a fair chance you see and that's the makings of new forms of fascism and so on you see and you say to yourself you know how do we hold on to some sense of hope and there is no hope without wrestling with despair if you afraid of despair you never have hope what do you when you say lefse with it you've got to wrestle with it not allow it to have the last word but you gotta wrestle with it when you're talking about the your concern about nuclear catastrophe impending nuclear catastrophe you're talking about what's going on right now with Iran well I'm thinking about Russia Russia the Sun is us missile has that right north possibility of war u.s. bombing precious Iran Iranian brothers and sisters are as precious and priceless as anybody actually just happened to be under an authoritarian rule that that does need to be changed and transformed there's no doubt about it but you think you know all the hell they've been through man eight years when the United States was on the side of Saddam Hussein yeah and they were all alone in the world it's very much like our Jewish brothers sisters felt in 1973 they're already undergone a genocidal attack one out three president Jews killed and 73 do their in the world all by themselves other than the US Empire you say oh my god who can I rely on and that brings out the worst in people the worst in people because it's all about in-crowd in-group security yes authoritarian on the inside and distrustful of the whole world on the outside and this is why it's so difficult to have a discussion about Israeli occupation what our precious Palestinian brothers and sisters because to try to be able to cast a light on how an underdog cause that's the history Jews 2,000 years it's basically underdog became an oppressor and how they become top dogs tied to the u.s. top dogs right now you always have the ginn those Jewish voices and organization that are critical of Israeli occupation critical of any actions of human beings including Jews that are that need to be calling the question but it's hard to keep track of the rich and priceless humanity of Palestinian brothers and sisters under occupation second-class citizenship when it's very clear that Jews have been so viciously treated for 2,000 years in the history of history of the West as well as the history of the the Middle East and yet we have a moral duty to keep track of the preciousness of pressed Palestinian babies just as we ought to keep track of the preciousness of Jewish babies when Gaza and Tel Aviv must have a a spot light in terms of what those human beings are going through on both sides of that divide as it were even given a symmetric relation of power and that structure of domination called the occupation might say the same thing about Tibet I'd say same thing about cash yeah I'd say same thing about Western sub-sahara under Moroccan domination there's so many examples that we human beings generate that require our moral and spiritual witness and our analytical attention and our artists who can authorize an alternative even if only for a moment an alternative what is the art like in Palestine the art the art the art in Houston Oh unbelievable I mean I would imagine when you're dealing with such an oppressed group of people they're living in the Arias situation and time in history is unbeliev I was just talked to my dear brother Mark Lamont Hill we just had him in Harvard for dialogue another Palestinian in black situation and he goes back and forth and he talks about the Palestinian hip-hop artists really oh my god they got one of the richest subcultures of hip-hop this is not always the case when you have a culture that's down trial absolutely and you get the Kurds in Turkey to apply the disproportionate amount of influence on Turkish culture what's like a good Palestinian hip hop band to look into that's a good question because I you know I didn't really follow through I like to listen to that to me I don't know what they're saying I love listening to music where I don't know the language you could just feel the spirit go into vibrations Brazilian nation I love Brazilian hip-hop because I don't speak Portuguese and it's just amazing the sound as I've never heard Raziel they'll come out to their soundtrack is Brazilian artists yeah yeah no it's I mean it to me you know one of the uplifting features of being rooted in the arts and music is that no matter how ugly and vicious and hateful things are it never suffocates the human spirit hmm somebody gonna tell a joke laughs something they're lying a song you touch your soul ya know what I mean yeah and it's almost a way of saying I love you not in a sentimental Hollywood stereotypical way but you know that song by Stevie Wonder these three words mm-hmm you got that me we can't play we can't play daddy will get no right because that was a video that you put up there before yeah but that video was Mary Johnson singing in a concert I definitely know that you did yeah listen to Stevie man because he's Tombaugh how an aching heart can be kindled to smile mmm open act in a world overwhelmed by hatred and distrust that shut it shut do all of us and we all contribute to it and we all contribute to it you see I mean that's one of the reasons why even when I talk about you know brother Trump as a the gangster I kind of do you have created a fascist Frankenstein and he's the creation of the worst of America and the way in which Martin King represents the best and they are both America's apple pie but any critique of anybody ought to begin with yourself hmm who we are because we all got gangster elements inside of us no way around us what else from him no I've never I met him one time I think at the end of Anita Baker concert in the casinos in the Atlantic City way back in the 80s and it was interesting he was there with Mike Tyson I think and it was interesting because it was a chocolate affair you know to me you know the vanilla brother there right and you know one of the first things that come across to the brother is that it just so glad to be there hanging out with the black brothers cool it's so funny you could just tell he just squares and rectangle you see you gonna listen to your Beach Boys man we got James Brown brother we got we Brian Wilson we love you but we got JB man and but it's but and it's a cultural dynamic because he was the richest one in the room right and Mike Tyson got a lot of money when Don King got that money too but but it was a different kind of dynamic and so it's a context in which you embrace you know it we embrace them because that's the best of black culture we embrace every body Donald Trump's mother shows up from Scotland in 1930 black people been here nine generation we're gonna say go back where you come from come on in here sister Bea Marta this democratic experiment we on the other side of chocolate side of town but we welcome you but don't say nothing about our brown brothers and sisters coming in from Mexico we lean because if anybody is definitive about what is America it's gonna be red and black people because they're the ones who undergo the monstrous crimes against humanity to genocide a stolen land on the one hand and the stolen peoples and the Human Bondage on the other those are the pillars the worst pillars of the country then you've got democratic visions coming not just from Thomas Jefferson but they're coming from the slaves like Frederick Douglass mmm the border crisis is a very interesting one right because it's it represents the the fear of people from the downtrodden countries where they don't have opportunity trying to get into this country yes but then it also represents the fear of criminals of drug dealers and gangsters and gang members make cartel members making the way across and victimizing our citizens at both days a humo things are real human but if you tell the lies and make it as if the latter represents my whole right and that's what Trump specializes see did you see the video of pence when he was down there at the detention centers and just just looking away no humanity just very disturbing and it's so you know it's so sad because he a brother who stakes his whole personal identity on Christian being a Christian yes like my coming as a Christian I'm not trying to call into question your Christian faith for nothing I don't have authority to do that but the Bible says in part by thy works you shall know them the works of love they exemplify and you know nowadays you got commodified Christianity and a commodified culture of a declining Empire and you get Christian evangelicals 91 percent of self pro-trump 79 percent sees that he's doing the best possible job and you say to yourself Wow Christianity it seems to have lost meaning of the Cross and has become so accommodated to the Empire and it was the Roman Empire who put Jesus to death it was a Roman Empire you had some neo-colonial elites who cooperated but it was a Roman Empire who put Jesus to death it was the greatest empire of its day very much like the Persian Empire the largest greatest empire of its day with Cyrus degree now you got the Roman Empire putting Jesus to death and here Jesus is sent there by the crowd by the mob and you say to breath of Michael pence so you're gonna accommodate yourself to Donald Trump you're gonna accommodate yourself to policies that are so inhumane and barbaric just to retain your position and try to then rationalize it as a Christian we need some music and some comedy to try to get in contact with his humanity to change him but most importantly you just need a social movement you know you need to get him out of office accountability but with parents that just there's seeing him in reaction to those people it's just a failure just cold desert they're halas well the narrative is that they broke the law and that they're imposing upon our great nation and you know this is its crimes of opportunity they're just trying to trying to find opportunity they trying to they're coming over here because they want a better life to not have sympathy for that and in other than indigenous peoples and in my own African peoples that is the history to come yes open and bring into the country those who are eager and have energy willing to work and sacrifice and a unbelievable contribution voluntary immigrants to the making of American American that a nation of immigrants I don't like that language because it overlooks indigenous peoples and involuntary implements like black people and and and slavery was not America's original sin that's another neoliberal line that you hear all the time on the corporate media as if indigenous peoples suffering has to be rendered invisible highlight black people what's one of the least discussed in justices of this nation and then is their current situation with their in these reservations with extreme alcoholism so they still got the rich music and poetry and resistant but the the social conditions are just but this the they are the casualties of a settler colonial enterprise and we rather act as if they don't exist I mean we black people became central because our labor and our imagination and culture became central and we had a mulberry Civil War 750,000 people day in each life precious and that has been the central event in the shaping of America so when people talk about race it goes straight to blackness as if indigenous peoples and retinas not integral to it's just that they've been British so invisible and the vicious attack has been so immense what's so complicated too that they have their own rules on the reservations they're allowed to have gambling and they can have all sorts of they they have their own sovereignty in a certain way on the reservations is very oh no it's true and I was blessed to be there in Standing Rock on a couple of December's ago it was one of the marvelous moments in in my life to stand there with the the group there was a multiracial group people came from all around the world and I am a client from Canada for the most part it was a matter of the indigenous peoples coming together memories of Wounded Knee 1890 400 people did you remind people with us with Stanley Rock is my standing right was a struggle over that pipeline absolutely trying to put pressure on the Obama administration to ensure that a pipeline was not built that would violate the sacred lands and many of the sacred memories of indigenous peoples and it was magnificent because you had two coming together of indigenous nations because part of the problem this is true for all oppressed people is fighting among themselves and the difficulty of coming together the first time you had to coming together a significant number of indigenous peoples nations unified against the greedy corporate elites who were trying to promote this pipeline through Canada all the way down to the southern section of the United States and it was his stuff well we first we got an announcement right where we were there was freezing to me it was December and they were hosing people down - oh Lord they were hosing people down wedding wedding them down while this is all going on and it was about minus 15 or whatever it was it was freezing up there you know and but know what we got an announcement from the Obama administration for a suspension of it because they had plan to do it - I mean you know Obama administration can be very accommodating to Wall Street interests and corporate elite interests and so forth even given the image and spectacle of a black president being a progressive and what-have-you much more progressive to Trump that's not saying too much right but but we got a suspension and and the struggle continues really but it was it and it has sent tremendous ripples through the cultures of indigenous peoples and their nations in terms coming together and the fact that it was successful absolutely and there was at least a relative victory yeah all these victories a relative but very relative victory it was beautiful just to see again you you know you can't downplay the role of joy don't brother this is so very important to joy in struggle the joy in organising the joy in fighting for justice the joy in the nightclubs the joy and the churches and mosques temples of synagogues joy is something that we need to come back to that's one of the great secrets of the human conditions what are the sources of joy what are the conditions for the possibility of joy we've been obsessed with pleasure for the last a hundred years or so and there's nothing wrong with with pleasure but pleasure is not the same thing as joy you know when you look at the sparkling eyes of your precious daughter that's not pleasure that's joy hmm you and your wife that's deep deep joy that's what endures you could be broke as the Ten Commandments financially but that memory will bring you joy that's real joy not peacocking that's exactly right that's exactly right you said so many amazing things today this was one of my favorite podcasts of all time I just want to thank you for being here is the time up all right time it's already 11 o'clock no god mighty this has been a blessing brother my pleasure what a human being you are my brother you stay strong though me too sir thank you very much it really a lovely man [Applause] [Music]
