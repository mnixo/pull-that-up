okay hello Andy I'm mr. Rogan thanks for having me oh my pleasure how you doing man you're all healed up the bruising and swelling has gone down as you can see but the most serious injury was to the brain you have a serious injury to your brain yeah brain hemorrhage what happened from what the mob beating so if I'm getting hit in the head you got a brain hemorrhage multiple times regions yes they were bashing me on the back of my head and to my eyes but so how do you know you had brain hemorrhaging and how are you able to just walk around well I was taken to I started losing my balance after the beating mm-hmm there was no police made it to the courthouse sat down on the ground ambulance was called I had to walk back to the ambulance because the streets were walked back to the police precinct in the direction of the mob the medics that were associated with the Portland Police let me know that they thought I needed to walk in that direction it was quite shocking because it was I just been a victim of the small beating and then now they're telling me to walk back in direction of the center precinct by the beating had happened did they not know that you had been beaten up well it's let's let's set this up for people who are new to this and don't understand what happened I've been aware of you because of you had written for Colette right and you had become one of these for whatever reason controversial online journalists and you covered ante fuh quite a bit and you covered a lot of the radical left you were in Portland and what was the exact rally that was going on what was it called did it have a name it was something like protect Portland so it was organized by row city on tufa and its allies and by its allies I mean I'm referring to the local chapter of the Democratic Socialist America came out to support them in numbers and what are they protecting Portland from they allege fascist fascists who just in general I mean is there like a particular thing they're worried about there were two right-wing events happening that day that they were countered demonstrating against there was a one part one part of downtown the proud boys were holding a flag waving event that was completely peaceful there was no actually flag waving American flag waving correct okay and a lot of Portland has found that provocative and a manifestation of fascistic violence and in another part of downtown there was a men's rights activist who was holding a rally it was titled for the victims of domestic terrorism it was an anti anti fuh event Hey so a men's rights activist yes that was doing an anti-fascist or anti anti fuh Craigs well what boy seems like a whole lot of do about nothing flag waving and anti ante foe okay yes can I set the context for please for the city of Portland it's a mess you have listeners and viewers all over the world so Portland Oregon is a extremely progressive city in the Pacific Northwest of the US and I call it a political monoculture because really it's not just you're more likely to find socialists open socialist there than you would find like a regular Republican or conservative and within the sort of echo chamber of just leftist politics there's it's become also a hotbed for far-left militancy so Rose City on Tifa is you could call it like the local chapter movement of anti feds one of the oldest in the country it's very large important and they hold what you could call protest but they're there their protests are always devolve into riots where they essentially take over parts of downtown and attack people attack their ideological opponents and do it frequently with impunity I mean I wasn't only one attack that day there were people who were bashed on the head very and have very severe lacerations to the face on head you may recall the footage from October of last year when there was elderly driver who was attacked on the streets yeah they were directing traffic exactly in and somehow or another the mayor thought it was a good idea to let this take place is that the case and they told the police to stand down is that true so I mean the next part of this journey for me will be the legal aspect of it and it seems like something stinks in Portland the issue is really not with the rank-and-file officers they're following orders to not intervene so I I have been assaulted and criminally harassed early before the mob beating people were throwing milkshakes at my face and head within eyesight of police who were watching in downtown and both of these were reported in the dancer that I heard that day as I've heard many times before when I've been assaulted by an Tifa is that we will not question approach or detain the suspect because this couldn't Slyke the crowd okay so this is why this has exacerbate or this is why this has become such a big deal in Portland because of this attitude because Portland seems to be the hotbed right now for this kind of stuff is that is that fair to say I think it is so is this the mayor I mean who is who's the one who's giving the orders to the police to tell them to allow this stuff to take place well I'm crowdfunding for the legal phone right now and we are willing we are going to hold accountable whoever is responsible for dereliction of duty where the evidence leads us so Portland has an odd governance system in that the mayor who is up for reelection by the way is also the police commissioner so oh wow yeah how does that work it is an old system that it inherited and it just and never changed from the Wild West like that sounds ridiculous yeah it is ridiculous you can see all the political conflicts and in conflicts of interest that that yeah would arise right yeah yeah shitload how did you get involved in this like what why first of all why would they ingry you I I work as a journalist I'll name like places that I've been published before I write and I do video and I do podcasts so my written work has been published in The Wall Street Journal the National Review Spectator New York Post I'm also on the editorial team of Colette magazine and one of my beats amongst Averell is about far-left militancy particularly in Portland and to me what I was noticing was that the national and local media coverage had a particular blind spot when it came to their coverage on an tyfa there was all this sensitivity to the : unquote far-right and white nationalism or white identity extremism but they could not or would not recognize the militancy that was on the left in Portland seemed to be one of the places for Ground Zero particularly after 2016 we had very violent rioting in downtown the a segment of the population could not accept the election results in November and so they did a million dollars in damage setting fires and destroying properties and businesses and at that time I was a graduate student working at the Student Paper and I destroyed on that and I came out to witness and it it you know this was a major American city but it felt like I was in Afghanistan or Iraq just with all these fires and explosions and people running around with bats while massed up and that was the first time I really became familiar with anti-fun I took an interest in it and I saw over and over look the media coverage was basically really sort of whitewashing then kind of like referring to them as anti-fascist giving them that propaganda victory and anti-fascism movement the Masters of doublespeak and disinformation so it starts with the name anti father is short for anti-fascist but I never refer to them as that because that's seeding the ground - to them they when they say that they are defending a community self-defense it actually is referring to meat premeditated violence and offensive violence so I started going to covering this more and more you know after I left the student paper I started writing for some national and international publications and though internationally there was a you know set of readers who interested in what the hell is going on in Portland why are there these continued scenes of street brawls and anarchy over and over what are the variables that are causing this and I thought that I could try to shine a light on it and by doing so an tyfa became enraged with my work and particularly things they hated me since last year but they started really escalating on on the 1st of May May Day so this year was when I was physically assaulted by them for the first time they were very upset that I wrote a story from the New York Post where there was a series of and this is one of the other beats that I work on his hate crime hoaxes and Portland earlier this year I had this huge panic over serious allegations of LGBT people claiming that they were marauding right-wing gangs driving around trying to kill people with bats with hammers trying to kidnap them and these were all rumors that were reported on social media calls a huge frenzy even the mayor had to come out and you know issue statement about how he was concerned there was an emergency Town Hall with the the local queer Center and so I started looking into all these allegations there was 15 of them found that of the 15 only one was reported to police and what was reported to police and documented in the report was entirely different from the GoFundMe where over 10 thousand dollars was raised for this trans activist she had alleged that one night walking home transphobic people had beat her with the bat and knocked her unconscious police report said that she was extremely intoxicated and likely fell and there was no evidence that anybody had assaulted her so when I the story came out because anti-fog was really anti fun the Democratic Socialist America and Portland were really involved in peddling this hate crime fear in Portland and I just kind of you know threw water on this panic that they have been flaming and so on the first of May there was a riot that I was covering and one of the masked I don't see Fela people went up and sprayed me with I think it was bear mace some type of chemical that blinds you and burns you yeah I saw the video yeah so there was no police that that was there that I mean that anti fire that was publicly advertised on Facebook and all that so over and over like empty files very transparent about their calls for people to come to the stuff in to engage in this physical confrontation that they call self-defense and the police either stay away or on purpose or are told to stay away so it's very confusing because when you watch the videos there's amazing people there amazing people who disagree with them like they're yelling at each other and then someone will come along and mace people and for the police to not step in and do something it's I don't I don't think there's another city in the country that would allow something like that it just doesn't it doesn't seem like it makes any sense at all because you're not talking about people that are being physically attacked and that are macing someone to protect themselves or even a threat of being physically attacked they're just disagreeing with each other and yelling at each other and then someone will come along and start macing people and I've seen it many times and I think there's also a real problem with people wearing masks you know whether there are idea LG makes sense or not when you put people in masks and then you have a bunch of people yelling and escalating and then there's teams there's team and PETA versus team you know anybody opposing them they feel is a white supremacist or a Nazi and this is just how they've chosen to frame it to dehumanize people and then you see them attack people I'm sure you're aware of the girl who got maced in the face because she had a hat on that said make Bitcoin great again but it was the same color hat as the make America great again hat and she got maced in the face and she got hit with something too right didn't she get hit in the face with something anyway this kind of shit is really weird it's really weird and disturbing to see these young people with these ideal idealistic versions of what they're doing I think a lot of the people that are involved in that really think they are fighting fascism they really do they really think that Donald Trump and the proud boys and white supremacists from Charlottesville carrying tiki torches that these people represent something horrible that's sweeping across the country and the young people today need to stand up and fight against this and they're putting on masks and they're carrying backpacks and whacking people in the head with crowbars is really fucking weird to see and it's really weird that the city of Portland or all cities in fact haven't made some sort of a law where you can't walk around in public with a fucking mask on because that is one of the things that helps these people it's the same thing that you see on social media when people are anonymous and they say the most horrible hateful shit they're saying that because they're not in front of you you can't recognize them they don't have to take responsibility for what they're saying this is a lot of the same characteristics that a person has when they're wearing a costume you're dressed in all black with gloves on and a face mask and you're hitting people with a bike lock like what what is that about well what that's about is you're getting away with being anonymous and you're getting support from all these other people around you there's this mob mentality that takes place it's well documented with humans where when you get a group of people together and there's another group and it's like it's a tribal warfare type situation and that's what you're seeing within teeth and the fact that the Portland Police have I don't know what's going on with them whether they've been told to not handle that but the fact they haven't done anything to mitigate this is fucking it's it's embarrassing it's it's a shame it's it's terrible it really is it's a it's a travesty you asked about the mayor earlier and and if he issued any stand on orders there's a statement that was put out after I was attacked by the Pajero Turner who's the president of the police union and he said very clearly he called from the mayor to remove the handcuffs handcuffs of law enforcement so they can enforce the law and he accuses America little icing the police department is this mayor popular no he's not he's hated well by moderates because of the things that he allows to up in the city but the father hate him as well they view him as not radical enough why why are they mad at you is it just the articles you've written because somebody told me that you had been accused of daxing people is that true absolutely not true so this is such an outrageous deferment reclaim so what happened was on May Day at that riot there was one of the anti faux women had charged in to participate in the fight during the brawl in one of the right wing person he was wearing a mask I didn't know who he was allegedly had hit her on her head near her head on her neck somewhere like that she was knocked out I recognize this woman from her activism that day as the person who sabotage the sound equipment when James d'amour came to Portland State in February of last year that was an event that I was involved in organizing Portland State University and we should just explain to people James d'amours the author of the Google memo that was talking about women in tech that was wildly misrepresented what he had said and people had claimed that he was just awful sexist even the CEO of YouTube said that he enforced harmful gender stereotypes where while he was citing evolutionary psychology and the citing all these different studies on why women gravitate towards particular fields and even up page and a half encouraging or strategy to try out strategies to encourage more women to get an attack but it was basically in response to things that Google had written about dealing with the lack of women in tact what what is the problem here they were looking for a very particular answer which was sexism and he was saying well it actually has more to do with the choices that women sort of naturally tend to gravitate towards and he was saying that there was a way to possibly encourage women to get into technology and he devised these strategies to do so but was wildly misrepresented and he if you meet the guy and I've had him on the podcast he is a soft-spoken sweetheart of a guy he's not a not a misogynist not a mean-spirited person he was merely looking at the results of studies and he was looking at real raw data and that this real tendency that certain people have to gravitate towards certain positions in life yeah so there was so many misconceptions about James sumo which is why the student group I was involved in was invited him to come but anti found that allies just could not take that to try to shut down the event they try to get it counseled and at that event this one woman she damaged a sound equipment as she was trying to shut it down she pulled all these clothes out and pushed the sound board on the ground at broke so I recognized her from that day she was named in the media and then on may day recognized her so I named her I said this is the name of the woman who was knocked out I recognized her from the Jains des Moines that protests where she had damage to equipment and on Tifa had spun that around as me daxing her and that's not Daxing boxing is where you release people's personal details such as where they work where they live the phone numbers with the so that people who identified her I named her yes okay she had been identified in the media before she was a big local activist so that's basically it other than you writing these stories criticizing their behavior what's disturbing to me beyond disturbing was legitimate journalists that were making excuses for why you got beat up and people saying things like play stupid games win stupid prizes I saw stuff like that that pick up better hobby I saw a guy write that you know anti-fascists will rule you know Portland's not your place I saw all this crazy shit from people with blue checkmarks that were saying that this is what happens when you support fascism and I was so baffled by this like I read some of your stuff I haven't read all of it admittedly but I've read some of you stuff none of it came off as you supporting fascism I came off as you maybe at the worst case scenario being a contrarian and not wanting to go with this sort of left-wing ideology that is so widespread throughout the Pacific Northwest but I didn't see any I mean first of all you're not a white guy we should be explained to people you are Vietnamese and you know you're what they would consider a member of a protected class you're not just a minority you're openly gay you mean you're you're what what do you consider yourself politically I've been avoiding labels for a while I think it's interesting that the loss of the coverage on what happened to me always qualified my who I am I was like a conservative journalist well the worst thing is the way they're labeled Collette they said you work for far-right a newspaper magazine Collette which is not the case at all that's not true I think the subtle I mean the dog whistles of the Tron is saying that this person deserved it and these are the same people who always talk about believe the victim they were the ones who jumped on to believe justice Millette but I guess I was the wrong type of victim well exactly because even though you are you you seem like a very nice person you weren't doing anything violent you you were supporting the wrong thing or not supporting them not supporting not just blindly supporting what an teef is involved with which is what I mean that is what fascism is I mean if you you can't even question some of the more heinous things that we clearly heinous things they're doing just fucking amazing people in the audience macing people in the crowd just pointing it at people yelling and screaming hitting each other with things when you're wearing masks getting involved these brawls it's so fucking stupid it's so stupid to watch it's like this is base human behavior in its worst example and the fact that this dumbass fucking mayor thinks that this is a good idea to let this play itself out this is how people get shot this is how people die when you allow a certain amount of violence and when you condone or don't do anything with violence that you can't defend like violence against a person like yourself I saw those guys hitting you in the back of the head throwing milkshakes Iggy will you try just trying to walk away you weren't doing anything yeah youyou asked me at the beginning how did I get the the brain hemorrhage so the video that's gone viral does actually the second half of the beating I don't know if there's video the first half hopefully there's through CCTV or something but the first there are more hits to my face on my head and so when I went to the hospital because of the nature of the contusions on my head they did a CT is kind of in the in the ER and that confirmed the subarachnoid hemorrhage so what started what what was the why'd you get hit okay 29th of June okay that would be ten eleven days ago from now and so there was that demonstration happening auntie pho was rallying to oppose the far right they claim of post fascists I came was excited to use my new GoPro I was a bit nervous speaking I going to the event I was nervous because I've been targeted just two months earlier right I left my house with the helmet gone to my car saw briefly my you were a helmet I had to help but I did have one saw a reflection of myself took it off decided I don't want anybody there to get the impression that I came because they already accused me of being a Nazi in fall right and white supremacist I didn't want any of them to then perceive me by the fact that I came to the helmet hasn't possibly a combatant so I'm like Vietnamese white supremacist is that possible in their eyes yes and I mean this goes to the the bigger issue that I've taken an issue with how flippant people use these accusations not just racist or being Nazi or far-right but it's like what part of what makes anti-fur so dangerous is that they feel that they are morally justified in their brutality yes and they get actually a lot of morale from progressive and left-wing media so after talking about what the attack I would like to talk about how the actual militant and tifo people is very small those who are going out and doing the violence the larger group and those that I find more concerning actually of the nonviolent in Sofia antiva you find those more concerning people are because they work to mainstream anti fuss tactics and ideas like now Daxing by an tyfa is not even is kind of seen as well these people deserve it like do people not realize like when your darks and you people's you know releasing your address has happened to me your family's address out it it puts this constant state of fear in you even when you're in your own home like i don't know if they realize that so there's the daxing and then of course you know the punch the Nazi meme was meant to be cute and funny but when they label such a large segment of the population has not seeds it's it's going after a lot of people who are innocent and law-abiding such as myself they're also calling Jewish people Nazis is actually insane and then now more recently that the milk shaking was seen as as cute non violent form a political dissent as you saw in the video after I was getting beaten I was trying to get away then they were pelting all these liquids at my head and in my face and that blinded me I couldn't even see really which way to leave so to backtrack a little bit sorry now I'm jumping all over it's okay the March was right in the heart of downtown just the fires attack they were chanting no hate no fear this is irony of it I remember that very clearly the crowd was chanting that I was walking towards the front of the demonstration thought I would get a wide-angle shot on my guv GoPro before I could get there somebody bashes me really hard in the back of the head and I've never been in a fight mr. Rogan so I didn't even realize what had happened to me I was knocked forward as soon as I caught my footing the punches kept coming from every direction and all I could see was like people Justin block with mass and most of them that were hitting me had on these gloves that have the hardened knuckles I think it's like gloves yes or tactical gloves yeah it was just endless and I could see in the background like this was in front of the Justice Center this is the other sad irony so in broad daylight in the heart of downtown steps away from the central police precinct from the Sheriff's Office this beating happened no police intervene at any point I police see it I don't know I nobody came to my aid at any point before during or after so this happens out of nowhere you get blindsided the back of the head a bunch of people punch you how many times you think you got hit maybe six or more the the fact that people dismiss this is not being a big deal is really horrific Tim it is the fact that the people that are in an Tifa that are nonviolent folks which I think I'm glad you brought that up because I was going to bring that up that it's the extreme of the extremists right it's the people that think that that there's a call for violence and this is a reason to do it and even someone like yourself that is a non-violent person is just there as a journalist that there is a justification for just just for whatever reason you want just go up to that person and start hitting them even though they're not a threat even though they're not doing anything to harm anybody even though they're not putting anybody in danger there just being a journalist and you feel like you could justify hitting them it's really disgusting and it's describing that there was this thing with Vox where Carlos Mesa was minimizing the the impact of an Tifa and kind of joking around about it and making it seem like it's just no big deal and he got really upset cuz steven crowder was making fun of the fact that he's gay and the fact that he talks with a lisp and that Crowder mentioned that along with mocking his stance on an tyfa and then it became this gigantic thing that steven crowder is a gay basher but what didn't become a big deal is that this guy is minimizing violent fascists and that's what I mean that's how I feel about this when you're trying to enforce your own ideology on other people and you have no tolerance for anybody with a differing opinion particularly journalists that is fascism it's so ironic to call yourself an anti-fascist when you're literally enforcing your own particular ideology to the point of violence and you're wearing masks and you're running around hitting people and pretending that you're being inundated with Nazis and white supremacists and that this is all necessary like that old man that was just driving and they're directing traffic and forcing him to obey them and then when he doesn't want to they chase after him and assault him it's fuckin bananas and the fact that this city has not stepped in and recognized that they have a real problem because this has got momentum behind it and the people that are involved that are nonviolent you gotta speak up they've got to speak up if you're a person that really believes that there shouldn't be homophobia and there shouldn't be violence and there shouldn't be white supremacy good for you you probably got involved in this for all the right reasons but if you don't recognize that someone like you yourself who is a person of a different ethnicity you're not a white person you're Vietnamese you're a gay man you got assaulted for no reason you didn't do anything that mean it's almost like a test of where do your values truly lie and if you think it's okay for a person like you to just get assaulted for no reason you are the problem you're the problem your mindset is the problem it's not whether or not there should be white supremacy of course there should be it's not whether or not there shouldn't be people be able to freely express themselves of course there should be that is not what the issue is what the issue is is group mob mentality when you get people together and you let them wear masks and you tell them that they're fighting against some evil and then they feel justified and hitting a person like you it is really sickening and there's this diffusion of responsibility thing that happens when one person hits you and everybody feels like it's okay to hit you it's a mob mentality thing and it's it is extremely common with human beings I've got been in mob situations it's terrifying because you feel it in the air you feel the chaos in the air when you're in some sort of a large-scale brawl type situation like anything can happen people just run up on people and start punching them it's not like two people alone in an in like an open area where they can talk and work things out no it's chaos and there's some weird animal activity there's some weird weird animal instinct aspect to it that is very unique to humans and when you see something like this and see a guy like you just getting peppered with milkshakes and punched in the head and it's fucking disturbing and for these people to dismiss that and not stand out not stand up and say hey this is not what we're supposed to be about this is not what I signed up for they become a part of the problem I'm sure there's people listening to this that are upset at this because maybe you but you've support an Tifa you support their ideology think about what you actually support think about what this is really all about what you shouldn't be supporting is people wearing masks running around fucking hitting people you ain't changing shit with that all you're gonna do is call for more people with masks from the other side if people feel like right-wing people are being attacked and and I don't think you're even right-wing are you I mean what are you just moved if you got a gun to your head or a mace to your face what would you we see you're a centrist what would you say I think it's fair to describe me as a center right center right okay which is fine it should be okay I mean this should be we should be allowed to have disagreements of ideologies and of political persuasions political leanings but this is it's twisted and it's twisted the way it's being depicted in the media it's very strange how it's being dismissed it's very strange and that there's really people in 2019 debating whether or not it's okay to assault journalists it's fucking madness well we've been seeing the build-up to this for years people political violence coming from the left is is seen as moral and unfortunately even those working in mainstream media how that Tynes excused or found that type of violence good I'm thinking of Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon at CNN yes and I wonder if that played a role in why they were the only hunter left broadcast news station news network to invite me on to speak no other leftist unter media has invited me on to any other show when they had you on to speak what was their attitude about all this I think some host was very respectful and fair who hosted who was John Brennan I think so you think they were respectful and fair did it bother you that people like Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon had openly supported and Tifa it did it I mean in her this is was kind of encouraged me to continue doing my work months ago even last year when I was getting threatened because it seemed like I don't think Chris or dawn actually understatement about anti-fun I think you're right you know they fall and they believe the the propaganda about them this is just an anti-fascist movement the name amid Rai itself I'm hoping that like even with my injuries and some you can see some you you can't I'm continuing speak force myself to do all these media engagements because I want the the needle on the conversations about anti-fur to move to change like this is not just a movement of people masking up and starting random violence on the streets like the violence isn't just it is not arbitrary it's working towards their goal it's a movement of violent radical anarchists and communists and they're agitated for political revolution and violence is part of the modus operandi it's not a bug it's the future of what they do so I don't know if people recognize how dangerousness is this movement in the DHS since 2016 has described some event to fuzz activities as domestic terrorist violence so the fact that they're able to openly organize and recruit on social media is it's a baffling to me I'm wondering like there's such as huge blind spot for far-left militancy not just in mainstream media but also in big tech do you think this is because Trump is president and because so many people oppose Trump as president that the idea of far-left militancy is in a in opposition to what they oppose so they feel like the the enemy of my enemy is my friend that's exactly what it is I think it what Eric Weinstein had a great point about this and he said the one of the real issues is the cowards of the left and the cowards of the right that are allowing the extremists to do the work for them so when people see someone like the proud boys running around attacking people even the proud voice you have to realize that they started off as a joke like when Gavin McGinnis first came up with the idea of the proud boys it was it was literally a joke and it became an actual organization at for fun and then people joined it that didn't think it was a joke and then people joined it and started taking in a deeper in deeper direction then he'll eventually disavowed himself in a band in the group you see that I beat I bet you see the same thing with antifa I bet the idea initially was hey we see these tiki torch carrying assholes in Charlottesville we see that guy with the car ran over the girl was a protester and killed her like this fucking shit has got to stop so we have to organize we have to do something and then what happens you get people in masks and you get people just a and then you get people that support those people then you get the extremists and the extremists who are not disavowed who are not there's no one speaking out against them from the left there's no one saying hey this shit has got to stop because they want them to do their dirty work for them they want them to push the envelope and push the agenda and get their D their ideology moving in the right direction even if it's done through methods that they don't agree with and that's where it gets horrible because I see these people that are involved in this and I know for a fact just by watching them move and interact with each other they don't understand violence they don't they're not good at it they don't understand it they this is like role play it's like cosplay and you're gonna call for reach you're gonna get real violence in return and from people who actually know how to do it and if you look at violence from the left and violence for the right violence when the right scares me a whole lot more they're a lot more armed that it's it's they're more dangerous human beings in general and I think that if this just keeps happening and people from the right feel threatened and their lifestyle feels threatened and their ideologies feel threatened you're gonna get people meeting at these things and it's gonna be more than just people throwing mace and milkshakes at each other it's going to be people showing up ready for actual combat that's fucking terrifying it's fucking terrifying and this idea that you could just run around hitting people and not have any consequences it's like the way a child looks at violence this is what bothers me so much if you are if you looked at their core tenets of what they want to do and if they wanted to accomplish that through political negotiation and through conversation and rallies and and and speeches fine that's fine but we have people wearing masks hitting and macing people you've you've packed you've crossed the line into the land of no return and you've called out to people who oppose you you've challenged them to come and do the same and this is how violence begets greater violence it's fucking dangerous it's really dangerous violence does not exist in a vacuum you can't just have a little bit of violence and then there's no repercussions people react to that there's people that watch those videos and watch you get punched and there is no justification for that you see someone like yourself who's a small person slight in stature not violent in any way and you're not even swinging back you're just taking it and trying to protect yourself people get infuriated by that and there's people right now I guarantee you who saw that video who were thinking what I would do if I was there I'd fucking shoot all of them or I'd beat them all to death with baseball bats or I'd run them over with my car or do things and the unhinged amongst the right who feel like this is a in opposition of their ideology they're gonna show up someday and when that happens people are gonna die this is a fucking terrible and this is where the mayor and the police and they have not done their job and I believe the police when they say that they've been handcuffed and maybe the mayor just didn't have an idea of where this was all go but now you do this is the mayor has been in office now for three years and he finally did a press conference two days ago nine days after my talk to address this controversy right and what was so frustrating is the the the police chief had um publicly stated that she thinks the city was a state should adopt a law that makes it illegal to wear a mask while committing a crime that should be a no-brainer it's shocking that in Portland I got a better idea how about not you can't wear a mask in public at these events because you can say you can't wear a mask while committing a crime you're wearing a mask how do you who the fuck do you know committed the crime you unless you take the mask off them you can't even identify them it's stupid you can't wear a mask yet so this you know sounds like a baseline somebody policy that you should start advocating like don't kick babies yeah well the mayor said he hasn't decided if he supported it he hasn't decided if he supported whether notes should be illegal to wear a mask while you're committing a crime right that's hilarious and he had no policy proposals and he spoke as if like it was his first day in office when this was like this is becoming routine now it's almost but now in Portland in Portland is a harbinger and a warning to what can happen in other cities when you have a a governance those in the upper echelon of governance turning a blind eye to far-left militancy and just letting these thugs go on the street just imagine if it was the case if they were doing that about far-right militancy imagine if there were far-right people who are doing this and committing violence and the government was just like well you know I'm not sure if they shouldn't be allowed to wear masks why they commit crimes people would be freaking the fuck out it's the weird justification of this stuff that's that's so disturbing I just don't and I fucking love Portland it's one of my favorite places it's great the city's great I mean it's fucking cool people it's not all of them that are involved in this is a very small number and the even amongst a small number it's the very small number of them that are radical that are violent when you look at the people that are attacking you not to minimize it but it's very few you look at that video it's a couple people out of thousands of people that are in that group there's a few people that are attacking it was about a dozen was it really yes okay if you count throwing milkshakes but actually hitting you how many people you think hit you not sure three four maybe something like that okay that's the problem the problem is these fucking assholes it's not the people that disagree with you so people who think you should be able to throw milkshakes at people and guys like Carlos Mesa who don't think it's a big deal to throw milkshakes at people it's a fucking big deal it's a big deal because you it calls for a response this is why it's a big deal and people don't understand assault they don't understand violence you can't just do that you live in some comic book world or some fucking Disney show world where you can just throw a milkshake at someone they don't do anything they're gonna turn around punch you in your fucking face and then what happens well you might fall and hit your head and die cuz that's real that's the real world we live in or you might cause a giant brawl because people don't want to be hit with milkshakes or there's enough of you where you think you can get away with it so you're an awful bully and you're throwing milkshakes at someone because you don't like what they stand for and you're meeting in a public place and you're disagreeing about something so to right this disagreement you're assaulting people well for that very reason and if I never engages in like a canonical fair fight one-on-one there what they do usually as a group while masked up one or several of them will distract the person either by speaking to them perhaps or blinding them with the chemical spray and then they take turns the beating so there's even no opportunity to like no you know you don't even know how many people hitting you at that point so that's what they do blind you and then attack mmm it's so it's so scary cuz it's so dumb it's not just scary because like you watching what happened to you scary cuz you know and watching that old man got hit in the head with a crowbar it's fucking horrific all that stuff's horrific apparently that guy had pulled out some sort of a rod and was swinging at people before he got hit with a crowbar I do not know but I do know when you start hitting people in the head with crowbars that is the beginning of the end horrible horrible shit happens in response to that and it hasn't yet but this is ten days ago who knows what's going to happen if there's another one of these rallies and you get people from the far right who organized this is when the proud boys really radicalized they radicalized to go against antiva they were attacked they attacked them and then it became this fucking shit show that you're seeing right now yeah I want to state for the record though the the violence that happened after I was beat up was involving the the men's rights activist group and an tyfa cowboys was holding they held a separate event in a different part of the city as far as I know they did not there was no conflict in this in this particular yeah in this Oakley who was the men's rights guy was actually a woman a woman who's a men's rights person yes that's Alera she must love dick right yeah I guess no comment sorry I'm a comedian yeah didn't help it um you don't even have to say her name so she's she she organized this thing yeah I would say here's the other thing you know like I might what needs to be stay as well about I guess the right-wing movements that are in Portland will come to Portland to do these events there's an element of being provocative as well but that should never ever justify the violence because I mean what explain what you mean by being a provocateur well for example holding an event in the middle of downtown titling it like you need that justice for victims of domestic terrorism and then having a picture of an Tifa like that is you know you know it's an employer enjoying them yes it's an inflict you know it causes a reaction and so there's a you know there's a there's an element of coming in and seeing let's enrage these lunatics on the far left or whatever but at the same time I want to make sure I state that just because somebody's quote-unquote provocateur worked in the words of the writing that it's unfortunate that people now find that that's justification for you to react violently well I think again it's a small percentage of people that find it this justification and you look at the number of people that were there what is it thousands thousands of people how many people actually engage in violence small number but small number that's the problem it's important to note that they caught more al from the crowd who are cheering them on the cowards the cowards who don't disavow this horrific action they cheered them on laughed and clapped if I was getting beaten and then the other thing about the people showing up in numbers who don't engage in the violence is they / they are like literal human shields they dress the same so they make it easy for the few violent militants to nonde not exactly and these people also watch the cops and they keep an eye out on potential outsiders as well and yeah it's become a game it's become a game and it's become a gigantic team war there's our team versus their team it's Mike it's literally like playing a childhood game it's really disturbing man and so since this has anyone from antiva College eyes about what happened to you or disavowed the actions of these few extreme violent people of course not and Tifa has an iron fist on the people who support its movements they don't allow any type of design actually in there like press releases you can call call them they explicitly state that even basically even if you disagree with our tactics you will not publicly state it it's to create I guess this image of unity right for a corner movement if you disagree inside the organization yes so how organized are they they are a of a leader there in terms of anti-fascist we understand today really crystallized only after 2016 there's been very little academic research until how they actually organized but basically as a movement they have essentially cells across the country that are semi-autonomous United by an ideology of Anarchy anarcho-communism and their support for violence so it's not so much a group itself it's the people who are part of that movement are drawn from other actual groups they draw from the DSA they draw from various workers unions other anarchist groups and like other terrorist entities they have processes to radicalize sympathizers essentially they have their own literature as well and so it's much more organized than people give them credit for they think of them as just a you know people showing up to fight on the street it's there's there's meaning to that to that violence and this literature to back it up and they have you know they actively recruit people to join the movement so I've been asked like do you think the federal authorities should stop in my responses I think it's come to the point that they do because with an tyfa it's not it's beyond what local authorities can do because a lot of these people a lot of them are in Portland from Portland a lot of them come from for example from Eugene from Seattle from neighboring areas that have other auntie for people come in to participate in violence for that day or to help out and then they go back to where they're from so they're they're coming in and out of jurisdictions makes it hard for one local body of authorities to address it I think the DOJ needs to step in I think it's gotten to that point but and with 20/20 coming up soon there could be potential for a lot more political violence if the results don't if the elections results don't go as they wish well that's an obvious one considering the fact that this all became a thing after Trump was elected yes with if the DOJ did step in what do you think they could do so that's well I mean do you believe in the the ability to meet up and express yourself publicly and the the ability to protest and the ability to just get together and have groups and and you know express yourself yes however that's not just what anti-fur does right like I said the violence is a feature of the movement so what federal authorities do to stop either when you say the violence is a feature of your their movement is there is it did they have anything written like the tenets of their movement where they say that violence is acceptable there's a book called the anti-fascist handbook is written by Mark Bray he's an academic at Dartmouth he is I would call him when a Anti Fog chief I do log so not only does he explain what anti-fur does and in his writings News makes it very clear that the the quote self-defense is what justifies offensive violence he actually argues why that's ethical so because he's an academic well-spoken he's invited onto mainstream media to explain to basically like I said earlier mainstream antiva what can you explain him what he says yes I highly recommend that people take a look at his book the Attorney General in Minnesota keith Ellison was photographed a year ago holding holding up that book of anti phobic and that kind of what he's been criticized a bit for that he deleted that image after my beating was holding it up in support yeah he said this he said something about like this book or an typhus strikes fear into the heart of Donald Trump yeah so there's people in government who has sympathetic to antipholus this professor can explain what he says he outlines and explains essentially why anti fuzz violence is ethical that it's because they're opposing fascism and fascism is a violent movement this is sort of a pre-emptive move like we have this word fascism yet it is a problem right yes because it seems like that's definitely something you should oppose but what is the what's the actual definition of fascism fascism as a far-right political ideology from what I understand pull up the definition Jamie so we could just read what fascism with the actual word fascism means here form of radical right-wing authoritarian authoritarian ultra-nationalism characterized by dictatorial power forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early twentieth century Europe forcible suppression of put the faculties forcible suppression of opposition is what they're doing yes strong regimentation of society I mean they're literally telling people how to behave and what they will tolerate I know it's not right-wing ideology but it's almost like fascism and I'm sure there's other definitions of fascism the idea of supporting someone who opposes fascism sounds wonderful sounds great let's let's stop fascism but are we really experiencing authoritarian ultra-nationalism characterized by dictatorial power in this country I mean is that not a fair thing to say I know people don't like Donald Trump I know people don't like right-wing ideologies running this country I understand that but this is not it's not what's happening yeah the issue like fascism as defined by political theorists who have been researching this for decades it has a particular definition in meaning and that's I think that summarizes it pretty well I'm very concerned that people use it so flippantly to just refer to the right or to even authoritarianism like there's much more to it than just being authoritarian there's all those other components and I need it's important to state that an tyfa's not just supposed to the far right or the right they're also against liberal democracy there's a reason why they hate the police so much hate border enforcement and hate the rule of law it's dope against light the concept of the nation-state as we understand it and they're working to dismantle that 2d legitimate it so this is what I mean when I say it's a it's a dangerous ideology that for now you know enemy my enemy is your is your friend but at some point if this movement becomes bigger more mainstream and more people as sympathetic at some point it's going to come back against the moderate not because these people and they want to see the destruction of the nation did want to see destruction the nation-state for what purpose they want anarchy yes so there are political an arrest anarchist social anarchists they don't want borders they don't want nations they don't want police okay what do they want be I mean what do they expect what's the ultimate goal they seem to believe in a utopian utopian Marxist ideas right of this risk redistribution of wealth where we can be we can only be truly equal in egalitarian when we dismantle everything about the country so not just you know it's institutions the rule of law but the state itself like everything just has to be broken down in start over because is irredeemable I'm not quite sure if I mean they've you know an tyfa I can't think of like where they have how if there's any somewhat comparable examples around the world of what it looks like for them to do State Building right so we don't know what it would actually look like but I mean the examples we see from these smaller anecdotes is chaos and anarchy like absolute chaos and violent suppression of opposing views indiscriminate violence at times I wonder and what I've been asking over and over is how many more people have to be drawn in to have to be victims of this violence before something changes and a potent Portland now we've had three years of this and literally no policy changes have happened no even proposals have even been accepted by the mayor the previous mayor was what was his political persuasion or her I don't know these are all the people who become elected mayor in Portland's are typically establishment Democrats right so they themselves are moderate very much you know in the vein of a Hillary Clinton type of thing but there's a constituency in Portland that they have to play to four votes which is the radical people who is sympathetic to very very progressive causes and so there's a reason why to date the mayor has never named an T for one time in any of his press conferences he has no problem blaming proud boys a patriot pair of the right for issues patriot prayer not the another group prayer is one of the other right-wing movements and in and around Portland that have held pro-trump events in town that anti-fog comes to to fight and impose those turn out they devolve into riots and the police allowed those they allow it through the inaction Wow it's just it's interesting to see a city that's gone so far off the rails like Portland in this regard with this issue you know when you see this in action and what the consequences are now how it happens and it's particularly for a person like you you you physically see it you personally see it are you gonna continue to do these things because it seems like you're obviously a target oh yeah and when I was haces in my interviews this week last week the the the response that I that comes to my mom right away is of course I'm gonna continue doing it I these people throw out to me before I've been attacked before I'm not going to be cowed I'm going to continue I won't be intimidated but with the the brain injury that they gave me it's like I can't continue doing it the same way as I did before and being a naive to think that police would actually uphold the rule of law they gave me a brain injury and like I never had one before but I'm dealing with some cognitive and neurological issues so I will learn what memory issues I have issues so I have upcoming physical that neuro physical therapy as well as speech therapy so as much as like on the surface I have improved a lot since the beating there are some long-term consequences that I'm gonna have to work through and you know I have to be honest I have certain fears and anxieties of being important I've continued receive threats violent threats and they've been reported to police and just people promising to make sure next time that I won't even be able to walk away that they repeat what happens to me when they see me on the streets so like have they caught the people that did this to you so it's been ten days now more than ten days this is my beating there have been no arrests I don't know where the police are in the investigation they haven't been keeping me informed there was a photograph of someone they released yeah so the Portland Police released photos of potential suspects and asking for help in identifying one was on mouse two two of them were masked and I forgot to say earlier than in addition to the the beating they robbed me of my my camera equipment so that was my my evidence for that day and I tried so hard to hold on to it but I couldn't what about you attending this with security have you thought about doing that yeah so moving forward once I feel well enough and once I'm cleared by the doctors it may be worth it to cover these events but with professional security guerrillas big giant dudes yeah would they wear what like armor like what would you have how far would you take this I don't know what how far do you think I should take it I don't think you should go to those things anymore okay I mean it seems like you've been I mean it is part of your job you're a journalist but it seems like you've been singled out and targeted and it seems like they don't have any problem justifying attacking you and assaulting you if I was gonna go I'd bring the biggest baddest dudes that I could find and a bunch of them and have them surround you and have them protect you what's I tell you about America that in 29 I think it's America yes it's this one particular area and this one particular group and not even the group I think it's the most ridiculous people in that group I don't think it's most I think most these people that probably are a part of this really don't want fascists and they really don't want some awful right ring totalitarian regime running this country and in marginalized people of color gay people and immigrants and all those things that I support 100% I'm left-wing I mean I would be on their side ideologically about a lot of things it's the implementation of it that I have the biggest problem with it's is the group mentality it's the wearing the masks is the salts so not understanding the consequences of violence all these things this is what I have a problem with the way the mayor allows us to take place the way handcuffs the police that that is what I have a problem with it's not that they don't want horrible people running the government and running the world I understand that that makes sense but you're not for the dismounting of the nation-state right nope no no I'm not or the breakdown on democracy No yeah so these are the points that I'm trying get head-on right those are the points that are hidden right these are important things that make up the ideology of NC 4 and the the larger those who are sympathetic because of the anti-fascist aspect of the anti right wing they are ignorant of it and I hope they become aware that I think that's what's important about your work that's what's important about these discussions that's it's important about people getting the word understanding what this really means not what it seems on paper it's like we're the anti Nazi movement well who the fuck could go against that of course you're anti-nazi that's know who everybody should be that's what it seems like well we're anti fascist good we don't want fascists I think that's what Chris Cuomo was saying I think that's what Don Lemon was saying I think they're too busy I don't think they're really investigating this I don't think they're deep diving and understanding the ideology at its core the way you're describing it and whoever that professor was that you were discussing that is somehow or another condoning violence that that is ridiculous anyone who considers themselves an intellectual who condones violence all this punch of Nazi stuff goddamn it you don't understand violence you don't know what you're talking about you don't understand the human condition because if you if you understood violence it's the last thing you would ever be calling for can I talk about the the next step of what's next for sure so a lot of people listening and are frustrated and have expressed support are asking well what can I do I'm just one and this is the the power now we live in time where this crowdfunding and you know with all the points that we brought up earlier it seems to show a lot of evidence to suggest that there's something seriously wrong in the past ramones of policing and governing in Portland and that's what the the legal fund is so I'm working with Hani Dillon she represented James d'amour she's taking me on as a first client for the nonprofit that she started called if you go to Publius Lacs PU bli us le XCOM you'll see information for how you can donate and anything helps and we're trying we you know lawsuits if they happen against the city or mayor or police department costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time takes you know there's a lot of overhead costs and a lot of people you know you have to take in to do all the investing to do your own investigations so there's an opportunity for the public to get involved you know I don't want the story to pass just about Andy got beat up so what let's move on but rather there's systemic issues happening in Portland and there are implications for the rest of the country what do you think is going on with media that is supporting this attack on you because I I've seen so many journalists dismiss this as being not a big deal why why do you think that anybody would look at something like that or someone's being beaten publicly and not think it's a big deal what do you think's behind that extremist ideologies are very good at dehumanizing their opposition and that's what anti-fur does so there's been a lot of disinformation this information put out about me you know I'm not I'm not they say for example I'm not really journalist I'm just far-right provocative I'm somebody who's sympathetic to Nazis and so when you put these ideas out not only are lies but I meant to remove ones humanity they just become you know like Andes no longer auntie auntie is the face of far-right ideology and it makes people feel comfortable with violence against that and it was so disheartening to see so many writers come out and say things like you know I don't really support what happened Andy but he's done far worse or he was too provocative his writings like he came and he he got exactly what he was looking for what happened to me should happen to nobody much lesser journalist right like this is an America in a major American city we're not you know this is not in Afghanistan or Iraq where the state is weak we have a strong state we have police force why the laws not being enforced while citizens having to suffer why they no arrest why they no arrest it's really absurd and it's obscene yeah when is the next one of these things supposed to take place on the 17th of August is supposedly the next event I think the proud boys have announced that they're encouraging all of their members across the country to fly into Portland and it's always fucking Portland yeah they're kind of reacting I think to the 29th of June so we'll see what happens I'm concerned are you gonna grow I don't know you should go and get a popemobile let them throw milkshakes at the popemobile get a big old fish tank put some wheels on it have some giant dude to push you around the I'm joking around about it obviously to try to make light but some do you really think you're gonna go I don't know if I feel safe and I hate we shouldn't feel safe well I hate using the language of the identitarian left you know like I feel unsafe and all that I'm trying to remain No okay but you were assault yet twice and I continued receipt thoughts you were assaulted what may yes and then you were assaulted again in June yeah yeah so and you can send continue to receive threats is this necessary to go to these things to cover them do you think nice ain't part of the problem with people that like Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo who were talking about this who haven't actually been there they really don't understand it and maybe you do because you're covering it with boots on the ground you got it you know when you're all the way in New York City and you work for the elite media and you always even when you travel to protests you have a very large crew of security around you it does it removes you a bit from the reality of the situation and I don't think any of these people who are opining on these mainstream media television shows have actually embedded themselves to covering these violent riots that are happening in Portland or in Berkeley how many of the people that are involved in antiva do you think really understand that they're trying to dismantle the government really understand that they want the state to absolve dissolve I don't have a number for that it's definitely small it's the same people who engage it would probably be around those who are engaging in violence and those who are eating and not violence for example creating shields or whatever allowing them to hide among them those people I think understand very much what the ideology is those people who come unmasked you know and just read the the Facebook event page oppose fascist come protect Portland those people I think are ignorant of the ideology behind the movement and groups that are organizing these events I can't put a number in them this is like where there needs to be researched by academics and in think tanks to look into and this is where federal authorities because need to be looking into as well like how are they organized where are the businesses that are helping them fund some of their causes because they you know when some of them remember members get arrested they have money for bail who's involved in funding that money and who's helping to to disperse their literature that they use to radicalize people like these are this requires research and intelligence gathering and as far as I know it's not being done there's a real concern among some people that we're entering a phase of this country where there's a real possibility of having some sort of a civil unrest civil war when you see something like these Portland events when you see this kind of chaos do you think that that's a valid concern not for something that is across the country but perhaps very regional or to the city itself and not so much like civil war but the violence that is done and planned by an tyfa is meant to make the wider public not just polarizing hate each other but also began to distrust the institutions that are in place that i meant to uphold democracy so the police in portland have come under fire for example not just from the radical left but a lot of people who are normally very pro police are finding like what is wrong it's important police like we can't even trust them so there's if things just continue I think the violence will continue to escalate leading to a death or death that's my real concern it's my real concern as well and you think this is particularly unique to Portland in the way they're treating and addressing it I'm trying to think of comparable other cities that have had some of these issues so for example in San Jose in 20s and 16 Trump supporters when they were leaving a Trump rally were brutally assaulted by mobs of people and then there was a lawsuit that was launched against the city for basically putting citizens in the way of danger the way they were funneled outside of this event led them directly in front of these violent protesters who attack them you know and those footage that went viral of that year since then policing tactics have changed in San Jose as far as I know and you know involve the lawsuit so like sometimes it takes lawsuits for the local government to start protecting people's civil rights so right now as bad as it is it does seem confined to Portland we haven't seen that for example in Berkeley the type of violence as in 2017 when Milo Cain like you know that hasn't been repeated for a year and a half now so but it takes the political will of those in power to enforce the law right so you mentioned lawsuits what lawsuits are you pursuing well immediately right now what I would like to see is the city of Portland carry out a full investigation and hold accountable all those who were involved in attacking me or aided in that as well and then as the evidence whether evidence leaves if this shows that there were was dereliction of duty from those in power then you know I reserve my judgment my lawyer reserves judgment for you know who if anyone gets sued at that point but right now I'm very focused on seeing that in putting pressure on the city to arrest people who are responsible and charged on and get convictions as well all right in enclosed because I know you gotta get out here is there a silver lining to any this I mean do you think that perhaps your assault and the the fact that the police did intervene is actually allowing people understand the the real significance of this the the real problem of this that it's this is a real issue a gigantic one in fact that goes against the core tenants the value of a free expression and and the ability to gather and communicate safely in public yeah as hard as it was for me to see you silver lining when I was laying in hospital with so much pain and there's one and that is that everybody paid attention to what happened to me it was a big story even the mainstream liberal press could not ignore it and I'm hoping that from that it goes beyond just being a headline but forcing the national discourse to change on how it views and talks about mt4 we'll see if that happens I feel encouraged that we're beginning to see some cracks in the way that an tyfa has been protected by sympathetic writers in journalists and those in mainstream media I mean the fact that keith Ellison deleted that photo that he shared a year ago right after that was attacked I think indicates that there's even he faces a certain pressure that it may not be good for a mainstream politician to so actively promote this movement and I hope it continues to move in that direction if you had a crystal ball and you were looking at the future what do you what do you think you would say well based on the press release press conference at the mayor did two days ago him not sure not having any proposals it seems like more violence has to happen all right Andy I hope you're wrong me too but thank you for being here my pleasure all right take it easy thank you stay safe out there we thank you smile too [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
