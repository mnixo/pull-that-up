one Donna we're live mmm so good to see you okay this is not the corporate people expect the week off Darnell has not been tested and I have subscribed to social distancing social dis is but the new normal the news young can you move over a little bit the new normal you know Joe but just I'm protective possibly protected myself from for me right to you okay and I love you know that we have a certain amount of trust factor but this nineteen shit is kind of dead and style trustworthy you are how do you think this is well first of all I think what's really important for everybody right now is just strengthen your music first of all can I tell you something you know what you look you lost weight thank you yeah I feel good thank you yeah shut up we take that fucking thing all right where I know my folks don't give a fuck about yo-yo was he out you don't give a fuck about no coach well that's one thing is like eating well he eat healthy take vitamins this way you need take for sure vitamin C large doses of vitamin C vitamin D and zinc those are very important right now right and just focus you rock does it isn't zinc aphrodisiac yes it's good for low so you can get your music some up and get everything that's all connected to your body being healthy you know the more vital your body is the more vitality you have right you know the more your everything's gonna work better your hormones your immune system everything so those are think those are things that I I recommend everybody but nobody is thinking about that Joe all you got to that's nobody said you you have to but nobody is thinking about that like everybody everybody is like so afraid Coffee to Kobe Kobe but I personally think that you should be more afraid of catching a coal in the flu didn't get in Co v.19 I think you should be afraid of Kovac 19 but you should also be afraid of catching the flu right you know those all all that's bad oh it's bad you know it's not good to be sick but when you when you protect your immune system and keep your body healthy and strong it it definitely it's like you have troops all right you got to think of the virus is like an invading army well there's all these viruses and apparently that Lex Friedman quote what was it how many different viruses are there hundreds of thousands that are constantly competing like he was describing it there's this genius Russian scientist that I have on the particle II the co V virus was talking about the world war out there viruses but when I hear in and when it comes to a being a world war I've heard that it's cozy the nice guy wrote there's three hundred twenty thousand plus distinct viruses and mammals and a hundred million in vertebrates invertebrates and plants there's an epic microscopic world war going on all around us and inside us nature is beautiful and terrifying and then so why is this why is this one getting the headlines that's the case well it's called it's a novel coronavirus meaning no one has an immune system for it no one has developed immunity you know when you think about other diseases like the common cold or you know different flus like we've had flus people have a certain amount of immunity to flu you get flu shots you can get a flu shot it gives you an immunity to a certain amount even even when they get the flu shot wrong apparently because sometimes they guess the wrong flu strain it still has enough of what a flu is to protect you somewhat so to keep you from getting more so corona is actually a strand of this like the baby brother of the flute not really it's a it's a type of virus a corona virus is a whole category of viruses that includes the common cold this is they call it's ours to Orko vid 19 and this is a new one so then the problem with this is no one knows how it gets spread like even back as far as January they were thinking it didn't spread through the air they were thinking it so it's not it's not I don't know this might be some ignorant questions but I know dinner it's Matt's not ignorant like we none of us really know it's just we're learning so is that what like you said I think what people are fearful of the most if it's airborne yes I mean I don't know if that is the specific reason why they're enforcing wearing masks or whatever yes and I don't know if we've got to that panic stage and I know none of the people have announced it or anything but it didn't it hasn't been classified as a virus that's airborne like it doesn't just fly around motherfucking fly around shit all day well when a virus is airborne what it means is like when you sneeze or you cough or you you know breathe on someone there's moisture that's going through your mouth and into the air and it's spreading it's travelling certain amount of distance that's how things are airborne it's not like they're just flying around it's they're coming out of people and they're getting in other people so the fact that average space a muhfucka can spit some shit is six feet before it can affect you there's a lot of theories some people think it could be as much as 13 feet really yeah they don't know it's all guesswork it's all guesswork there they're learning as they go along how far but they do know it travels through the air they definitely know that there was a really sad story about a choir that got together and laughs I don't know I don't know they didn't say it oh how many people died and when you're singing together you're raising your voice you're projecting so probably feeling the air right with all this stuff you know I just it's just interesting man because you like everybody all you hear people say is like I can't wait for it to get back to normal again I can't where people like people in that and I think that people are wanting to have enough confidence in the government or Donald Trump for Donald badly but some people are just waiting for him to say okay we're good it's over and that's not gonna be the case no gonna never be like Charlemagne posted something on holidays and was it a booty picture no the booty kitchen was the Duncans Malik Yoba no you can't bring that name of booty booty can you do this this was a booty booty music at least site you just started a fucking fight I didn't I didn't but he posted oh my god and his name is Lonard Joe okay Charmaine is a great name oh yeah but the guy part is the thing I would never connect with oh yeah yeah that's well he can get away with it there's Spanish oh no it's a it's a photograph I think I was trying my hardest not to interrupt man but I can't stand him booty shows but go ahead maybe it wasn't his I saw I swore I did not bring I swear I did not bring this up just never do that I only did it because he so whoever I thought it was him someone posted maybe did it on Twitter I don't know someone posted something there was a picture of these people that got tired of social distancing after the 1918 flu and they were out in the streets celebrating the end of the war and they said that that started a resurgent cases and the second wave wound up killing more people than died in the day you know those people were young men a lot of know they were motherfuckers that was in fucked up relationships Joe if Corona does has anything yo if Corona don't test anything it's gonna test the love that you have for the person that you're supposed to love yes and I'm pretty sure like nobody wants to die right right definitely nobody wants to die right but sometimes dates bitches that you know what huh you finding out if you made a mistake I made mistake but you start and I hope that's not the case with people you start weighing it you're like oh fuck man I swear well women with men to men imagine being living with a guy who's falling apart right now fall apart in the health-wise adjustments in your life just like if you're together you're together in a house 24/7 right and you know you're you're falling apart as far as like the way you're handling this like some people just can just accept okay this is a new normal this is what there's people mothers open the fucking government right there's people that are freaking out right now right and there's people that have points and there's people that don't have points but men and women like everybody's a mess but you know you you're absolutely right and this is with and I know you've got it you're a fan of David you don't say love them David and David Garland's oh love you don't saying like yikes like I agree with you like you have different mindsets when something like this happens yeah you have the mindset of like oh fuck what am I gonna do I'm gonna get money fuck oh my only can survive off for one week somebody please help me you got that motherfucker to bitch motherfucker did you get a motherfucker that's calm and says okay you know there will be some challenges I'm not I'm not sure where the next monies will come from but I can't just sit there and bitch about I got to do something about it you gotta do something like you say and one of the things that this is gonna what's gonna happen with this it's gonna be it's gonna increase awareness on so many fuckin levels because they do these Co V fucking um briefs every day right and there's three things they say it's gonna really fuck you up if you do drugs alcohol and it's another one jumpy City so obesity drugs and alcohol they said obesity was an obese actor in New York City and this is a thing and this what you this is what they don't report and I'm not just reached I'm not shitting on anybody you know do god bless I mean hopefully nobody I know gets so just I don't want shit happen anyway but this is what they don't mention when they say these numbers you know it is crazy I enjoy beer so 500 people died today they don't break it down is it five Joe Rogan niggas is it 500 David Goggins niggas no it's probably it's you know what it is it is but sometimes it's not that's what's scary about that you know sometimes is not but we do know Joe did it contributes yes it has a major factor it's a major factor and people need to know that it's a major factor and stop saving their feelings just letting them know as a fact yeah motherfuckers is dying to Co V yes and sometimes like when you're just was live with a ventilator right he sound like biggie smalls he was like some serious nigga yes it's serious you know what else is serious to those 10 pieces of chicken that extra sweet tea that motherfucking potato salad with mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise all that shit is apart all of it is relevant all of its wrong all of it is fucking wrong you it's delicious food but you know what you're doing when you're eating it when I told you drink something that's like you know why you're drinking it like if you drink it like a regular coca-cola right it's goddamn delicious but you know you're gonna pay for and know what you're doing though it's like fram oil filters you could pay me now or you can pay me later that's all one of my shot did you tell it tell me that all the time like I was a fuck up in school right and he'd be like Darnell I'd be fucking I'd be like Daniel listen my lessons are like fram oil filters you could pay me now or you can pay me later I was young and dumb when you young and dumb you don't know what wisdom is you like this old motherfucker need to shut the fuck up I didn't know what he meant hit Celeste those lessons he tried to teach me then as I got older I was like nan I know the fuck he's talking about you could pay me two dollars for this elf air filter now or 3,000 for a whole new transmission right you know saying and people don't people don't people understand that that's a way of looking at it for sure the but with the the problem with people's bodies and like what they put into him is they they get this connection in their head that this is rewarding them the food is rewarding that's sugar yeah right sugar it's a trap it's sugar in its carbohydrates traveling so long well know no more than you black people you go to any black bears a house you want to have sugar in a cabinet in salt right you go to wipers house you have oregano you have time you have rosemary and shit like where the fuck is the sugars where's the salts will you cook right yeah I do do you how do you like are you big in the spices do you know you know I know my spices but one of the things that I'm trying to do and not like Heather because have it be as a good friend of mine right and she just everything is fried right what I want to do and I get impressed is trying to cook cleaner and for a black person telling the black person to eat clean it's like that shit nasty do you know your health work done do you get like blood work done to see yeah you know I don't know where my Maccoby shit is right now they're gonna come here is it gonna be a nurse Charlamagne long follow me they won't let you and I and and I want to know and that's another thing that's like that's a drawback of this whole process like who has access to a test you know you know I mean like who has access to a test there's a whole line outside if you go there's like a bunch of these stations they've set up all around the valley where you can pull in and they'll give you a test so what is that is that something is that something that the government spam for is part of your is show no it's a good question Jamie do you know the one that came before you need like a doctor's prescription but eventually they're gonna have to be able to eventually it's gonna have to be it's accessible to everyone should be free right should be look if we're gonna spend money on anything we should spend money on that right god damn what's the idea that we're gonna make people pay for that it's crazy yeah you can't this is a thing that's happening right now it's almost like there's a lot of dangerous shit that happens when things go into chaos because there's people that take advantage of those moments and they be rich the people get rich but more importantly laws get passed cuz people are scared and those laws can like be they could sneak something in where they ban encryption or they sneak something in where they stop digital currency that aren't controlled by sort and certain companies they can sneak weird shit in while people are freaking out 24-hour surveillance because we want to make sure that people don't loot and riot the weird shit can happen they're gonna road your civil liberties when things get chaotic different change this is a weird time you know but this is where we live this is life right now you just gotta accept you think something like this had to happen for people to put real family values and what's important in perspective is do you believe like we talked about it off like and I'm like um I'm a religious person to the extent that I know that it is something that makes people feel good about yeah you know but you know within but then you have those holy holy holy people that celebrate God on one level but then when something like this happen under stand that if you believe that God can fix anything is gonna take you to the promised land you gotta believe that he had to be part of the narrative of this of this curse it's how much responsibility you put on yourself and how much responsibility even if you believe in God you put on that like you got to do some work yourself to like even if you believe in God don't get so fat that you're gonna die you got it yeah don't do that don't let yourself do that start drinking water just exercise stopped eating as much sugar you can do it joke maybe some motherfuckers all the fucking time you gotta fucking help God help him you gotta help them you can't you can't just be like oh shit god I hope I don't get diabetes let me get the cotton candy let me get the extra sweet tea let me get the fun okay you can't do that right you're right you can't shouldn't if you do you're you're you're doing a disservice to the gift of life you know many people out there in wheelchairs they're born with horrible debilitating diseases they can't do shit people they've been in accidents people have been blown up in war they can't even move around and here you are taking a perfectly good body and just dump and bullshit into it while it just explodes and I understand that people get addicted to things you get addicted to that feeling of the rush of eating but you got to get yourself off of it you know it's got a way to live your life better it can be done other people have done it you can do it too the idea that you can't do it is stupid you know you just gave me a thought and the reason why sometime I interrupt because I know I got a TD right if I don't get my thought in that sensitive to interrupting no not in a bad way but he would have you said they love me but you know I knew you're gonna be you and I really enjoyed meeting RZA he's a fascinating dude I have a lot of respect for him and he's a genius just a really interesting guy but it was funny to watch and I haven't said this I was like this what I'm gonna do Rogan talk about like nigga I'm just gonna talk about did I just I felt like we had so much to talk about right yeah and um I don't feel like I owe anybody in an apology or anything but I would like to expand explanation please don't you're great you just being you don't try to totally deaf people they didn't have minted that you read hate you can't say they hated you there's so many people I don't give a fuck about me I already got them in a bag bro give a fuck I love you fuck you whose nasal you know it was you can never you can never get to a zero point you can never get to a no haters point it doesn't exist it doesn't exist I just need to bring it down just a little bit is it because you say they weren't managing this is how you some of them were mad a lot of them were mad you're reading too many of the comments and you did when we left this was this was before kofi idea when we would embrace when I see you a hug and a funny the irony of that interview was at the end of it you and I was feeling good about it I love yo I loved it listen brother I loved it like a motherfucker side gave me a tongue kiss you pause no Charlotte man no Charlie man yo you embrace me cuz you said I remember what you said you said at the end of because that's when Reza did the fries and you said in hearing you say this means a lot you said that might be one of the greatest out chosen podcast history 100% coming from a motherfucker is 1200 plus you just seen it all right and I was like you right and we hugged and I remember you telling me this - don't read the comments look at you like what the fuck do you mean Joe the streets love me man I had a good run and I believe listen you ever tell you something Joe you said don't really comment I know this might be excessive but I think I only read 2782 oh my god and it was nice it was nice and then they started using words did only the vocabulary of a real podcaster cringe like what words do word cringe Oh cringe just straight cringe like I need a little bit more information what the fuck is your definition of cringe there was like cringe motherfucker said and this is the real assholes they didn't want anybody to get to know me anything day was telling people exactly where on the timeline to find the discussed ahead they'd be like I almost fucking killed myself and 1738 okay kid a motherfucking get 60 minutes before we get hurt now I'm telling you you can't pay attention to that yo you're just gotta be you you're great you're sure Joe Joe that's easy for you to say Joe yo how many years did it take you to just be you and comfortable like this and the reason I'm saying that when you first started right when you're nothing and the birth of my pockets because when you first started I know as calm as your demeanor is right now and as comfortable and I may be wrong as comfortable of saying fuck them don't worry about him I know that could not have been your beginning you had to have had you and I may be wrong you had to like okay why did that person say that what do they mean by that Darnell I think I have brain damage from what from getting hit in the head don't worry about the same things that people worry about right you're absolutely right because I spa real possibility right do you know me that might be real right there might be something going on there but it's also your whole career money and I just want to stand up yeah that was free okay so you had seed you say you had a not oh I don't buy a lot of shit I don't go crazy I like cars that's my only addiction right but I'm not when I did something like Fear Factor and making some money it gave me this freedom to now do not worry about ever doing that you always have been up that mindset yeah but it reinforced it it just really things like that reinforce it like having a having like savings in the bank is nice but also doing what you want to do is nice too one of the things that I learned from Fear Factor I want to do that anymore right I don't want to do that kind of stuff anymore you know what I don't want to be premature of it but I can see you my podcast mentor you know I'm saying but not being but you're into it too early but you made me feel that type of confidence in turn and and in in terms of controlling your own destiny being in control of your own shit and this is what you want to do because I've talked to you about every time I get idea here job like we think about this it's TV show and you told me like I was excited about this idea and you were like the pocket has brought you control that you you're you right right like you're you at your best when you're just having fun being you and no one's gonna allow you to do that well my producers are gonna get greasy they're gonna get their greasy hands on you and they're gonna try to do this so get you to wear that or don't talk about this at Darnell if you could just lay back here and just let there's a bunch of people to direct to you you're not gonna get to who you really are right you gotta do it by yourself and you'll find it I don't trying to interview in your own show but where did you wait where'd you when did you feel it I just knew that because I saw Tommy interview you did yeah and and this was like I don't know this was considered the birth because this when the technology the whole thing and you were like breaking it it was weird for me to hear you breakin down the future of it yeah to somebody that was actually doing it and you said you said you got to figure out this is important how do you make money off how do you make money off it yeah but you also got to keep it the way it is where no one's fucking with it when I went to Tom Green's house he just had these wires like this is 2007 when it wasn't I'm like what the fuck they going live fuck he was law any that was dalip not only was it no people at cable when they had ISDN lines in 2007 is like just mostly a lot of people but cable it wasn't the near the bandwidth that you got now but he had all the servers and everything in his house he had turned his house he had this dope house in the hills and he had turned this house into a TV studio his living room wasn't a living room anymore it had a desk and had monitors behind it and all this was like these big fat fucking cables so that way I don't have to Canada today yeah he did this all on his own and I had actually met with the company I met them in the Denver Comedy Works and talked to them a little bit about doing something similar but I was like my thought was like as soon as you start doing with a company now you're now you're doing the same thing again yeah you're just doing it online you there's different kinds of people and it's not it's not a value judgment but there's different kinds of people there's wild creative people and then there's studio executives studio executives are the people that have to look at these wild creative people and go how do I make sure that donal doesn't go crazy I'm gonna put him on this show that's why I'm not on it's too wild we got to bring them he said son too much we got a we got to keep him on the commercials have to come in seven minutes he has to be ready to make that break they'll and they'll say look we've got numbers Donnell that shows when you start talking about this people get upset and they tune off right but if you just you know talk about this we're better so we've written you some talking points and they'll bring you some shit look we're not writing for you we're just giving you like what do it fuck is this but I do need the money I think you have to have a meeting and Debbie's gonna pull you into the office and go Donnell I just don't think you respect me okay we have to work together I'm your executive Peter sir you know I'm here to put this show together you have to work with me and I don't want to I would love to work with you but I don't want to cuz you don't respect the fact that I that you don't respect what I'm doing so how the fuck do you get to respected wild creative people it doesn't always work out like sometimes they don't it doesn't pan out a podcast doesn't pan out or a TV she doesn't pan out but at least you they have a chance right like you can't have a podcast like yours yours is a perfect example you're just you she just a lot of it is just you ranting into the camera about shit you can't no one would ever let you do it that way and let us wild and organic that's why and that's why you when you were trying to tell me the beauty of it I wasn't understanding another reason I wouldn't say I was like all right motherfucker win do the money kick in like I understood he was like yeah Danielle's gonna be one I was like this alright what number do I hit when I start gently they they'd say it's like when you start getting I think it's like a hundred thousand downloads right that's when advertisers become interested in you that's legitimate that's a hundred thousand people and as long as you pick your products carefully I definitely do a good man right now I'm come dick pills mine was the fleshlight was the first one flashlight flashlight what's the flashlight a flashlight is a fake pussy that comes me for that one right now let's do some fucking business I'll do some business with you I bet if they still do

have you one to sell anything because i'ma tell you and I agree we just said and I was like and I wasn't concerned I wasn't thinking about what am I gonna make the money on the podcast first thing I

know if you have corona or you kind of feel it right your sense of smell and your sense to test that's why Joe you're not gonna believe this right I came up with a one-of-a-kind this is a specific to me it's the Daniel Rowling show okay now I'm not a--not of you familiar with a smell called black ice black ice do you know black ice no you know what black ice I don't know I wouldn't lie to you no

oils going from ashy to classy breathe in the memories of cold air hitting your skin on a winter's day shades of your skin getting a shear and ashy air as the brisk wind hit your arms and ankles captured the energy of a good lotion without having it black ash eliminates the smell of torque and replaces it with his exotic smells the ingredients Joe I don't know the first one what does that bergamot bergamot please I don't know what that is do you know what that is Jim bergamot we sandalwood I've heard of that Musk uh-huh Elan lavender jasmine and amber Gallagher's ambergris ambergris and this okay am because this is where um cuz I have a really professional person that does these cans right amber juice and I was talking to somebody there's really a health nut into raw stuff and this what else I heard ambergris was at first it was sperm from a whale I knew usually get excited about this key what I thought about it this is what I heard first it was sperm from a whale that they mined for it right but come to find out it wasn't I thought it was I was like oh shit my candle get a weld nut right but it's not that it's the byproduct of an actual sperm whale do you know when the no cruelty no please cruelty that's the most important the load out of the whale without being see that's when the story started to just that that's what the story got flaky you know I mean I needed to know more I was like who was jerking the West sixty thousand which I've fucking pop-up ads you son of a bitch what is it oh you have to give them an email oh shut up I know you got somewhere well I was gonna say is that Red Bull we found out that Red Bulls made with taurine and the original source of taurine they said get it from bull testicles really bull nuts yeah like Hitler apparently was into taurine bull nuts yeah yeah ooh it's like some form of testosterone or something or some form of stimulant well anything that has something to do with sperm it feels like I supposed to give you super super strength or something people are silly ambergris how to tell if you've struck gold with the whale vomit or stumbled upon sewage oh so sometimes you they find it like floating around yeah oh is it the first thought I thought it was sperm so I was like who the fuck is swimming through oh my god look at that shit it it can be up to 71 thousand dollars for a 1.57 kilogram lump that's like three three and a half pounds right so I'm like this is a lava what is the whale what what is it the well it said well vomit so it's like truffle yes look I knew it I know it's compared to fucking truffles mmm my shit I can do got truffle each type fucking ambergris soprano sperm whale that's what it is scroll back up a little bit there Jamie and is no cruelty nobody beat the shit out of the whale it's not whale sperm it's a product of the sperm whale that's not only a sperm whale makes the compound responsible for ambergris alors it's called Ambreen and different organisms biosynthesized different compounds such as caffeine maybe cocoa coffee or tea plants Ambreen is made by sperm whales only to glue together squid beaks what the so what you fan now Joe is my candle is baller as shit look at this and the rest of it listen Larsen is squid is the main diet of sperm whales but the beaks can't be digested they need to be passed out without causing injury and they do this by coating them with Ambreen so the sperm whale creates this amazing shit just to dissolve beaks of squids I'll be a mother fucking candle goddamn nature's and to be my fucking camera my black ass but the thing is it's some quality shit in there Joe and in the thing but it was it was I was gonna launch this before the corona should hit but I had to ask myself like this with put things in perspective for me I'm a row red you know I'm a Road Dogg yeah me you a Road Dogg you start feeling company like I get you look at your candle you can't a comedian you look at your calendar and see your counter you like I'm good and the rhythm of my calendar before the ship hopped I was rocking with Martin we had fucking dates coming on you know I'm saying I had some I went I'm not supposed to do you this was gonna be my weekend it was you and Dave on a Friday and then Martin Lawrence the next day as they saying the streets God was good as a motherfucker the last show idea before these mandates came in it was at the UM at the mill what you probably played it before Milwaukee theater yeah if happened the Pabst Theater yeah so you've been down in that green room downstairs mm-hmm incredible that was the last time the last time I was on stage do you remember what weekend that was it 14th or was it the weekend before that there was like a couple of weekends where people are still like a member host Malone had a big show it was very but it was a bad rap it was like you know the reason why because seeing a day's road guy whatever every like when we were on the road every day was a different news report you don't say it was right when it was going down Joe like it was like where's my rating yeah it was everybody was like oh fucking this what was here the NBA baseball and we was like this week good we telling jokes bow-bow I did next thing you know the shit yeah was shut down but I said I was like hold up motherfucker you are really unemployed right now you know and when I say that my flow of income is Road and I'm like what do you do you got savings and shit but you still nobody wants to just see money going out and no money coming in and then I was like I was happy yeah that's why I was always thank you but I was happy because you got me out the gate so the momentum is dear and I needed to put the focus and I was forced to put the focus in it but I put the focus on and I said myself as all these comedians bicha what am I gonna do I'm like you got three months to figure out what your rhythm is gonna be and what you gonna do you can wait for this is what you ever you consider to be over you could wait for it's over and then like start now or you could start now and the only ways I'm saying like that they can of think it was gonna be a novelty thing whatever but I was like this candle is gonna gonna train me on what it takes to come up with an idea market it get people excited about it provide a quality product and see what the feedback is you know so I know it may seem like so simple to people but as I've always had a entrepreneur spirit but never was forced to really write engage it yeah well you know you only have so much time right that's it we're doing stand-up consoling you're always on the road there's only so much time to do other things and the worry is that if you do try to do other things those things will take time away from your standup that's what every comic Cory but I was a road rat yeah so and I talked to you before it starts somebody said every time I do it any of you first thing people at all it must be cuz we're on a stage you and I are we do this shit you know I'm saying we don't just okay I got an arena tour coming up all right I'm gonna take two weeks I'm gonna tape look I'm gonna tape an hour special I got one week to prepare for it and you see it it's reflective of the show you can bring out that people know we straight up Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know you probably not soap you you do clubs anymore I do all the clubs do you do you go out and hit like yeah I still do I'd like to I like to do Comedy Works in Denver so you know what those reps those are up so that's what that and down you like for that person it's just like everything we express and we as part of what we do it because it's somewhat about therapy you know I'm saying you angry or something they be go fucking talk about it you happy about something let me go fucking talk about it you know like so there's people like that when it's time when it's when it's time to put up you you fucking ready to do it you I mean you want you're working out yeah you have to is this this we've all tried stand-up different ways you know there's been comedians since the beginning of stand-up trying at different ways and pretty much everybody agrees you got to do it constantly and that's and I always lose my thorn this where I start to interrupt but the question that I had to bring my back and I'm learning to be better at this is people always actually these interviews they say oh and I was this was follow up on us how we love performing they say oh man it's gotta be fucking killing you to not be able to get on stage and if if I didn't have my son like the thing now is unreplaceable and it doesn't affect me as much you know I'm saying it doesn't oh I gotta get out because the time I was like okay I got to do three spots tonight I'm watching Oram world with my son I'm building a goddamn fucking a fake candy machine out of cardboard so it's the transition for me hasn't been that tough because I just put that energy somewhere else and it's been amazing fuck my son's four years old Joe this is the longest stretch of time I've spent with him since he was born not because I'm a neglectful dad or anything because you guys show's gonna put things in perspective because at one point I was like I can't miss this show fuck that you gotta go get the money gotta get the money now that I'm getting this town my son going back out of whatever I'm glad just you know what maybe I just should start considering counseling that weekend you know could do things around here to know what I'm doing I've been thinking a lot about that about almost like doing like an LA residency like find a place it's like a 500-seat theater or something but this is what this is this is beauty of Kobe if there's anything it makes you think on a different level what makes you think that this is really temporary just because it's always been there doesn't mean it will always be there what you mean virus or them whatever life is way the way arc society is structured this is new alright this the cities themselves are new they've only they've only been around here for a few hundred years right we Taman friends think Weesa the world started in the 60s whatever it is whatever the date is we all know that the world used to be very different we just assumed that the way it is now is the way it's gonna stay that's not a good assumption because it's all volatile and changes constantly and there's natural disasters that are way scarier than this virus this thing's like asteroid impacts that are inevitable there's things like super volcanoes which are inevitable they're going to happen whether they happen a hundred thousand years from now or a hundred days from now somewhere in the world a giant volcano is gonna explode and it's gonna turn the whole fucking planet into nuclear winter equinox shit it's gonna die it's gonna cloud out the Sun it's gonna cool the temperature of the planet and it's gonna do it for years and a lot of fucking things are gonna die that's happened a ton of times of that I mean this what we're having right now it's been a condition too because they went through it we never went through anything but this is why we're going through something that is the good if there's anything that's good about going through something is that you're forced to realize that something can happen something real can happen that shuts the world's economy down and no one saw it coming something real that's a real thing but we really haven't had an American we really haven't had that test no but this is for the whole world though this is like a planetary test and the good thing about that is you get to see how different people try it different people have different you know strategies they have to deal with their public and their healthcare and it's very different results all over the planet and they're gonna analyze all that shit and try to find out why Germany did so well and Italy did so bad and this and that they're kind of try to put all this stuff together it's it's a it's a terrible time for the people that are affecting the people to get sick but you know that's not a good thing do you think but people can get something good out of it when there's something good out of a bad thing and the good thing is to prepare yourself better you know I agree what you want to person but do you think this because well you you talk about it you know only my fuck I wouldn't know there with no more than ten viruses most muffles I grew up with only know one virus you know you know all the viruses do you think and we don't know all the virus you know nothing to me you know I barely know what I'm talking about yeah but it just sounds good cuz I'm but you write off them ten syllable words like you know all fucking viruses but you don't have to clap it out but they say this is what they say by the virus to this what they say about the virus to Joe they say it's a bitch's virus yeah like they like is it for some people for some people do you think and I've heard that well you think it'll be flattening more or when it starts getting really really hot are you dumb do you think that I heard it doesn't survive like 85 degree or 90 degree temperature this is what I read somewhere that it doesn't have that the likelihood of it living out of your body whatever as little as a lot shorter yeah I don't know if that's true but I do know that for whatever reason there are seasons right where people get colds I mean it kind of makes sense it yeah because wouldn't be on surfaces as long like they'd get somebody have a cold in the summer you like whoa yeah you okay cuz those viruses don't flu viruses in them corona virus that's like some cold shit yeah I don't know enough to comment on that but I do know that their words it's gonna be a second wave the words gonna be a first wave and then people gonna relax and there's gonna be a second wave it'll be a second wave as people have to if people build too much confidence it's definitely gonna be a second wave what's weird to me is how some people get it and it's nothing they don't even they I had a call for a couple days I can't believe I had that person close to mind it works in my camp I was his name or whatever right principles just motherfucking had Corona Light yo I know this I had to be friends the Tru dis muhfucka said oh she liked all this shit right and didn't muhfucka say he was home like three days later about what fucking type of Corona you got so he's in the hospital for three days yeah it was a hospital that's listen if you're in the hospital for three days it means you got it bad michael madsen a fucking honda yo michael yo in a weird thing about the michael yo joint cuz like I love Michael yeah he's such a great dudes of great guy know Joe he's a great guy so I was up early every month for 4:30 I'm up early right and same people are up like five o'clock hit I poses something in in yo liked it which is okay normal of him and then he comment I was like motherfucker you up right I'm like you want to comment you up you could you could like in your sleep right that's a comment you could just automatic like how many I all this muhfucka like blah blah comment is like okay put the glasses on right so in this one I was up the notion I was like motherfuckers um the shit just so fucked about this pandemic is that motherfuckers are afraid to die and then I said and this was this was my mom when I was like only time motherfuckers really think about living is when they think they're gonna die that's when when someone do what the doctor says well how long do I believe three years they might want to do everything they want to see it parents more yeah wanna fucking do they bucket list shit you know I'm saying I was like that's is motherfuckers they afraid to die and you got to know that it's inevitable that is gonna happen to everybody you know so I would just I just wanted to rap when yo so I told him I said man and I told me so shots at man my fuckin trying to live and to a motherfucker is I'm thinking about dying Michael yo said nigga almost died right and that moment was so meant so much to me for so many reasons Oh to hear Michael yo say they were niggas say I got the same feelings with Wayne Brady said is Wayne Brady because one of the most unscathed motherfuckers you know this mother it's like Michael your name should have been Preston or something like that right and then he told me what his situation was whatever and he's getting better and he had NASA whatever but he got it bad he was in the hospital and he legitimately told me he thought he was dead to my point as much as we want to consider it that's all we hear the death of it the death yeah soso die in 24 hours but this is about Michael yo you have to really consider is that he's healthy he's young exactly he's robust like he's a guy works out alive does allowance when you hear that he got it and almost died you're like oh well this is a different thing I'm thinking too Jojo don't let all tryst you I gotta get a no health health help you get in touch with your black side or your Asian side which which side did Michael yolk have caronian yeah black thin and he works out a lot like he's not he's not overweight at all and he lifts weights a lot we got about on the podcast he goes to this like weightlifting gym that place he goes to it's like some it's just all weightlifting boxes and and and he's a healthy guy that's why when I say the point I'm making is like you know it's not like this may sound crazy like when you back in a day when you heard about aids you didn't hear when it first popped nobody survived that shit it's true nobody it was like you get a's nigga for months it's a rat and everybody thought they had it and everybody thought they had but the reason why and it took some time for it doesn't have a cure but people living with it people tested when did you get tested about four years ago the first time you get tested for not the first time the first time was like I got jested for an insurance thing that I had to do for health insurance and like 92 some 92 ish that was so terrifying yeah just a slide show her own enjoyable decisions I've made the corrosion but depressed making but when that first when that first hit when that first hit motherfuckers was like he was like but people didn't really take it as serious because they just thought it was just associated with a certain lifestyle well you know originally we thought anybody could get it that's what they were really worried they're worried that I mean this was remember they when did they even start calling it HIV like in the beginning they were just calling it a it's right yeah people worried about and you know I think before that even called it the gay cancer like they were trying to figure out what it was it was killing people but when I took my first test in 92 I remember all my friends were going through a similar situation and everybody was terrified to take the test because we were all convinced that it had some incubation period well you could have it in your body and you'd be fine for five years boom and they would it would kick in but a point to the point I'm making about that is that like um but like you hearing you hear these stories of people like Michael yo mmm-hmm you hear the story about the person I was talking about earlier you hear people that when you heard they got or whatever that they made it through people are surviving it you know some people yeah some people yeah yeah but that's what's weird about it man it's killing some people that are young and apparently there's something called that I never took any consideration called viral load and this is a kind of sperm whale where let's never do that what is it exactly define viral load so it depends like someone who works as a nurse in the ER who deals with a lot of these patients is much more likely to get it that someone just gets in contact with one person who has it that's the constant being around yeah the load I mean they're these these poor people that are working in health care right now they're dealing with this constant environment of sickness and a lot of young nurses regarding yeah that's the that's the young doctors that is so fucked up in his soul and that's it's just because you like you know we have the shortage of these masks and everybody's doing masks and stuff and one of my friends is like I need a mask I was like you better get a scarf do something right it was like no I need to m94 3m so and so I'm like if you're walking to have you walk down the street with one of those fucking surgical doctors masks to go to the fucking store you should feel ashame your self because the doctors and nurses are the people that need that stash the people that are out there on the front line are the ones that need that stands that's tribute in California you have to wear those now yeah you have to I'm talking about the level like the one I'm talking about is the one that mean that the real filter the real filter one and not know that they like at first it was all about everybody was like of the notion you got to have this certain mass but then they said you know you have to cover yourself have to do it they want to let you into certain spots because yeah ya know you there's a new law in Los Angeles in Los Angeles when you're out you have to have your face covered which is man that is is that just that just for going into businesses or just repress it to say yes now people in the future like when are you gonna tell them they can't cover their face anymore this is where it gets weird because before before it was weird if you saw someone with their face covered you would get nervous one agent were trying to rob you if they weren't Asian imagine if you're a guy who works at a 24-hour convenience store and everybody's got a fuckin face mask yeah you know how much that guy's his tension has spiked your anxiety is spiked everyone could potentially rob Jovi another movie late night shift do you know believe that's why I got a see-through mask you want to get back to really racial profiling all right but you're right that has to make people work in a liquor store and you know like your your really your store has been robbed a couple of times already how if I wait here's a liquor store anybody's thinking about Rob legs sir keep in mind that I'm almost certain that every motherfucker to own a liquor store got a shotgun or pistol back there yeah I don't give a fuck they gonna have something back to you so take it roll up in here with your fucking spider-man mask if you want to you gonna get your head split that's a crazy job to be in man put yourself in a situation where every day you go at work you might have a gun stuck in your face and be told to empty out the cash register like any day like you're living fear of that the people coming in might rob you I said I was at I have a routine I don't socialize about go get coffee right there's a 7-eleven I go to and I know the motherfucking Mexican motherfucker they work in here right and I was outside a car and it was a black guy in here I could tell him if I was looking the black guy next thing you know I was about to do a radio interview DC my man Joe clear shut up and these motherfuckers started rumbling like fighting like going at it like fuck you fuck you in my instinct was to try to go help or do something and for a second I was like all this is fucked up man stop that did I was like Rhona out there motherfucker I'm not getting it and they finally they stop but it just it was just weird like that kind of contact unless yeah you're stopping a man from doing that to a woman or unless you're stopping someone from hurting someone as much motherfucker where for 7-eleven Joan like he's defending whatever might have been a can of spam or whatever the situation is oh that's he's fighting over I don't know what it was I don't know what it was I'm pretty sure he's accused guys shoplifting oh but he put us especially in this day and age wherever and in the state to where this motherfucker was fighting he was fighting for this shit to let it go yeah you gotta let it go I'm like this motherfucker you have especially cuz you're just an employee imagine having a fight for a can of spam but that's an employment paid five dollars an hour anyway in a whole damn way what's minimums like you know they're trying to make it 15 I don't even know anybody that's making minimum wage I know a few people I bet it's like $11 I think is like 11 or 12 bucks yeah yeah yeah Majan fighting someone for 11 or 12 bucks an hour they will fighting to the death okay Mexican they would home depot MMA match they'll do the fight mask free they don't give a fuck that's a yeah but I would just like this goddamn what what are you loyal to this company or are you loyal to the fact that you're in there protecting these 7-eleven Goods because you're providing money for your family but I'll say he doesn't even have a fucking security guard like the guy behind the counters gotta go but it was just whack it was it was one dude one dude no no he couldn't jump they couldn't jump anything was one fucking dude imagine being that dude it's in the sketchy area with the late nights the late night shift and just sitting there looking out the window looking those people you're in there like a little target man I'm telling I would be more fearful of that dude as in that situation every day did a motherfucker just coming in here yeah because he you know he's played that scenario on his head forever probably has to audio button and everything yeah a lot of people they catch people slipping all the time it's just those videos you watch on YouTube and you see someone get shot or you see something at robbing like man this is just a job just a terrible job and you're gonna gun put in your face think about getting actually mmm-hmm daddy I was I used to live in Brooklyn and I Salinas area called fort greene-clinton hill and it was in right now beginning of being gentrified right Spike Lee used to have a house right down the street and I used to do a porch a comedy poetry night get a little money from the head or whatever and one night I'm going to the weed spot all right I'm like fuck I'm gonna go get some weed I've got the weeds by two motherfuckers rolled up on me and I know I was in gentrified neighborhood because my hood senses were down I should have never been looking down to my father's Road me give me a shit motherfucker oh shit it was like where this motherfucker said wear the jewelry cuz I'm not a flashy type of Prayer he said where the jewel where the phone at motherfuck I was like I don't travel like that I don't get down like that this mother said are you a broke motherfucker you calling me broke and you fucking robbing me out like what the fuck somebody didn't raise you right that makes no sense and I was still gonna go to the Wiis buggers I still had a couple bucks in my pocket right but I was like it would be just my luck I go to the weed spot and the same motherfucker that robbed me is in the goddamn weed spot yeah but that shit was like people and and when it happened to me I felt fucked up I felt so violated cuz I'm like you a bitch I would respect you more if you mug me you know like beat me up for my money but to pull a gun out and have that advantage and think you tough that shit was so fucked up and I felt so violated on the inside I was thinking like probably what most white dudes think you know what I'm gonna jump for the gun like you I'm thinking probably do you think I'm gonna disarm them cuz I know you got to move it somebody put I know you you know something and somebody put a gun to you you'll be like and then next thing you know the gun did be in their face I was thinking that shit but I was like if I miss people have a distorted idea what they can do especially if the guy's got a gun yeah you have a real distorted idea of how quickly you can move through space like all this person has to do is this that's it that's a great equalizer so that's what the movement like that kid can kill you and that's was the reason why I didn't go with how I felt on the hints you have to give them the money it's just uh yeah you're right it's a it's a bitch way to do things but it is just a it's a part of society that most people never use most people never pull a gun on people to get what they want but some people do it's a real thing and it's uh it's a it's one of the weakest thing someone can do it is it felt in you but it also you feel powerless but it also come on the other side on the other side it can protect you you know I watched a video today of these games the other side on in places that we talk about is for the other side where places where it's legal like you know the only people that have guns for protection and I'm speaking I live in New York was the police legally right legally yeah that's where it gets real crazy right like then it's like California is the opposite California it's not that hard to get a gun you know people would think that California be way more liberal than New York but New York it's very difficult to get a handgun you can get like a personal carry not just for like if you I know if you a business you carry a certain amount of money you can get a gun in California you can get it just by having a clean record yeah you can get it for your home yeah Nevada has really interesting well excuse me Arizona has real interest motherfucker pick this up for a short time his shit was yeah Arizona you could have it out yeah yeah it's a open carry state that's the equalizer that shuts down so great Arizona yeah that's Arizona right yeah it's all Wild West down there I know for sure I've seen a guy that was I had a gay guy he was not only our driver but he was he had a shit ring like Joe exotic right he's in Oklahoma so he's walking around yeah they must have it open carry law doesn't the funniest ever but it's so many people connected with different personalities and I'm watching this shit like like this motherfuckers really crazy I was like but he's think he was the probably the originator of trolling he was a marketing gee if you think about it yeah he was a marketing genius every time you thought you had him he knew how to flip it but then he got like what most trolls do they go too hard he turned it to Takashi's 16 high there's like bruh you got enough followers brother yes look at you win do fucking hard that's what it was hard and that lady went and got him yep it didn't I guess he was so used to trying to win that and eventually he lost by trying to win so hard well he was just Karl fucking yo he was what Karl fucking basket yo he was funny with that shit it was hilarious it was very very obviously he had a sick obsession with her though it's not like it's a it's it's cute when you're watching a documentary that doesn't affect you personally when you're watching you know seven episodes of this guy shooting a Carol Baskin dummy I don't think he had as much obsession with her as he had obsession with Fame and people talking about him and he knew that she was the right person to keep talking about to give him the fame he wanted I believe like he knew his boys everybody that ain't gonna give him the headline I think it was also she was going after his business saying that he she she apparently has a different philosophy on sanctuary yeah what she does is different saving him yeah and she's not into the cub pettings right there's a whole cub petting industry apparently so that she was reporting them on that and you know his argument was like what the fuck are you doing right anytime you putting a big cat in a cage right doing the same thing is you treating it better in the cage so you have a holier than thou attitude it's crazy you know these things should be wild this should be loose in the wild and this should be a few of them maybe that are if there's a worry about extinction a few of them that are isolated somewhere but to have it like that but I probably braids they probably had similar um they both had similar personality traits because they gave a fuck and didn't give a fuck at the same time both um shits I mean that but her shit came on the most more peaceful side his shit was a aggressive nature he was you want my fucking what but that shit was funny oh I got a lot I would like watching him blow shit up bro but look at him walking around with the knee brace on the guns out and the fucking permanent eyeliner I mean he's just he's right out of a movie no when they showed a picture with him with his three husbands I like this movie and they're both saying they're straight I'm straight you can saw you know you can do that right now right Joe you know that right now right straight guys can you can they say this is what I've heard on the streets in certain diagnosed a with speech then this is what I'm saying I understand that this were Muslim outlets right said you could suck a dick twice no no what still three then you would be gay okay you wanna suck a dick twice so first is a test second is confirm your test so I get double-blind placebo-controlled dick suck it study it is but it's only two like the same process in a comedy club to drink minimum like this is what I heard in those streets I don't know those streets but you could do it they got a new shit called fluid Oh gender fluid you're back and forth judge the fluid means like they don't matter actually orientation fluid or gender fluid would be your boy or girl you go back and forth from being a boy and a girl yeah it's like any party you go to you win mmm you know it's like never sausage party not to me chips you always fucking win it's all confusing well yeah it is all confusing I don't know do whatever you want do that's all you can do if you want do whatever you want to do just be should be that big of a deal it's the problem is this big of a deal for other people like that's that's where it really becomes a problem right if someone is anything whether they're very masculine very feminine very gay very straight the problem is not what they're doing the problem is how other people think about what they're doing and whether or not they give them a hard time for if they think it's wrong it's not it's not for you to judge if it's wrong exactly that's where when when it comes to like religion like why do people focus that's a big one that I always get weirded out with about respect particularly with Christians it's like why do you care because if you if you really want to focus on the Bible there's so much shit in there that you're not supposed to be doing you're not supposed to eat shellfish you're not supposed to eat sir what tips do animals you're not supposed to wear different two different types of cloth like if you want to follow the old school that dog nobody wants to follow to the you you why do they care about the gay part though why is that part like it's a freedom issue it's very clear that those two guys whether they're gay or straight they wanted to suck Joe exotics dick okay that's why they were the owner they wanted to you hanging around with Tigers they might down the meet they did it because they like Tigers so the sukkah dicks so they can hang out with Tigers right but for whatever reason they decided that doing it was better than not doing it particularly his both of them could have beat the fuck out of him anytime they wanted to that one guy was gigantic does it one young kid like the model looking dead it was a gorilla he was fucking gigantic with huge ass hands I know you don't want to beat the shit out of that dude but the one I would've beat the guy with three teeth he would have beat the shit out of him too yeah that's what I liked it get right in that gap oh you had a toothless blowjob from a tattooed motherfucking you live it tattooed motherfucker with your name tattooed above is there yeah promising right didn't it say something like that something what did it say but almost Tiger motherfuckers freakery in some kind of way they were all freaky but I you know I feel like it's it almost doesn't seem real it's the show so crazy there doesn't seem it's so crazy that a lot of people feel like it's played out like people talk about it too much yeah because it just hit it was good but the thing about it when I say marketing whatever he knew everything we do record that shit this is that the same guys at a different one not a look like they don't know he's gotta see that what the tattoo is that's like Halloween right there check no there's another one above his dick that he got covered up with a bull there it is right there bang go Charlamagne ago right there what does it say privately owned yeah Joe exotic privately owned and literally turned it into scribbles and a bull he can still see the actual light he decided not totally cover it that's like indicative of his whole life did you see the follow up did you see the follow up they did he was like he was up said yeah a tattoo artist was low offended because they didn't give his properties intent swept up Yoda please they fear not the fact that was blowing his do like yeah yeah we didn't like the way that tattoo was tatted well it didn't that's why I got confused I thought that they were all on meth right didn't hit someone but what didn't that guy say that he hasn't done anything in like four years I think he said that wasn't from math or something oh okay hey what is what it is yeah but um it was hit by an animal that's true too like a lot of hockey players have no fucking teeth but they that's a badge of honor frog he plays they don't give they got enough they like fuck this she like to take him out and show you in Canada you see a mouth like that you think he's a millionaire and fucking and fucking Ohio is like that month was hitting that myth have you ever seen the photograph for that old school hockey player who has all these scars all over his face no I don't know do you know I'm talking about Jamie it's it was a recreation of every scar this guy had ever had on his face over his career I there's a it's a famous photograph and you could see these it mean it looks like he's just been in a fucking box cutter fight his whole face is just butchered yeah cuz all they did was look at this guy's face yeah that's it and what was it it may get large yeah yeah bro he's a goalie before they were mask bro then like when I'm casting surgery facilities in LA dude he was a goalie before they used fucking masks look he was just straight face they would just take it in the mug son you mentioned a guy slap sticking one of those fucking hard-ass pucks how fast can they make those things go now they can make him go well over 100 hundred 20 by 40 oh my god really I'll check fastest lap shot yeah I think it's you have you seen that photo of that dude who does that long drive with the golf club do you know I'm talking about this is Jeff deulim there's this really jack dude who hits this guy he's got this crazy step through happy Madison or happy gilmore type stroke to it and he makes the ball four you know so he one of those outdoor ranges it flies over the back net it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life oh you probably saw a clip of somebody hitting it out like the top shotgun you see but you've seen that one guy who step sideways he steps to it like happy gilmore ladies about to kill it it's bonkers how far that thing flies I want to find out where wasn't it he holds the maybe he looks like a bass but he's big dude he looks like he looks like a pro baseball player but he holds the long-distance world record for for a golf ball drive like drove it the furthest so he holds the record dude it's the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life and I don't follow hockey like that I've been to one hockey match I was in New York I think the Rangers played somebody but I've been to a couple they're fun it's wild in person you know it's on TV there's a lot of things like that stand-up is a good example there's a lot of things like that we see it on TVs like jazz looks good but if you're there like oh shit you'll escape that's what it would the interest for me then you know yeah I'm black you go to hockey my you like you just want to see a fight you like this monition you don't even know who's playing who you like oh shit he just fucked him up do so how to fight now there's some hockey fights where you watch guys throw like crisp punches like with technique you know oh Jesus you think they trained for a hundred percent oh you're saying yeah you can fight it's the only sport where you can fight like look you do you practice hitting the puck yeah okay we'll practice beating the fuck out of people can I do that - that's protective part of the game part of the game is beating the fuck out of each other that's the wood there's no other sport just stop and think about that no no other sport we could fight bare-knuckle in the middle of an ice-skating rink at a drop of a hat well yeah if they continued and continued to be friends at the internet shit and the referees I'll let you do it they step back yeah they never like keep talking - they never like fuck ya'll meseta mars-like ba pop I got it there's some videos that dudes getting flatline no it's different than it was back in the day cuz back in the day they were tough guys who knew how to skate and could maybe fight a little bit and so they'd grab each other's fucking their jackets or grab their or their clothes and they'd be punching each other slam and move it all now dudes are hitting guys with hip throws and slamming them onto the ice and knocking him unconscious I seen a dude about hit a guy with a perfect counter right and a dude swung at him he backed up like this too right there let it pass right yeah just hit victim oh that guy could fight that's a that's a guy with real skills that's a smart motherfucker yeah he just stood right in front of the guy who let the guy threw a punch and then BOOM I could even imagine having that you know you might have to fight to balance yourself on skates it's just like do get it I wonder how you compare that like this guy this guy he jacks it God didn't even really run up to he's called the swing man I'm saying here's a run up to it but he picks his leg up it's a weird watches move see that you got a bunch of videos of him 106 miles an hour for the fastest laps that's insane that's so fast with that puck 106 miles an hour that puck hits you in the face some people can pitch that faster right I don't want the world record of pitches whats the world record pitch well just when I guess my guess 111 is that ridiculous 105 yoader's Chapman damn that's funny how do you hit that his mother be connected with this shit how many times can they throw that fast that's he can do it a couple times in a row I think he burns his arm up pretty fast I would imagine how could you not burn your arm out think of how much explosion is involved in this god damn that was a that was a blink of an eye it's interesting like the mechanics of when you watch a real amazing pitcher this is crazy body torque going on look at this whip there's so much in that man there's like there's so much mechanical movement and leverage in your legs does that recent coordinates like within the last 10 years nine years ago there's his video of the bird that's flying by right when the pitch comes at it and I quoted it slow my big cat explodes that's crazy was it Randy Johnson yes right oh yeah Randy Johnson a rocket he used to tear shit up it was exciting he I don't know when his during his era people were excited because all in the news artists watch this he hit the bird right in mid lighten the burden sploded imagine - at the end for that birdie like how the fuck look at the world has a plan here's your plan birdie oh yeah ceremony level nothing know that birds dead as fuck imagine that I mean that dudes throwing a hundred miles an hour right or 90s ultimate something told me not to turn right there oh no just went right by it I guess one-minute video mechanics did go back to that the video again the part were Randy Johnson look at look at the mechanics at how he throws his body into that pitch look at this you step off there's so much good it's like a little coordinated movement he's really in any matter yeah what support can leverage no matter what's 11 who's that big just think about all that leverage man plus he can reach almost a foot closer if not more than that than any other picture so he's literally releasing it at a closer distance than anybody else you know so yeah last time that's true it's a good way to look at it that leverages never just interesting man you know cuz it's such a it's such a huge factor in some sports you ever throw a pitch out no way I embarrassed my shoulder it's just like your ego goes yeah one shot of 50 cent throwing a pitch out and he looks so gay doing it was funny he probably had that deleted from the internet I just saw this yesterday I don't know why it was coming around but this is bo Jackson throwing somebody out flat-footed from the outfield that's not the sorry it's not this one but it's his next one bo Jackson was one of the freakiest athletes of all time his arm was so crazy where everything was crazy if he didn't get hurt in that football game look at this jumps off the wall so he avoids all the impacts literally just ran up the wall yeah Bobo knew everything he's a very amazing that was just to sports play to sports but world class at both sports it wasn't until the football injury that uh he had to get hip replacement and that one of must he was the first person you picked like I got this motherfucker what sport in everything anything and everything there's certain dues just have the the perfect build the perfect genetics and then work ethic another one is a Herschel Walker the kershel Walker destroyed yeah they say he like he can barely like he can barely walk now he'll still fuck you up Herschel Walker was he was fucking people up in Strikeforce when he was in his late 40s I was thinking Earl Campbell I don't think Herschel Walker has bad knees he was fighting almost until he was 50 he was fighting in Strikeforce a ya know that yeah Herschel Walker at 4849 whatever he was what he's fighting looked like a 30 year old perfect specimen of an athlete he didn't look like a an older athlete like you and something did really strain of Dwight it looks like he's fuckin world-class ripped full six-pack super jacked f40 what's what is his age there what is it for you 48 look that right there yes dude look at the build on this fucking guy and he destroyed the student Strikeforce he beat a few guys he was undefeated in MMA and the way he would beat these guys was just first of all he had a long martial arts background like done martial arts before I didn't I've never known any of this but he's got such a crazy disciplined work ethic that like his body is still in pristine shape in his late 40s now I don't know if he's taking hormones or anything here but either way the way this guy looked in his 40s in a way I mean just like his face his face yeah that's crazy that guy would do push-ups and sit-ups and bodyweight squats and and shit over weightlifting that was like his big thing was that he did mostly calisthenics I had no idea that he ever did dude Herschel Walker was but dude his that's the thing when he started fighting people were like oh you know he's like a guy who still wants to compete who used to be world class at something he probably won't be good at fighting right he's fucking look at it would me just look at it didn't look like it was just like a show like no no he looks like a professional mixed martial arts fighter I wouldn't say look like the best in the world but he was a professional and he even went to one of the best gyms in the world he went to aka where Jas in San Jose it's one of the best mixed martial arts Cain Velasquez Daniel Cormier John Fitch Josh Koscheck mean go down the list while he trained with some of the top haters came out of there yeah it's a great gym and they have been training world-class fighters forever so he went to the Lions Den he would nurmagomedov train who went Mike Swick trained there I mean it's those it was the Comedy Store he went to comics he went to comedy right in there and he trade there look at that look at that build come on man who the fuck looks like that in the late 40s and does professional cage fighting after a long career in the NFL special man he was no idea oh my god dude and I'm telling you every fight was like this every fight was like a man versus watched a lot you watched fight watch them all of course you do i watch everything yeah yeah that's a dumb question i watch a lot of shit yeah yeah a lot of audio books too I do you read a lot you read a lot of mostly read articles but I get my books are consumed my books in the audio form because I can do other shit like I can go on a walk when I was taught by Dawn I would listen to a book when I was talking to the person who helped me with the candle as and I got the fact about the whale shit I was like this motherfucker is going to be all over this shit ambergris I knew it I was like this is right up his sperm whales of crazy this just to dissolve beaks that's what I mean like pearls right that's just like a coating that Oster puts over a rock or something that's inside its mouth isn't that what it is and then he gets irritated and creates his coating and puts it over and becomes super how long but then but that's over well it can't be a long time because or it's just not don't live us a lot what's the time it's good criteria to develop Perl let's just guess is a total guess how long do you think an oyster stays alive if you had a guess like how old is an oyster get I'll say I'll say 15 years Wow I was gonna say 3 a wonderful thing No well do you know about to be paroled up I think they don't know how old sharks get well it takes I just like it takes two to four years for it to form the Pearl they live anywhere from 2 to 41 years 41 years for a noiseless Joe Oh Joe no I was closest no you say so - its 273 I'm one away 41 that's like well sometimes babies die when they're one day old how old the people oh okay I'll give it to you I was closer to a life expectancy I thought it was like like octopus because octopus is real quick right octopus are real smart but they I think they have a very short life span I think octopus the brain of a human they're fucking clever they're clever and they're mean is shit and they're smart yeah they're like an evil alien that's what they say look they're in the same family mollusk yeah yeah yeah so like that's why it's similar to prayers a crustacean the same it was a mosque isn't the related so not they're not like the same same but is a shellfish a crustacean because the crab is a crustacean right I just like the same big words they are all I like crustacean craft crustacean that's what the only time I use their word voiced by valve in the octopi gastropod or cephalo yeah I was the pod that's right life expectancy what's the cephalopod it would take two to four years depending on yeah yeah right okay yeah we have two of four years is nothing for something that's smart that's what's so weird imagine you're that smart they can't live long a net motherfucker dummy tools there's no doctors and yeah they do grow their limbs back and when men when males and females breed sometimes the female just decides to kill the male and eat it females are larger so happens quarantine that's come out of quarantine motherfucker if we make this all your limbs we're gonna eat that shit a male's octopus his dick is also his limbs what does it say the largest bivalve is the giant clam which reaches a length of four feet and weighs 500 pounds holy shit holy shit did you know that I a four foot clam that weighs 500 pounds that's crazy that's like the Little Mermaid lives in there is it part of a menu I mean do people know we should eat the fuck out of that thing you know at least 500 years old it's also the oldest known animal can live to 500 years old to to 500 years ago raising um octopuses dick is also its tentacles and sometimes it has to give up its dick it'll like let an arm separate so that the female doesn't eat it because the male's would just jack it to dick that he thought will they eat the arm they'll take his dick which is also his arm but take one of his tentacles and they'll eat that and like it's almost like you said like here eat my arm I'm not so what it was back dude it's the craziest shit ever there's a lot of videos of it female octopuses just jack male octopuses and kill them and eat them when they sick or the arm you don't know their whole body is the same and they stuff them they stuff them into like holes in the reef and just peck away on for days yo why do you sell as much that way you got more excited about more and more and more fascinated by that shit you're fast but this is something to be fascinated by because this is a living thing that we can look if we found this on another planet we'd be freaking the fuck out if they sent one of those probes those like Mars probes to another planet and they found this just laying in an ocean somewhere and they studied this this is the life form on this planet that's dominant and sometimes the females which are super intelligent sometimes they just killed the males and eat them that's what this guy is doing this this girl rather is killing this guy she's killing him right now she strangling him and and biting him play by play that's might have been one of the most impressive things I've seen their mean of octopus getting ain't no mean it tastes good too they taste real good but they're smart calamari all day that's squid I don't think they're smart no oh yeah I'll stake squid or that smart this they smart who's smarter I love color oh that's true set what is the other one that does cuttlefish little shit ones the ones that blow up no there that's a puffer yeah cuttlefish is like this weird thing that's like it's not quite a squid it's not quite an octopus but it looks a lot like them it's a similar thing and it can change colors and there's Suki that's what it looks like that thing's freaky but get a video see if there's a video this is these things just to do a cuttlefish camouflage do they look exactly like their surrounding and they just jack things like that so they blend in perfectly with the environment even the texture they can look like coral look at that they can look like the rocks on the bottom they look like all kinds of different things and they can change really quickly to blend in with whatever the background is they're freaky man that's crazy they're really freaky what did it taste like fucking anything what that's right I think they taste people eat them I know that anything they eat cuttlefish I think it's like a like a luxury fish it's like you know very I think it's highly sought-after in some ethnic cooking's right like Asian style cooking's I know I've had it I know I've had it yeah cuttlefish cooking tips mmm yeah I don't know yeah well you do elk so cuttlefish is now you can't be that much difference I know you could sell me on it because I try different things but certain places you go your net yeah people love that chowing down on dude that looks good as fuck that looks real good but looks weird looks like an alien thing yeah Cadiz is just like squid she says if you saw that on another planet if they found an animal underwater another planet that could change color and blend in with its environment they don't even know how the fuck it does that they don't know how they do that they watch them do that and they try to figure out how the fuck this thing instantly mimics that texture of coral and blends right in but that's years evolution oh for sure but I mean it's it's beyond what anything else on this planet can do like that you look at like what we can do we did you shit we reproduce yes any act of that is the simplest thing you could do in your life the act of reproduction oh my it's a oh it makes the you know not much later you're responsible for something true yeah and it's your body's program to want that more than anything to reproduce or do such that you get this oh yeah but the program for that and to reproduce though ultimately that's what's crazy about so that's what somebody could say so my cheat day was like I would just feed in my need to reproduce you can't say I was just being unfaithful I don't think that's gonna fly okay but it's amazing that it was very much of our society is based on the sexual desire right it really is just a call to reproduce so if girls ass and girl with big tits and small waist like you see that it's like a program that runs in the brain that gets the by saying oh you you need to get go you need to make just look yeah but it is something that come that becomes get to a mental part too and that's what that happens with women and guys you know some people should meet up for dates and get tested once they get testing everywhere people should meet up for dates get tested and then go out but kind of a fun little thing to do yeah it would be it would be I would tell it's gonna go back to that second wave yeah somebody's gonna slip through some eyes like you know it's like I wish I knew that's the case I don't know I don't know in situation this situation it's gonna change for so much shit bruh the way people think about so much things and it's gonna you know ultimately it'll make us a better people or a better place it'll change a lot but we're still very fortunate and we should just use this time to make a better situation for ourselves I said we can do that I say that too I say that to people I was like it's easy to get down it's easy to have an excuse why you don't want to do something but you know or you could challenge it and that's what it is the real problem is people with families that lost their job that's a real problem being able to put food on the table people being able to you know they want to get their business back up how can they possibly make a living again it's not like anything else where people lost their business didn't make any bad mistakes you know if a certain if a person makes a bunch of bad mistakes and they lose their business they kind of at least know what happened but when all of a sudden if you've been working hard your whole life and you have a successful business and then boom the floor falls out in a month yeah but I will say truck I mean what I get from troubling that they have been or trying to be as aggressive with keeping small businesses alive more than anything yeah and that's a good move it's very important small businesses but you know they're dirty there was a thing today and I think was Washington Post where they were talking about how they're already out of that money that they deemed for small business loans they're dirty this is reason because I know when I went back for more money that was today yeah I was reading something today I don't know what paper it was but it was they were Washington Post all of them all of them and it's basically saying that they need to figure out how to keep doing this if they're gonna if we're gonna social distance protect particularly in California like we did the idea is May 19th now or May 15th is that what it is may 15th I think 15,000 now yeah I mean and how are they gonna start it back up and what are they gonna do start it back up and what what are people gonna be like like how long it's gonna take for everybody settles back in again you know they don't they don't really know they don't but it feels like if they they ease it up or ease it up that that's gonna be more for like you say people that work mm-hmm right yeah that's where the issue would come in is like how people gonna feel comfortable going to work right if we were talking about guys work at grocery stores right right you used to work in the grocery store it was just a job now it's a job that could kill you like what like doesn't you pay that well imagine a job that doesn't pay to kill you now so imagine being there right now and deal with these people coughing and walking back and forth everywhere you look all these new people all your being constantly exposed to these peoples air and he used to just be a regular job now sudden it's a regular job that might get you so sick you could die like fuck that's why I J but this is bigger coach other you got a fucking raise that minimum wage now watch that's gonna probably happen well I guarantee that will probably happen this is what we're realizing in all of this is that if you do have a crisis this is the good thing the vast majority of people comply with what's needed to you know stay home just go to the supermarket do essential things come back just stay home let's just let this shit die off let the people that have it right now let them get to a point where they're not transmitting it to anybody else anymore everybody stay away from each other and let's just nip this shit in the bud and the way you look at it in terms of like different philosophies in different places that have done it some places have not been so aggressive and they've experienced a lot of cases and you could say well yeah but those people they're gonna it's gonna go through their immune system quicker and they'll be able to go back to work quicker much hmm yeah I don't know I don't know but i do know that california has a very low number of deaths and in particular and a low number of it's it's a low number of people that have gotten gravely ill in comparison to the size the state like if you compare it to New York which is a very high population of five like 5.5 million in Brooklyn alone and everyone's on top and everybody's like why so it's so shocked it is an epic epicenter is because everybody's dead everybody up in the sky it's all about like when do you jump like when do you make a move and California made a move a little bit quicker you know and it's it's that's that's really what it is like who acts the quickest and you got to do and I do understand like the tough mandates because you have to lay it down because people will be easy yeah and lacks with it they are but there's also people that are getting too much of a kick out of telling people what to do you know like they're kicking people out of parks when it's like a family of three and there's no one else in the park like come on like relax there's no one here if you're there and there's no one else there leave the fucking people alone let them enjoy the park now if other people come and they get too close to each other then step in and stop them but I mean we're said if they do it like that there's always gonna be somebody's gonna try to push it so I can I get into I'll be like fucking nobody yeah I mean like I took my son for a walk the other day and like he's doesn't really know what's going on but he knows what's going on and he was on his little scooter right and I'm like he was just happy to be out right just you know and he had his mask when I was like is that the future you know the little met that little mess I'm like we're gonna get so weird with each other I mean if you wanted a formula right if you were if you if you want to be a real conspiracy theorist and you want a formula to get people to to more more easily be separated and more easily given to the future of machines taking over the world this is what you do you give him a fucking disease where they can't even be human anymore they can't hug each other they can't kiss they can't even get close because they're worried they're gonna get a disease is gonna kill them so what do you make them do on top of that you make them wear a mask so now you can't even see each other's facial expressions you can't even look a person in the eye you just see like a you see only yeah but something is gonna make I understand present but something is gonna make those people feel more comfortable it's quicker testing with quicker results a vaccine I don't know how long it's gonna take together but something is gonna give people a vote of confidence and that's gonna be with those numbers of like people want excited by legs like what is it what is it call flattened out they like oh shit flatten the curve yes flattened occur it's gonna be something to give people more confidence and then when people have more confidence some people gonna push it right and some people gonna be like it like we say it's gonna be the new normal they're gonna be don't taking extra precautions I don't know next time I'll do a meet-and-greet right a meet-and-greet that part of pretty much that part of our businesses when we gone for it for some time for sure do you remember that Spring Break footage of those kids they caught down in Mexico yeah going crazy or is it Florida Florida Florida is not American right that is not America so they go down there I mean if you're from Florida relax I'm joking they're not gonna relax relax they're gonna be okay for fun I was in Florida this is Wendy Nilsen they'll blame it on me for $59 he hated Florida kill him those kids watching those kids on the beach oh because there was no laws there was no law yet so these kids move slow and they were like the last state right they were last tape well they Florida just said that professional wrestling is an essential business really that's true what is the exact statement cuz I don't wanna because it sounds so ridiculous I don't want to fuck this I they said they rush to judgment I think they might have just really things no did they really with it now no no original originally yeah yeah oh be taping this weekend but if a show a show it says show that gives people jobs and it's produced it's create jobs other people couldn't that be considered essential job to the people that work there yes so every jobs essential then that's what I was trying to say yeah the WWE is now considered essential service in Florida it's a service officials in the state permitted employees and professional sports and medium production with the national audience to hold an event if it is closed to the public yeah I think you should be able to if you test everybody and everybody's negative and it like again test takes 15 minutes and apparently they're working on ones that work a lot can I say that Joss said that's what it's gonna shift like I say people getting somewhat a little bit of a vote of confidence when you know that uh you could get results wrap it yeah I want to know if they made it in a lab or I wanna know I mean the virus itself to the the theory is not cool on not even that they made it in a lab that's not what they think what they do think is it escaped from a lab and that this was something that they were working on in this lab with the very same type of bats they were working on in this lab this was reported by Nunn and Fox News I believe they have a lab there than working on bats are they working on viruses and they came from the very area it's not that's not possible to pretend it's impossible seems a little crazy for me that bet I heard it might be Matt bet story was somebody my bet my story was bat and a snake was involved what is some kind of way there's a Pangolin people thought that it was a that bats like this was someone told me that bats transferred over to pangolins which is this weird fucking armadillo looking creature I know it's a little funny look weird thing yeah I know it's like a dinosaur looking thing yeah and that somehow another that got to people but then they thought it was a lady who was patient zero who worked next to a stand that was selling bats but this article claims that the wet market the whole reason why that story got out it was a cover story for the fact that it escaped from their lab but of course that sounds so much like a plot in a movie like it's too almost too attractive every other news reporting like CNN and NBC is this says that the US officials are now looking into that unverified theory pushed by yesterday it doesn't say Fox movie this whole thing feels like 100% like a movie like to see Times Square yeah with nobody nobody yeah nobody my friend John Joseph took a run off across the Brooklyn Bridge today and took a picture of him standing talking top of the Brooklyn Bridge on his Instagram and behind him it's just empty like like I am Legend Chet yeah it's like there's people in the background you can see them way far in the background but a normal day I'm doing Brooklyn people walk you get hit trying to but I believe that it's going to my belief don't mean may not mean too much anybody but has to start back up again when is the big question and what is it going to be like you know I I hope people just happen to be a continuation of I think it'd be a continuation of what's going on down now going on right now with the social distancing and stuff but it's just like businesses aren't opening because this but this is gonna be this is gonna be six foot it's gonna be six feet mask and everything for a while you can believe that shit for a while yeah imagine the people that were already germ freaks right they'll Brittany I was like I said nobody's a germ free Neal Brennan and white people knew Neal Brennan and white podcasters knew that this was going to happen they knew they knew it was gonna be a point where we're not gonna go on a road we'll be good in Neal Britain is a germophobe and I laughed at him I even called him gay for um fist bumping everybody he knew he did it where you go I never thought this was happening you knew it could happen there was somewhere in your imagination I know there was a scenario or story you if anybody would have been like what if I think you've seen this movie and your brain I've seen a bunch of movies in my brain that's what bothers me what bothers me is complacency and I think it's real easy for people to just keep on keeping on and I think if you look at a lot of the problems that we have in our culture are from poor decision-making and more people choose comfort over doing a smarter thing it's harder to do that's gonna help your life the easy road yeah it's real real real real real real real real real common with people it's a part of you it's part of me I have it in myself we all have it we all fight it right this is making you realize what's really important you're 100 percent me losing weight is not about me looking good it's about me staying alive like it might be the difference between me dying from this shit or skating through it it makes you and then it makes you think about it when we weren't thinking about it at all exactly the way we were think about think about it you see you the date I've seen motherfuckers you go to a muhfucka Airport motherfuckers you know quick piss in and out or whatever you got motherfucker just like gotta quit come right out to join don't watch your hands or anything clearly I didn't even think I was I I know about washing hands whatever but I didn't know that hand sanitizer was that gangsta yo people have handsome ties was gay like I owe you all missed older mofo but then you realize those precaution is moving forth those are gonna help us yeah you gotta be on you gotta understand that every surface that you touch has been touched by a bunch of other people it has the potential to have something on it and that's just how it is it doesn't mean you shouldn't touch things anymore just be real careful what you do with your face afterwards it's like a conscious face that you take for granted for grant is like it's easy it's easy just like hey what's up I know that but the other thing is the stuff that you get in contact with your immune system gets stronger when you're in contact with more things like kids particularly when they're young they say you know these two have what would they called chickenpox apparently I read about it yeah I think it's just a common thing that Americans did back before they gave kids vaccines for it once you got your pops it was about to be a sleepover mmm apparently it's real bad when you get it when you're an adult yeah not good yeah same with the measles measles well measles kills kids to do the funny if you say if you have an adult with chicken pox you like where the fuck did you go have you been chicken Bob's mother fuck and by the way how do you not get vaccinated for that by this time okay there's a chicken pox vaccine right I had it when I was kid you can tell the old mothers got this shit right there yeah well that's also is that chicken pox that one or is that Isis I think that's smallpox to these measles we got it there's a bunch of vaccinations shaking apart check our vaccinations scarred us up we're kids right I had one in my arm like my whole life I had this weird scar and the top my old school Scott there's chicken look at you lately oh you got one of those like old school yeah 1995 the vaccine of varicella before the 1/4 million cases a year that's crazy old Hren that's crazy who's gonna be mm-hmm there's going to be a comedy club that says fucking let's get opening somebody do it somebody gonna do it you just can't make people sign waivers say the the club's not responsible if you get sick you know is that they're responsible to do is that irresponsible do I don't know is it look tell people to get tested tell them to get tested when it's available when testings readily available and treatments are readily available I think only then are we gonna relax yeah I said it yep then the question it's like what do you how do you tell people that you don't have it like if you go to a bar are they gonna are you gonna submit to having a nap that's probably some type I heard in Wuhan or whatever they have some type of system where it is an app where I guess you register and you could scan and see I know there has to be in development - I was just talking to somebody about it I don't know exactly what it is but I think that that technology exists do you follow Willie D from the ghetto boys yeah go to his Instagram and he's got a post where there's a company that's sticking a microchip in these people's arms they hired a fucking professional tattooist and piercer a professional piercer and what could that has to come back for you to get what the fuck imagine if your company tells you to I know I know you don't want to bring keys you know fine bringing keys everywhere just can give you a little microchip I'm gonna make sure you're showing up to work on time enough to punch in anymore you're all set you're gonna go for it they're going for it in this video laughing and joking around about it that is real right we can get hoaxes do we get hosts cuz it was a it's a new story I don't know about it on his page but I'd know I know exactly we're talking about someone real good this company embeds microchips in its employees and they love it and I see employees at times you know I got RFID chips in their hands those are probably people that know that anything they probably know that anything that the government wants to find out about you they could find it out whenever they want look at this when Patrick McMullan wants a diet dr. pepper while he's at work he pays for it with a wave of his hand Oh we'll definitely don't carry credit cards anymore that's too hard to do there's this dude it's let him put a microchip in you pay it with a wave of your hand I think LaGuardia one of the airports in New York has got the experimental thing going where they have in one of the terminals a place where you can go shop you just swipe your credit card when you walk in and usually with whatever you got and they charge you like like those Amazon stores it's the same technology I guess Amazon's licensing it out well that make sense it's still a credit card though like it's not a chip Dam this is or you don't waive your card I think you just have your phone with you kind of and it's just like knows that you have as long as you can leave it at home this you can't leave at home this is what's so crazy about this how hard is it you lazy bitch you can't pull your fucking credit card out you you're willing to let them put a microchip in there so you can get a diet dr. pepper no it's my move you can loan somebody money would adapt at his office he's one of dozens of employees who've been doing likewise for a year now that's very funny imagine that's how you give you to the man you can't touch now because Krona who you know that's right I couldn't baby bra social distancing McMullen is the president of three square market a technology company that provides self-service mini markets to hospitals hotels and company break rooms last August he became one of roughly 50 employees at its headquarters in River Falls Wisconsin would volunteered to have a chip injected into their hand fucking yikes what I saw was a dude was getting it in his forearm I was it must be a different company so this is what's scary is this gonna be the new norm like what if you get fired by these people when you get hired by Amazon you have to put in one of their chips you have to take out your old chip do they sell the chip to the company we believe this would be when you leave give me my chip back oh my god they cut you open but that doesn't that does not surprise me in the least it doesn't surprise me but it alarms me it alarms me that people are so interested in having someone put a chip in their body but we a company that tells you you have to do it their company tells you have to do that fuck that company but I know it but those are people that feel that they need to feel the need of being a part of new technology I wanted if that's the hot shit motherfuckers gonna have it this was 2014 says microchips will be implanted into healthy people sooner than you think it's gonna happen yeah it's gonna happen I mean they've they called it's gonna happen for people like I say look think about it Joe somebody with Alzheimer's yeah you know I'm saying they're gonna find a smart reason if somebody is um abducted you know I'm saying it's like it's weird to think about it but didn't if you really think about it it's it's gonna be weird but it's still not there's gonna be plenty of reasons what I'm gonna say tell me where your chip is people don't want to tell us that cut your hand off this article I don't like right here the talks about this guy getting at oh Jesus a year later Ghassan infected his own implant with a computer virus one that could pass on to other computer systems if the building's networks were programmed to read his chip as Gasol breezed around the workplace spreading the virus and corrupting computer systems certain areas of the building became inaccessible to his colleagues Jesus Christ that's that's how didn't that's how war is gonna be for Josh yeah motherfucker don't give a fuck if you can fight it words like this who can hack this shit that's where the words that it's not gonna be that physical shit it's gonna be like you got one motherfucker in the room yeah that could crash some shit like that you know what that fucking do to everybody dude I was watching this video of this couple that was infected and they were being dragged out of his building by these security guards and hazmat suits in China you know see the police or was that exercise or was it real it was real yeah it was I want to say it was a man and his wife they both tested positive I don't remember but they were being dragged out they've been really dry like like picking them up like they're likes like they're criminals I saw some Finnish I don't know if it was just it just I don't know if it was just it might have just been associated with Khurana or some other footage about seeing some stuff where motherfuckers like they was pulling this one lady out and they fucking cracked her neck next you know she's on ice really yeah I can't remember and now you know people are crazy on it might be somebody like a story not related that but they changed the headlines get a different clickbait woman some catastrophic starts happening and people start dying people justify a lot of crazy shit man and one of the things that I bet people will justifies they'll justify manhandling people that they think are not complying with the rules or people that have the virus and then shit could get a real crazy if that becomes normal it is gonna become normal cuz you think about it like right now when you have cases of people getting frustrated somebody um is yo you inside my bodies on my social distance and this is when P is not even out of here joke this in New York why is this person getting dragged off whatever in a mask oh it won't wear a mask so they're just dragging them off because he's not complying yeah yeah fucking crazy you know worse because they're all closer yeah this is crazy this is great but it also was crazy that this guy doesn't think he should wear a mask when he's on a fucking bus crowded filled with people while there's a pandemic disease going on he should have a fucking mask on so where's the where's the happy meat middle the happy middle is not these cops grabbing this guy and physically yanking him off the bus and causing this you know very violent moment I think the thing we need to figure more important with that is like put your mask on son yeah he didn't have a mask maybe he just didn't have it yeah we meaning to make that masks available you don't want to lose your life yeah but those people on the bus they're probably very happy that the cops came and pulled that guy off to manage your mess because he's got a mask and this guy doesn't to lose your life from the mask yeah masks rules everything around me there's a terrible video of a bus driver in Chicago and he makes this video talking about people were on his bus just coughing and constantly coffee with their mouths open he's like please he's like we're out here risking our health to do this service and you know you people are being completely disrespectful well and not caring and four days later he got it and now he's dead so this guy he's in this video and then a short time afterwards he's dead for what he was talking about I've heard so many cases in it dude imagine all of a sudden you're but you're a bus driver and instead of just driving a bus now you're also worried you're gonna die from a pandemic disease and you have to keep going to work and being surrounded by these people because someone has to drive people around them they're not giving them buses no more bro no but was that given on bus they're not gonna bus when does this start back up and what is it gonna be like Don now like what is it gonna be like when the gears get going again they start clink clink it's gonna be it's gonna look like the International Terminal for fly Korea in Japan that's what's gonna look like motherfuckers gonna be a mask for a while yeah I think you're probably they're gonna be masked up for a while how long you think a year yeah I mean you got to being able to test vaccine how you get rid of it you know they're gonna teach buff us how not to catch it okay I got it how I get rid of it and I was watching one of those shows on CNN with this black doctor and she was talking about how they are close to a vaccine or something because they're just extending I guess certain tests they were doing something else did that similar trace I'm not a doctor I don't know exactly the story but it was a story of they did the study and a research of it had already started so they had already been making the vaccine for the other stuff yeah was it's ours it wasn't SARS it was some one of the new Vipers I'd never heard of but it was an interesting story because she was I don't know it was goop or whatever the motherfuckers what it was but on it was a great conversation like what if okay we had they not we had but had realized that something like this is about to happen mmm because of this strand of something this is gonna be the next Hercules shit how do we get ahead of it maybe some people out there that um had already been thinking it they're gonna find something to cure the shit well they definitely been thinking that this could happen cuz they're not I know it may sound crazy certain shit is like I don't know what has got the world so evolved not it wasn't specific to a race or anything just like like I just say the streets anybody could catch it anybody you know yeah that's the panic and that's what that's where they're the panic is in every community the whole world the whole world world the whole world covered with humans everybody's got it it's on every in every continent except Antarctica I think in our cuz the only place doesn't have cases that's what's wild about human contact and you think about how a disease can so quickly spread from China just all over the whole world and shut everything down they said that if China was honest about it I don't know if this is true but this is what I was reading in more than one different story that China could have stopped 95% of the spread they were just amazing and not know and they say if Donald Trump was honest about it they could have said in mandates for social distancing and everything a little earlier I think a lot of people were real skeptical unfortunately a lot of people were real skeptical and no one no one anticipated it happening like this they were giving him a hard time when he was saying that they should stop travel from China people call him racist now everybody stopped travel from everywhere yeah but they wanted a lot of people want to call him braces for fucking goddamn anything if he just said coffee with no sugar wall see this is the reason why don't want to fuck with this motherfucker well you know it's it gets clocked the things get cloudy right because like what is the thing the thing is he wants to stop travel from this place because it diseases in this place and then the reaction is well that's racist to say and we should be more sensitive and this is yeah but people don't understand it Donald Trump don't move off of emotions the things that he say is that you gotta understand a certain a bill like this certain people don't make decisions off of emotions and that's what so many people get connected and disconnected with a can and whatever's like yeah I fuckin rooted for him like it connected with the emotions I didn't certain people like him and people of that like mine which are mostly business people they don't fuck with emotions they only fuck with results it's like oh I feel sorry did you think about ID bitch I don't care about none of that that's not how I work but what my point o said if you gotta give the guy a hard time about not reacting quick enough to certain things you also got to give him props for shutting down traffic to places early but nobody wants to do that because it's a weird one because the people that don't want to do that Joe is the ones that have caught up in the emotion the idea some people do not get deal with Rio right they're really in that net on the term that are trying to harp on the Trump shit but Isaiah Washington you know Isaiah Washington yes Grey's Anatomy known him from years and Brooklyn whatever he's a he's like like what are you a trump supporter he's like a loyal Trump supporter you know I mean oh he's a he's a easy he's a supports Trump but I've heard him say say I don't vote for a person I vote for policies mmm I vote for policies and I'll give you an example well this is a weird one Darnell because no one had ever experienced this before no one's doing the right thing having experience with pandemics that shot the whole world so when he when anyone's doing anything right everyone's gonna be criticized 100% but you got to do like like what people don't like I listened I'll watch both outlets Fox and CNN that's confusing isn't it it's Christmas CNN just where yeah CNN is like a nagging girlfriend it's like oh good shut the fuck up oh you know god that's argue about five years ago like oh you remember that time you remember that Fox be like bitch listen you know I'm saying like you listen to if you listen to too much CNN bruh you don't even know what the fuck is going on with nothing other than how much you hate this motherfuckin used to be that way I'd know Kenan used to be pretty straight journalism relationship without so toxic for both so it's so for both of them is so I want to get you back is so like girl let me get you back girl it's so popeyes chicken girl you go with lemon airs in spices girl it's so in like when I sorted the point I make it is like but when I listen when I listen to both cuz you want to hear both perspectives if you really cared you listen at both but then when I go to Fox listen to her I at least hear okay this is what our players are this is what we want to do mm-hmm this is what the plans are this is what the president says he's gonna do this what the government wants to do you go on the other side all you hear is like 1,000 people more people die die die die that's all years of numbers and dumps you don't have no solution and then the problem is Joe people get fucked up on how they want your solution conveyed to them it's like can you give it to me slow Joe can you have Vaseline with it or are you gonna be rough with me and they can't take a motherfucker said muffle just a handle rough imma get like this right I'm gonna get my Democrat right and I love being a Democrat until tax season you know how close I was to putting to make America great again yeah well the point I'm making and I'm proud and exempt for a lot of people I'm a small business you know I'm a vet I'm a veteran I served the United States Air Force I did my time they're gonna say how good of a airmen I was but I committed four years of my life to this country you know I'm saying and if there's it is not about let's take away to shit about but the way he made me feel and then he said he's such a so let's let's take away that in my situation as a lot of people that are I'm a small business and I'm a vet in the things that he'd do for type of people is easy for me to say I could justify it if all I'm thinking about is money and paper I could justify yeah fucking because of that but it's people the disconnection right now with this election I feel is that everybody has even they're using everybody sticks us on emotions hmm that's all on how I feel oh I like this guy like that guy like this guy whatever you know this is like this mofo was gonna come into this election and just beat the shit out of anybody the economy was doing well you know I'm saying the pond and hold my whole thing was with anybody getting upset Joe what are you gonna fight this motherfucker with this time you don't have no more fighting styles yeah well being pissed there it's not good for anybody it's definitely not good for him it's not good for them but it's that's what sells like this battle sells the barrel sells this is a you know when all this dust settles we're gonna re-evaluate so many different things about our culture because we're gonna realize how temporary this civilization we put together really is especially if we hit a Great Depression after this we don't bounce back Oh things do get real ugly for a lot of people you know they're gonna feel very misled and mismanagement I don't think that that's my personal thing that's communication like don't just again not a doctor professor in India but it's more technology involved these days there's more of a possibility that of making profit off for this and you know how when you can make money off of something how people feel about that just like you just telling me about to test the situation like you know it's like do you have you had a check like sum up I don't even know where to begin and the reason why don't know where to begin because ideas okay cuz what they tell you Joe what do they tell you they say don't come up in this motherfucking a hospital or whatever unless you feel a little fucked up right you know I'm saying like everybody doesn't have the benefits that you have you don't I mean and this is no disrespect to anything so what happens how do I so what they trying to say I gotta be sick before I go see that's some people's reality you know some people like this I don't go check you don't say but what this shit is gonna switch over we're gonna we're gonna that's what you but we're gonna start having a level of confidence and that's gonna be because we're gonna handle this shit quick but this is what I think money we need a certain amount of health coverage for everybody and this is this is a perfect example that because the more people get sick from this the more everyone else is gonna get sick too the more people get anything Joe like yeah anything like I keep saying it that keeps saying it the thing that's gonna enlighten everybody and understand about this it's like I know you don't want to get the co V but while you try not to get Co V you stopping a lot of shit yes you stop watch it goes back to Utah mo diet and everything yeah and that's why like they like and in a black community like I was hitting hard motherfuckers come on man like we talked about this before nobody was the deal with fucking reality and it really be writing your fucking face the reality is always our fades yo I think of this large number of people that live like that Darnell's just a symptom of this crazy society now that this has been shook up I think a lot of people gonna reevaluate they're gonna think about the things that are putting them the weed you know Eddie um I believe this the week people are gonna get weaker in this job I think it's something like this week people get weaker you know and strong people get stronger it could happen or weak people can figure out that what they're doing could really end their life and that there have been fucking up and they need to step up and then they'll step up now because they realize that this is all gonna be weakened you could be weak and smart at the same time sure there's a lot of people like that that are really intelligent but they don't have control of their emotions or they don't have that control of their discipline it's real calm discipline is a number one that's a big one it's a big one it's what gets things done it's the thing that gets things done more consistently than anything is dis and nobody's whatever nobody back to our here's my sated Joe why didn't it happen they're gonna be like oh yes young then doc no but not too many people say then it comes down to I wasn't disciplined enough that's what so fucked up about this crisis is that there's people that were doing the right thing they were disciplined and still they get their livelihood taken away from them and then they get their health taken away from them they did the right thing that's what's so crazy yeah that's that's never happened to us before and that's what it's so it's not funny but um that's what when it comes to a even death you know like when somebody you hear about somebody dying and you were close to him or you know a story of them or something tell you when people die you hear this right here um oh shit we lost a good one today like the other days we lost those guys they were good ones you know it's like out of all these deaths like this one today oh we lost a good one sometimes when someone dies that you're like a fan of they're like Prince or David Bowie or Bill Withers when Bill Withers died real recently it was like Oh live at Carnegie Hall I know that guy was that song used me I mean come on man great song that song you are my friend yeah one of us has to say he's sorry we could never be friends again I said some things that cost you sorrow I just want you as my friend we're here today and gone tomorrow none of us knows where life will end that song man live at Carnegie Hall and I'ma tell you thing I dug about Bill Withers the most me being a comedian and loving music you know I don't know everything about music but like if you heard his live economy our album the transitions from one song to the next you would appreciate if you haven't heard of Joe the comedic timing of it listening to the crowd you don't say like you know what I mean like the storytelling never it's like like his little husk and the things he would say was all on point he he took a craft it's a suspense to build up to joke and then going back to I loved it when he introduced grandma saying he said grandma used to go to church and it wasn't one of them churches where you go and you say if it's all right he said no no no he said grandma went to one of church where the beat started getting to you and you get him that went to that stove you say oh that was grandma Church did he say I love that old lady grandma's hands if you haven't heard that album in a while and you know it's classic anything about Bill Withers people don't know the young is the millenniums they don't know half the songs the remakes whatever happy should they get connected with came from him yeah I imagine I wonder how much come on if he was on the Lionel Richie level of royalties or whatever but a visitor fucking album right here how about lean on me boom boom boom lean song you never tell you I use that song as the background theme for my roasting of Charlemagne to God you know I just want to say I have fame solved for this motherfucker Joe yo-yo I have theme songs some times in life I pray for him cuz a slaughter him son why do you guys go at it so hard I'd understand I mean you brought it up I didn't bring it up Joe it Alex I brought it up earlier I brought it up a ballet signing I'll explain the Joe Joe Joe this was a day of frustration I'm here okay I've known this crew for some years Joe Angela we go back 20 years DJ envy go back 15 we used to do hot 97 together Charlamagne we work to MTV's guy code together right it's all love we know each other right and then I used to go up there I'm up there so much because I work at Caroline's on Broadway you know that's what you promote it so I did it start adjusting where they want to play pranks on me right like oh we got a lab you know one prank was when he comes in no one laughs at his jokes all right right this whimper look it's like this one of them is like this Joe when he comes in don't laugh at his jokes right so I go in and I ain't trying to be funny I'm just funny and nobody laugh or anything and I'm like John thinking like this I'm like I noticed I know the fixes on my Joe Joe know you were suspicious Joe something's wrong Joe have you ever seen me in a room and nobody's laughing I can't say that no okay that's pretty much everywhere I go I'm just being honest so no you're funny I know I'm funny but not in that but my energy even if I'm not funny my energy is is good I came in they trying to play it and I'm like oh I'm about to tear everybody up in this room I'm like I don't hit women but yeah I mean she was up that right and they've like uh we told him that - laughs am i okay little corny Joe three or four other town there buddy - keep doing these jokes and I'm like stop doing the motherfucking jokes like I know we're friends or whatever but at the same time I do have a resume I have done stuff I'll continue to do stuff as much as they want to play this is the reality of it she feels disrespectful no it's a disrespectful way like anything you tried to call me not funny you see me stand up 6,500 people are ready to city musical Charlamagne you see it out of your voice that Donnell I went to see Radio City Music Hall Chris Rock Dave Chappelle and Daniel perform that night he said I love all of them and I ain't takin away no he said but Donnell that night was on you saw that nigga you saw all this shit so you trying to say you corny which is allergic word to a black comedian you corny like no you trying to give them impression that I'm corny or that funny it's just a waste of time and it don't make sense so now that we get a little joke stuff off now give me a real interview you know I mean that the only thing I say give me a real interview okay did you does he know you feel like this you ever talk to him off the air yeah we talked about it but just what I'm saying is but this is how petty he is okay he this is the distance part this reason why I won't stop because he won't stop right he'll say I've expressed myself to like this he said that's all I claims you digger you two sisters right so we go back faster okay fucking let's go back and like we've had the conversation but what I realize Joe is that it doesn't matter what I say he's never going to give it you know he's never gonna do it so what I have to do is continue to destroy him on the level that I need to destroy him in the means I'm ruthless I've seen them and people are like I thought it was inside fun joke though I didn't know it was so serious no it's serious and it's funny okay Joe everything is always underlining everything's is always thought that underlie it's like no we're cool but so that's never you never feel comfortable killing I like him and the reason oh I like we have fun together I have said to him you know why I said I know why you think you're a sex symbol and you look good I said because I was in south Kalani this weekend right and I say you are the best looking person is South Gladys you should feel like a king we fuck with each other like that but also know his ready your background I'll never take this away from this is where we differ he's ready your background is coming from South clan you know how it is getting ready a break going from mark like South Carolina to New York New York is the number one radio market period you go from that from a PA or intern whatever entry-level position here you go from that and you build and you grinding you a country motherfucker you a country motherfucker and you can now you're Charlemagne a god he works hard and he doesn't watch cast with Andrew Schultz - yeah they do what does that brilliant idiot he does a very good and I'm a person of this two of them together they are they great I'm a person like this Joe if you doing it I can't hate on that you're doing it you do a really good job at you you don't night and all that type of shit I respect that but it stopped with the same clan you can't clown me you can't clown me I'm not a you you can't clown me you're giving people asses for Christmas presents given people acids you didn't notice Joe no but I'll make ounces Joe you didn't notice I didn't notice what the fuck you doing man just busy doing other stuff oh yeah we went through this yeah we went through this with spit 62 I'm sorry this is different like giving me no fake ass I'll say good now you okay can i play into scenario before you see this video okay right and I'm not trying to say anybody's gay but sometimes people are real comfortable comfortable real comfortable okay if Jamie were to come in here like this and be like Oh Joe good to see you man I haven't seen since Holly I got a gift for you you'd be like Jamie that's nice you open the box he open a box and you open it and then as Jamie gave you this as a gift okay here we go open it let's see what is this no this is friends is that a rubber ass what is that look Joe oh we made a mold of his ass right okay that's funny that it's kind of funny yeah how long for a little bit how long he goes to put his finger in the booty hole hmm well you know you do what you gotta do you wanna get what the fuck are you talking about man I don't care really no okay all right all right you're comfortable you would be comfortable black ash black ass well what the fuck maybe this is the wrong show so is it would you design an exact mold or you just like your my pick see that's important see see Joe like you would study that here it is you know that that's what they did I guess what Joe and this is what I try to sell you really appreciate it that's white boy humor right there you love that Joe it's not my feeling you saw my favorite that's a fun thing but that's you can respect be like dude a teabag - my whole life I have never done that but exactly in route um okay and no one likes it like that anyway with porn stars man they they get paid to get like molds of their body and then do so you're trying to say Charlemagne is a porn star that's how they make those no reason why there's a hole okay Joe I don't know how the fuck they made that one but don't bring it to my interview and

trying it's just but I can't blow this bottle but you you said I didn't force you say you was producing the first episode I would do it I said I producer and Jamie was not excited about it all he wouldn't even take the shit off my phone but Jamie was doing something with you right no he didn't it wasn't he didn't do it on was the issue I was trying to I was trying to bluetooth I was trying to UM airdrop the episode that did in the car so Jamie was producing it so he said it but you know he started not taking my calls also is that what happens off the ground that's why I can't take this you put it up for him you uploaded it know it we got he sent me the video and then we got the video and then a whole bunch of stuff happened that day like including the podcast at the res no we were supposed to get a song from Rosa what you got I think right yeah he never said it to me de beat how was I supposed to put it on that video I didn't know you was well so right we we felt like this was going to be more work than we anticipated I knew it I knew it I knew its Jamie they want to do its dad I mean they've that kind of stuff where he's got a life figure out how to put the bead on the you know if I don't know why you guys didn't communicate properly we did community wasn't legal with me jo-jo he wasn't fucking with me Joe when I walked to the scene is very he always responds what happened Jamie okay I don't want to say it on air oh that's awesome remind you guys off air no when I went over there Jamie started breathing hard when I went over he was like he was going this is what you said Jamie I'm telling yourself you looked at a little depth a little scroll ah you do like this your eyes blink bro utilities you said it's not it it's gonna take too long alright here's what happened bring it again okay in the middle of we had we'd finished your podcast and we've started the next one with RZA I have to do stuff in the middle of doing two podcast that's what I didn't know during that you came up to me and started not making me but asking me to help you write I had to get the next podcast ready and I had no idea at the same time you were I was trying to communicate with you how to use airdrop and you weren't on the Wi-Fi we're on the Bluetooth and that's the best way to get the video to me we were trying to figure out if you could do that or a drop off so Jamie you didn't hear me say this you didn't hear me say this Jamie this part of the story you didn't hear me say this Jamie Jamie I don't want to upset you what do I need to do to make this dis situation easier for you I never said that we got we got that part figured out though yeah but that was the first thing but see I didn't know the urgency of I must here comes my narcissistic attitude I was assault I was thinking about me and I didn't think about you had another show so you were whining right for I contacted Jamie and Jamie told me that you got somebody else to do with that like who david's opening aria yeah I did it because somebody wouldn't answer my fucking phone call doesn't mean i okay alright it got done but here's the thing and like you I'm happy you're up and running that's what I'm saying like I could never be bad at that situation because that was the kick in the ass for me to do it you know I'm saying it like the fact that like that day and it was it was the birth of it you know I'm saying like that day was so special to me you know I mean I didn't want to be at the Rizal Park as I told you I was like I just got the flight haven't seen my son in a while right I said I was like fuck he was like a wizard I was like yeah nigga I said yeah I scored you bigger I said yeah nigga but my son I see my son I got a red eye right I remember that and I was like right before before I was gonna leave you X Mickey you say you sure I was like nigga go see my son right I love wu-tang but I gotta see my son and I walk out the door I'm about to leave I'm dipping in the car fucking RZA pull up and the first thing he said was what's up and she Larry you funny motherfucker hey Joe I said man fuck my son nigger that's the RZA would take forever mice I don't even look like me nigga I'm good they got to get your up the shit out of this that's what happened so if it was if I was out of pocket i'ma tell you cuz I would not I would've never been on ocean like you better do this I was naked anybody America to kill you understand Joe Rogan and Jamie say they're gonna produce my first podcast RZA come through the fucking door saying I'm gonna give you a track that's a lot of things that happening today that's a lifetime motherfucker Joe Rogan just adores my shit Jamie said that visit came in bong bong trying to be a comedian and he says he's gonna give me a beat I was like man when we went to that podcast I was on fucking cloud nine bro when you do your podcast what are you doing it twice a week how many days a week I do it it all depends like twice twice I do one one some time I do too some time I do one it all depends I have feel but I think I can feel like doing yeah nice yeah yeah I love it I'm telling you I'm whenever you feel it man Joe i'ma tell you something from that day I will be forever grateful for that conversation you know because it put me on a path of like like everybody everybody to start this business they want to be you they want to be you and they start they don't look at the steps Joe they don't look at the steps the only thing they see is you now you got some loyal fans but when it comes to being somebody being introduced to the game or whatever you're the Grail you're like I want a nigga you can't just do that motherfucker you gotta fight for that shit you gotta go through whole bunch it you can't do that but what you could say it's like I want to have the work ethics of that motherfucker half don't know that's everything that's f cking doing it and I've done if you you keep doing that you get better at it that's when I started when I was stretch you said I was sensitive because I didn't know that I'm not in control of the podcast world I'm a control of a stage yeah if I'm gonna stage nigga you come at me i'ma tell us up you coming me with the trollese shit or whatever I don't know I'm not an act this some new shit and then as I'm when I first started doing it I never promised anything anything or anybody crazy I was like it's gonna evolve and even the people that I'm working when I said listen man it's a learning process I said but every week we got to grow every we got to be some difference if wheats about sounds kind of shaky the week before next week we can't have that sound issue of course we're gonna make mistakes but we can't repeat the same mistake that's when it gets to be a nuisance let's grow let's grow in terms of the mic the posters everything yeah it looks like everything else man just more more you think about it more you can improve it the more you think about what you did that maybe you could have done better it's it's not ever done like I'll have a bad podcast to this day sometimes it just doesn't click or I'm off or my brains not firing that good it's gonna happen the way around it but if they did you know tuning to find out well they they kind of could tell if someone listens to you for so many hours they kind of get it it's just like there's some days like any other human being there's some days like physically you don't feel as good as you feel other days you warm your run down your brain doesn't work that way or well that rather that way either when your run down your brain doesn't work well it's like sometimes I'm just not as sharp or sloppy or maybe I'm not as enthusiastic as I should be maybe not tuned in as much like it's all about being tuned in man I did I've had some and it's just so funny said because every time I've done an episode right I'm like this you know when I get offstage I know when I ripped yeah oh yeah I'll do a podcast and I'm like unlike did anybody scorecard right I'd like like I like this job like yeah not you know how to muffle like this and you like this like yeah deal like oh yeah and but for some reason those moments I'm like oh I don't know because it's hard I can't be critical of myself when I'm talking it's hard man you know I got a I can't think but the times I thought was gonna be like whatever was some of the best it felt good man it felt really good and this should feel good from nobody everybody talk about you run a razor pocket that mother forgave me for beets bro and I didn't cut this beat up into all type of shit so I got commercials I got a sass I got the remix this one fucking beat is so dope this is the thing with him and DJ premier yeah I was I was in and out of it how interesting is that it's like it's a great way to like make something out of all this but you know what Joe I'm glad you brought that up right because that's the new thing everything is the vs. thing now Joe right the battle mm-hmm and did people like even with that what people were like this they said on who won and in the better like that everybody won everybody won everybody won you also people won because you're watching it while it's happening and these guys are having a good time knowing that all these people are getting into it online and it's all going down on your phone so it's all everything is this completely new thing from top to bottom the quarantine is completely new the fact that RZA and DJ Premier dude I'm a huge gangster fan of y'all gang star from a long time ago that's like real rap and that's what was so dope about this and this is the point that I was trying to make on the RZA joint I was talking about like one of the things that I'm impressed about RZA and I know people's like just you didn't leverage RZA talk whatever but I felt like my father's say the same same shit same same shit I know it's his voice to say it but I'm like anything else that we do we know about risen and I'm more impressed on being able to create a group as iconic as wu-tang is that's it and be able to say you know what nice it was the strife or anything's like I'm a bad motherfucker I can flip John Rose I can do whatever i'ma show another white writing style so that's one of the things that I personally respected about him and his journey they built one of the most iconic bands and all of music did or what did you tell me fish or some shit no fish is a copy the Grateful Dead they would have to say that abandon and tour forever yeah forever there's some but there's something about them it's like what they stand for is strong you know that expression that the sum is greater than its parts so like you counted up all them together together they just so original too and you know and ODB when ODB went big that was a part of their master plan though right well Oh Debbie yeah when he was when he was doing that baby I got your money song come on man today when you hear that song that's one of my all-time favorite songs that's a happy song but it's and he was like you know ODB was ODB yeah like when I'm the only thing that I liked about what your fans say it said that nickname they gave me because they was giving me 110 names at this shit right they called me the old dirty interrupter right and I was like this I had to give a thumbs up on that word said they called me the old dirty interrupting and that's yeah and the thing about it was that shit the dirty interrupted it blew up so much RZA hit us up but they were doing a 25-year loud in every yet loud I'm loud 25-year loud record anniversary at Radio City Music Hall wu-tang KO punch groups right and a resident reached out to us and he wanted us to do a video to introduce to wu-tang on stage man dave was a we were me and Dave where we were touring we were somewhere and we did a video and they played it ready to the music hall and NVIDIA was like yo Dave is like yo what's up Radio City Music Hall did you see me company let me see did you ever see it no oh man it was a great ass moment man and as much as people want to shit on me about he ruined the podcast just and I know most of it was the energy Dave had but that little connection came I was like you motherfuckers didn't woke up a beast you know you ever be so mad Joe it make you go do something win man I have seen this video I have seen it yeah it's like a selfie camera yes a selfie camera yeah okay yeah yeah that's right you know and even like that while the concert was going on and then he was like man it was you know that I know it probably didn't even make page six or whatever but it was like to know that that is a part of my life you know I'm saying those relationships it was it's just fucking dope man like RZA gave me a beat come on man that's pretty impressive yo but yo RZA gave me a beat shout out to my whole crew Julius and that's what you use for the podcast opener right yeah but it's like that in shows I did like Cole opens but and I don't want to be like overly producing anything but I've established something with the intros where they I think people kind of look forward to like how does the play not knowing what you know yeah for sure it's just that you're just able to express yourself so easily there when you do something like that where no one has any input it's just you to them it's like you're basically doing a lot of what you do when you do radio shows anyway you just do it to the whole world yeah yeah it's just you rant for the whole world and you don't know the hardest part is like you don't know they're listening yet you got a win that's true you got a way for the responsible stage you knew that shit was whack or not yeah it's just a different thing but it's like everything to focus on it's been fun it's been so dope and now and it's like with with the co v90 and everything is like I really have time to put into and I'm having I'm really I'm really having fun doing it it's fun that's beautiful man it's it is all about finding something to occupy your time that you enjoy that's a big part of what life's all about but I'm hoping this does too for people once the dust settles and the economy starts to bounce back I'm hoping people when they go forward they're gonna make choices based on what they want to do what they really wanted what they really are excited by what they're gonna enjoy not on what they think is the same so the safest option long-term they have to now because they feel what's important yeah they have to they filling it so it's like what do we do what do we do what do we do we do why is that what do I do when you're doing impression of me why do you say what do you what do we do because every not all the time but we know I don't what do we do but it's not just what do we do it's like a movement what do we do what do we do what do we do what do we do and why are you what are we doing you're telling us what what we need to do but you still say what do we what do we do cuz I'm never sure but you don't you sound like and that's do you sound like you write about everything you don't know to me motherfuckers that sound like that I definitely don't sound like I'm right about everything I'm wrong about a lot of shit but I'm right about what you don't sound like it I'm right about what I think and that I know this is how i think i'm cure in my intention i'm not always correct what do we do what do we do what do we do what do we do with intention joy what do we do it attention what do we do we'll ignore it do we ignore it what do we do don't get sucked in your phone baby don't get some comments don't do it it's just time you can never get back that's important it's time we can never get back you're too creative you're doing too much good shit doing too much funny shit that bit that you posted up on the Instagram the other day I love that bit without how women love text messages cuz there's no way you would ever let them say that many words to your face no you would not do it by first paragraph it's like not today bitch not today you go save just for somebody else yeah when they're giving you this fucking one two three four five six pages jeez how many text messages to come are we reading to each other here and then sorry but they all stopped up did you hit K in here fucking losers oh is that so passive-aggressive you don't evoke a cake just it's like I don't want to hear anything it's like please it's like it's like a please you can kind of get away with K you can kind of get away with okay but if you're right like you know some people write a bunch of Ches like if you do that that's like you're like dismissing them right like okay okay okay but you can never stop at three Ches no you just like that message now instead of hitting K even if you just liked it yeah until that girl back is that God's weird man girls get upset at that yeah I feel like girls wanna they want you to write it back okay sounds good thank you bye they want you to say it back Jamie nah man they just fucking like their thing because what if they have Android it says it it's a text message to them that says you like this mess where's the fucking confusing thumbs up because I don't have no middle options that's how they keep us divided ya Edwards is right Android and Apple that's how they keep us divided that's the separation is that's so real man yeah can't even air-dropped me good weed right that shit was I never had that speed weed so this is all speed weeds blunts they're called loaded shout out to my man Gino you know they got that belt I think he's always got the belt he has a literally a bandolier like Clint Eastwood in old western wear this these cartridges of once all around him yeah ma'am hilarious you gonna keep that on in less than half an hour we're gonna find out whether or not you got the co vid con Rona I wish we've done it before no well let everybody know I feel you feel good I feel great that's the thing of that's the thing did like that's the thing is gonna freak motherfuckers out like a motherfucker could feel great and not be great you don't know yes you know that's what's scary about this disease is more than any other one how many people test positive but don't experience any symptoms and then other people just die it's like it is confusing for folks I think they said there's some the number was between 50 and 70 percent right they they test positive they've come in contact with the virus they have no symptoms at all when do you think we're gonna get back to normal I don't think again Joe is never gonna be another normal at this is it now yeah this is it I just think that um people going to build a different magic if you graduate in high school and this is what happens is the world you looking forward to motherfucker right when I get out or another thing you can think of like I was talking with my buddies and I'm I've been having a really good time with my son making stuff he said man I know this may sound crazy but just Corona shit he said you and your son don't look back one day you're gonna be like hey Dad remember when we made that I'm slingshot doing it when a Corona was out yeah you know I'm saying it's like and it's like you know the memories are gonna beat it all type of ways yeah you're building memories that you wouldn't have ordinarily built yep as long as you're alive and as long as you're healthy it's just it's I think the positive side of this you can always look at the negative side but the positive side is look how many people are complying look how many people are doing the right thing right that's a lot of people and they're doing the right thing because they care about their loved one but didn't really they care about your loved ones and people aren't complaining as much people not day like I mean some people are hurt and financially a lot of people losing their businesses they're hurting but the amount of stripe Hill the amount that you see in the streets as far as like riots and protests it's non-existent people are understanding we're all fucked this is like we didn't see it coming we all got a deal I just hope this makes people realize that all that pull them up by their bootstraps stuff like people love to think that that's how people should be you know you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps go out there and fucking make something for yourself that's all true you definitely should go out there and try to accomplish some goals there's gonna be times in our lives as a community where some shit goes down and it's not anybody's fault but they need help and that's when we have to evaluate what our taxes go to because if our taxes don't go to some form of excellent very accessible health care and making that more widespread then you're basically saying you don't really care about people's health and their survival as much as you care about money now we're gonna commit to that kind of a culture after something like this well we're insane we're not learning anything we should learn something from this and what we can learn from this is like we could we were not prepared whether it's through hospital beds I see use ventilators social distancing protocols whatever the fuck it was we weren't prepared for something like this but now that we are we should all go hey yeah you know what man no one should not have the money to pay for treatment for this so what do we do what do we do Joe what are we doing what do we change the way we look at our services it sounds like you said we've got a change thinking period change thinking but also change what what our money should go to our money's got to go to that it's got to go to that but that's very important for everybody when people get sick it spreads to all of us now we also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love that's gonna die because they can't get health care that's available for people that have money that we got to stop that just like we stopped with fire department fire because fire department goes to a house when it's on fire because not just to that house they don't want to spread through the whole city let go well that's the same thing with health care if someone's really sick they don't help you and you got coronavirus you spread it to everybody else right you don't get the health care so it and you you're contagious it's almost like a fire in a lot of ways it's like a viral fire but aren't we living in a system where everybody is qualified to have health care we should be we should so what is it what is covered California what the fuck is that all about I don't know man I don't I mean if you think about how much money gets spent on things right whether it's computers whether it's cars whether it's how whether it's with other things that people buy how much of a percentage of that if you could escalate it just a little bit and all of that money goes into just health care not just taxes where no one's accountable you don't know where the fuck it's gonna go what if everybody's dollar cost a dollar five just an added five cents for most things you buy up to a certain point and all that money goes straight to health care wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar a dollar five for something if you knew that five cents is gonna go towards health care that's you know what as a busy person deficit may mean a lot to me as a business you're right it might that's what I said that's it that might be four I can't know I look at know that darlin darlin five that's the only five cents now if you talk about that being billions and millions then optimize it up to a certain point to a certain amount of money but I mean after why yeah it seems like it would be better for everybody and it would be better for us to not worry about what happens if you get sick because you don't know if you're gonna be able to pay for it sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after their you know an unexpected injury all right unexpected disease time in the hospital they got a huge bill they can't fucking pay it's real common that we don't know favorite because of that kind of shit and if you're entitle you got to go get it so just man this whole Covey's shit is so just only know that's the word yeah you go back and forth with it but I think that if if nother thing we can do is like we must agree there's no there's no going back to normal well not until they come up the vaccine and then even normal then it's gonna be normal that we realize that this happened it might I say vaccine I'm not a pro it's not that I'm saying we gotta take the first vaccine that comes down though don't worry about the microchip not let's not get crazy I'm saying a treatment medicine something that cures your can disease just like they've cured every other disease they're just like just like they've come up with treatments for polio or smallpox or all the other fucking disease leave it to the medical scientists please leave it to these people that study this shit they're gonna try to figure something out once they do whatever it is if they can once they do then I hope we ease back into what would it but life used to be like but with an added knowing and so this shit can go down right buddy to there till then the mask do you nervous be nervous about the future oh good beautiful me you definitely got the best you with the mask on so take that off I know I gotta to 20 minutes in 20 minutes you gonna get tested alright excited I'm super psyched I'm telling you just like this when you think about it's like you don't even know what motherfucker did know about fucker they got a test yeah you know I'm saying it's like and I know that that's that's definitely the direction we're going in because I own the news I've been seeing I'm like testing stations testing stations but I don't know if everybody knows what's the system and then for what I hear on a news whatever don't go to the hospital don't go but I guess going to Aspen and testing is different don't do this unless you fill in symptoms of feeling bad you know Sam yeah I read this one article this doctor was telling people there's so many people that come that don't have it but then they go to the hospital in the waiting room and then they get it in there it's like if you you know there's people that have the flu and they don't have coronavirus but then they go and then they get the corona virus at the hospital while they're waiting around to find out if they got corona virus which I have a broken leg Dane trying to go to the hospital right now I know it's my friends he was I'm not going to hospital for a year I was like really here let's do one of my friends is in the hospital and somebody told me husband's I may have fuck that my leg would be broke fuck that god dammit we're gonna get there Joe I think we're gonna get there I think I think we're gonna figure this out you know it's gonna be a tragedy for a lot of us it's going to be bad for business it's gonna be bad for restaurants and comedy clubs and everything else but at the end I think we're gonna emerge with a better understanding of the temporary nature of life of our society and hopefully we'll be cool to each other that's that's what I'm hoping like when when I said I was into Bernie Sanders what I'm into is someone that wants to look out for people that aren't doing as well and that that this is something that we should you don't think a Biden dodo you don't fuck goodbye guess what the streets say they say you don't fuck with Biden it's only somebody say ask him about Biden son I didn't know if he was fucking Biden they're not I think he's in some sort of state of cognitive decline and it's not my opinion it's a very common opinion it's not just my opinion it's you see watch videos of me stammering there's no one he's tall about and they're trying to ignore it and they would never ignore it if it was anybody else that they didn't agree with they didn't enjoy and you watch the the fact that they're not concerned that these people that are on these left-wing media shows aren't talking about this and about how important this is and the only people that are talking about it are people that are on these internet politics shows they just want to win they're worried about some important things worried about the Supreme Court they worried about environmental laws you know he's laxed a lot of environmental laws that they feel they should never be relaxed and then going into the second term he's gonna do even more crazy shit you know there was something that just came out today JMU see if he could find that it was lowering the the was
