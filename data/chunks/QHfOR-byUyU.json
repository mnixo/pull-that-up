day Joe Rogan podcast my night too loud yes alright yeah I'm sorry do we have an adjustment thing here it's too loud we can actually lower your volume where you at are you this one right here yeah that better is that better for you yeah yeah okay go sorry about that didn't mean to blow yours off thanks for join us thanks really Douglas rushkoff if you do not know of him hat is would you call yourself a media analyst which comedian theorist media author mainly author mainly yeah and your new book is called present shock when everything happens all at once is I would everything happens now and then when everything happens now I saw quite a few years online there really really really interesting conversations and one of them that really struck me was well there were the several of them that struck me but one of them was your story of being mugged and you you told people on an online room like where you got mugged and people were upset that you in telling them that you got been telling the world that you got mugged there it was lowering their property values yeah it was it was a bad one um that's so crazy yeah I mean it was one thing to get mugged which is kind of freaky in itself you know and whatever you know shame and weirdness goes with that but um I guess what I was trying to do I mean deep down was probably elicit you know love and affection from people on my list you know so I put up oh you know and there was a social some social responsibility to it so I put up where I got mugged because everyone should know this is maybe a dangerous stretch here we got to maybe get a light but um yeah so I sent I sent it out and then the first two emails I got back from this like loving list of parents was how dare you say exactly where it happened you know we live right across the street you know you're gonna lower our property values Mike are you selling now is that is that no we're not selling but it was a really weird time when people needed their property values to go up because they were trying to get bigger mortgages and pay down and do all that um and it was just like so panicky there about that that some you know someone was afraid of what if a newspaper covers it and it's bad and what if I it's so weird when ones and zeroes Trump humanity you know and in that case that's exactly what that is that's ones and zeroes Trump humanity well yeah and two kinds of ones and zeroes you know the the ones and zeroes of money ya know and the ones and zeroes it sort of of digital technology which I think can create a kind of a distance mm-hmm because you're not feeling the impact of saying that to someone's face yeah yeah there's a weird communication it takes place online that's you know it doesn't have any consequence you know you can you can do it anonymously and this is what it's like these Barb's that you can just send out and illogically like see in in ways that you would never if you had to deal with some one-on-one because you would feel it you would look around you would feel the response you would be like why are you saying this like like why are you being such an asshole but because you are anonymous right so people are just licking this unnatural communication thing right but then the part that then worries me after that is if you get used to doing it like that in an anonymous way online does that start to make the behavior a bit more normative when you're even with your identity No oh I guarantee it has to it has to there's there's no free rides when it comes to that I really feel like your thoughts your connect like there was always a thing I remember when I was in high school this was someone in my school newspaper wrote like a funny critique about the Boy Scouts and one of the things that he didn't like about the Boy Scouts was that they wanted you to keep your thoughts pure there's like you know well my thoughts are my own thoughts you know I'm just as long as I don't do anything I don't think there's anything wrong with my thoughts alright enough that was really smartly argued I remember reading it going well there's kids pretty clever but then I thought about him like but you if you're thinking about creepy shit you probably are kind of creepy you know and it's it's not going to get any better just you know you're just gonna eventually one day you're gonna snap and then you're gonna do to the happy thing yeah if you really are like the I don't know I mean everyone has their own definition of thoughts being pure you know like a more lenient person might allow a lot of like healthy sexual things in the idea of thoughts being pure as long as it's not creeping but there's other people that would just sit around and say well let me just think about creepy shit all day and not do it and I'm fine but I not there's no free ride there maybe though you think's I don't mean well I mean with what you're describing what you're describing is you know the benefits of an absolute police state as long as it was always right you know that's no problem you know that's the problem I mean then you can always get your minority report you know just maybe there I'm not really subscribing that I'm just saying that you really it'd be nice you can't have really shitty thoughts and get through and I think that if you're really shitty online you have those thoughts even if it's only online I really believe that negative energy Alico genuinely shitty I mean it's just how do you decide what's what's what shitty and what's not but ya know it's people when they're due you are online without your face the meaning you can be online with your face on the meaning you can get in real life you know until you just got mean people do you investigate people's toy like if someone says you something weird on Twitter do you go to their Twitter page and see just all their kunti shit that they write to everybody and go oh that's just crazy I will admit I focus way more on the kunti tweets and emails and things in on the ones that are positive nothing a part of Oh get like ten emails all your book was great oh I love it you've changed my life my children were Chaput your alter is like delete delete delete lived it what's wrong with you rushkoff who is this guy my god yes this is the biggest piece of shit I've ever read but and yeah thousand people loved it more than life it's all right but I'll spend the rest of my week trying to convince this one guy oh no you do I'm not a bad guy why the book is actually uh you got to learn the Internet yeah well now it's Jesus that's well it's enough it's hard it's hard not to engage people because they're there it's like a person saying it to you yes it's very similar and to someone who's public you know you're out there your name is out there the videos are out there anyone can find out about you and see you they can reach you too and reaching you on Twitter you know they can send you some shitty thing just to get a rise from you and then they're just making you dance and you're right Dancing's to someone else's spell so you got to learn how to just look at yourself yes make sense no ID look what I caught oh yeah and be able to leave it but you gotta be able to do that to the point where where it's healthy and not be on yes at some point if everybody's going rushed off wake up your book needs to be this when it's you know you've got you can do this but you can't do that I well on the end the sale of the market would tell me I guess yeah the monkey would tell you but yeah you're not a dumb guy you'd never do that he would never make a book like that that was so off and out of line you would look at yourself along the way and damn - I can tell him talking to you for ten minutes you're not that kind of guy that the kind of guy that would do that it's like there's there's certain people that are functional crazy and they can like figure some things out and chase some things down and then they'll get stuck in some sort of a weird rut and you can't talk him out of it and you know you realize oh he was crazy all the time he just figured out how to get through life you know those are the ones that will go off on crazy tangents and people go what are you doing cuz the guy wasn't really nuts in the first place you're not nuts you're out man you have to worry about that she's need get that way buddy you need to keep asking people around you to keep telling you you're not insane they get a second I think there's a good thing that comes from criticism though because the even really harsh criticism is because of their ridiculous and if you look at what they're saying is ridiculous and mean and that it really reveals far more about them than it really does about you but look at what they're saying and is there any merit to it at all does it make any sense or is it just nonsense this is just a guy being an asshole or if you weren't you could you find merit in it like I've found criticism from the biggest assholes but it was like it was like a hair of accuracy into it that made me like reconsider certain things yeah I mean in the most valuable thing about it for me entertaining it to some extent is just it makes me it makes me more flexible you know as a thinker you know if you can wrap your head around you know oh where am I wrong right it can make you a little indecisive because it's like well he's right he's also right this one right well sometimes things are complicated it I know but that's the whole that's you know for me the object of the game that's why I keep writing I'm writing about that now you know present being present if you're actually present you have to be present with yourself and you have to be present who you're with right you know and that's the thing that everybody looks to be avoiding one way or another you know whether whether they're doing it Koch's I gotta earn money or they're doing it because they got a check a device I mean there's the constant assessing and it's just I see so few people I walk into rooms now and I feel like you know I don't feel like I'm in a room with these people there's no sort of social cohesion mm-hmm they're not really present they're each in their own little segment you know interconnected with the internet or nephrons yeah and then not connected with with each other you know I I am you know I'm a net fan I've been since late 80s I've been you know Pro you know Boing Boing or cyberpunk type but you know I keep feeling like rather than using these things to to reach out to other people and connect you know we're using these things for business they've gotten super aggressive behaviors gotten WAY worse and I don't even think it's our fault I honestly think it's in in these cases it's because we're living on this this an operating system at an economic operating system that just needs to feed off the net when it should be our space not the economy space yeah it's I feel like we're in a stage of progression for this interconnectivity progression where we're starting off with you know we're starting off with just regular telephones and that has moved to cellular phones which everybody carries which is going to move into some Google Glasses type thing which is going to eventually I mean down the line if you extrapolate a hundred years or whatever it's going to take there's going to be some really crazy interconnectivity that people share and I think this stage that we're going through right now the anonymous stage of being able to like make a twitter account or some fake name and just start saying mean things to random people like that ability is going to go away you're not going to have this anonymous portal like I just think if you look at the way things I feel like the way I look at the future is like the thing that's going to be really scarce is secrets I think we're going to be able to connect with each other in some way that we probably can't even imagine right now whether it's some neuro chip or something that you embed in your body whether it's nanotechnology whatever it is there's going to come a day where we're like completely interconnected each other but did the beauty of that though is if it really worked it would bring us back to the nail that we've been avoiding all this time yeah it wouldn't base to face live interaction where you can't fuck with each other because you're here you know there's this guy strange way to look at it yeah I met this guy this show guy um you know a stage magician guy who could tell when people are lying I don't know if you ever seen this guy he's like work for the FBI and stuff and he can like he does all these tricks he lines up ten people and he says okay one of you think and he can really tell pureed Whoopi and I was thinking if he can tell that people are lying because he's got this talent it means that on some level we all know we all have that ability yeah so we all on some level know when the other ones lying to us so it's it's kind of been if you're actually in the moment it's all exposed anyway yeah I think there's a weird feeling that you get when someone's being deceptive there's a weird feeling you get where you're like there's a sense of disturbance when you're communicating with them you this but you can't put it in a tangible there's nothing you could say always X amount of weight so here I know this is a real thing you know here I put it on a scale it's but there's some weird thing that happens when you when your whistle like you can tell if someone's upset at you and not saying it they can be saying all the right words but you like there's a certain there's a coldness or a lack of warmth or there's a little something I wrote about those women in what's it called the Housewives of Orange County they really I got obsessed with them because they were just having all of these awful disagreements all the time occasions got in front of you what why is their communication breaking down and right so this is what I do so I know so I I concluded in the end that is because they've put so much Botox in their faces that they can't actually execute facial expressions in an honest way anymore in a way that the other person organically can react oh my god these women in trying to kind of freeze time at age 29 ended up making themselves inaccessible to the now that they're in Wow because you know you see one he'll say oh you know my you know my daughter I think she might have cancer and the other ones like oh I'm so sorry but she's Rosen in a smile right so the first ones I can't believe I told her my daughter you know his kids her and the other one she says she's sorry but I can tell she's not feeling that sort of I mean that's it's just a metaphor but that's true they're like stuffing cotton in their mouth and they can't you can't understand what they're saying right they're they're ruining the facial communication expressions of facial communication right and I said well we live in the weather shooting poison in their face to freeze that but they're to freeze it in time is they're trying to stop ya time and that's like a it's I understand the urge to stop time but when you stop time you lose the moment that's the other the whole point I'm making secondly the net it can stop time in a certain way but you're going to lose certain moments that you know so I'm all for being on the net and having a net moment but you know even here you know I've heard you do those ads before from those sponsors and you could just cut and paste you know you could cycle seven of them and maybe people wouldn't even know it's the same ones you know you could cut and paste from another show and throw it in but you decide no I'm actually going to sit here and read these three ads with my friends well if I didn't do it like that it'd be really bored you know I never want to just read and add so I we always say you in that way you know his money you know that's the inductive model of the Industrial Age of course is to make print out more yeah and the only way we would even the only way we could even do any of the stuff the way we're doing is because we don't have anybody that we have to approve it with you know no wonder I don't have to go to NBC and say hey this is what we're thinking of doing I know you have these commercials but we're just going to talk shit and occasionally we'll get to the point of the commercial but but ironically on the long run it ends up making more money yeah it's certainly more money for the people who are actually doing it you know maybe by the other system you can make more total money but it's going to go to you know god knows what to some institution anyway you know so so the fact that it is that it is live and it is a what an mp3 mainly it is mainly a podcast you think on the first hand because I'm looking to do maker kind of radio choice myself and it's like well I can do this for the man and make this amount of money kind of guaranteed but I'm going to have to stay between these sight lines and bro or I can go this other route and actually do the thing I do you know yeah there's not even a choice there yeah not in this day and age it's not necessarily it's it used to be a time where you you would have to choose you would well this internet thing who knows what's going to work out but it's crazy like you you have an option to immediately jump in and get a gigantic group of people that are going to start retweeting and tweeting and listening stuff and you'll you'll develop a giant following in no time and as that's happening all you're doing is you're you know selling ads for companies that you actually believe in right if you could that's the only way you should do it fuck working for some company that tells you not to swear or not to do this or not to discuss that or you know that's not the stands were taking on this particular complicated issue you know fuck that it's just that's the enemy of real thought the enemy of real thought is committee you know I don't know what you're really thinking if you everything you say has to go through a committee before it comes out of your mouth I want to know what the fuck do your thinking and especially in like the sense of a radio show you know a guy on a radio that's like the whole thing it used to be even DJ's it used to be this DJ likes this music so this a wire sauce or was broadcasting from the same city that you are in yeah remember when oh then Clear Channel took over and it was like oh my gosh so we're getting a recording that's done by computer miles away this is my local rock and roll station goes Jack FM's which is essentially like playing shuffle when you're on your iPod there's you know could be anything of a number of things that they approve and they pretend we're wacky we just don't have any rules like oh we're jack FM and it's like a standard model there's like a hundred Jack's across the country and probably even more than that it's weird I think radio is completely on its way out I think they're fucked I think that's like our it's a silly way to do it and no one's going to stick with it after a while like why you're going to have internet access in your car within no time that's it that's easy they could do that right now I already get that with podcasts on the iPhone because I have my iPhone bluetooth to my car so I'll just immediately say oh I'd like to listen to a Duncan Trussell podcast and I've done it at a red light it's so easy at a red light it's one to Duncan to doom there is the one aspect of radio that I feel like I would miss is that local terrestrial reality of it because I mean yet we could still have like you can you know you could have a la channel and I could have a you know to this part of New York channel and you know we could do technically with with digital you know where you'd pick your your so-called regional thing it'll be local stuff but the mediums not biased towards that the medium is it's all equivalent you know and I wonder would we drift further away from from local and kind of the things that matter to us in the here and now or you know or we choose that stuff I think you know instead of like a local radio station you're going to have a million people in LA making their own music making their own putting their own shit out there that you can choose from you know whether it's a music list like a Pandora list or something like that someone puts together or whether it's podcasting I just think the idea of a local representative was always gross it was always gross Wolfman Jack was always gross because for every Wolfman Jack there's a million other dudes it probably had interesting ideas as well and they had no outlet so you have one guy has this outlet from this particular time that's crazy that that idea sucks the idea that we're dealing with now is way better it's like a billion outlet six billion outlets and and there's no local anymore there's people that are in that town that will tell you about things but everyone's more connected than ever before right and because they are I mean the economy as we know it also has to go away too right you know there's once you have to explain people doing podcasts I mean you got two billion left doing farming it's like where'd all the businesses go and you also lose those iconic figures like the Wolfman Jack or like Howard Stern or like the mate well I mean I think you could still choose you would just have major every once in a while something major would happen maybe it wasn't wimpy wouldn't be that one guy who's your town's guy you know when I grew up in Boston it was Charles Lockwood era Charles Lockwood era and the big mattress was like this you would call this like morning show is called the big mattress it was a great guy Lockwood era really nice guy I met him too eventually but he he his he was like the number one radio DJ in Boston everybody knew it you'd go to when I was doing construction I go to job sites people would turn on / turn on the big man listen ilaqua Tara and it was that was a shows like that was the show and the only way to get a show like that is to not have a lot of options you know to a show that everybody agrees we're all going to listen to you know it's going to be only like three options you know disco no we're not listening to disco you know we uh there wasn't like the internet quality options that that changes the whole game like there's never going to be a CB s radio on the Internet no it's just it does it will and it's going to replace everything terrestrial I mean on ever since so if you're saying we're saying everything's going to be replaced everything terrestre is going to be replaced first it's radial and it's other stuff all we have to make sure then is before we lose all those things which we're going to inevitably lose to say to ourselves what is what is it we value about those things that we want to bring into these digital things before we're untethered in there you know before it's all the way yeah what we want is our kink we want to eat it too we want the digital era and we still want mom-and-pop stores right we're trying to like keep it all together and that's the question is can you get both you know so can you have this a very traditional narrative 20th century Industrial Age culture live right aside you know this sort of steady-state economy and peer-to-peer currencies and local CSAs you know can we have an iPhone and organic chard and and those slavery in Africa to get either yeah is that possible I'm hoping so I move towards it or not you know it seems like that's what a great percentage of the world would like but it's we've made shockingly little progress and moving towards that potential utopia right but then we but you know if as long as we got a hope or you know try to envision well you know I would say okay put but this shift that were undergoing now from an analog era to a digital one is a bigger shift than just than just that here's a whole different digital media environment that we've gone into so we've gone into this from this this time is money expansionist economy live by the clock universe to one that's potentially asynchronous that's just off that off that day I remember when the net first came up it was like it was you know people in Austin and slackers and cyberpunks the idea was that the net was going to give us more slack right you know and it's ended up for most people kind of doing the opposite cuz they're always on and working and being monitored and all that and distracted but I mean I think if we if we take command of the way we're programming these things then we can use them to sort of to create you know the gorgeous culture slide to create you know what a few of us are kind of discovering we can do like you're doing with this right you're just doing your thing yeah I think we're trying to resist the inevitable and that inevitable is a symbiotic computer relationship there's going to be some sort of biomechanical connections there's one man talking through Joe Mike I want to do another man with that bonds to a million people listening in their car wherever the fuck they are asynchronously yeah right it's I I really don't feel like we can stop that it seems like the things that we got so excited by as these higher functioning primates are these new things that we've created that input us or give us input in a way that our bodies completely not designed to to get like through your phones like like listening to a podcast like the a computer itself the ability to watch a video the ability to go to the movies it's all yeah this is the stimuli that's coming at us it's just we're not designed for it let's what it's it's reconfiguring itself to be as seductive as possible yeah well it because it's not it's that's what it's for right is to seduce us into itself so that the companies behind it can make money and because we move constantly in to in a path of progression and if you look at the technology it's always going to move into a stronger brick we were never satisfied with any particular result at any particular time more choices yeah well more choices we wanted to be powerful more fast we want it we want better graphics we want bigger booms that's not realistic enough let's take it to the next level it's it's the in this desire to get these experiences we're pushing the technology look ultimately that I was getting but then what's interesting to me about that is while all that's pushing ahead what we get in a digital media environment is we end up retrieving like weird medieval values yeah you know you get Burning Man and Etsy and people doing peer-to-peer stuff trying to have their local currencies which they haven't had since medieval times you know you see the the stuff that gets retrieved in paganism men and you know mashing up roots to heal yourself the things maker culture all these things are what we've lost over the last thousand years that's what the Renaissance in the Industrial Age was about you know stamping that out and putting everybody on the on the assembly line at Ford so it's fun as we move forward we get these great old recurrences which to me is reassuring it means that we are bringing something with us into into this next place I think it's also that the current system is so flawed that people are willing to try anything and that they're actually actively thinking about what can we do differently can we make a local local currency like right you know which is interesting it's like the two places I've gotten emails from last many years of people doing social currencies are either from a place like Ithaca New York where they're doing it because they're just you know strange and trying to try something weird and good or like Lansing Michigan where there's no GM plan there's no bank that's going to give money to a factory to open up to hire people and they're desperate they're like well I've got skills I know how to fix refrigerator and they have needs so can't we just make an economy that way you know those are the places where people are actually asking that the the way they're ready I just don't like that readiness seems to involve being just so I'm not just fed up but uncomfortable you know that you've got to do something yeah the word was clearly going through a change with clearly going through a change as a culture that we weren't prepared for and we're sort of making our way as we go along and there's there's a lot of mistakes along the way and the evidence that points to it one of the best pieces is your story about people getting upset at you because you got mugged and called in the story and said the location that's one of the best examples of people like losing the script like like along the way in this crazy thing that we're doing where we develop currency and and then there's things called property values and there's mortgages and equity and all this crazy shit along the way you know we're gonna have to figure out how to how to stay human and when you see like instant failure like oh my god I got mugged you fucking asshole what do you do ID you say the place it's interesting I mean it's in every single one of my books I've written like 12 now you know they're they're all finally about how do we bring humanity into this thing that seems to have lost it right so I did it for you know for business I did it for for the economy with Life Inc is the book you're talking about did it for Judaism with something called nothing sacred saying Judaism should be this ongoing conversation keep it alive keep it human don't let it lock down and now this one it's weird because it's like I'm kind of admitting that it's what I guess I'm realized it myself but I'm kind of saying oh my gosh I'm a humanist you know I'm a humanist and a technology enthusiast hadn't how do you be both because so many of the other folks who are sort of pro technology sort of my posse they're all sort of talking about not human beings being enabled by technology but technology surpassing us you know some singularity or you know some some moment in the future where computers get smarter than us and then we're not really needed anymore it might not be that simple I'm I've been thinking about it a lot lately and one of the things I think is why do we have this idea of competition and why would the computer enjoy that idea with us our idea is based entirely on our biological makeup our need to reproduce our need to prove ourselves to our mate our need to protect against strangers all these instincts that a computer is not going to have at all so the idea of competition with humans for resources or even the idea that survival is imperative and that you know you have an ego and you can't they're not going to have any of that so why would they be in competition with us why wouldn't it just be wouldn't like I knew it wouldn't be because of them it'd be because of somebody program 3 program you know it becomes sentient though that that's when they wouldn't do the bad thing because why not keep us around but it doesn't matter I don't even it's not it's not a matter of them being able to do that because I don't even think they will I don't think they can it's more a matter of people in the here and now saying that human beings are really only important insofar as we can be the Shepherds and organizers of information right information is the thing that's evolving towards greater states of complexity and once human beings are no longer the best at making complex information but computers are the best at it then there's just no need for humans anymore with the computers kill us or not I don't know what they give us a good time who knows but but just the whole idea that we should be developing technology with this in mind I don't know it negates what I think is an essential for us anyway centrality of humanity in the equation well I think people don't recognize how much we need each other we don't recognize how important positive interaction is with other people to your health and the way you feel about life there's clearly a relationship that people have to each other that we're in denial about ready lock ourselves up in our apartments or in our homes and we shut our car doors when we roll down the window and that's one of the reasons why people will only give people the finger when they're in the car you would never do that in real life like you're in some sort of a contained world and even though you're not even anonymous you're still like fuck you you know how many people do you give the finger in real life like nobody but once a year I'll give somebody the finger somebody does something crazy and they beep it me in fact you fuck you it's beautiful it's beautiful thing to do but you know that eventually I think we have to accept the fact that we we are only happy when the people around us are happy when we're in harmony with the people around us we're not happy when we're in conflict we're not happy when when we're not happy when we fuck people over I kind of have done bad things business and bad things ethically and bad you know and they're not happy people but then in the current culture they can compensate for that with medicine yes that person that gets them through the night well what you have to hope I mean I always do which is a vain hope I hope that the people who do bad stuff but then make up for it with drugs still feel worse than I do you know not taking those drugs and trying to do good stuff you don't want to believe that you know these kind of guys like I used to see um I won't even say his name one of those millionaires down at Knicks games and I'd always think I sure hope he's not happy yeah that's fine isn't very fair but uh well he's doing is playing some really crazy game that was around before he was ever born he just got into it and got really good at it they have the game itself bananas just the stock market itself just the idea that the wealth of a person can vary day by day because of confidence you know right - is a computer a consumer confidence in a product and like shift and change with recall and then you watching these numbers go up and down like what the fuck are you even talking about host of the explanations you see you know I watched these business sites and the market will go down and they say Oh mark it down because of such and such abundant and then it's like by the time that piece comes out that markets actually back up and they're already constructing they're you know let's time market going back up to another random feature you know it's like the the explanations after the fact that so little to do you know with whatever some algorithm decided it was going to suddenly ultra-fast trade something and and throw the stock up you know it's like at this point it truly is that's the best place to see humans combating machines yeah it's on the market was like there's human traders competing with these programmed algorithms and the algorithms are certainly winning the war and if you look at their screens while they're while they're doing it it is almost like code like the average person who doesn't understand it doesn't know what the fuck the stock market's saying the symbols and si oh and this natin of ones and zeros you look at all that you have no idea what that is I mean how is that really different than a computer code that you're reading me that's essentially like a way that people are tapping into a sorry system I mean it was at one time the sort of the price of something had to do with something right it's like there's a factory oh it's factory went slower today in the rain the market will go down on that side it was like right you know and I think it's gotten certainly further and further from whatever is going on in that company or their earnings or the things you know it's it's absolutely abstracted to the point now where people don't even invest in companies right right you invest in something like when Facebook went public people bought it like 9:00 in the morning and like nine ten they're all pissed off that it hasn't gone up it's like wait a minute I was supposed to you know I thought people my well jump on my wealth it's like no you don't you don't make money on the trade use to make money on when you've when you've done it but you now we've got you know derivatives and derivatives of derivatives and derivatives of derivatives of derivatives on there which is just a way of kind of shrinking the explain that for people don't know its own so if you buy a stock I mean you know you buy stock you hope it goes up and then you sell it in the future if you'd rather make up that time right now I can sell it in the future right now right I can basically sell that future sale because I think that sale is going to be a good one now right I can say what if I did that trade I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have it now but so one of my trading Ben I'm trading I'm trading on on an abstraction from what something's going to be worth someone will in the future so it's like I'm trading on the stock over time and then someone else would say well I'm going to trade on the abstraction of that I'm going to trade on whether or not people think the stock in the future is going to be worth more next minute than this minute it's like well what's that so basically what you're doing is you're buying the stock over time over time over time over time you're creating these things these derivatives of whatever the original investment was which is kind of just a derivative of the thing I guess the porkbelly this derivative the porkbelly derivatives of the derivatives derivatives of the derivatives of the derivatives of the derivatives all all ever tighter ways of saying what is porkbelly gonna be worth you know on February 3rd why is that legal well it's legal because what it because the economy requires it right we have a kind of money right that has a clock it's lent into existence and has to be paid back more than got lent out so our economy needs to expand by hook or by crook somehow it has to grow in order for it to survive that's just the way central currency works they need to find more surface area for the money more ways for people to buy stuff so instead of just having there's not enough of a company to buy so now we can bet on how that company is going to do in some future that we can bet on that or we can bet on that right but what we're really doing is trying to kind of compress all of this time right onto like the head of a pin so we can bet on that so I don't have to sit in wait you know 3,000 years for Facebook to be worth something I can trade on his future worth now but the whole joke of that is people who are trading that way they're these computers that are trading faster than them so I put in one of my superfast crazy you know derivative trade goldman sachs sees that order coming in on the computer they're so close to the exchange they can execute an order before my order even goes through based on having seen that i was going to do what i'm going to do so they can literally trade in my future right well i am in their past no that's that's digital time shift that's matched that sounds like is cheating that's like someone like running a quick server and they're local and then you have like 150 ping exactly that's bullshit i think so with the sort of bullshit the irony of it is it's gotten so big right derivative trading is bigger than regular training yeah so that the New York Stock Exchange actually just got bought the exchange itself got bought by its derivative exchange so it's almost just like the proofs in the pudding it's like the derivative owns the market at this point but that's when you get anybody allowed that how could the government even ever deny how incompetent they are when they allowed that like that alone to like someone should just like have a broadcast on national television a you know one of those townhall sort of events where you sit down with the the main people that run the country and go how the fuck are you allowing this how if you not fix this why would you ever try to do anything else before you fix this when they made the decision they genuinely thought it would be good for business but it itself in the short term I will never understand where it all closed this business people promise them figure out before it got really bad oh my god we figured out before it got really bad how much bigger is the derivative economy I don't know exactly I mean it seemed I was looking trying to find out what that what the sort of training was it seemed from what I could tell like that 94% of trades are now derivative because there and because there that because there's such bigger volumes oh my god that's insane no one's good you're not gonna buy you know 10,000 shares of Honeywell today cuz that's you know you know whatever $60,000 or something but you could buy like 10,000 futures on Honeywell because they're a really G god that is so crazy number or percent of the stuff trades are the coach and I'm scared how many more is I think it's ultra-fast to as a whole other there's sort of two different two different realms but yeah it's huge they must all be crazy everyone involved in that must know that they're bringing on the matrix they must know that they they're the first steps before the digital machine takes over they must know they must know that there's no Humanity in that stock market shit that's kale the thing is and and again I don't want digital technology to get blamed for this right because the real operating system they're promoting is not the digital operating system it's the economic operating system underneath it it's this 13th century central currency interest-bearing debt based economy and none of the guys who I thought would get us out you know EV Williams with Twitter Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook the kids from Google right they're good each of them had a real shot if even Bill Gates at breaking the central economy and and flipping things the other way how do you not go and do that going public not be good not doing it with venture capital saying if I can if Google can hack web search if Facebook can hack social if Twitter can hack everybody why can't they you know if they're so busy disintermediating all these different things why does any one of them yet want to disintermediate central banking and say no mr. chase we don't actually need you we're going to do our whole thing through Kickstarter say like one of your didn't want any things up yeah yeah that's an interesting point of view I think they probably would never want to take that stand because they would be killed I would imagine there's a lot of money and uh in in them not being successful with that quest you know tonight ensure that they remain in control point at which you know you're doing PayPal okay we're gonna let people do individual transactions that was their their original model and they were going to make money on the float and then the banks came to them and said uh you're not allowed to do that you're not a bank PayPal kids you got to be you know can register as a bank or you're gonna have to be connected to one of us and that's when you know PayPal kinda becomes part of eBay rather than whatever these crazy guys might have done and I suppose there's this point you know where you know innocently these companies that get bigger and bigger bigger hoping to do the right things and then it's like we're gonna not gonna let you do this if you don't if you don't play by our rules but I also feel like there's companies that if you if you're willing to go smaller if you're willing to let it grow a little bit slower that you can scale up you can become a big ethical corporation yeah yeah I was always wondered why a big corporation couldn't be ethical why can't you have a big corporation with a good ideology behind it though but I think it's really because of shareholders right yeah because and shareholders are impatient shareholders are they're they're not really there right they're distant their shareholders are are people who just want to see a number go up by the next quarter and if you have to make a number go up by the next quarter then you're going to have to be thinking about something other than doing good in the world yeah you if it is ones and zeros at all cost yeah yeah if that's the game you're playing and what if you've got shareholders then you're going to throw you in jail if you don't do that I mean that's your fiduciary responsibility and it's a fascinating thing that you a corporation can do something that an individual would be a total piece of shit to do if it was one person that was involved in this one guy what he did was he you know he gave the loans to the third world company the countries that they couldn't pay back he went over there monopolized our natural resources himself dug the oil line himself polluted the river himself you know raped and killed the villagers himself he'd be like Jesus Christ lock that fucking guy in jail he's making people work for five dollars a week you know that guy there he is there he is holding down you know but because it's a corporation like well they're making money for their exactly and how many people who on the one hand you know will read you know good Baga zine or something or listen to us and and NPR and be all sad about that stuff still has a 401k plan with stocks in the very companies that are doing those things so who are they they're the ones who actually own the company they're the shareholder who wants the thing to go up so they could send the kid to college you know I mean it's it's interesting how circular it gets so I mean for how unvirtuous that circle is though I think unwinding it is just is just as easy so it's like okay instead of doing these sort of long-distance long-term disconnected investments and mining companies I'm going to invest my money where I see it and people I actually know in the place where I am who are trying to do something you know and bring it bring it if not if not local at least at least into your present lease into your into your visible reality yeah and it really is the the pursuit of the end goal of simply only ones and zeros done through a corporate way is really anti human I mean that's the that's the real anti human aspect of it is that it will engage human suffering as long as it's willing to extract ones and zeros from that like it right calculates how much human suffering are we willing to cause how much devastation to the environment or we want across how much you know which is why then the question becomes I mean in the nightmare scenario then is you invest that into technology so that your robots know they're not in competition with us but they are playing the corporate program they have no desire other than to extract value and meaning from and those computers running algorithms recognize trends in the marketplace before a human could ever see coming and then browner countered and meanwhile as we're making ourselves Dumber about technology I'm wearing this Codecademy t-shirt right want people to learn to code as we become more stupid about our computers our computer is getting smarter about us right yeah doing big data repositories of every every keystroke right every you know it are there they know you know they know stuff about us they knew some teenage girl was pregnant before family did and you know they know when kids are gonna be gay before they know themselves you know it's like think that they're they're they're Scott really smart not how about the readiness that comes when you go to a Google when you google something or you look for things at certain things online and then say you go to a YouTube and there's ads for things that you've recently looked at scary tantalizing ads oh I see you into jeeps why we have a jeep for sale it's a new Jeep and here's a video you can click on and they're a be testing that you know understand which is which is he react to last day yeah girl and Jeep are not going to lunch eat garlic okay they've met next time tits gotta see tits like they'll show you everything that you're into you like you son of a bitch how do you know about Lana's it's weird it's just the beginning we're accepting it slowly accepting the needle into our vein that pumps in nano cells that eventually replace human tissue this is going to be a commercial is giving me an artificial guy is going to be saying why would you want to be natural you're going to rot it's not fun life gets even better they don't buy your thousand you buy your little nanobots to come like the most reputable company you know the one that you really like and the great User Agreement and but then after it's in you it's like they get bought by Google and all of a sudden your User Agreement shifted isn't you know agree to you know do you want to have you know uh do you want to remember your your children's names you know okay then time that's use this new User Agreement right otherwise you get a nose no data you have enough for two people two phone numbers your emergency 911 one just like a phone like your phone they won't it's not registered it only lets you call 911 be the same thing well you should a pager bill mr. rush cough I don't know why you didn't want to pay your bill and here you are with no recourse yep you're gonna look at a shiny guy from the future he's a thousand years old and it looks great but it gonna be all artificial yeah but again it's not it's not with all that artificial necessarily although it maybe is it's not necessarily the technology that's the problem in this equation you're it's the company that owned the technology right but ultimately what's getting done the technology is getting pushed that seems to be right the case in every single situation ultimately at the top of the execution food chain when you look at like what is being done at the end level that's really the game changer the technology cost only increases and with every you know overtake with every you know new gigantic invention and in bundles of money they go along with it and all the people that got fucked over at the end of the day the technology keeps moving forward and it keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger and but it's not just stronger though it's it's it's fundamentally different I mean that's the thing that McLuhan was trying to bring up Marshall McLuhan the media theorist he was looking at that the different environments the different media different kinds of technology create so you know fire had a change that had a media environment had a technological environment with fire now you know people could then go live further north in colder places and little Apes you know who were smart enough to have fire could get away from big dumb Apes who you know couldn't travel north to chase let me know we got different Ray's that all sorts of things happen because it's not like fire or the invention of text or the invention of text changed well for me it changed the way we look at time right because now I can write something now that I'm going to be accountable for later so we can have contract with text we got history we got the judeo-christian line of thought we got law and ethics you know we got a we got the calendar you know then you know that all went along and we developed then we get the printing press and we get the clock right now the clock all of a sudden we go oh wow now we can actually break down the day into these little pieces we put one up at the town square and that's when time became money that's when it's like okay now you can work for an hour for me instead of making a thing that you're connected and selling it to me now you can work for the hour two hours or three hours we got a standard and now we get the digital media environment you know which is just as different as the Industrial Age media environment that in the clock was from the printing press from the from written text from from from even fire you know and in the digital media environment there's this it's not just more tech it's it's more it's more of a sense of of moving through time and a choice to choice to choice to choice way you know we're we just have more choices than we know what to do if we spend more time processing choice itself than we do getting the things that we've chosen you know it's like the the call waiting is almost like the typical kind of digital choice it just entered our I'm talking to this level and I've got a call waiting what do I do you know just to be put in that just to be put yourself in that in that interruptive state is very digital because you you want to have the choice because that person wants to reach you but how you know how that interrupts what what used to be a more continuous way of just of moving through life yeah it certainly gives us more options and we're naturally designed to handle and the more people have on their Facebook page the more likely they really have zero connection to those people the the idea in me like like we're we're designed for Dunbar's number right 150 people yeah and you get get 5,000 people on your Facebook page well who the fuck does that mean who are you talking about yeah well you think you want your marketing you know well what kind of interaction are you really having well it's not the same it's not a human to human interaction the other weird thing about Facebook for me again is how it compresses time so it's like there are these people from like second and third grade I'm finally you know 45 whatever year away from that and then it's like you know so two weeks ago hi I'm Marcy from second grade it's like oh god I'd finally I'd left that behind me it's on Marcy I don't know who she is it's where I was or who she relates to it's just it was in the past for a reason right no and now it's here but then on the front end I've got the computer on the other side calculating everything about my keystrokes so they know my future right the data who's gonna be pregnant is gonna be gay who's gonna be this gonna be that so it's like okay so it was like my past is all in here and now my future's all in here and everything's just sort of crushed in on me there I don't feel um I don't feel autonomous anymore I don't feel like I have agency I don't feel I'm in charge I can't get away from anything and I can't actually be moving towards anything with a sense of free will but can you though I mean you're sort of in control of how much you interact with it how much you change you get that's why I dropped Facebook you dropped it yeah just like that too much yeah but you still use Twitter yeah what would it stays there why is Facebook uh problematic Facebook is a problem at what real problem with Facebook is I'm not in charge of what I do on Facebook why is that because Mark Zuckerberg can use me or my likeness in an ad of something that I don't even know what it is we can so you can't do that anymore though I thought oh really he undid that yeah I think that was something that wasn't supposed to happen supposedly were they backtracked about that hmm they do they go two steps forward one step back to step forward one step back it's sort of an ever-evolving user agreement I mean where the part that I had gotten concerned about was you know I'm on there as an author right I'm on there by my book love me you know and like my ideas um I can't do that I can't solicit the likes of other people of readers of people who I'm supposedly advising about this stuff of especially about sort of media ethics and integrity I can't invite them to like my page when that very act of liking is making them vulnerable to marketing that's going to be passing through me beyond my control yes and no because they're also providing you with this excellent connection with all these people that's available through Facebook which not as limit as Twitter with a hundredy care no and I'm willing to pay for the privilege to reach those people but I'm not willing to have them and their likenesses used to represent things I don't think that they understand that what liking makes someone vulnerable to you know I don't fit so I mean on some sense this is Patrick I guess what I'm saying is I think I know stuff about this technology that they don't if they all knew really how this worked if they all knew the implications of what they were doing then I would say let's let's go for it but ultimately the worst consequences is what marketing they're going to be marketed to going to be represented so their image would then be put on something Oh so but in oh I'm pretty sure they I'm a hundred percent sure they draw them right then they drop that thing of using their photos and advertising yeah like you're not going to profit they they're not allowed to just take your photos and just just go out your photos no they're not going to do with your photos that what you're talking about generous or you're talking about that the photo the photo thing they bought no no I'm talking about using but for you were saying like using a thousand sponsored stories and how they use people in a sponsored story at least the day that I quit at that point it would nothing oh you could turn that off but yeah that there's things like that that are on but there's ways to turn them off I'm not I'm confused about like what is a sponsored story but do you mean people don't know I feel like most people don't know and just to be there it just didn't seem like and it also because I so don't trust who they are and what their what they're about I don't trust them as a company the way I want to trust the kinds of companies I let get bigger and bigger and deeper into my lives and eventually put probes in my brain do not trust him because Justin Timberlake played him in a movie is that morally the other one know where the other one played at Shauna um you put a good guy know he played this what's the myspace story and how much of it not about Coke and hores I need to sound like because that would happen with those guys they just take that money in really crazy but if you're good if you're gonna take Facebook if you're gonna say you I don't trust Facebook I you can't trust Twitter you can't trust Google you can't trust any of this no you I'm aware right now I'm aware of the ways that Twitter is broadcast I feel in control of how I'm tweeted and retweeted is almost worse though because they're actually to the point where you you try to go back in time in your timeline you can their Cutler gets a cutoff point where you can't download your own tweets unless you know the exact link I ended up don't then they end up giving you your history they said I still can't do it online and that's the same with like twit pics or all these photo ones like some of them now you're saying that so bitch is okay you're saying that you want your if you're going to do tweets you want I should have an addition for your free for your free tweeting you want them to maintain an archive of you and everyone else well I'm but I personally don't have a problem with it but when I'm saying is that that's kind of more ridiculous to me than Facebook the fact I can't even access stuff that I've that I'm know that you can totally give it or whatever so thing I'm concerned about I mean this is what in the book I call it dizzy Freni a-- you know i feel like the problem with with digital for most people is not this idea of information overload that there's too much stuff coming at them but they're they can't maintain more than one online persona simultaneously that there's too many sort of individual instances of us and if you're going to have different instances of yourself you know even your email inbox or some is an instance of a sort if you can have all these different different things out there filling up or interacting you want to be damn well sure that you're in charge of each one of them you know and I don't feel I felt like Facebook was now doing things on my behalf I was like one step of control well you make a very good point in that having more than one version of yourself becomes very problematic especially if you're involved in any like real meanie I'm sure you probably interact with quite a few people every day and to do that on Twitter's from semi manageable do it to do it when you can but to do that on Twitter and then you have to hop over to Facebook to it's like you should have one portal know one portal at least one that's one that it was always said you know cuz I don't really i didn't go to facebook much when i go there and they'd be like some relative you know oh I just heard of your mom's passing it was like six months have gone by before I found that message and you know want to consult them or whatever it's it's just such a it's for me it was such an awful interface anyway that I was just losing losing stuff there but yeah it's a I don't think it just has to do with oh I get more correspondence from other people so I've got a I've got a limit it more than others I think it really has to do with them well if anything it's at least I'm a canary in the cage for what's coming for everybody yes I mean you know people will need to get one or two emails and now it's just streaming in for everybody yeah if you send me something on Facebook I don't read it it's a just to let everybody know because they pile up I don't have time to read them so I'm with you in a certain way I still use Facebook to put up links but it's connected to my Twitter and I'm pretty cognizant of the hassle when I put a tweet up on when I put a link up on Facebook I make sure it's short enough to fit into a tweet yeah with with a look at least with with Twitter I mean you you understand what you're putting out you put on this little hundred forty things it went to your people and those words are out there right it's like with with a tool like Facebook you don't really have the same sense of ownership over what's going and you don't have you don't actually have it right your picture is use Douglass went into Starbucks just now yeah I could turn it off so everyone should turn it off you know all right so again you know it's like I feel like it's it's a useful it's a useful tool but it's it's a it's just part of the untrustworthiness of a good portion of the net yeah well I could see that with someone else being control of the the interaction and someone else being control ultimately of like when you sign a User Agreement and you have all this information that you just sort of put up online you you're entrusting it to them and then turn they're marketing it to you I mean that's it's it's really clean relationships as long as they don't fuck you but yeah yeah I mean there's a point at which you know I'm all I'll let Netflix and I to whoever's in behind my TV remote I mean now they know all that stuff right right I mean I'll let them craft commercials around me it's like I'll accept in this in this little arrangement we have with business I'll accept anything incoming you know shit but don't use me for your outgoing in other words once you're taking the person's identity and then saying oh you know Alice down the street like this sitcom - you should watch that and then my what I'm watching is getting broadcast to them or what they think I'd be watching that's where it starts to be like oh now I'm being disembodied now I'm being taken I think - uh yeah it's it's a great Facebook is one of the most popular websites online and it's also one of the best ways to waste time like you can waste a day easily just looking up people that used to have sex with you know just find them and go what is this bitch up to oh my goodness look how hot you got you know you could do that all day you could do that all day and they heavy you know entertaining you're not getting shit done it's right it's like that I try to use Twitter one of the things that I do with it is when anywhere whenever someone sends me something fascinating in a link I retweet it and because of that you become like a portal for cool shit and people know that if they send me cool shit I'll retweeting and so you get all this cool shit just starts coming to you when you sort of have that idea and then you send it they send it to you and then it becomes this really exponentially expanding thing where you know you you have this like a radio channel or or like an information dump what percent of the tweets that you get do you think you a pass on um it's not that high percentage cuz it's not always you're someone Hilter well I have to look at it you know I mean if it's really interesting I'll look at it but sometimes they'll send you something like oh dude that's nonsense like what do you talk did you see where this came from like you read the link you know that is not Bigfoot in that guy's refrigerator shut the fuck up man stop ten minutes but what that makes you reliable a reliable filter yeah you can't just retweet things but I do reach agent Lee if someone sends something really preposterous I will retweet it just to see how people react you know there's um or if someone if people get mad at me I'll retweet it just to see how they react it's just it's just we live in strange time it's a the Twitter interface is a very bizarre one the idea that you only given 140 characters and people abused shit out of that sometimes people send me like 30 tweets in a row like explaining something to me like to stop well now you know it's all the the Jeana things like snapchat you played with that or no what is that the one where you you take a picture and it like you can send it but it dissolves in like three seconds or five all right so it's like kids apparently I mean this is the dark secret kids are lead Facebook you know the the demographic the younger like you know thinner than 16 it's like falling totally off and they're doing things like snapchat because they don't want they want to be putting everything they're doing on their permanent record I mean finally this picture like they could show some when their pussy and only last for three minutes five seconds if you screenshot it though and then you save it re upload it well he knows but if you screenshot it it to least tells them that they've uh I mean so it's been defeated but if you screen save it they at least the person who sent you the thing knows that you did that they've given given that control but yeah but just this quest for truly uh you know truly present based non archivable see yeah but you know what's cuz when we were silly we got to do you know the parking lot of the 7-eleven it's like and there was no camera in the back either it was really just it what happens to the 7-eleven stays at seven you know now it's like it's every single silly thing they did if they didn't post about it their friend posted about it so it's still up there and it's like may as well be pitched in you know a passion to the side of the the Parthenon not only that but the the ideas behind what you can and can't do or enforce by these archaic laws that were written when none of this digital technology was available so because of that you get a lot of weird shit happens like there's a one girl who got charged with child pornography shape she was sending photos of her naked body to boys in her class and so the cops arrested her and charged this young girl she was 15 years old with child pornography selling pictures out yeah me talked about losing the scripts that's that's really losing the script for life I mean that is yeah that is the nuttiest shit ever you're you found a child porn kingpin right there now it happens to be a child yeah yeah exactly zero tolerance son it doesn't matter if she's a child but Dad that's its roar vagina doesn't matter son she's a criminal massive ICTA maizing transformation is rape exact dark hunger she's feeding the dark hunger son we need to discourage this in a big way solitary confinement yeah but that's really just a temporal lag hopefully yeah bro so I think and our laws then catch up or we I mean what also I mean sometimes a lot lack of privacy could help that along too it's like if you know if Google camera is finding like tens of thousands of people who are just smoking joints in the street of every American city you know some point they have to go okay just let me let people smoke pop let gays get married I would say yes except the smoke pot thing there's money in enforcing it the biggest issue more money in enforcing a short in selling it no but it would be to different people and yeah try it from the hands of the people that are making money by keeping it illegal whether it's the the private prison industry whether it's the prison guards unions whether it's different pharmaceutical companies that would stand to lose profits whether there's going to be a bunch of people that are trying to stop anything any change especially changes in legality because there's a big business in blocking people up for shit I know so they're going to have to maintain an illegal population all right well were to stay alive they're gonna have to arrest more and more if they're gonna have corporate growth yeah greater the greater percentage of America has to be in prison every single year until it's an asymptotic curve and there's like one guy left that becomes a really interesting scenario if marijuana does become legal and you can trade on the future of marijuana you have to fuck matter wanna does have it there are some stocks that are marijuana stocks really yeah that people trade how is that possible well they're the companies that I guess that I've already laid out a marijuana strategy or aren't ready for look at that percentage of the US prison population that are non-violent drug offenders in the nineteen eighty and then in 2012 percent and in 2012 it's 25 percent yeah the war on drugs folks they're winning more people are in jail I guess is I mean they're winning I don't know thumbs we have a private prison system it's good for the economy the whole thing is fuckin bananas it's just the the fact that in this day and age you still can't make a logical argument as to why certain things are legal and illegal certain things that are legal which are devastating to your health and then when you find out that informations been withheld and that companies may have noone known about certain risks no one seems to go to jail if anything happens people get fined a little bit but if that was an individual a person that did that oh my god there would be a horrible human being a personal person one person is responsible for all the deaths that came from aspirin alone you would want a head what's why there's some there's some ways to get more conscious of it though because it's all of us right it's all of us who are part of that system or owning that corporation as shareholders or whatever and they're these things like um have you ever seen a slavery footprint org no it's a it's a fun website you got to do it when you're feeling good about yourself that what it does is um you you put in everything that you own if you have a car or not where you live in this net and it calculates how many slaves are working for you right now God like with like whatever I'm getting that yeah getting the molybdenum for your iPhone or whatever it is or you know losing their fingers and some metal thing molybdenum molybdenum lived in them yeah metal is it a rare rare metal Wow I never hold that one I've just recently heard a coltan that's the stuff that they get in the Congo for so oh yeah something that's really good yeah yeah something to do with electronic yeah yeah connectivity and the user for cell phones so it's I've found it to be so bizarre and one of the more bizarre things in life that the most complex stuff that we use like cell phones like computers that they very base of it the origins early there's a mine there's a whole ground there's a lot there's also human suffering yeah just why I don't like the idea that my computer which could really do everything I needed to do is rendered obsolete by changes in operating systems that really are unnecessary except to sell another computer you know the the difference does not but I don't think necessary because they're trying to continue to improve the product and they're continuing to add more functionality and I stops believing that at least at the rate at which they do I sometimes feel like there's a but used to be sort of Windows and Intel that you know windows will make a complex operating system so that you'd have to get the next Intel chip and then Intel would create a tweak on that that makes you need the next a you know the next Windows operating system this sort of would leapfrog each other and it feels like that with them yeah you know your ear yeah your iPhone does better things now then three iPhones ago but what about all these iPhones in the garbage and all these people who lost all this stuff the amount of time compressed into one of these one of these devices is really intense you know that that at least one of our our goals when we're developing new technologies and new technology pathways should be well what's the one that's going to actually require the sales of the least of the fewest amount of computers I don't know any people that Apple are going how could we sell how could we need to sell less computer so that we you know people don't have to throw out these old ones have you seen those photos of Cuba of the old cars yeah because Cuba doesn't get new cars they have cars from like the 50's entities in the yeah but are gorgeous yeah the beautiful but they do drive like shit that's the problem if you drive like a modern-day BMW and then you go back to one of those stupid Chevy's from the 1950s those things are dogs shall really a break terrible they handle like a horse on rollerskates they're ridiculous cars they're so stupid so you gotta be thrown into rebel without a cause today and you hopped in that car it would not be that it wouldn't be the experience we're thinking there talk shit they're terrible you could with a Prius you could easily get away from some guy on a 55 Chevy there's no way you keep up there's like those things are terrible they can't take corners the brakes of this stupid drum brakes I mean they might as well have a rock that you throw out that's attached to a rope to slow your car do you take a you take a 57 t-bird over a Segway yes yes over just because it could rain okay but I like the idea that you know they've managed to recycle these cars and keep them working and keep them running and it's it's really cool to see aesthetically it's beautiful it's gorgeous I mean you see a modern street in this day and age and you see these beautiful like and you can tell they're proud people because these are shiny cars I mean they're painted nice and they're done well and they were stored well or or at least maintained well I mean I don't know how many miles some of these cars have on them but they're they do look it does look amazing I know and there is that you know I feel like there's a hunger for stuff not just 50s but also sort of sixties Mad Men period that nostalgia for that is that's right before this digital age started that's like the height of the TV agents you know putting satellites in space there was that innocence you know you know it's funny because people look at these kind of shows and say oh you know aren't they you know it's about it's about their you know decadence and I was like now it's about their innocence you know they believed and there they got you know what's that you know and you look go around LA it's like everybody's got heywood-wakefield in their house and trying to get those old GE frigerators with the sort of rounded covers you know there's that longing for it's like the Industrial Age just feels so real you know it's a solid when people made stuff you know it wasn't just kind of printed right yeah there's that that also like when you see those cars there's like such a human element in that old stuff like even like 60s muscle cars like those were sort of like human created works of art as opposed to you know you look at like a new Mazda or something like that a real modern car and they like looks like something that just like came out of a machine they screwed it together and came out of a machine you looked like a 69 Chevy that does it like a Chevy Camaro 69 Camaro that's that's something somebody fucking screwed together there's some men working behind that there's some people put tires on the wheel and bolted it down in place there's some guys who work some wrenches there's no doubt about it you look at that thing that's a mechanical creation it's not a computer creation and we're slowly moving towards the Prius and I'm fine with computer creation aesthetic if it means that we don't have to work right yeah it's like they didn't it's like so they get rid of all these guys screw it in the screws and it's like so they just then let them stay in their houses no they end up fucked up this guy's have to pick up a lot of work after all yeah that's the whole thing - it's like so now we have the big problem in America is unemployment right vamos talked about getting jobs jobs jobs for people who wants a job I don't want a job you don't a job people don't want jobs people want the stuff that you get when you have a job they want the money that you get for having a job but they don't want the jobs right so meanwhile though we've got more than enough stuff we're burning food every week to keep market prices high we're tearing down Bank Americas tearing down houses in California because they're in foreclosure you can't just let someone live in it it's gonna bring prices down down they tear them down why did the term dumb because they're there would have to sell at distressed prices that would then lower prices of other properties that they're trying to keep up well it would cost them more I mean if you own ten houses in a town and one isn't going to sell you'd rather tear it down then right and if the bank comes along and creates some sort of a program to give houses to needy people then it's going to lower the real estate values of the mortgages that they've invested in that are already teetering so they can't do that so charity itself becomes unprofitable well it's never been quite comfortable that's like less than notable what if we figured out that okay we only need rather than having everybody work 40-hour weeks which is based on a clock of the Industrial Age how much can we have people work in a weekend what if people really have to work that much for us to have everything we want right right what if 10% of people could work you know two days a week and we get everything wet so you go in you do your work I'm going to do my work in April 2007 you know and I'm going to go again in March what if it got that you really didn't need everybody working all the time for everybody to have stuff we couldn't deal with that not because we don't have technologies to do that we can't deal with it because we don't have an economy we don't know how to divvy out the spoils you know the reason that you have a job is so that you can be entitled to a share of what's actually in abundance but because there's not enough jobs for people we got to rip up stuff and ruin stuff that's in abundance right you know you can't give it out there's also the social issue of not having jobs when people don't feel like they've made their own way or pulled their own weight they feel uh they feel right both while that's a welfare you yeah but you gotta replace employment you know with work you know women is a new invention employment again Industrial Age we used to work for each other and ourselves we only got jobs when we got the clock when we could work on the clock then we're employed right but we don't have to be employed in order to work in order to have meaning if you don't have to have your job you don't stop so you just have to find a new niche into the system yeah if I have to find us a new thing are you waiting contribute to your to the world yeah I completely agree with that but too many people find sort of a pre-existing way to interact and they don't create their own way to interact and in doing so you oftentimes miss on one of the best things which is accomplishing things whether it's accomplishing starting your own restaurant and keeping it open and in or you know having a car shop that only fixes a certain type of automobile that you really love to work on you know when you can figure out a way to do something that you actually have a passion for that's like that the old cliche it stops becoming work it just it becomes you you don't really have a job you have a thing that you love right and you're in flow yeah how many people have that and that's all promise you can't have it in this kind of economy you can't have it when you're this kind of education system you can't have it what about just real naturally dull people that need to be pushed in straight direction yeah but you know so not everyone has to be the one that figures out how to do a new method of biodynamic Rudolf Steiner farming on their organic community supported agriculture plant someone can just go there and plant you know plant carrots it's also the issue of how human beings are raised in the first place which is so huge and not really addressed the the reason why some of these people fall into these mindless jobs is because never along the line of they've been stimulated never one line by their family by the school systems by their environment by their atmosphere by their you know their fellow knuckleheads in their community they're all just surrounded by people who are either like-minded or less or you know or support it and they're you kind of fucked and then when something comes along that eliminates that job for that guy that robot job when he was 45 years old at 50 years old he has a star again and sort of reignite some sort of passion curiosity or die off like a dinosaur and it's hard to cuz he was liking the thing he did you know if he's a toll collector right you know and you get better yeah and then you start you know then test see how many people you can make eye contact with when you're getting the tolls and how many lives can you change with that eye I mean gosh she can be that's you could live the Bodhisattva life as a toll collector you know they take that away from him and it's not just that he can't be retrained he doesn't have motivation or I mean it's not that it's not his fault that they broke his heart yeah they should have a show where a guy's a toll collector and just see how he interacts with people and then give them projects like today you're just going to casually mention your penis let's see how many people freak out here back to your reality roots yeah it'd be funny you do did you have to get do a toll collector you got to do it pretty fast yeah well it's so via left a weird way to experiment how people interact when they don't have to it's really quick you know how many people treat you like shit I mean like how you doing what's going on everything cool all right man take care you know this you're gonna get a broad variety of the way people interact I think they'll be kind of funny wouldn't like hold up as a series right but maybe isn't so one hours one hour special the tol guy yeah yeah yeah I just have a guy and you have we have to do like break it up as I go we'll sit down yeah little chairs and then have a discussion about the last couple of ones that we seen it what it really means people love that fast-track thing now though they won't don't pay at all they want to put that little thing up there and they just go through like New York is one of the weirdest scenarios ever because somewhere along the line they just decided to make people pay to get to the city it used to be that they were paying to get the bridge built but they paid that fucking thing off a long time ago every bridge got paid off a long time ago but the revenue is so intoxicating they just kept with it we can't understand that in California because we don't really have a fully we can't get anywhere those bitches were built but now they gotta all be rebuilt they rebuilt that I understand Hudson bridge they were building it building in billing it and by the time they finished they had to start rebuilding it again it was just that many years two reasons why that's nonsense that the big one is is the dumbest way to make traffic you have a spot where everyone has to stop on the way into the city that is so stupid when you are going from Long Island to Manhattan that is the most imagining shit to do at 8:30 in the morning you want to fucking kill somebody because it's so stupid you're maybe any stop at your box you should make people pay you know either either you could justify the construction of the bridge the maintaining of the bridge but they should pay for it through their taxes and that's it there shouldn't be a spot we have to stop because that's fucking dumb the only reason why you want to do that is you want to check cars for bombs or nutty people or are you just trying to discourage yeah well I guess maybe I remember less trying to discourage get people onto LIRR and do Rapid Transit the way God intended and discourage people from coming into the city because the the easier it is to get in the city the more this traffic sucks and sucks already' it's terrible make it suck and then charge for making it not suck there's this guy named Vic $20 doc you can't fix this up that way just making more suck $20 I'll give you the green light do you live in Manhattan no do you live how you it I live in New York I live in Westchester County I lived in New Rochelle for a little bit yeah yeah Hastings on Hudson oh yeah it's um that's a--that's a beautiful area that's nice that a whole Westchester has got some nice spots yeah it does it's a little snooty some of it so there's a couple of towns in Westchester that kind of retained some yeah little just a reality you know it's not just Westchester is a weird it is though you'll be in a neighborhood where you're seeing these mansions with these giant lawns and then you'll go up a half a mile and you're in the projects and you're a project so it's a little more Jersey Jersey ask um yeah Drive Thru oranges that it really hit that sense I mean most of Westchester is pretty pretty affluent at this point you know but you know it's not as half of one is Manhattan yeah Manhattan's the most affluent right well yeah I mean you if you're inside Bloomberg's bubble if you made it in there somehow you know when you in an apartment was a million I you've got ten million dollars of real estate or something but you know anywhere else didn't quite it's not quite that those places are madness those multimillion-dollar apartments you like the way of living in a big city like that is so alien it's only exists in Manhattan where you have so many people living in apartments and it creates it's a different community and in the sense it's more connected than than Los Angeles's we did I mean most things about it are kind of more consonant with our era and our digital economy and all that it's a better carbon footprint to stack people up like that that they have everybody having lawns and fertilizer and whatever else they get in the suburbs so I mean it's it's it's good on on most of those levels it's just New York itself is so crazy expensive you know through God knows what sort of real estate shenanigans are done that's what sort of then for me colors the experience of you know urban joy there uhmm no one is an artist dirt or you know writer regular of regular means could live there yeah that's where it gets really crazy we see a small apartment like 3,000 bucks a month and you're like okay that's just nuts that means a guy who makes $50,000 a year has to give up three-quarters of his income to pay his fucking rep that's nuts right so it's like I mean I don't know if you need crime to make it better but you know you go back to that era of you know Basquiat you know he couldn't live in in Manhattan and lo you know none of that none of the folks from then or the Ramones or well they were Queens actually but uh you know Warhol or any of his do you remember 42nd Street the real yes but that's the thing though it's like exhaust was criminal it was you know it was awful terrifying yeah it was terrifying and yeah there's certain some part that waxes nostalgic but that's not a good old days that you really want to return to either it's just like how can you have a New York that works and is still artistic and alive and vibrant and fertile and not have people you know getting stabbed in the subway yeah and how can you have so many rich people living together because you have to be rich to live there I mean it's it's really difficult to pull off living in Manhattan if you don't have at least you know of upper-middle class income so yeah it's a strange strange place unlike any place in this country you know there's no place in the country that's so overvalued you can get a decent apartment in San Francisco for half of what you'd spend on an apartment in Manhattan I think although San Francisco now has gotten the worst something yeah one of those lists well like at worst there's some places outside of San Francisco that are just insane like we're near Stanford they have I think it's called Atherton it's the highest real estate in the country and you you look at these people that I know have this house up there is it's an acre and a half is worth fifteen million dollars it's I could look into the sounds like what are you talking about it doesn't make any sense but it's like everybody in that neighborhood is all they're all tech people they all they all made insane amounts of money in the various tech bubbles and booms over the years and all that Google money's up there and all that Apple money's up there and there's just a lot of fucking people that have incredible amounts cash up there so real estate they need houses this is where they live so Real Estate's through the fucking roof right like you look if you look at like I I enjoy doing that sometimes like could I live in Phoenix let's see what you know what the neighborhoods are like in Phoenix so I'll go look at real estate at Phoenix for a goof you look in Atherton and what's eleven million dollars you like get the fuck out of here that's 11 million dollars well they gotta be you know bike distance from Facebook or ever yeah yeah it's an amazing bubble of that of money this strange one a really strange one because again you go a mile over and we've stopped at this Wendy's and it was like really sketchy Wendy's like we know like this place is kind of fucking dirtbag --is-- to be a mile away from a fifteen million dollar house like it's so strange well there's no middle anymore yeah that sort of got got spun out in the in the spin cycle at the end of the yes Industrial Age here well you can't say there's none but I mean this shirt and certainly a diminished very little yeah very little but you know like you're saying though if if the if that lower 98% or 99% whatever it is gets fed up enough it'll network with itself rather than trying to get something down to the top Sonny would fed up it seems like we only act when we forced that yes we need a desperation we need you know we need to have no options and then we move into this new stage of understanding what the fuck the real problem yeah yes but that's and that's different and again that's that's the whole point of being in the present of present ISM is that instead of going on some long march on some other 20th century movement sort of this eyes on the prize and just the mean justify the means battle to the future thing we go screw all that we just want it now we're gonna just do it that's what was so encouraging about the Occupy movement think what are your demands what do you want from us we want from you you know it's like we're not going to state our demands we're gonna actually do this thing mm-hmm you know and that's where yeah but do what thing though they were the real issue right I could try to occupy the world in which we live I look I liked in the Occupy movement to white blood cells like they recognize this an issue and they they gather around it and you know it's like it calls attention to the issue and you know they're but they they're gathering around a six spot I mean that they know there's something wrong here and so everybody's like look this is a spot it's all going down right there right listen they try to educate they do teach in and learn about stuff a lot a lot of people know more about these issues now than did before and they see it as a super long term project I mean this year they did occupy debt and the debt Jubilee so what they're doing is buying pennies on the dollar the debt of people like you've got you know health bills they can't pay and all that because it's just owned by credit companies so they buy the debt and just relieve it whoa so it's kind of cool you know if they take ten dollars and believe like a thousand bucks of debt it's well worth it that's interesting that's a great idea and I think that's a great community idea that there's a lot of people out there that I would spare five dollars or spare ten dollars all right you would even think about but if you get enough of those people you can enact some real change and really help people um what do you think is like what what is the best way besides podcasting besides books and besides having actual conversations with people where you explore these ideas what is the what is the best way to get people to understand that true happiness really does come from a sense of community what one of the interviews that I saw with you you were talking about your youth and you were talking about living in a place where you all shared a large backyard and it became sort of a community thing where everybody would get together and have like a barbecue and this was it so yeah so forth in Queens and we had it was like one barbecue pit at the end of the block that was just on all weekend that's when we were lower-middle-class my dad got a better job we leave Queens we go to Larchmont Scarsdale these you know these Westchester town see ya and it's like you don't barbecue with the Joneses anymore you barbecue against the Jones it's like every single family's got its own like 300 our Webber grill in the backyard and no one would think you know it was like you can invite someone over I suppose but it's not that barbecuing was this solo family activity and I was thinking about as far as the grill company is concerned that's better they'd rather everyone have a grill and nobody grill together because then they get to sell more grills you know but what it's like I've looked in my not the neighborhood I'm in now but neighborhood I almost went to like everybody on the block had a snowblower I'm thinking that's really weird just like 10 houses with ten snow blowers how many snow members do you need per driveway it's like every two houses share one or every four houses share one yeah but what if you want to just get up in the morning you don't want to talk to mr. Johnson see right use the snowblower first because you got to be at work at 7:30 you don't want to talk to mr. Johnson is the fan he's a douchebag maybe no maybe you should be able to have your own snowblower maybe there isn't asshole is beauty because he's working overtime to save up for that guy ya know easily right what yeah well there's not a lot of people that are happy out there's the rose quote the most men lead lives of silent desperation yeah today loud desperation and Marshall McLuhan's quote that humans are the sex organs of the Machine world and that has this desire to keep up with the Joneses you got to pay for those weber grills you know as this connects us yeah I walk in a room now it feels different when I see people sitting on their devices now you used to walk into a room with a bunch of guys you walk in here you guys have devices but you can feel the family you can feel you guys are on it on an animal level in touch with each other's vibe right on whatever that subtle level is and I go into rooms now and I don't feel the same group dynamic group presence right I used to even teach in a class you know 20 years ago versus going into one today when everybody's you know excreting what's going on in there it's just different I'm not saying it's worse although I think it's worse a qualitatively different experience they have more choice over what they do they can divide their attention the way they want they have more autonomy over all these things but they're losing and maybe it's out there on the net somewhere maybe by the time we're in the great great Second Life we reconnect but they're they're missing a certain subtle animal contact that we don't yet fully understand maybe it just needs to be mitigated maybe we need to just understand and explore like the ethics of when to and not to use cell phones when to and not to connect and encourage more connection and like let people know they're like look that is an impulse just like washing your hands too much just like there's so there's a like a lack of satisfaction in the satisfying or the completion of that impulse the check your Twitter you check your Twitter check your Twitter again what are you getting out of that why not pay attention to the person who's in front of you you're doing it to like a nutty person washes their hands on yeah I mean that's the hope that's the whole reason I write you know my books are the book before this one's go programmer be programmed and the idea was just to give people sort of the 10 biases of digital media like they're really good for doing things far away they're not good to be doing things with someone in the same room no cuz they're they're you know just really simple stuff like that or this time idea you know that's which is that digital technologies asynchronous it doesn't live in time so don't you try to keep up with it right because it's not in your temporal universe it's in its own you know and you can make it conform to yours but certainly don't run and chase it it's that it's kind of it's at this point it's education it's just having the conversation letting people I'm that's the whole thing if they become more aware then you know then they stand a chance I certainly think a lot of these things are sort of snuck up on us and we could all do with a lesson or at least an idea of how to manage them more more right more humanely exactly and the trick is for people not to see and this has been my whole thing not to see the messenger of this as the one who's saying oh this stuff's so bad oh woe the children are turning more violent you know that whole kind of PBS ish hand wringing thing that so many writers are out there it's like are you for technology or against it are you for it or against it you know and if you're not just going ya llego business they think you're against it and say no no I'm for technology I'm just against the way we're happened to be using it right now I don't think there's a any III don't think it's a coincidence that people are I think fundamentally less happy now I think then they have been in a long time if you look at the amount of people that are on medication for happiness it's really what it is and then if you're on an antidepressant essentially you're on a medication for happiness and whether or not that's because of a chemical imbalance that you suffer from or because the fact that your job sucks and your life sucks and you just you're just filled with suck every day and you're responding that well for whatever it is if you look at those numbers one or two things that's happening probably both one we're getting fucked over by these pharmaceutical companies and they're they get unethical doctors to prescribe that shit with impunity there's that for sure but then there's also like people are not connecting to this world they don't they don't feel whole don't feel sovereign if you're in great pain it's better to only be in moderate pain or mild pain if you can take a pill I mean what's hard to do is to get people to go oh well actually that pain is is kind of a good sign because it means that we all need to kind of work here to change right change the way the world is and and and take some action the pain is trying to get you to change right the pain is trying to get you to avoid the pain and you should use your logic to say well what's causing this pain well there's a disconnect I'm not I'm not I'm not emotionally satisfied I'm not connecting with my fellow humans I'm missing something right unless you're up against the wall there's nothing you can do to change your circumstances in which case you're going to take the pill well no no it's that's the that's the danger there but I do think the more people can start to in touch you know for me it's these rhythms you know the rhythms of life you know the 28-day lunar cycle and the fact that each week of a lunar cycle your neurotransmitters change right so you have an acetylcholine week followed by a serotonin week filed by a dopamine we followed by an orbit Efrain week it's like every month is one bump a bump a bump if you know that then you're like oh this is the dopamine week that's why I feel like this or I'm getting strangely I didn't know when it's a dopamine we now call it actually as a website soma space org that he's got it he's got it laid out there was originally it was an Olympic trainer Irving dart ik who figured this stuff out he was doing the exercising people at different times of the day in different parts of the month and they you know they've been looking at bio you know a biological clocks for many years ever since the you know major league baseball pretty much discovered jet lag that people you know get more jet lag when they travel west to east than east to west they realize all these clocks are not folklore there's actually something going on here so there's circadian rhythms for the day in the night but there's also all these are the rhythms controlled by different you know you know weather and astronomical features in traveling like that really does fuck with those rhythms right yeah yeah but as people get in touch with them I think it could help us you know get out of some of these you know drug drug relationships that were having you know where were you taking drugs in order to compensate for the shifting neurotransmitters because we're trying to be on all the time well I'm in sales so I got to be in sales when I'm in dopamine week or in serotonin week you know nuts that's hard well there's also the the arrogance of the human mind to think that I can manipulate the human mind yeah the human mind go look how like how things are running here I think I I'm going to take over the running of me and I'm going to invent some shit that makes me run more to my liking I'd rather just be okay with everything I want to be high all the time and okay with everything okay can you get that and then one day they're gonna get what you feel like when you're on ecstasy it's going to be keep it all day just be on accuracy all day enjoying the world wow you've never seen this guy this color blue you're gonna be so happy to have those though they don't let you genuinely have those drugs because when if you're as high as you aren't ecstasy or as high as you are in pot then you start figuring things out then you start unwinding that relationship and becoming less dependent on Sam it could yeah I mean even just a shift in the levels of things and the approach to things gives you oh this is a new consciousness space that I'm a pioneer for whether it's a brief moment or a long drawn out crazy trip right and it's different than the sort of palliative care of Vinod pharmaceutical sure yeah yeah that that does the exact opposite yes sure the ones that are available that you could buy on a regular basis or the ones that bring you closer to the hive drone exactly like slowly another drug yeah just to let you accept more and take more even you know caffeine and alcohol you know are such you know easier them to tolerate the one that's interesting that sort of is playing both sides of that of the field here is adderall know what I mean because they use it to control little kids you know adderall it's like ritalin it's one of these ATD drugs that keeps those kids from you know acting out of a different class but also the counterculture is taking it for you know the right to write or work or to get that uh kind of uh why don't you work right I've never fucked with it but the people that I know that have said it this is a kind of campers creativity right I guess I guess it's more for smaller speedy at cramming for a test yeah yeah yeah getting work done organizing shit like my friend Robert Schimmel rest his soul he he accidentally took it once and he had heart issues it was kind of a crazy story he picked up the wrong pill ago someone else's prescription and took an adderall and he called his doctors like what in my in trouble am I scared you know I got this heart condition the guy's like you're going to be fine you're gonna be fine you're just getting he going to be you're going to be doing a lot of things over the next few hours just accept that so he takes any said he just starts fucking organizing his office and he sat down in front of his notes and he's hey I got more work done and I've ever gotten before but well yeah is that why they call it speed yeah but it's a it's a great to say a price yeah it's the ultimate industrial age drug I guess cuz it it makes you more more productive more efficient I've had quite a few friends who've had an issue with it several you know a good friend very smart guy who just went just got off of it and you he went crazy with it like several months and he was starting up a business and working in the tech company and there's a lot of hours and he just took a little adderall to help him along the way and next thing you know he needed a drawl I mean yeah yeah they do say this to sort of I think speed long term speed use is the closest they can model schizophrenia with drugs you know I've been on speed freak for a really long time you get way closer than with any you know psychedelic or something yeah towboat it just seems like it just red lines your system yeah Lindsay Lohan's plea deal one string attached I want my adderall was that TMZ yeah you know she's supposed to be in that like prison or that rehab for the next whatever 60 90 days is she's trying to get a plea deal so she could make it adderall wait a minute they're putting her in jail again yeah what for this time I think it was for hit and run back in 2010 or something like that I can't remember oh poor kid I've been following it but there's another weird aspect of our new society that children become famous you know what I mean back in a Shirley Temple days when they invented that it was available yeah yeah who would have ever thought that you would get a person like a Lindsay Lohan we raised them from the time their child and they never know anonymity and just he's long to escape everyday longing to get fucked up and just drift away in a drunken stupor and not have to think about it yeah and they can't leave it is the thing because they also ever did to to it yeah and if you do leave it it's almost worse to been a has-been than to be it never was it never was you see a person walked on the street you never go oh look at that loser he was never fast he just go there's a guy I tell you there's it reminds me there was this moment that I still don't know exactly how I feel about it when they did the they did the Brady Bunch reunion it's like 10 years after the show whatever 20 years and Jan didn't show up they had a different girl for Jan and I was like yo you go girl in other words she broke free she will moved on yeah she probably Eve plumb she probably got you know all this crap for not going and a lot of people probably thought oh because she's probably too screwed for some problem whatever and I'm like no you know you win you went into the future you know and you're not gonna let that just you know define you no matter what yeah or she wanted money yeah yeah who knows who knows who knows I know that meat is good for projecting there's something very sad about people that live completely in the past like if you were on show in the 1970s and you're still going to those autograph signing things and tired I heard uh it was Barbara Eden on the radio you know I Dream of Jeannie yeah and I was thinking man that's one of those it's one of those things well Barbara Eden also was in a time where you didn't make money like you didn't get that residual cash where people are still selling I Dream of Jeannie I'm sure she would still be getting a bounce yeah but no needed she didn't get seen get a slice back in those Gilligan's Island days those guys didn't make any money they got fucked over Gilligan's Island days was uh the you know like back in the day they never knew about like syndication they didn't they didn't have any idea things are gonna be worth so much money and then in a digital form forever dude I was supposed to be at my next thing by now whoops it's like five
