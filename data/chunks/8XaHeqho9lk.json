hello freak bitches it is what it was just like any other problem that people go back to I mean at some point it's it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past you know and that's a huge point because people define themselves by the past instead of thinking about who they are now and said they still look back at a mistake they made and don't just get past that mistake grow and learn but dwell on it I think it defines them it's the worst thing I met some guys in band uses singers I've only met him twice two different times years later both times he started telling me about this story about what happened to him when he was in this anything in this poor guy has gone on all these years and he's still focused on the worst situation that he ever had to live through yeah and he's so attached to it well some guys get one breakup and they're done some guys one breakup in their 20s will tank them for a decade I've met guys like that that yeah you know I came out here with Sally and you know she fucking fell in love with her trainer and dude Sally still move on what is that and fucking years ago oh oh you know changed my life bro but Tiger toy are you so disappointed I can't trust women anymore oh you stupid fuck you know what if he got mugged by one person he'd done trust in people one person was a murderer let's not trust anybody yeah yeah you know I heard about Ted Bundy I'm not trusting people anymore okay great I'm not sleeping tonight we yeah I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life you're gonna run into him we all are know you can learn and grow if you survive you pick yourself up you dust the dust off and then you start going and I don't let this stuff don't let it beat you down it's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in life their ability to face hardships you know and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled kids are so sad like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever a young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to keep on rescuing him his dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have the character themselves to be able to get by in life they constantly need someone to help them and bail them out even as a grown man I've met guys in their 40s that still need help from their parents I'm like what the fuck man you're never gonna get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't face enough of the adversity to realize that there's sometimes you just got to get up and get shit done there's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push forward even if you want to stay in bed and if you don't do that you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy keeps rescuing you you never develop those tools you never develop that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your life what's your age limit you would cut a chick off at I think I think around 55 whoa you're a generous man I mean it all depends it all depends on if she goes to yoga there's a there's some good-looking 55 out there there are now yeah there
