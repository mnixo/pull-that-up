Carl Hart know a famous doctor who all doctors with just two syllables in his full name well he's got dreadlocks he trusted me more as cool but he he's a very very interesting doctor because he talks about like drug use and drug he's like first of all one of the things that he points out it was like let's talk about a drug-free Society he's like there's never been one because there's never been one there's never been a drug for you and you don't nor do you want it he goes when it comes to whether it's caffeine or alcohol and then pharmaceutical drugs things that help people he's like we have this like we decide to demonize certain drugs yeah and he's like the drugs you got to be worried about like alcohols one of the scariest ones because if you quit cold-turkey if you're a hardcore drinker and you're drinking all the time you'll fucking die look maybe cough syrup to win yourself also like that's something like I don't think it helps I don't think it activates some part of your brain you know I was talking to uh this photographer I was at this festival this weekend and she had a film camera you know do you develop your own fishy's oh no you can only develop black and white because if you develop your colour pictures the fumes will it'll knock you right out well and so I said so just a little bit of that would be a great time this is just a small so just get a little bit of that and you can click off and paint yeah you do a goddamn job interview Meilin maybe just a little bit midget just like crack a violin funny micro dose a little bit of that have you ever tried poppers you know poppers are those are the things that they crack them and they sniff it email night trade I think it's called no I did whippers in college oh yeah I did that when I worked at a Creamery I worked at Newport Creamery it was like an ice cream place and they had a the ice cream those big vats yeah that what is the gas nitrous oxide nitrous oxide right yeah that's what this yeah and we would would you talk yeah like sucks off of it that killed a lot of brains a lot that kills a lot of brains I remember I did one weekend in college and I think I did on a Friday night and on the Sunday I was just walking on oh if I was forcing the yield just because I was trying to justify how I well or if it was a natural yeah but the other was happening Wow yeah and you couldn't help it I don't know you know something you ever just tweak out by yourself just you know you absolutely do okay like a crazy workout yeah I have to work out for yourself right yeah change your state of mind just by yourself yeah like people say if you smile change your mind right change the way your brain actually feels well if you freaked out it probably does that too right yeah yeah definitely this ways to do it I mean why wilds would Indians like Native Americans when they would do those those battle cries why else are they doing that they getting fired up yeah you know singing a song yeah yeah is it it is New Zealand isn't it yeah yeah well they they would play it's this video of the plan the USA team oh yeah and they're doing this elaborate thing they're doing it it's very elaborate and just energetic and the cuts of the USA team and they're kind of looking back kind of just connect confused with just what's going on and they went through this whole thing is this right yeah they did in a basketball game you had a basket some volume this is ridiculous yeah a basketball and yo nobody gets dust about the 45 points yeah what you playing NBA superstars you fucking dummies but it's just for the coaches for the it me that's what they do all the time but is but it's just it seems so stupid that's well it seems stupid if you have you playing a basketball and stupid no I think if you it's a performance art like the but the the other players clapped like good good job children that was and then that game what was the final score that game a hundred million to zero so it was weird you do all of that and then your ass get dumped yeah that's that is one of the most unfair things ever that they like NBA superstars playing the Olympics that is so fucked up it was in our country but it's so fucked up it's so fucked up it's like the Condrey Ward was an Olympic gold medalist but if you let him box the Olympics right now it would be so fucked up it's just wrong because the just way better in the box in Olympics they is no less the professionals is it an age cap to it or was it just no it's just I don't think they allow professionals although that whole professional non-professional thing is very very weird now especially now that they let NBA players play you know cause like there was always talk of that like when they were talking about doing that like it was back when Mike Tyson was a champ they were like well what the fuck what if you let Mike Tyson box the Olympics good luck well the the players from the other teams are pros - yeah I mean whenever the country's well Spain has some solid players and some of my NBA players Pau Gasol Marc Gasol Rudi Gonzales a couple other players they played in the NBA Australia actually put up a decent team that got Bogut maybe Patty Mills I might be fucking out but they have a handful of uh it's a handful of pros from other countries and in those pro leagues that have been competitive against thee but not those guys but if there's pros and then there's American pros it's a it comes to basketball there's no competition it's kind of a joke isn't it for a second for a little bit kidding Spain and Spain as some guys and Spain there's a bunch of guys in the league so it's when Spain plays the USA is basically like some NBA players playing against other NBA players mm-hmm you know what I mean versus random do some instead of it being random dudes from Spain it's actually you know they might be playing you wanted two guys on USA might be plant against wanted a real NBA teammates interesting yeah the rules are a little different to an international basketball with some what's the difference for instance you can goaltend what once the ball it's the rim you can swatted off and in the NBA and all-american basketball pretty much you can't even touch the ball if it's anywhere close to the rim or above it I was like uh that's a whole act like that's a whole extra rule if you're like if you're seven foot tall right I can just snatch the ball every time I get to near the rim hmm it's a couple other little small ones it's like bumpin engine it's interesting how other countries used to have it used to be a non-competitive in certain so like boxing is a perfect example for the longest time like the American boxers were head and shoulders above the rest of the world yeah like especially like in the heavyweight division the look wasn't even close they like it was Henry Cooper who hurt Muhammad Ali real bad that was a interesting story this is back when Muhammad Ali was still Cassius Clay before he became a ha manali and Henry Cooper was like the big English heavyweight and he rocked Muhammad Ali with a left hook and you know what Angelo Dundee did he cut muhammad aleyhi loves he went back to the corner and he's just sliced his gloves he's like guy we got to change these gloves his gloves are fucked up so they they bought him all this time they had oh shit yeah they had to undo the tape get another pair of gloves like that cut his fucking gloves cuz that's the type of tricks you could do in the 60s yeah [Applause] if you ever see the fight he got cracked like more than he ever got cracked in his entire career Google Henry Cooper rocks Muhammad Ali and so Muhammad Ali it wasn't Muhammad only was Cassius Clay back then so he drops him with like the perfect left hook that was his big punch too and Ali just crashes down to his ass and he's like out and they they gave him all sorts of time he went back to the corner they cut the gloves they took the gloves off then he went back and got new gloves they had to they sliced his gloves open with a razor blade they just sliced them so this is about ten minutes there's a lot of time time a lot of time because they had to get gloves you know they don't have gloves is waiting what was uh I wonder what the commentators style game was like I see it right here what these guys used to Stalin like right here boom oh yeah like he is fucking out is very end of the round the very end of the round boom I mean I was a perfect left hook it just got sat down he's in deep trouble yeah so there's two things happen one it's the end of the round see he's like really out of it right yeah they're throwing water on them and then when they go back they're like oh you know oh so they cut it out of this they don't show oh they changed the gloves so he's super fresh here and he wound up the stopping Henry Cooper bye cut see if there's a clip of the glove changing yeah there's such that's funny it's like this is Mike Tyson's old train not old trainer but old manager goddamnit I forget his name but he was a boxing historian and he put together all of these videos and he used to do the voice-over for a lot of these videos too like right when custom Otto died him and Shelly Finkel took over goddamnit what the fuck is his name Mike Tyson's old manager what do you got there pulling up nope no there's a old Jewish guy forget his name but he was a he had a tremendous library of films yeah and it's one of the things that Mike Tyson used to go and watch you know obviously we're talking about the early 80s so this is before VHS tapes are around I mean those things weren't on VHS tapes so he would watch them like I'm like six times yeah yeah yeah damn god damn I'm struggling remember his fucking name it's driving me crazy something with a J you know anyway point being he probably edited that out yeah you know they didn't want to show the the controversy because it was plain straight cheating they just cheated I want to hear the what the commentators did during that stop it's like point yeah so what we don't know what's going on did they just veer off into other talk sometimes how baseball commentators just start talking about some weird random shit about their family downtown out fishing this weekend I'd like his great man the mosquitos get to you but okay hideaway yeah baseball players this an art to that right because there's so much downtime yeah it's uh oh absolutely it's so much down I was watching one clip I forget what team it was but it was uh just one of the it was somebody at bat and then one of his teammates was just exactly Mike and his his uh just imitating his batting style and ritual just each from like every little nuance to just what he would do with his little bit and just any and then he was doing that father's team X because you got so much downside right you could and you around them 162 games and plus practice so you like yeah I know exactly all of your moves all your mannerisms exactly everybody your mannerisms down to the ice which my high school wrestling coach refused to call baseball sport he's like it's not sport skills skills game it's a skills game you have to run you have to run this is not my favorite sport but I respect it a lot I don't you know Javy Baez is from the cups I don't know anybody's playing baseball once they get arrested a lot of people Javy Baez is one of the best defenders and it makes incredible plays and where you think that's that's athletics if somebody oh for sure yeah it's art it's a lot of skill involved but it's definitely you know they're definitely athletes I think yeah they are but it's like there's a big difference between that and say like basketball like you have to be in some extreme cardio right basketball you run it back and forth and back and forth and you know those guys are always sore after games and you know they got fucking plantar fasciitis and shoulder issues is constant activity there's no you know you can be in left field a couple innings and that do anything just chill it out there yeah with your own thoughts talking to the fans and shit yeah yeah it's none of that and basketball just standing around except for doing free throws or downtime but baseball players might go especially if the pitch is killing it yeah you just you just get into your fucking stands half-heartedly and but you know it might not be coming out they're just that's the other thing about baseball the fans will torture you if you're sitting out there oh yeah that's a long time to be out there especially on an away game posted drinking there's 18 minutes of action your average major league baseball game wow that's like less than one fight you know a team that's like one championship fight or less than yeah less than one championship fight or basically one three-round fight which is 15 minutes of action that's crazy we act like we made a big discovery and shit yo baseball boring yeah we did it well baseball is one of those games like if you try to invent it today they'd be like get the fuck away nearly old school but about that 18 minutes action that's not even action of everybody that's not everybody moving right at once like a football game right well basketball that's maybe three or four people moving around B yeah yeah the pitch to if you turn in double played and you know right there's a handful of people involved in but yeah it's pretty boring game just get paid a lot a lot of games I guess it's crazy how much money is involved people like it man but it's it's gonna be like Japan where else what are the countries adopted baseball adopted it took it a super popular in Japan I know Cuba Cuba right I think maybe Mexico Mexico uh Korea I'm just sayin stuff yeah I don't know just guess it it's amazing how little interest people here have for soccer that's what's really amazing when you say soccer worldwide and you see how little we give a fuck about it here except those annoying white dudes that like to get really up about it when the World Cup comes around and they scream and yell at bars like they really give a fuck there's reportedly growing belief that Bryce Harper's next contract could be worth over four hundred million dollars I could imagine Jesus just that type of just scrutiny and attention on my finances like that Brian it does expectation this is not even not the contract is set yet but when people talking about what you might make oh so much money it's a lot of money it's too much money it's too much money to be resting over your head I think for hundreds to well say it's about um I mean it depends on what state he lives in how much money it actually is well it becomes a thing like with Floyd Mayweather you know like a big thing about fully Mayweather is how much money he makes is not just that he's a great boxer it's that he's gonna make three hundred million dollars apparently is gonna be even more than that you see the the pay-per-view numbers they're talking about 6.5 million pay-per-view buys Wow so it's more than 2 million more than the Manny Pacquiao fight that's insane that well every potential refund today that's a good question well he did nicknamed himself money Mayweather well he did history was Pretty Boy Floyd he changed it but yeah then he built the persona around spend money yes he doesn't have to do I mean it's it's good and good for him but he did make a big thing about spending money that one time he showed it like a hundred million dollar check like wait why is that unlike a regular ass check yeah it was like a regular chase bank check it wasn't even a big cardboard one not even net or print it out or print it out on a or even a wire or something I would get that wire yeah laminate that thing anything that's real the ability holding on to a 100 million dollar check but it was just a regular ass check that you would buy groceries on in the 80s yeah yeah that is 100 million yeah I guess he wrote it to himself so is made with her promotions general on her yeah yeah you got a hundred million in a Bank of America I guess so it seems like he just holds onto it to hey he doesn't catch it that's so weird out of his bookbag at one of the yeah yeah something but I mean why is he hanging on that why does it should probably catch that well his other account anyway this may weather for Moses account who cares sort of May where the personal account the checking so he's probably gonna make more than three hundred million dollars from this last fight sure yeah amazing I can't imagine that they won't do that again that him and Connor won't do it again with what figure if they Cana can figure out how to not get tired yeah if he could convince people like say if he fights Paulie Malignaggi isn't it beats the shit out of Paulie Malignaggi and then says Freud let's do it one more fuckin time and I think Florida nah man come on we did that our own I know that's what he starts thinking about that money could drop if you could figure out a way to get people excited about it Connor could get somehow somehow another get more people to pay attention because it was an interesting fight for the first three or four rounds it's made it look interesting but it really wasn't interested I thought it was interested within when I thought back it wasn't interested well he caught Freud clean you know he caught him with an uppercut in the first round nobody hits Freud clean like that Lloyd underestimated him I also wasn't he wasn't doing that shoulder roll no he was because he wanted so he didn't believe in Kaunas pop so floyd usually boxes do you think that's what it is well you always see him boxing that lady box Canelo and he does that and right and he goes off of that counter I don't think that's what it was I think he knew that Conor was gonna get tired if he was backing out you know that Conor has endurance problems and as long as he wasn't throwing a lot of punches which Floyd wasn't and he's constantly faking and moving he's got Conor backing up he could be what it's way easy to be defensive if you're not being offensive so if you're not thinking about hitting the guy if you're constant like fainting and you got your hands up you're moving forward but really you're thinking about what he's throwing yeah you can get away with a lot and you could press forward a lot more because you're gonna see the punches coming because you're not really thinking too much about throwing your own punches unless it's like a clear wide opening so for the first couple of rounds he's mostly like putting pressure on him sizing him up when I watched it after the fight it became way more obvious like while you're watching you like what's gonna happen what's gonna happen what's you already know what's good what's happened then then I watched it and I said oh I could see exactly what he's doing he's fainting putting a lot of pressure on Conor and he's making kind of backup a lot which is exhausting and then also Connors not very efficient he's not a boxer so like there's a lot of energy being wasted he's gonna get tired more easily and he doesn't run so he doesn't have the same kind of endurance at Floyd has it's a lot a lot of factors in there yeah it was a hundred eleven punches but some of them were like yeah all the ones that Connor landed II mean yeah there was a few of it it was like little mm-hmm yeah yeah there were also like weird ones like patty little patty pack punches to the side of the head yeah this is one me it shows kind of this is folk this boxing shit well you know you get used to that in MMA you know you get used to hammer fists well I think that's what I saw I was talking about and a lot of other people were just wondering if muscle memory is gonna just kick in and he was gonna do some weird immolation and it did kick in a little bit but it met to the extreme yeah I think there was some massive penalties for any so if he had any sort of a point deduction or anything that they did is something illegal I think he had a massive penalty more than a million dollars for each thing he fucked up with a 10 mil 10 mil makes it for each one that makes sense at that 10 mil it makes you get your shit together as long as he's not doesn't get disqualified it might be worth it like 10 million for one fucking knee to the body oh you know I didn't know you used to fight until after the last time I did the podcast I just thought you got it worked out a lot and just really liked mixed martial arts in combat well I never fought mixed martial arts cuz I wasn't around but kickboxing yeah I did that yeah because I remember this seeing something somebody said oh you talking about Rogan like that he'll kick you and your shit you know what and then I looked up Rogan kickboxing like what the fuck she was kicking the shit out of a back yeah yeah how that feel meant to hit somebody feels weird the bag Oh bags easy yeah bags on her back it was the last time you hit somebody in anger or in competitions been a long fucking time it wasn't anger Oh neither one this wasn't longer yeah and anger is probably high school competitions lost 22 or something that that was a Taekwondo tournament I was 19 then oh and that was you yeah those need to walk if you kick somebody the body like that a spinning back kick to the body so much bulletproof doesn't matter that thing that's just moral protection oh man you so what was your at that point when you saw him laying down he's dead the news dawn but I'm not dead you know what you taking damn he's not getting out was it what yeah you have to walk away and like make it look like it's no big deal that is how my thought process was don't get excited make it look like this is what I'm gonna do to everybody just relax just walk off and have everybody so nervous that you don't even care like this is just a normal thing for you you kick people to go unconscious they fall down they can't get up that you got to have that people because you're in a tournament so you're going to be fighting a bunch and then watch it yeah you might have to fight three or four times a day who was there rooting for you just my teammates guys that are trained with yeah yeah so it doesn't even seem like even more I watch that doesn't really feel like me so long ago stay here well not only that I mean I also had protector on the back of my hand they would wear these uh head protectors you could wear a full one that covers your whole head like over your ears or you wear one that's just the back your head which is really just there so when you get knocked out yeah it doesn't fucking bounce off the ground yeah because we were fighting on a basketball court you look at that that's just a wood floor shit yeah there's a lot of that fun on a hockey rink once where they put a plastic sheet down on a hockey ring so it was uh not the ice but the cement underneath the hockey rink so we're basically fighting on cement so the 80s were terrible is like an awful fucked up knocked out and bounced their head off the ground I saw a lot of that yeah not good and for no money that's the thing there's no future no future and no money for the love of the game well I guess it prepares you for life and also you wanted to find out I wanted to find out how I would do you know I wanted to find out but it would be like to compete under high stress situations like worrying about someone kicking you in the face yeah um I'm glad that most people can't kick somebody in the face so I'm glad that's whenever I go to a UFC fight or a mermaid I just whenever somebody gets kicked in the face I mean if I got kicked in the face have you so disappointed it's not good it's not it looks it looks crazy yeah it's terrible for you the thing is more people can kick people in the face now that I think in any of the time in human history I think there's a lot of fucking people that can kick people in the face now because of watching MMA and Internet in classes yeah training I think more people training now than than ever before for sure there's way more people that can strangle people than ever oh yeah 100% because the choke is easier to learn no it's just more people are doing jujitsu than any other time in history like before like in my early martial arts days there was no one that was doing grappling really like I wrestled in high school and then there was no like jujitsu classes there was like you could take judo like there was judo but there was very few like actual like submission grappling schools or anything like that even nationwide there was a small handful nobody knew what the fuck they were doing now everywhere you look there's a jujitsu school like I was down in San Diego just San Diego alone which is not a big city they must have a hundred units or schools just in San Diego shit crazy I'm gonna start sponsoring more fighters yeah are you remember I sponsored one and she missed wait Yan Invicta right yeah yeah she's you anymore I am some other people reached out I gotta just get some new designs for the club that's been holding me back I gotta get some new designs that would that was okay design but I had a mixing I'm like your face on her ass or something like that it wasn't just asked it was it was just in case you know just in case she got knocked out and fell on her face did pull Hannibal Barca mmm yeah yeah you could do it in some organizations still she didn't make weight that's a bummer make weight I think it's harder for girls to make weight well she sees she's fighting next week and I think she was trying to fight it 115 and she's fighting at 125 now or she was trying to fight I think she's trying to fight at 105 and now if I don't want either what she's cut in my swing she's cutting this way - yeah that was the other thought about the Conor fight a lot of people thought that Conor cut too much weight that's one of the reasons why I burnt out yeah that's part of it I think it was a factor he does cut a lot of weight and that does drain your body and it's not like when he's training he's cutting that weight because he's not you know like you only do it once you do it right before the weigh-ins you get you weigh in and then you put the weight back on so all that endurance training all those hard rounds that you did that's not after your dehydrating yourself severely so your body's not used to operating exactly that level with this situation now well he's used to it because he fights an MMA like that but MMA you get more chances to take a break you get it's it's different you know it's more exhausting like it could potentially be more exhausting because there's grappling and there's kicks and there's just a lot more going on and you're fighting five-minute rounds like you have more of a chance to get tired and that five-minute rounds but when you clinch with someone you could actually hold on to them like referees not going to break it you can take them to the ground and get on top of them you can hold your position and catch your breath there's there's more opportunities to recover right now weight cutting is the worst part of fighting 100% seems it was even the fighter that uh Janissa was supposed to fight that day she took a picture of herself and she may wait but it looked terrible like it was definitely 105 now that I remember cuz 115 wouldn't look crazy like it was she's like I made way now like yo you okay it was like you know what she tried she tried to make weight shit okay it's a few pounds but I guess those few pounds matter obviously somebody's overweight and didn't go through the strenuous yeah process that you went to then they come in at an advantage yeah you have an advantage if you're not dehydrating yourself as much but that advantage is crazy like they should stop doing that they really should figure out a way to stop fighters from cutting weight like that what's the alternative the alternative is to weigh them like randomly the same way they catch people with drugs like we went you're like random drug tests do random weight tests like they show up and they go Oh Hannibal look you're 175 pounds you're supposed to be fighting at 155 what the fuck is that like okay and then they catch you again okay well you're 176 pounds today oh you're definitely not fighting at 155 and they'll give you a weight parameter like it says it's healthy for you to cut 10 pounds you got to fight it 166 okay that's your weight class so it'll force fighters to be more disciplined about their their actual weight like you can't balloon up in between rounds or in between competition and you're also you know you have to think about how much weight you could actually dehydrate out of your body healthy California has some new raw laws I don't only let you cut a certain amount of weight like they'll they periodically measure people like during their camp yeah give him an opportunity to measure him during the camp and does one of the reasons like Hanna Burrell who was the bantamweight champion he fought alg Amin sterling but they wouldn't let him fight at 135 they made him fight at 140 okay cuz like he cut too much weight at a catchweight yeah yeah I think there should be the option for the crazy fighters just whatever weight you want to be class that should be one like for the fighters that might not be active all night on the bill and we got this spot like guest spot guess a guest spot on the comedy show somebody's pops up a right a pop-up fight no matter what the weight is these two fighters they whatever the fuck weight they want to be they've agreed to fight we got this guy coming in at 165 this other guy coming in at 215 they agreed to fight each other you're cool with that like old-school UFC one yeah like the old-school but not crazy you know in that sumo wrestler versus you know 100 pound ooh but how much weight 30 pounds difference like that cat was the cap I think it's up to the late leave it up to the person is a guest panel it's the guest spot well a lot of people do that in grappling tournaments and grappling tournaments they have the absolute division in the absolute division sometimes the lighter guys win the whole thing yeah but there's no hitting that's the thing about grappling you know it's like you can you can get by and skill and technique in an understanding of positioning whereas like you know you're fighting a guy like like France it's in Ghana or something like that just a giant 265 pound dude if you're 150 pound guy you're fucked you're just fucked I got he's 100 something I use 10 and 1 tit and one yeah I think you lost one of his early fights the Commission okay leave that they have a 10-point plan to curb the weight cutting while protecting fighters now normalized in the Commission's rules are steeper fine for missing weight a 10% cap on the weight of fighter is allowed to gain between the time the weigh-ins oh that's interesting and an event and the weight class restrictions for those who miss weight more than once they also recognize for new weight classes I think that's huge have a bunch of weight class they should have weight classes every 10 pounds that guy Andy Foster he's the California State Athletic Commission executive director he's the shit that guy's awesome he really is the most proactive out of all the athletic commission guys so that's it they figured out they banned the use of Ivy's which is interesting too because IVs help you considerably to rehydrate sure yeah they banned it yeah they banned them they don't want people relying on that this is all these articles about a Kevin Durant about talking shit about Under Armour dude that crushed their stock yesterday it's very easy it's Kevin Durant is the Trump of basketball shoe stocks no you know what he did he's just like casually commenting about like how kids will pick schools based on what what what what uh sneakers are gonna have to wear a teacher yeah Oh hard Durant takes a shot at Under Armour but he just said it in like in a matter of fact sort of away he's like kids don't want to play in Under Armour see look at this nobody wants to play in Under Armour's I'm sorry the top kids don't because they all play Nike on a podcast if you drop the stock is that what it was a podcast yeah your podcast they dropped the stock three percent money that must be for a giant company like Under Armour three percent that's a billion dollar plus company three percent is probably tens of millions of dollars right and get a bounce back though how much is the month of the actual difference oh it's LA is down 44% says to start at a year yeah there's a lot of issues with Under Armour and hunting - a lot of people think that Under Armour is there they're worried about their hunting division because like anti-hunters they're like the only gigantic company that has the stones to support something that's as controversial as hunting they haven't been around very long though either right Under Armour 15 years maybe I think that's a good question like Iran I think they're from the 90s I read some adidas started back long long time ago and oh yeah two brothers and that's where Puma started it's the two brothers started due to some boomers not like that or like dienes is from remember Run DMC my adidas that's like 1980 something there just now rebounding from the problems that night did you pee that quick you're a wizard how'd you do that you listen man she's got a hatch this is pour it out should I be professional that's the craziest fastest pee ever seen you've down 3 water since you've been here man you let all this talk about these fighters dehydrate yourself know those rules know that in that in this game we were talking about Under Armour they have a hunting division and they take a ton of shit because I know those uh there's a bunch of like crowd funding not crowd funds what are those things no it wasn't a fun thing it was a crowd something another that we're going after Cameron Haynes because they were call him a trophy hunter and they were trying to get Under Armour to drop him but then you look at like how many people like their their hunting divisions is tiny division and then Under Armour itself the company is just gigantic it's very interesting it's not a lot of companies that would be that big that would support hunting takes a lot of balls yeah that means the CEO is definitely into hunting yeah well yeah the owners it's like you manage of Nike got in the hunting no way Nike was in golf with Tiger Woods and obviously he was a gigantic athlete for them but now that he's not out there you even playing golf their golf division I think they just closed it this year like they don't even make anything anymore boys don't make some clothes for and some shoes like they're putting golf spikes on the bottom of Jordans but like they don't make clubs or anything anymore I think it's what the huh they just putting golf spikes on the bottom of Joy's out there from the recall some spikes on there and just get him out to the US Open we were talking last night about rappers that get sponsored by shoe companies at the store like I didn't know that rappers had contracts with shoe company years Nike announces it will no longer make golf clubs balls and bags easy yeah 50/50 cent and jay-z had a commercial yeah rapping back and forth with each other who was it Kanye has his own shoe he has yeah yeah but he had it with Nike originally and then went to adidas it's only rappers could you imagine for comic Kevin well you have to go to the next let have solute level stratosphere he has a comic or I mean unless you really want to do it and do it on a on a small artisanal level yeah I guess that's a it's a weird thing know that rappers get sponsored by shoe companies yeah well like Kendrick Lamar yeah he's got some sort of a shoe company thing right popular pursued Yeah right but does that guy work out I think Kendrick probably works out probably Kendrick because you know why it's certain rappers I could tell that they work out based on this show really cuz they have energy well not even just energy but if you respect if your songs and your lyrics are very dense where you're better it don't matter and you wrap it up that takes a lot of breath control and cardio especially if you're not doing it if you don't have a hype man onstage give you a hype man the hype man is so much just isn't it your energy is so you can catch a breath and so he'll take those last couple words on the line and then you catch your breath and you come back because a lot of people don't have the breath control so a lot of times even if somebody's not ripped they're in shape their lungs are in shape if they can do a whole a whole show of just you know kind of rapid-fire songs and shit yeah I never thought about that a hype man huh yeah that's what the hide minute I mean it's far in it is definitely they bring the energy up but a lot of times if you see a rapper and at this show and they don't have a hype man they're like you know I could spit my own shit all the way I don't need a hype man yeah yeah especially if they're fast with their lyrics right yeah and Kendrick doesn't you know he doesn't rap over his own beats that's a pet peeve of mine a lot of big rappers and they will just wrap over the song the actual song own lip-syncing almost pretty much just wrap it over to sit at their old concert now get some if say you pop up at somebody's show to do a guest spot as a rapper and you do your biggest song this person's DJ doesn't have your instrumental he only has a regular track then rap over that but it's just show I don't want to hear you rap over that cuz you're just rapping over this will produce song I'd rather just hear this shit crispy in a club right yeah yeah just otherwise you're just seeing their presence and that's enough yeah it's just I mean it's still you know it's still fun but it's just that when you when you know what the alternative is which is you being a good polished performer yeah yeah come on man just don't rap over your shit yeah that's a weird pop thing right pop singers are kind of allowed doable in that we know they do it when they get busted it's a huge deal like what was the girl Ashley what the fuck that was a big disaster right she kind of vanished after that I mean for that - bad timing yeah how big she had a show there trying to ramp her up on TV like there for the diary mmm oh yeah they pull though pull the plug on that fucker that's it for her yeah never heard about her again no really not really right saw at a party that was like 15 years ago right at least 15 I think it might have been like easy - easy - I worked there 2009 so the couple years before that I guess no six for my mom looking at over 200 forward oh wow yeah damn 1314 years time will fly yeah it does not wait for you you gotta be yeah if you're gonna be a person who sings on stage and moves around on stage and you're not gonna be going over your track you have to be in some serious shape yeah it's a to put on a solid shot yeah you got it promises no shit in 2007 Jesus fuckin tree broke breaking her music nobody know where'd you find out but this is December 14th 2016 she said five now look at her she's got kids teaches yoga she found she found value and things besides you got to good that's probably a good move for some people you know get out now we were looking at what the fuck's his name Mick Jagger's routine like Mick Jagger's 185 years old and that dude works out twice a day yeah like he does yoga he lifts weights he has trainers like he's just doing everything to try to keep his body together like hang in there might want to keep fucking supermodels this girl likes what he's up yeah he's got an 18 year old girl in five six days a week but I don't go crazy I alternate between gym work and dancing then I do Sprint's things like that I'm training for stamina he shredded though they had a picture of like Mick Jagger like his body damn he runs eight miles a day swimming kickboxing and cycling how old is he he's got to be like 72 right let's let's take a guess how old you think Mick Jagger is yes yeah he's seven yes 70 I think 72 is good yes 72 73 I remember seeing something all right when we were kids 72 year olds were dead absolutely there was nothing left like you you had you were on empty your body was falling 74 he's almost he was almost 100 then how long is he gonna live how does melon girlfriend look at her Oh Mickey dirty dick she's just turned 30 and he knocked her up right didn't shoot a live one in there yeah what are the odds that kid's gonna come out and not have superpowers all this stuff that he's taking this to stay young wow that's crazy thirty years old Mick Jagger because of that's the baby giant head look the kid can read minds the kids heads filled with vitamins and anti-aging serum okay look at her she's like your daddy 74 your daddy's older than the president we have to find you positive role model because your daddy probably won't be around very much longer have you heard of maroon 5 it up when you're 74 and you're having a kid that is super ambitious like you're optimistic is fuck to be 74 and have a kid yeah even I'm I'm 34 and I'm like yo I need to fuck it if I'm gonna have kids I need to gotta get it in X I'm happier the next couple years yeah it's a good move yeah but would never it 74 of brand new one yeah that's like super bold I guess it's just like you know you know it's got a great story by the you know Theo von you know Thea hilarious dude he's fucking hilarious his dad was like in his 70s when he had him oh and he's got hilarious stories about going school and like telling people that's his grandpa but being embarrassed it's his dad this was fair falling asleep everywhere sounds like fair behavior for a kid who's Jade Jagger is go spin these first kids 45 Jesus Christ man that's first kid could be his girlfriend's mom oh man is he married to the girl the new girl oh it says spouse so like why not I'll get married we don't give a fuck take my money partner partner giving my money to my kids yeah partner means fool me twice shame on me only three times I'm senile oh man and collect on my estate niggas lover and another lover they're not funny that we have like distinctions all right did you or did you not scribble on the paper did you or did you not agree to some stupid shit that doesn't make any sense financially you or did you know is your life is just a state at stake with this relationship can you just shoot loads and her random all willy-nilly or does she have access to half of your money let me know well no she know let me know what's going on what's the deal what kind of deal what you guys make that's it that deal is just so weird I have a friend that is a super rich dude and he was getting married his wife did not a prenuptial and he was like well this is crazy like why wouldn't I get a prenuptial like if we stay together like we don't have to worry about anything because I you know you'll you'll be fine you'll have plenty of money but if we break up why would I be in a situation where you could get out my money Jim you don't think this relationship is gonna last that's why it was done I think it's gonna last that's why I want a prenuptial because it's not gonna matter right and if we if it doesn't last let's work out a side deal that isn't that half yeah you can't just hold that over me like well his ex-wife held it over him like they didn't have a prenup and when they got divorced it was a disaster and so then he was going into a second marriage and this lady was like I don't want a prenup he did what I've already done this like the fuck out of here it's a tough combo yes it works out it works out that's yeah that's a heavy I've had some heavy combos in my life but those that's one of the ones where well yeah I've been kicking it for a couple years but uh yeah I don't want you to just in case this goes poorly let's just get this out of the way real quick careful like what stage of the relationship you do this to because in the beginning like if you decide to get married after like six months you're like you're on drugs right you know you blissed your blissed-out you can't believe they're the relationships working so well it's amazing she's incredible she's my life she's my partner she's my soul she's my partner she's everything to me then you just get sick of each other about two three years in then what's the seven-year itch you know that's seven-year inch I've talked to a lawyer she goes okay listen let's just if we if I get divorced now and then the lawyer goes well how much money is he making now is you have any other financial opportunities there on the table that could perhaps increases Walt over the next few years because you might want to hang in there for a few you start thinking about it mercenary like like if I just get to 11 years if I get to 11 years then he gets the CEO position and they starts making X amount of us terrible zesty idea of living in the house with a woman and then she starts hating you or resenting you at some point and then starts plotting leaving well all that's well just still yeah just living in the house hey honey Blanche is just going through the motions of what a marriage is supposed to be yeah but secretly gonna end it and she kind of knows exactly what she's gonna in it that sounds terrifying it is terrifying but it's also adorable it makes me laugh it makes me laugh because it's so silly because it's like such a human thing like it's not it's it's a such a cultural and a human thing and it's this weird lottery like this the reason why men are attractive to women at all when they're really wealthy if they're gross you know if you see a gross dude like who's that guy Rupert Murdoch the guy who owns Fox yeah he's like he's old as fuck he's like doesn't take care of his body's kind of like but he's got this hot wife right there's something there's something adorable about that because this is this weird human folly that but it's also a scam what's interesting is a guy like that becomes attractive because he's wealthy and the woman's not wealthy right you got assume if she's worth a billion dollars who wouldn't be attractive she'd just start fucking her personal trainer and I'll buy you a Ferrari honey eat mommy's pussy you know like that kind of shit but if you get to a situation where you find this old dude and you know well he's just really kind to me and other young guys they just want to have sex and leave me and he just takes care of me and then what does that Veronica Terry the Treasury munchin oh yeah he's got a bangin hot wife that's the lady that got in trouble because she was tweeting about all the different clothes and things she had on a on a government trip she's on a government jet and she's like tagging all the the bags she wears and the shoes she wears it and she's smoking and he looks like he looks like her dad easily right doesn't he for sure he's crossing Twitter that when you didn't have many people have lost jobs and money because of Twitter is really fascinating I've had a situation happen because of but nothing I've haven't done any I haven't had a stupid-ass right social media blowout but when you think about how insane it is with that where this is a media where you can literally control every single word you say and you still say some well shit that cost you millions of dollars or cost you relationships yeah exactly around your friends you don't think twice about and you say hey online what I was gonna say about these rich women though is that like when you're a wealthy man and the woman's not wealthy the fact that you're wealthy is attractive but then if she marries you she's rich too now yeah you're just a dude and now you're gross and now she wants to stay rich so she has just kind of hang in there are you talking me out of getting married I always tell people just it's one day won't be around yeah one day marriage won't be a thing it's gonna take time you know I spend my money on what I do random which I was uh I was caught in a weird internet wormhole last week I was a little hiding on some adderall and I clicked on I and on adderall my on adderall hi oh wheat and on adderall Jesus what's that like it's great cuz it's uh you have to focus and energy of adderall within the creativity of week ooh there's a good combo right like that is how you write I was planning to write but I just took some different times on the internet that I would normally take I should have written but it's just you when you when you take adderall what you're supposed to do is when you take it you're supposed to get settled with what you want to work on right away mm-hmm and then when it kicks in you was in on it versus you know I think when my shit kicked in I was just on the internet so I just really dug deep into the Internet and so uh there was this a article about this guy on this this comedian it has all these funny tweets and so I started looking at his tweets oh yeah good tweets and then when his tweet said huh I'm uh I'll help my friend go to wrestling school and it was just this young woman that uh wants to go to wrestling she wants to go to pro wrestling school and I went to WWE Smackdown a couple days prior so wrestling was kind of on my brain so she had a GoFundMe and I just prayed for her wrestling school I got no cars Joe we just pray for some random wrestler school don't you just her everywhere you know I rent cars some places but yeah when I'm in LA over a lift around but like where you live in Chicago I'll get a I'll get a rental but I'm not there that much even though I residence in Chicago now I'm still not and so for my own frugality I can't justify having a car yet I am living that's interesting gonna get one so i'ma break out of it my dad is super cheapest so that's just kind of his brother I'm still I'm lightly extravagant and cheap and practical at the same time an extravagant watch what is that this is a barrera it's beautiful I bought it cuz I was hyped before I was shopping before I did some shows at Radio City with Chappelle and so I was right before sounds like I need to buy a shirt I bought a nice shirt and I'm like fuckin I would get a nice watch and it was isn't that that crazy like 700 bucks or some shit okay yes reasonable yes a reasonable is too much for a watch but not any stupid but that see that's the one thing that fucks me up about watches like if you told me that watch was 10 grand I'd be like okay like it's the same thing yeah it looks like it could be a 10 grand watch right watch is a weird look is a weird but it just kind of they pop on stage a little bit and it's you know it's a bracelet with the time yeah did you see that Floyd Mayweather watch we're talking about the laferrari that's all crystal 600 looks like some futuristic shit 600 grand a lot six see I could never never yeah this is even still now and I have this happy like 700 bucks on this Jesus Christ guessing you had a book that gig in Boise to cover this shit can be doing this gonna end up on 30 for 30 broke that what what kind of car you gonna get I think I like the Tesla okay yeah electric yeah like just you have to get out of town quick and there's you have to hope that there's electricity I add a town quick yeah what if some shit goes down but with this some sort of an earthquake or something I guess I'll just get somebody else's car friends of shit that mean I should have believed in to hop a ride yeah the thing about Tesla's it gets me I love them I think they're great but you really can only drive them 250 miles yeah I don't give a fuck what they say and even that you better be driving slow cuz if you drive them fast or if you drive it in traffic like my business manager came out to Anaheim for the UFC and he drove from Hollywood to Anaheim and his shit was dead all the time we got to Anaheim Oh traffic yeah so he was stuck in traffic and it was no like shit on off the road he had to find a superstation so you gotta go sit there for a half an hour at the superstation and when you do that it fills up like 75 percent or something like that oh the city drive it no maybe I'll get a used card as practical mmm for the apocalypse why don't you get like a hybrid Lexus Hybrid yeah those are the shit and yeah you can operate I think they have a switch where you could operate I know they have that for the Acura NSX that new NSX they have an all-electric mode where you could drive a totally electric oh you hit all the switches and it's normal yeah then it's super fast this looks fresh you know what uh yeah there you go Alexis Alexis hybrid that's a badass car - that coupe because it's it's sporty but it's just understated enough where you're not driving a Ferrari or a Porsche or something like that but it's a badass car that one right there that what is that the LS l CH yeah that's a badass car yeah yeah baby that's what you need to get you get yourself one of those look at that thing that's sleep that's pretty weighted looking car and you know what I like about Lexus's man they just never break this is my second Lexus that I have right now and I've never had a single fuckin problem with them those things just never break you just drive them they never go wrong customer service is fantastic they're the best customer service any car I've ever had nice and they're in there like they're flashy but they're not impressing a rapper you know what I mean you don't know what type of rapido yeah that's true right it was like yeah like De La Soul they're probably impressed you know I did this week I I donated some honey to Red Cross for the Houston thing people get mad at you for that and then I remembered right away about the Red Cross shit yeah it was like a knee-jerk donation and donates a Houston Food Bank also but then I remembered about the shit with how they handled the Haiti funds and Katrina and then I even helped because it was through Amazon Payments I was like hey can I get that money back please I want to just give it to some other source oh did you really haven't got a responsive but I was just a it was one of the weirdest no top 10 weird emails I've said why I asked for a donation back yeah that's slippery right I want it back though because I don't because they are I think it'd be better for some some organizations on the ground this is one Texas is the Texas diaper because everybody need I sure so and they're based in San Antonio so you could just sin I just went on Amazon and just sent a grand where for diapers mmm just because that made me feel good cause it's super specific and you can't really get two fraudulent with diapers doesn't mean that's a good way to look like with product you just send the product I mean maybe somebody worst-case scenario somebody steals it but for the most part if you sending a helpful product that money that shit's getting broken up some of that should go on to the mortgage something that should go on to like ink yeah it's weird because I guess effective charities have operating costs there's no we're just have to yeah people have to get paid you have to pay for logistics and planning and and the Red Cross obviously does a lot of good there's no doubt they do a lot of good and people just get mad at the accounting thing like how much of the money goes like right you know on it we donated money to the Red Cross for Harvey for Hurricane Harvey and people were like yeah the fucking Red Cross a terrible place to donate money okay you want to say that right people want to say that yeah what was the best thing to donate my I'd like to know what the best thing to donate for like Harvey is I think there's some I did a Houston Food Bank Texas diaper thing Houston Food Bank sounds like a good today JJ Watt has one the guy he plays for the Houston Texas is a few other ones that are on the ground and in Houston or in the area where Red Cross's you know I mean they obviously I'm gonna have people on the ground but it's pretty general so yeah they handle a lot of different things but they do a lot of good too like there's no denying that the Red Cross does a lot of good but it's it's that whole accounting thing like people get mad it's funny man because there's a lot of people just waiting to get mad at something even get mad at where you're donating your money well I think it's just I think the issue more is the from the little research I did on it the ripp cross hasn't had full transparency right with how it's like I think people want to know if you give a dollar so Red Cross what percentage goes there is what percentage goes it is what percentage goes it is yeah and I don't think they offer that and that makes people feel like they're getting shy stick do you think that's because they've been around so long the like Red Cross has been around for like how many years like a hundred years probably something right and like wasn't until the internet came along that these questions even came up but that people demanded transparency probably on a regular basis it's just cuz they haven't been that many results from the Haiti earthquake what people don't see tangible results and I know I donated a bunch on the phone texted to you I don't know if Wyclef was doing and Red Cross thing if he was doing something separate but I texted a lot just donate when that happened and so I think it's just what people don't see results for their money it's just like you know they want to especially if you just try to help something and it that I think that's what makes it worse for people where if you try to help and you donated money to help but you don't really see the results what the fuck yeah Haiti things it's almost like the infrastructure was so fucked up and there was so much damage done down there that you would need untold billions of dollars to fix everything it's like when you donate millions it's like you barely even gonna see any results like I wonder how much how much damage was actually done to hate you got to wonder about Houston I mean they're talking about Houston being just catastrophic to the point where some places are never gonna recover it's uh is pretty messed up man it's raining there right now still waiting and they were saying how I was about how the constant development that they've been doing there was part of the reason yeah why the flood it hit harder because they developed on prairie grass or certain land where this land might have soaked up some of that I mean it probably would have still flooded but it might have unless severe if there were needs yeah acres and acres of new development yeah I saw that where they're saying that by paving over these areas those those areas can no longer absorb the water but it seems like you're talking about did you ever see the graphic that shows the difference between the amount of water that rained down and Hurricane Katrina versus the amount of water that rained down so far on Harvey not even including today and it's gonna rain apparently tomorrow to I think it's it's so much more water than Katrina the difference fourteen to fifteen trillion gallons as of August 28th and what is today the 29th to 30th today's the 30th so that's two days ago of rain and then Katrina is only six point five trillion gallons I mean that's amazing I mean that's I mean I'm sure it's people that dedicate their lives it is but how do you count that they're out there with scoops beyond like oil drums you really yeah come on how do you really know it definitely looks like a Latin I hope is all right yeah well you know one of the things that I love about tragedies is when people come together and help each other out and one of the things is there was a line of fishing boats of dudes pullin fishing boats to go and rescue people it was like a whole line on the highway of dudes with trucks pulling fishing boats and they were dropping them off and they were driving you know their boat rather riding their boat down these flooded roads yeah and rescuing people and bringing them to safety that kind of shit makes me so happy that's one that fucked up things about people's like sometimes a bad thing makes people see the good in people it makes people do good things definitely but how how insane just abducts the position does they have to beat some like you in your crib just watch the show on Sunday relax and well you know fright and then a few days later you have to be saved by boat from this from this from this place where you usually just walk out and get the mail yeah you have to probably if somebody has to pull up with a boat that's insane this is a once every five hundred year storm - but how the fuck do they know that five hundred years ago people wrote shit down on bark you know this scratch they showed like raindrops and skulls what is that people house saved her with a jet ski Wow umm this is my friend's grandmother being jet skied out of her living room in Houston what about yo wow that house is fucked there's a lot of fucked houses the other thing about Houston too is Houston is so damp like Houston in the summertime so moist it means they're gonna have crazy mold growth their mold is gonna be off the charts and that shit makes people sick as fuck like I've had a friend in Austin his house had to be gutted because he was getting sick and they couldn't figure out what was wrong and they came in and did some sort of a test of the air and I - your house is infested and so they broke down his walls and apparently there was some pipe leakage or something inside the wall and then just the general moisture of the air though the entire walls were filled with his black mold and it was getting everybody sick gross yeah molds no no joke man that black mold stuff can really fuck you up if you're feeling shitty and your house has mold in it you got to do something about that because there's something going on there that's uh you're literally being poisoned by house yeah that Tom like it's dude had that going on - in LA he had to get his house gutted he he was feeling sick for like a year and then it finally did something about it found out his house is filled with mold they tear it down to the to the raw frame of the house and have to spray everything with this antifungal shit and redo the whole house again shit how long was he out of house like over a year I want to just says did he say that but so I'm reading a little article on it says that black mold yeah yeah just said it really had his voice hard fucked up as health it's no joke man I mean you're breathing in these little organisms it means spores are these little when you're thinking about mold it's a like a fungus right those wouldn't you consider mold fungus is that what it is yeah yeah that shit is in the air and it's poison so you're basically breathing in like toxic poison all the time yeah if it is just I can't imagine it shit man so you living in Chicago you don't you don't care about winters doesn't bother you i any where i walk around to work around it yeah animals not in town well here doing cake so about yeah I do that book I booked myself like that during the winter and Callie and Arizona Texas Florida etc and then if I do a run and I'm scheduled to come back but I don't have any actual thing to do in Chicago that I need to be there for I check the weather and if that's just like under 25 didn't I just chill where I'm at look that's crazy called down to the front desk and say extend for two days please that's good and you just hang out wherever yes hang out well go to a some other warm place for a couple that's how I mean this is my first time being back for for winter so that was that's how I handled it this time I would stay having the life it's nice man you live in a nice life I ripped my place out it's a apartment building I read it out when I'm not there oh do you really are you are frugal yeah you have people live in your house do you know these people no Wow every be I don't have like stuff stuff there I'm pretty uh bare-bones when I travel it just few t-shirts jeans a couple days so you your apartment in Chicago you don't keep a lot of shit there I keep just a basic stuff TV and the whatever you need if you're a traveling person if you Wow and then I stay when I get back it's three of them I stay which in whichever one is open block a couple of days oh you rent you have three apartments yeah isn't it big one builder yeah that's weird three apartments in one building why'd you decide to do that cuz it was a I mean I got it as an investment property I don't getting a separate place to stay in but that's where I stayed now is when I'm there cuz I'm not that much that's a slick move do I sound like a weird crazy cheap person right now you saw I wouldn't say cheap because you do have a $700 watch I would say frugal frugal is the white right way to approach this yeah yeah why not well I'm not why not no no I mean having them sitting around not generating any income doesn't do anybody any good absolutely not I think it was driving me crazy yeah so you doing the right thing it's uh sorry man yeah I was that uh is this festival called afropunk what's Network it's a music festival and it's uh it's just a beautiful festivals all black artists and it's great and people dress up in the wildest outfits it's a fun time I met the people that put it on I met them a few years back that used to come to my show at Knitting Factory in Brooklyn Jocelyn and uh math you know people is so backstage Shelley and I was there with a friend somebody introduced me to this lady she says oh I uh she has you know industry job oh I work here and blah blah blah we'd love to have you in and I say sure you know that sound that sounds good I'd like to do that sound it sounded like an interesting thing to do and so she hands me her phone and I put it in my email and my assistants email and then give her the phone back and she was like you go give your number doc dust I take that as a sign of disrespect I'm an OG in this game if I was I was super high at this point and like what is happening she took it as a sign of disrespect that you didn't give her your number yeah cuz I guess she deals with lots of famous people or some shit so the fact that I just gave her emails she just I never met that I met this woman 90 seconds prior to this part of the inner it was so what it and I was so hard - well is this really now I really wanted to work with you and I just gave you the info to get in touch of me yeah why do we have to talk on the phone that's less affect it was suicide what has happened then so and then so she goes on about that but wait for how long that long but then she tried to continue the conversation after is obvious that her vibe has changed while I was in it she went from my hey was that tonight yeah to a very dry oh so it's so she continued the conversation I'm good in this kind of dry weird wet what she said oh so you're about to go on this tour with knowledge and Lauren Hill how do you approach the shows differently but it's obvious that she's just kind of asking inside of you you in so and I saw I did not just answered it and then she pulls out her phone she's like oh my friends over there and then she uh she she's like goes like this like he can hear me and then I just said all right I'm I'm out of here I just walked off somewhere else but then it was such a weird experience that the comedian in me was hoping she was doing some weird Andy Kaufman bit was that intense it was just super wit cuz everybody was everybody else was really chill I wasn't even having any network and discussions with people like that there and everybody else was really chilling talk another feeling is that did that really have it is so I saw her later like a couple house later I said was what you doing a bit was that a joke and then she tried to play it like she would but I could tell she sees like I had to check you like check me for what you might and so but she was really into selecting people so she's really anyway yeah also she was uh interacted with me based on who else she's dealt with in her past versus just interacted with me as an individual so she was just super saucy and I was just it's so ironic that at this beautiful black festival the only person being weird backstage is a white woman in her 40s as a sign of disrespect you must have felt like as soon as she said that like oh this definitely was the right move not to give you my number because you're fucking crazy it was just more like I was wondering after I was like it was mine like did cuz I sometimes good I give random people my like but I don't know what I don't know maybe something is too instinct you knew it just gave it to her yeah buddy but I've given people my email before too but it was just it was just especially since I was super high I was like what the fuck well see the thing is for business though email is the best way to contact people yes you 100% you can even somebody at 3:00 in the morning it's nothing well yeah and not only that like you can like if you say hey we're trying to work out the logistics for this thing in February between February 2nd and 4th tell us your availabilities so then you can sit in front of computer or look at my calendar for my birthday hey happy birthday thanks look at that shit okay well here's what I've got and you could you it's it's clear it's more concise having a conversation over the phone that I got to remember I got to write it down hold on let me get a piece of paper or let me dictate it into my phone like that's less effective yeah especially it was it was crazy fucking bitch what is it's crazy people out there man I've met men and women that do that they want your number and if you don't want to give him your number they get upset this reason why you're getting upset is a very reason why I don't want to give yeah you too excited about getting my number look someone's that excited about getting your number you shouldn't give him your number he's nothing yeah she started a name dry finish it fuck that as soon as they start name dropping out a second time I've done stuff I'm put on events for Obama oh yeah call Obama right now wake him up that's like really great did you did that but don't offense for Obama did Obama give you his number crazy asshole like Obama's giving out yeah text me anytime no matter what's going on with the seven billion people in the world I'm handling yeah well maybe she's a troll and she knew that she was becoming a podcast story you see that I like to make people sometimes I like to make people more calculated than they are that's like some Illuminati shit that's like I don't think so I don't think so I think she's just crazy lady just a weird show business lady you know just a crazy lady yeah have you like completely moved past all the Cosby shit or do you tilt still take grief for that that grief no I've uh well now you're vindicated I was never grief is just where I would uh be forced to talk about it in situations I didn't want to and also it came out the the joke and that video came out right before we were starting the rollout from my Comedy Central TV show and we actually people on that we pushed back my announcement because looking opportunist that news was that crazy that we pushed it back by maybe he pushed it back the premier announced by a month or two Wow because it was that and so so even though I had my Comedy Central deal in place this insists 2012 out of all-around Comedy Central deal is so then when that came out and then I got my show with it well then my show was scheduled to go on the air it looked like oh you did a Cosby joke and then II got the TV show no man this is like my fourth development deal and this is finally the show that I got a haha isn't that funny how things that work yeah but so that was that was the thing where instead of instead of just having this show that I was able to it was his energy around you know in 2005 July like yet all early 2005 it was just energy around it where if I was gonna do press around that time they were definitely going on what year was it this was 2015 two years ago who thought you said sorry yeah 2015 and that show in Philly was October 2014 so yeah it just kind of really affected the the energy around it as far and and my want and and eagerness to do a lot of press just because I knew it was gonna come up yeah and I was just like I was so that was that I'm not saying it that's the reason my shell is not on anymore you know just before people like you [Laughter] like doing the show I I did I did like aspects of it I like the activity part of it where's always something to do you know I mean if you like if you you the face of a show you got a right you got to edit you got to get the writers to do stuff you got a you know deal with costumes and it's always a task to do so I like just the that I know for that whatever what four months three four month period I was never bored during that time doing when I do movies I'm hellebore yeah yeah I would like movies just cuz it's no you just sit around and you go say some stuff it's like baseball it's totally baseball it's absolutely baseball if you talk about a 12-hour day that you spent on a movie shoot is actually for me 45 minutes an hour of actual active and shit and I mean well with me maybe 10 minutes of actual acting because I'm not a good actor at all just say it words but yes it is just my normally boring but the finished product the finished product is is cool to see and it's dope to be a part of but we doing it the director has a lot that you know he's moving around and he got a lot of shit to do and so he might yet but yeah doing it yes shit it's boring it's very boring there's no other way to do it though it seems like it's always that way uh I think depends on the budget of it when they got money to burn then they got time to burn also what if you're doing an indie movie then they gonna keep it they're gonna keep that shit moving but then yeah she's doing a I did this one will be band of robbers that's on Netflix and it was just you know we were active what isn't it it's uh it's Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn but in real in real time hmm like in current time yeah so I did that and that was it played it you know did a few scenes and that but it was quick it was no wasted days you know sometimes you go to a movie set they go yeah get here at 9:00 o'clock in the morning you get there go through the whole shit get your hair makeup get your clothes on and sit around and just sit for a full I set for four days yeah like full days and then dude like what was it nothing what the fuck was the plan yeah want you there in case they get throw a scene even do anything well you know we're not gonna you not know do you good for the day for the whole for the whole day who planned this out now when you were doing your TV show how many months you do that you said dude for like four months uh eight episodes it was two months of shooting in a month or a couple months of pre-pro yeah do you enjoyed it I did enjoy I just yeah I enjoyed it I want to do a I'll probably do something on TV next year again to it so once I get that idea right and figure out exactly you think you do comedy central again Comedy Central needs a show uh they need something I'll do some where I don't do what you know what the best choice is I had a good relationship over there still but we'll see see this is it's so hard to do those things because you got to deal with so many other people get so many different cooks in the kitchen executives all these different people hanging yeah that's that's one part I mean they were they were pretty chill they were they were it was will be weird aspects and just weird things that you think you care about this it'll be a weird line why do you give a shit about yeah this line so much but they let other shit go but it'll sometimes give notes on something that seemed pretty insignificant to me yeah I think a lot of times they just want to justify their existence yeah they want to justify their paycheck and have some sort of a point of view even if it doesn't make any sense they just want to add to it yeah tweak it a little bit that was my idea wad that was my idea yeah conference calls is the work because everybody feels the need to chime in gonna call anyway I've been on conference why am I on this this call I don't know if I've had a I don't know if I had a conference call where I just felt really good like where I was like that was a good conference car glad I did that shit never a conference call once and I canceled a show I was supposed to do a Comedy Central stand-up special on the old regime and we had a conference call and they went they had like a transcript of my set and they were going over the material and they're like well you definitely can't talk about this and you you can't say this and you can't say we got like five minutes in the conversation go stop stop stop stop stop I'm not doing this I don't want to do this there's no way I go you guys are butcher and everything I go this is my ass you know what my act is you want to cut things out and change things and you like there's no way this is not happening you think yeah so thank you though I appreciate it I mean if they that they they were stunned there was one of those stunned conversations like what I was like yeah I'm not doing this did they did they flip though no no well it was just a straight up well I was yeah I was like we're going somewhere else but this is crazy because one of those conversations where they would be they were super result resistant to controversial shit this is a this is what a few years back like I wish I could remember late 90s no no 2005 ish six ish I wound up doing actually a series I'm a special on Netflix that went to Showtime that was 2005 that's why what I'm doing it but the conversation the phone was just like what like they were going over the material no okay we're gonna have issue with this you can't say that you definitely can't say this this is just those doing those specials on TV it's such a bad idea anyway because they're always all broken up you know yeah yeah yeah especially for stories I did my first two with Comedy Central and they were they break up your story they broke up a story a longer story in my second one if I'm that Oh mistaken but they are Netflix now and therefore but yeah they would I mean I gotta that's how he paid me that they fuckin sell ya Axe body spray I gotta take another face real quick so much water drink 4 bottles of water you might be the new water champ I'm not upset outside 2 also it is 110 yeah it's crazy out here too it's so hot that I went running and it was burning the bottom of my feet through those five finger shoes you know I wear those really thin trail running shoes those Vibrams that everybody tells me we cannot kill me people act like you're gonna die if you wear those things I tell people I'm worried a class-action lawsuit don't you understand please you're terrible for you bro they're not it's just your body is used to wearing a cast on your feet listen to everybody that's worried about those things I swear if you just use those things and walk for a while and then like wear them a little bit and then eventually build up to running with them you'll be fine but you have to strengthen your feet Neal Brennan said he got plantar fasciitis from running on a treadmill like those things on those Vibram FiveFingers shoes those the ones that really stick to your feet they're like well eco shoes yeah like you know I run with those and they're better for your feet it's like your foot has to be strong because most the time when you're running you're running with running shoes on like if you see like the average pair of running shoes they have a thick heel and what happened is Nike I think in the 70s whenever they came out with these things they literally change the way people run because people started running and landing with their heel because that's where the big cushion is change the gait the natural human gait and to put way more pressure on your knees and people start developing all these issues because of that the real way to run is supposed to you're supposed to run on the forefoot like landing on the ball of the foot and let the natural structure of your foot decelerate your stride that's what you're supposed to do but most people's feet are not conditioned for that because we wear these thick ass sneakers everywhere and those things act as it's like we're gonna cast everywhere that's how it's been described to me so over the last four or five months I've been running with what they call minimalist shoes there's almost no cushioning at all it's very thin and I was saying it's so hot out that I was running in these things and the bottom of my feet got hot yeah from though just from running on the ground the ground was so hot was it started to melt let's upload it I could feel it I could feel the heat through the bottom my feet was hurting it is actually like burning the bottom of my foot which by the way people if you have dogs be super fucking careful your dogs outside because you're walking your dog on concrete you can easily burn the shit out of your dog's paws I just looked a little bit into it they're painting different sections of asphalt I guess here with I don't know if it's like white yeah it's a it's a heat absorbing color instead of like black asphalt because black asphalt apparently you just absorbs the heat and reflects the heat and radiates it around yeah they're often like 10 to 15 degrees almost immediately I was here we got 12 degrees just after one coat yeah I've seen that that's amazing that's great yeah they all die as hot as I saw into one article but it's like 120 degrees it was getting someplace it's like off of Sunset Boulevard in LA like just the middle of the day when it's like 85 outside 90 degrees outside makes sense really really extra hot yeah it totally makes sense yeah and all of LA's asphalt basically - yeah paint that shit stupid yeah this would change maybe maybe a little on your feet oh yeah are you running on I'm running on dirt I'm running on hills but uh it was so hot it was the first time it's ever like burned the bottom of my feet like I could feel it it was hot I was like Jesus you know I'm not a I don't really jog but I'm a good judge of form are you I judge you like a runnin court coach no no if I could coach but I could just I could definitely tell you when you're wrong can I see some people like hmm you foot it happy foot it's bad most people are running on their heels I see people running and I'm like wow it's crazy when you look around - you look around how many people wearing shoes with elevated heels you're like wow that's kind of nuts it's kind of nuts how many people just got accustomed to wearing those kind of sneakers and running people around in basketball shoes or something - and you that's like you probably shouldn't be doing that I think you'd be better off with that then you are with the running shoes just don't land up that way just don't land on your heel if you land on the ball your feet basketball shoes I think should be fine but what the fuck do I know but you know I'm running with some really I run only with those five finger shoes now or with I wear these morels - they're called vapor something or like the real thin - minimalist do people ever try - now you'd run in but people probably still will attempt to stop you while you jog right yeah but I don't you can't so that's so crazy like I'm in the middle you're literally gonna interrupt a workout looks like how that people come up to me when I'm on a treadmill before like a man can I get a photo with you like definitely not now people do it it's about you ever you can have a mouthful of food you could be eating food is cutting food up for my daughter and this lady asked me for a picture I was like are you crazy I'm feeding my kid this is just people just don't give a fuck they want to adorn their Facebook with someone who I saw on TV once it's weird not even print it up you don't care not even really printing it usually well it's they don't even want it that much it's just like they have a phone and like it's like if you have a gun you want to pull the trigger you have a phone you want to take a picture like how many people do you see at the 4th of July taking videos of fireworks no you are never gonna watch that fucking video who the hell's gonna watch a fireworks video like what how they're sad does your life have to get where you don't have anything better to do then be sitting there watching little lights go off on your four-inch screen hey man Airport layoffs are real dog is that what you do when you're sitting there lay over you watch you know the person who did it you know when you like say you got a layover in Salt Lake City you delayed about five hours it should go through your videos and delete all the fireworks ones just clean do something just clean up yeah you eating up like gigabytes you are when you look at it you realize how much bullshit is on it you push it in the cloud yeah do you do mmm I should know I know how you will not do it I mean but it's nothing too too risque there's a couple risque to accept it but my face isn't in there that's one thing that's just I think I asked a friend this yesterday would you like let's say Amazon started a gmail competitor would you just like not just jump over but like wouldn't it be a good thing maybe to just start fresh with you all your email and be like ah what do I need that's 20 years old my email 15 years old oh yeah for sure I definitely if I look at my email on a daily basis 9 out of 10 things I get her bullshit 9 out of 10 1 out of 10 I need and those people I would just give my new email address anyway like Ari did that pretty recently ari just changed his email I'm like it's good move I changed your phone I changed my phone that's a good move to having more than one phone is a good move to having a phone for people like that fucking lady at that thing yeah yeah I just remembered my number right now by hard number about to change it again yeah yeah just I like not knowing at all I don't care as you know what else I like to I like that my vision is going so I can't read things so like when when I if I get like an email or something like that like I can go what does that say okay and you can feel held to like read the whole I don't feel compelled to put my reading glasses and going to depth I just look at it to get quick glance don't need to pay attention this as some bullshit yeah think about some important things that's that's uh that's why old man flaky damn game on yeah I'm practicing not giving a fuck I've always been good at it but I'm like actively working on it harder and harder more now than ever it's tough especially if you're in your if you think about it stuff that sir to not give a fuck would also be very aware thing about that it's all the time what you have to you if you say you don't give a fuck you do give a fuck cuz you making the choice to be like I don't give a fuck but you're still do give a fuck you just like I'm not gonna react in a way as somebody gives a fuck but I give a fuck yeah make it a choice though you know what it's like it's like I'm pretending I don't give a fuck by saying I don't give a fuck yeah I'm by putting that out there I'm like making a conscious decision to not give a fuck but in doing so I'm giving a fuck about not giving a fuck yes means you give a fuck you know we don't give a fuck who locksmiths why is that they don't get locksmith confidence doc I don't think of it cuz they can open any door they can open any door and you call them about the lock I mean I guess they have to eyeball it and see what it is but you got caught like I've had I was locked out of mine in New York and I say you come through and being a dad tell them that I'll be there in five minutes but what's the price I'll let you know when I'm there like that's confidence today I'm gonna tell you when I'm there because you need to get in your place that's true and yeah and so I've I've I've seen locksmiths away just as a too much money just as an act of aggression yeah he was like is this much and I was like trying to talk him down and he wasn't having and he was like so and I was like let's find out it's all good and I just sat in my hallway foot and I think I went to the bar a couple doors down just called a lot of the locksmith how much did you save that worked that time for my spirit now did you get a vibe off that dude like you sorta had a vibe off that lady didn't want to give her your number there's no it's just I think it's just because I I just see how quick they can do it and like I could do that in you know for like they do it in maybe 20 30 seconds sometimes I mean I I can learn how to do it in the five minute version of that how fast they do it is so it makes me when I see how they do it it pisses me off to note it you can just break in my shit at any time and that he's just charging me an arbitrary price because this market is kind of you know all over the place yeah well I guess they have a skill paid for that absolutely right so like what do you remember how much money it was on it fifty let's say honey 5000 just give money probably yeah but you like like you you you got an enjoyment out of saying no yeah cuz I think he yeah I think he's used to my Felix sure you well you know what you got this skill you can break into people's houses and shit I've seen people do this shit fast and I'm not having it I live on a block I they wanna block with a but I'm not in a suburban area my block in uh in Brooklyn in Williamsburg I got one of the most lit blocks to do yes like four bars just on my very blood although I got time to kill went down to my local and uh play some skee-ball hung out hmm yeah why not how much did you offered to take off I don't remember the specifics out of negotiation but it was a very nominal amount I meant nothing yeah and he wasn't really budget and shit yeah it was just it inside it's the mind of Hannibal Burres that's how my dad was three apartments rents them out with Airbnb $700 watch big spend no car no car won't pay for a locksmith hmm will pay for a locksmith well he'll pay for a lot well but not that one not that one yeah yeah how much do you think you saved on the second locksmith much man but drink money and I had some drinks at that bar yeah 20 30 bucks hmm yeah I kicked in my door once didn't have my lock did not Mikey G will you with the family is this you know I was by myself when I was uh was pre cellphone days okay I thought front kick the shit out of that door and call the dude yeah it's like what happened that's like yeah Dan my key had to fix the door jam the whole city that little metal thing with the thing I was all bent and fucked up it's amazing how easy it is to kick open the door like when you see those dudes like banging their shoulder against the door if you got a solid front kick there's no way that door survives they just open yeah that's a pull for you door if it's a pull forward or you're fucked like you got to be able to kick through the door I'll give of a hard kick but a a push open door super easy they just opened up you know you said she was so low when you did it but the I just still have a locked image of your family with you why'd you kick the door and the kids like would I kicked open the door once on a set of Newsradio and we blamed it on the band anthrax oh it wasn't it wasn't part of a scene it was just you it was a door to the break room we were drugged and I was with a Maura Maura tyranny and she was like god I'm fucking hungry I want to get in that break room and I'm like I can get in that door and she's like how are you get in the door I go I'd have to kick it open she was you can kick open that door I go yeah and she goes do it like alright here we go Blume I just kicked the shit out of that door to ban it bent the fucking the all of the shit that like works inside the door yeah and then but it was yes it was so worth it wait is this very shady though to blame it on that band was wrong they wouldn't they were working on the set that week they were on the episode with us this day is it well I think we're on sunset Gower at the time thank stomp the hole in that door wait this big old metal door - did you used to act guys sometimes you do some scenes drunk no no this was after the episode had been done I'm so pixelated is that yeah that's them I'm the they're cool guys though I hope Pradaxa didn't call them because we did we were like who you know they were like who fucked up the door like who knows you know like probably that fucking band like probably if I would guess was that band yeah fucked up a door for like $10 in potato chips yeah I was wondering what the what the take was just not monitor some chips you know snack foods whatever's available did in a moment oh did just that be able to do that feels amazing yeah to be able to kick our door open my buddy as our gave me this tip about uh like when he goes to the movies he's orders a kid's ticket and cuz the people taking the tickets they don't look really they just look at the theater number in a movie right and what I did it the first time you two tickets we saving four bucks or whatever want some change but it felt amazing I felt like I'm a mini heist you know girl who you are this is me unreasonably cheap yeah this is why yeah let's see the movie to get set in the stage to so like when that prenup comes she understands yeah yes fine she's not gonna go I can't believe you brought a prenup yeah of course you know me I cheated the only theater right some pretend to be a kid for four bucks exactly mmm but that four bucks that said you you know sends you brain it's a great place there's a lot of women really get upset by what cheapness yo I I was actually I was out with this this girl in Atlanta and we we went to this club she was driving and we park in there parking lot it's like one of those situations where you park in a parking lot it was a dentist's office but now somebody's charging for it and so my immediate question you're like five bucks for the parking spot right but my immediate question is does he is it do they have a deal with this dentist's office or do they just charge at night for people to park in his dentists all cuz I'm like you're not the dentist why can you right come up and I was telling huh yo I told her that I was gonna say that before we got out the car like I'm gonna ask him if he's a dentists I'm not going and she's like huh and we get out you're not the dentist she was like what the fuck she's upset that you actually did it yeah and so I was really about to be like what like what's the chances of it getting towed I was really not because of it I think the cheapness was a part of it but it was genuinely I wanted to know the reality of situation right and did they explain to you know I just she was getting upset not just pay the fact that she I really upset not really upset but enough where she wasn't we didn't have the same sense of humor and frugality whereas she knows we weren't on the same wavelength as far as that interaction so she wasn't rolling with me that drives a lot of women crazy finally cheap yeah yeah it was supposed to be bold like the win that's one thing that women like I feel like when dudes make it rain right you throwing a bunch of money in the air you don't give a fuck there's something about that that like it's exciting I don't know about that strippers like that but the average woman won't like that right that's true yeah yeah yes but it's a male move like to make it rain in a strip clubs a total male move right it's a saying that you don't give a fuck about money you just chuck it up in the air I mean it's a lot behind that I haven't bald out in a strip club like that before I think the most I've spent in the night in the strip clubs maybe eight hundred something like that which in Atlanta is I spent two months in Atlanta this this summer that's pretty low you know there's some guys that go and just have ten 10 grands this rappers spend 20 grand in a strip club which is as shocking and frightening to me Atlanta's famous for that right yeah he's great strip clubs in Atlanta I was just there I was there Friday I was at the Tabernacle yeah it's a fun time man City man is it's a good night life and but you had a strip club where it says it's a spectacle you know what I mean so you just I mean it's fun but I went there a few times who's throwing money who's that uh 21 savage young stuck there on the stage maybe they did a song or something but it's just it throw money on everybody see it's just but that is a thing like the flamboyance of not worrying at all about writing it to the point where you just throw it up in the air yeah as a boxing ring that might be King of Diamonds you don't want me on paper said let it slip around yeah it's summer strip clubs they have girls boxing and King of Diamonds in Miami I went there once on a Monday they have girls boxing it's a huge strip club I don't like my strip clubs you did over well I like my strip clubs kind of like dive bars like a certain strip clubs if you walk in and you throw up a couple hundred dollars like you can kind of take over the energy of the place like all the strippers a start coming to you in a small place at a smaller place King of Diamonds that's where Rick Ross hangs out yeah Mayweather through some now you see that ki-moon diamond bezel and had a basketball court I think we talked about strip clubs last time we were here they have a basketball court in there and a barber shop in the strip club what yeah a barber shop and a basketball court why they have a basketball court cuz sometimes before you want to just get your you know endorphins going before you throw out of money I guess or maybe the strippers like to play basketball we're interesting but it's uh the music is great that's a weird strip club too because the girls were close what's going on I think this is the preamble I think this is the youtube version oh I see they're getting warmed up you want to go to Vimeo you can see the the real deal does Vimeo show nudity yeah you know what's interesting is what's the rules with twitter because I follow some porn stars yeah they they show full-on fucking uh I think that's it you could do it that's amazing sometimes I forget that I follow pornhub on Twitter and then I'll be scrolling through it it's just a gif of just some part but oh yeah what's a real problem if you leave your phone around your kids grab it when they scroll through your feed yeah throw through the whole feed I mean they go somehow animated gif files fifteen seconds to a sand deck and like whoa it's amazing they can have that on Twitter with the millions and millions and millions of bother them I mean there's worse things on Twitter our president on the plastic did you see that that woman Valerie I don't know how you say her name is Valerie plam or plume or something like that she's the CIA operative that was outed by I guess it was Dick Cheney I think it was a big deal like because he had said something or her husband had said something so Dick Cheney outed her and it like compromised her position and compromised the mission she was working on anyway she's working now on buying Twitter to kick Donald Trump off Valarie point PLA Mei do not know how she yes that was money no she's crowdfunding to buy Twitter to kick off Donald Trump she wants to buy Twitter just so they could kick trying billion-dollar Gulf she made 85 grand so far well I got news for you honey Twitter's not for sale for a billion dollars it sounds like Twitter for a billion illa that's that's nice comeback when you get out seven bills get out of here Valerie give that money to Houston fuck out of here I'll make it how much money didn't think like how much money is Twitter worth like if Twitter was gonna be for sale it had to be for sale first it would have to be like 15 billion right it's uh is the thing with Twitter from the little bit that I know is that it in comparison to the other social medias they've had trouble monetizing yeah in in the same way so like Instagram is making money Facebook obviously making money and instagrams all about if snapchat is doing what's Witter hasn't figured out how to get real reverently people use Twitter and and are active on it in live tweet events but as far as the money it hasn't been it's been lagging and understand that do you understand that that doesn't make sense to me like like Instagram has sponsored tweets with that say what are you putting up there oh the market value fifteen point seven billion for Twitter yeah yeah so why is that check things she can get it for a billion bucks she's trippin she's just trying to get attention right yeah you think she's smoke well you think just that's just pure just anger to come up with anger just anger not just to have the initial weirdo wackadoodle not gonna happen I did but to because I've had a lot of those calm down yeah what's it to go through it so yeah do a crowd funded by Twitter that's so stupid and then to actually like go onto the site and then write it up yeah put your picture up there yeah and then look at it proofread and go through all that shit and still vote yeah still crowd fun for Twitter still be on board with the idea and I post it's so stupid because there's 350 million people in this country with every single person what's my she just wants to become the largest shareholder so she can make the decision oh fuck would anybody give her that money you're giving her that money like what if you gave her a hundred grand how do you does she give you an accounting form of what she's doing with that hundred grand that's so stupid no one's gonna die I can't believe she got 85 grand that's amazing in and of itself well the final number the in the end of that number is seven which means somebody gave like two dollars or one somebody gave a weird off number I don't have much but good luck yeah who's gonna give more than five bucks let's look at the day because sometimes they show the names of people that they're gave stuff and like what they what they said and so let's just see Victoria needs let's do this now well uh the way he tweets we get this fool out of office and put him away can't cause damage five dollars look at that tweet that he made look at that tweet scroll back up Jamie to where it was before so you can see Trump's tweet look at that military solutions are now fully in place nope nope eaten space between comma and locked so typos galore locked and loaded no comma array a comma no space again should North Korea act unwisely and then double space the fuck that's about hopefully Kim jong-un will find another path exclamation point it's just it's like it's like you took some housewife from middle of nowhere and allowed her to be President I mean it's literally like the mindset of that tweet it's a just silly tweet hopefully he'll find another path I mean hopefully he's uh is are you disturbed I don't know if I'm even disturbed anymore if I'm kind of like oh if I'm Nam in a yeah in a kind of uh I don't know like domestic situation where just like yeah domestic violence oh you mean anyway yeah yeah yeah like your wife that's what he said yeah he went to Texas and and like to see the flood damage it was like yen good crowd big crowd that's what you like this way is kind of crowd what a crowd here to see me right everybody I don't think I'm disturbed I just I don't think it was I knew it'll be bad I don't think it would be this bad get this bad this quick this quick and yeah it's really it's fascinating the thing that fascinates me the most is not just him but how many people still support him how many please don't have any problem with it yeah where I I try to I can't understand it really with a they still are behind you like you behind all of this or is it just where they have a similar just are the people that are really into him are they the same type of says egomaniac or narcissus is what they can't admit wrong or they know that it's wrong but they I can't I'm locked in now they're locked in I think they're finding a way to justify whatever he does no matter what it is like I had come out bail yesterday on the podcast hmm I didn't read I don't read comments on YouTube but I did look at the thumbs up thumbs down and it's like he had as many thumbs down as thumbs up that's a super rare and I think a lot of it was cuz he was talking a lot of shit about Trump we were both were we were talking about how ridiculous this is yeah and I saw a couple of comments on Twitter people that got mad because we were talking about his response to Charlottesville and they were saying he was saying on all sides because it there was violence on all sides yeah like people showed up with torches they showed up with torches for white folks they were like we're here for white folks only we have torches like you don't you don't think that's an issue you don't think people showing up a line of crazy white supremacist with torches and the people that were opposing them the people that are opposing him yeah they fucked up too but the only reason why they were there is because there was people with torches right the whole thing was insane it's and he doesn't have the I mean he doesn't know how to handle it and also he can't say that publicly he can say hey guys I'm panicking right now no he never see that but he can't say it explicitly but he kinda says it through his axe I don't think he's healthy also too I think when you're 70 years old like you were talking about like your brain gets older you're 34 right mmm I'm 50 now my brains getting older for sure what's it gonna be like in 20 to 23 years what does he took thirst 71 72 something like that what's that gonna be like not good I don't think you should be working all day yeah dude he's too old and he's uh he's a crazy person and he used to host The Apprentice and he was on a Comedy Central Roast amongst other things not to say that those things mean you can't be solid and uh being president but this guy you say you still watch this five hours of TV a day who reported that Reuters writers their budgets fake news how could anybody have time to watch five hours of TV a day if you have a real job wasn't brand new article but Trump's obsession is a first look at that hair hilarious look at that they can just take a photo of his hair only and black everything out that is a the most bizarre image of a president that crazy helmet of hair yeah got mix it up your photo editor it's a good move actually cuz I mean no president has consumed as much hold on no president's confused as much television of the current one or reacted as quickly or directly to what they're seeing he loves Fox & Friends 6:24 a.m. Monday Trump gushed over Twitter about the amazing reporting in quotes on the morning talk show a week earlier he instructed the nation to in parenthesis in quotes watch Fox and Friends now for their exemplary Russia coverage exemplarily Laurie exemplary Russia coverage he tweeted about the program hosted by Steve Dewey dokie duty hi sad juicy dookie dookie like poo Ainsley what are these peoples names Ainsley Earnhardt and Brian Kilmeade seven times in March alone and recently brought up brought it up in an interview with Fox News Tucker Carlson telling him cheerfully I liked that group of three people even after becoming president Trump reportedly manages to fill his days with plenty of television in quotes and from his tweets it's often possible discern when and what he's watching in January Axios broke down the president's media diet most mornings Trump flicks on the TV and watches Morning Joe but he hates that guy now not anymore now he hates that guy who talks shit about his wife's plastic surgery often for long periods of time sometimes interrupted with texts to the host or panelist he texts them after the 6 a.m. hour of Joe he's often onto Fox and Friends Wow a little CNN before or after just to fucking get the blood pressure up he also catches the sunday show especially Meet the Press the shows as he calls them often provoke his tweets the day of our interview with him all of his tweet topics were discussed and discussed during the first two hours of Morning Joe Wow five hours of television every day yes I got five a day but too much and although he is weird that the president is easily Bay table on Twitter more so didn't me Stephen Colbert got him and then Colbert said you know mr. president as much as I think you're terrible to be the president I thought the very least you understood show business good you responded to me that means I won I got you yeah yes that was when he called when he called Trump's mouth a cock holster for Putin oh it has a great joke it was a great joke but it's crazy like seeing that on a late-night talk show a late-night talk show on CBS the hosts calls the president's mouth a cock horribly cut I don't know what they did they probably had it yeah but you knew what it was yeah a cock cult he's saying a cock yeah you know what I'm saying but the fact that that was in the monologue that CBS is like yeah go for it I mean no other president you would never have that not in a million years feel like the the minimal amount of respect no FCC fine for Stephen Colbert's late night Donald Trump cock holster crack Wow yeah they bleeped it so does Trump trying to go after it for the FCC do you remember when uh the FCC went after Howard Stern people forget about that shit he got fined and he didn't even swear he got fined hundreds of thousands of dollars shit yeah how do you think this is how you think it is and this guy you think he ends his turn you think he dies in office you think he owed ease you think he gets impeached well you think what happens what's wrong it's a good question I don't think he gets a second term but you think he makes it wrong I think he makes it to the end of the term really yeah I think it's just how long wheels on a giant disaster and it gets worse and worse and I think here's the thing that Howard Stern had a really good point about Trump he said he wants to be loved he wants people to love him this is a terrible job if you want people to love you because even the people that supported you once get in there you're trying to do this impossible job that really no one's been able to do totally people forget that Obama had like a very low approval rating to at one point in time and his presidency I think he was in the low 40s like 44% or something like that approval rating like it's not a job that anybody does well even if you're the best at it ever you still people a giant percentage of the population millions and millions of people going to fucking hate you yeah that's not I don't think that's in that guy's psyche especially if you check Twitter like that yeah you can ya can block himself from a little bit when Brock he blocks regular people when regular people not to block himself from there yes with just like by deleting it off his phone he can kind of get away from but I don't think he could take that attention away from himself no I don't think so either I just I don't think it's healthy for him especially at this late stage of his life you know yeah the 7yz taking this kind of heat because before he was president that guy whether people some people didn't like him some people loved him no big deal he was genuinely generally able to like walk around everywhere and not be hated like he go to restaurants people go oh look there's Donald Trump there's no no people were like hating them right it's kind of a douche bag maybe right yeah they might laugh I try to get selfie with them it asked him a question but now the amount of hate he experiences is probably like four or five hundred percent more more even ramped up through the roof yeah so yeah five digit weird number or something crazy unquantifiable heading towards this man with the weird air from The Apprentice yeah everybody just wants to take a free shot at them to like everywhere he goes poor bastard people are building goddamn careers off of hey they are the Trump the the presidents show on Comedy Central that's true goddamn Colbert has beat Fallon in the ratings lately because he's been ripping on him yeah well cuz I'm making that goddamn legacy off of this do being an asshole people mad at Fallon cuz found was too nice to him who's running for president the hair day I mean it was a done deal didn't you think Fallon was gonna run it no but it was that Fallon didn't kirill him he didn't it didn't like pressure him that's what people are mad at that he didn't treat him like a dangerous person okay I don't probably had no idea that he was gonna win - yeah it was jokey at that point Fowler should have played one of those weird games and then cheated fuck you yeah it's a big smile Muhsin his hair up yeah mmm very weird yeah yeah it's very weird it's just it's just so strange that that's our present it so hard to believe sometimes like sometimes I'll stare at the news and I just have to look at it for like seconds but 10-15 seconds just go okay this is real this is really this that really is the president's you know Trump have you traveled abroad yet with a mr. president yeah Italy Italy yeah sit with the fam yeah how was it it's normal nobody give a shit yes normal is you know they don't give a fuck they're doing Italy shit but you were doing so use this vacation no cells yeah okay no shows yeah I'm sure if you go somewhere I've been to Canada to do shows but I'm sure if you go and do sure have I wait a minute no I haven't the first my shirt first shows with trumpets president will be next weekend in Edmonton yeah you know I haven't I haven't been anywhere while he's actually been the president it's gonna be a trip man yeah they just kind of blame it on you like what in a few conversations I've had when I've been out of the country what what do you guys do yeah well they have a situation that's the exact opposite they have a super liberal president that was letting in any immigrants and now he's apparently cooled off on that too because you're having it yeah Trudeau also they're having issues with free speech you know people are getting fined for saying things that they're setting up these weird laws where you can get in deep shit for misgendering people not using the correct gender pronouns one of 78 different gender pronouns that people use now like they're super ultra left-wing like his cabinet and his ideas he's a real like legitimate social justice warrior president so it's interesting it's like you got both schools right right next to each other yes both of them are kind of fucked yeah yeah we we did it they did it Russia did it nobody should fuck fucking me president man nobody shouldn't be President oh oh hi take we need more we need a group of humans as a group like 12 yeah yeah yeah yeah something like that yeah and a group of intelligent people that are qualified like with like a great education excellent ethics great morals you can't have just a popularity contest to see who gets to control the nukes it's fucking crazy I hope we get bastard I hope we get past it but I don't think we're going to I think once we have things written on paper once we have like a way that we operate once we have some sort of a plan that we follow it's very difficult to get two people to shake that to have some sort of a new reasonable plan to run the country without representative government you know like senators and congressmen and people that you have to like I mean they had all that shit back when they couldn't get a hold of people I mean they had all that all that stuff was that the and I'm not saying that there shouldn't be some representatives I'm saying that the system that's in place right now was really in place right now because you had a representative every state and they had to travel to DC and they did their business then they come back their constituents well the constituents can all communicate in real time now I mean we have this unique ability now to share your opinions and even to vote online that also should be an option 100% we should be voting online I don't know about that that could be that could be easy guys I mean if dick pics on the cloud he's worried about people vote on what no that's just a dark dick played a voice play the voice all right it's not saying anything it is fake news Reuters photo shopped I just think a better system as possible it's not the best system I feel like this is like trying to patch up Windows 95 then over and over again just come up with a new fist yes couple years old comma mix it up come on mix it up but you know that's gonna take a lot of time a lot of time to do what's in the notes man we do it all right everything organically yeah I mean I'm not a you know I'm not a hammer it in type of you know more they did the morning radio type of you know that's the worst Oh so what do you want to talk about you do though still to do morning radio shows ah no I haven't Wow uh-uh no I don't even those were to call in and so Hannibal I understand that you were at a baseball game or a baseball game baseball Superboy no we got through everything except for weirdly the what uh you know congratulations on a thousand episode thanks by the way I started a podcast last year oh that's right yeah handsome rambling who is it was a high name I'm locked into it now gonna change it it's fun no it's been good do you have guests have guests on yeah way to do it we do it all over we do it like we it's me and my DJ Tony trim so we do a lot of them in Chicago but we travel and yeah it's uh we we have comedians and we have a lot of musicians on we home often you do it I do we put them out every week but we block record up just cuz uh usually traveling a lot so we just we have a theremin and we got we do make goofy songs we do that set that's uh that's Tony's crib in Chicago oh it's nice set up there yeah so we we play some songs and shit and goof off and do some interview stuff it's a fun time though it's been good nice it's kind of its kind of changed you know how I I feel like I'm uh when I talk to people I feel like a better person not because I have a podcast but I feel like I'm more in tune with what a person is saying yeah I know yeah well I am I end up accidentally interviewing people when they talk to me realize what's up but like asking good quite work I genuinely where I end up talking to people but asking you know better questions then the way from getting beyond the surface level so I think that's happened because it happened well I I feel like the same thing with me I've learned how to be a better conversationalist yeah you evolved for sure you also learn what's annoying about your speech patterns oh yeah I see a lot of years yeah that's what I say like a lot like yeah it's like there's like you know you know and like those are big ones yeah you know like and yeah yeah as I just say three years five seconds you also learn how bad like a lot of regular people are at having actual conversations a lot of people just waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk like they're barely paying attention to what you're saying yeah yeah but being a good conversationalist it's huge it's a lot of tools yeah did you did you read books and shit when you first started that you just go to it or did you did you study certain people when you as you went along or when you first started no no total trial-and-error just doing it a lot you know in a thousand episodes but we've done a thousand episodes plus another forty that were like fight companions or hot cast on a plane podcasts on a hike there's a bunch of different ones fight breakdowns how often do you listen to it or do you watch I listen to occasionally I listen to one if I think it sucks if I think I was bad or if I think the person said something like super interest like there's one the other day with Sean Carroll he's an astrophysicist and he's an expert in quantum theory and it's just shit he was saying it's so hard to grab a hold of I had to listen to it several times dan yeah but it's mostly just me asking questions and him talking's but it's just the stuff that he's saying is so intense you got to kind of listen to it over and over again with my feeble little brain just to try to like store it you know okay what is he saying there's another one there's this woman that she's on all the time Rhonda Patrick dr. Rhonda Patrick what necessity nutritional absorption and just how many nutrients affect the body that's like the big thing with her and she's she's one of smartest people I've ever talked to her she's freaky smart like like almost like an alien well you talking her and you realize how dumb you are because like you can ask her a question about something and not only can she tell you what it is she'll recite the studies that were done and what percentages the studies and this is a pulling this right out of it in between her ears right she's not no prep nope into she has notes but she rarely uses them when she comes on the podcast she'll like have something that she wants to talk about like some new study on like you know like broccoli sprouts was one that she went over the last time because she's been experimenting with broccoli sprouts and she's a clinical researcher as well so she does actual scientific research so she's one of them that I listen to like several times just to try to remember what the fuck she was saying so does she hit you up the same way I actually Joe got this broccoli sprout shit I need to get off to she's a researcher to she's always like for lack of a better word balls deep in research right and she's like sometimes she doesn't have time to do podcast she's in the middle of so many different things that she's working on actual science you know that's the interesting thing about having real scientists on is you realize like what a different world they live in absolutely I would never have a scientist on I know maybe down the line but right now I keep it to fine bull I keep it fun and with people I know it I think yeah maybe down in line as I grow at it didn't I be able to carry that kind of conversation with confidence or at least lead them into what they want to say in and ask engaging questions during it before right now keeping it rappers comedians musicians just fun right well some of my favorite podcast I do or like comedians like yourself or my friends or one thing I can tell you though looking at that image of you guys yeah this is what a mistake that we did when we first started out we did it on couches the problem with couches is you gotta like sit forward where the microphone is they're not that comfortable right I got realized after a while I see how you guys are like everybody's leaning forward look okay see like on this show you're sitting in these ergonomic office chairs yeah you're sitting back and you but you're sitting up and you can sit here for hours and hours at a time if you do three hours sitting the way Byron Powers is right there right that's just gonna hurt your back oh well we we keep about an hour and a half or so hour naps good yeah that's right when it starts at wing but like office tariffs are the way to go there's a reason what they make these things like especially these ergonomic ones yeah these are from the Ergo Depot they're called capisco for people that ask and they're um they're not a sponsor or anything this is their badass chairs and they force you to sit up straight so you can sit in these for hours and it doesn't fuck with your back solid tip jar oaken solid tip appreciate I made those mistakes I had a couch yeah an Ari Shaffir took that couch he sold it I gave it to him and he did something with I think he baited or something let everybody know is the couch look at this go on yeah I'm here that's uh we with mogh fest what is that Moke fest Moga is the company makes synthesizers so a lot of bands and you'll see they use mold products and so that there are many that we use on the podcast this is you know that there are many is the instrument that you can operate with waves like just you move your hands around it they make that uh-huh and so Tony Michaels he said oh we should go to mold fest is so I think that should be that's a good I did at their festivals in Durham so I reached out to them and they they said sure come to the festival we did a couple podcast there and then also they have a workshop where you can build your own drum synthesizer so it's a two-day workshop where you build it from they give you all the parts and you build it from scratch and you do all the soldering and so I built this jump synthesizer it may is that what you're doing there is that what's in your hand that's a yes at that point yeah I'm soldering right there so that's like a what is that what are those boards called circuit board circuit board yeah so yeah we both work zone I didn't do all the work on like but uh I did a lot of that was my first time soldering anything or doing I hadn't done actual building shit with my hands in a long time but yeah then we then when we built them all everybody built theirs and then at the end of the class linked them all together and they just and just kind of fucked around with him he just made crazy noise Wow yeah that's interesting it was fun man that seems pretty badass yeah making your own sense oh that's a cool what just off a whim just decided to go and do that well we were cuz yeah we just uh I looked it up and it was a bunch of artists that I liked there too and so just and we've reached out to them it's kind of a chill festival it's a they have some bigger artists but it's still pretty small in the way that we were able to hit them up a few weeks before and they were able to accommodate us with timeslice I said okay they were already gonna have somebody interview Flying Lotus so they had us interview him and we had a few animal collective and they were pretty just Luke it was just loosen and chill and it was easy to navigate it was a it was a fun festival yeah it was just on a whim - so do you use that thing now that's gotta be like kind of satisfying knowing that you made something I haven't used it yet because it set mine I had to get it from from New York and bring it to Chicago and start using it I used a theremin Mordo that there was fun so like what do you make music we make songs on the podcast we do instead of doing an ad read we do we do a jingle for use what we do original song for each ad so you write the songs and like with their talking points uh we do well we do the we do the song and it's kind of hooky usually just based just saying the same like we got bevel as one of our sponsors so we go pebble and he'll produce around it and then we'll do the Reed after the the song this is that there are many days talking about - oh wow leave your hands over it and that makes music the other antenna will control friends knows I know about that hand technique I usually do a full open hand that's Martha Thomas shit it's real weird that's a real weird thing but it's fun man in it so we've made some beats with that that's fascinating I never heard of this thing before yeah we really used that I mean we have in Tonio beal he'll have a drum machine we got a microphone it does like auto-tune and stuff wow it's really to cover up then we're bad interviews goof it up and make it as well don't you think like you're probably not an interviewer you just having a conversation right yeah well that's hot cats are really absolutely but I just I could talk you know what I mean but I also want to be it when I when I have a guest I want to like put them in a position to shot you know what I mean and so sometimes I'll catch myself kind of going off and I mean oh shit let me get it back to them you know what I mean well no I'll catch myself going off onto a into a long-ass story then I realized that let me just bring it back and get its uh set as guest yeah that's what I mean yeah that's fun yes I know it's a fun time as long as it's fun man that's everything do you find it like a lot of people that are coming to your shows they they listen to the podcast and it's sort of what gets you closer to them yeah it is where we get a lot of messages from about it and people say they've bought their minis because like I did not even know what if they're mini was but now I want one cuz they play it so goddamn much it is kind of a running theme on the show where the guest of a what is that thing I'm like hmm and that's a therapist so it just kind of is almost like a third host of the show where you the person finds out what it is now explain it pretty much every time it's a it's a fun time though and so tell people that's handsome Rambler this games iTunes SoundCloud the other ones was it about so yeah uh-huh what is it Google Play it's amazing how few people bring up Google Play because they're like half the people of Androids don't think isn't like him but Google Play never gets discussed and you can get Google Play on an iPhone too right but you can't get iTunes can you get iTunes on an Android phone you can't get the podcasts on Google Play on the iPhone because there's a podcast app which they don't let you but they let you use some podcast apps right I don't know does that comedy podcast app that always fears always that's different that's comedy app that's aggregating oh I see how many things they wouldn't let you just use an actual podcast app other than theirs I don't think so I could be speaking yeah it's a tough road for those Android people it's tough road people just look at you illegitimately if you green text message me yeah they get weirded out by you read that they made one they just announced it I was like ooh it looks tremendous they made an Android phone yeah it hasn't they just sort of put up a picture where you can only see like the corner and the rest of it's all like shaded a let's see if I can find it know that dude Marcus got ahold of one yeah I use all the video yeah they had some wording on the bottom that like there's gonna be some special things that you won't be able to buy if you don't buy in this window it was a whole salesman like I just went ahead and bought ahead so you're gonna switch over to Android that switch it'll just be like a second home owned gonna have a home phone it doesn't work I'll sell it and just no but it's supposed to also be a modular something or other for the new cameras they're gonna have coming out too so it'll actually be a physical tool mmm more or less just a 5-inch screen that's a tool for these these cameras that don't have any screens on yeah and those red cameras for people don't know there's a lot of television shows to get filmed with those they're like super high-end high-definition top of the food chain cameras that new phone does look dope and it's got like these crazy grips on the side of it like the side of it is not smooth it's got like finger holes like where your hand grips onto it well they had to been doing great as a camera company where they say this do phones also yeah yeah well Marcus is a video what is Marcus's last name Brownlee there's a video or Marcus is watching it he's like whoa we can't show you yeah it looks like he said he can't show you guys you can tell shit you can see my reaction to it and by the way is like the reaction is not even to the finished product will to be even better than it is now but you see how the side edges have those weird grips to it it's really kind of interesting yeah he's messing with it but you could see like when he's holding it in his hand like what it looks like is that it I think that's a different video than the one I saw maybe it's not he was on a couch yeah there it is and you see the thing it doesn't look like any other phone you've ever seen before like yeah there you go like see the sides of it it's all like it's got like ripples like finger slots yeah it's real big too huge way bigger than I feel like yeah I found now he's got big hands so you can't tell as much I got tiny hands I'd be trapped in this shit yeah which one you have a regular iPhone yeah but there's so much it's so worth it if you go online like if you go online you want to read something online it's just so much better with a big screen it's just the experience and looking at pictures and videos of fireworks and shit holographic displays interesting I'm all a little worried too that they announce something they won't be able to deliver on which happens from time to time well Jamie's just the red marketing person went from really excited so full-on hype peace until I don't know if they're gonna be able to do it you're gonna get a bunch of eggs on Twitter zero posts like fuck you young Jamie yeah there's um that Galaxy Note 8 looks insane - that's coming out real soon that's like almost out it don't still make the airplane announcements no thanks those are seven yeah they don't make it anymore pretty much everybody's gotten rid of that thing zero holdout you like I'm gonna fuck I charge it but I charge it you know I take a pot from my my stove I charge in that fucking thing catches fire put it in the fireplace you see that little video showing out people to if they're in the floods how to still charge their phones off of the 9-volt battery you know in a key yeah it looks sketchy but nine volt yeah novel battery put the in a car charger I'm on the internet too much okay so she's got a car charger and she takes the car charger and sticks on the end of a 9-volt battery like one one of the slots and then puts a key in the other slot I think you gotta touch it the circuit what if this lady's burst into flames and lost her eyelids but so you can get it electrocuted by doing this you can't read so yeah be careful because I'm a nine volt battery you can and obviously it won't be a big charge I don't think but it will charge the phone so she touches the two of them together wow that works that's crazy right that's nuts so if you're in a pinch and all you got the 9-volt battery and you need to call 911 why don't they make a battery adapter for an iPhone why don't they make a little thing where you can plug a 9-volt battery into it just go to a store buy a battery plug that fucker and and charge your phone does anybody have that how they not have that because they have those banks you know those uh power banks that you can plug your shit into have you seen that new luggage that you could ride have you seen that shit yes fucking and what is that I don't know I've retweeted it the other day that was on Mashable and I was like get the fuck out of here that thing goes 8 miles an hour you sit on a fucker and you ride around the airport with it that's uh that's legit that's one way to stunt that's one way to handle a layover just drive around the airport into you your luggage runs out of batteries but you can also use the battery charging of that the battery and use it to charge your phone like you could plug your phone into that that alone is worth it like always having battery power right there connected to your your luggage that's a lot of a lot of these luggages are doing that now look at that get the fuck out of here and that's a carry on yes what is it call the mod moto bag come on look see she's fitting her stuff in there and then she drives off we look at this you could plug into it that's what I like yeah I want to see you ride that in an airport though I'll do it be fucking you don't think I do it yeah you don't know if I do look what you could does that what was that she had a gyroscope is that real I'm getting that back up a little bit right there and then
