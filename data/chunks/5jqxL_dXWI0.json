hello freak bitches and I feel like you guys talking about slide about the chicken is hahahaha I didn't believe it at first I didn't believe it I'm like someone said explain it to people who didn't hear our other podcasts and I'll tell me on the finals well the match we're talking about and me and Joe talked about this and they made a Stewart cooper made a film on it but otávio souza it his strategy was to not be on his back stay on top and just kind of maybe get a takedown late you know cuz that's a you know that rule format or that points format in Abu Dhabi that that happens a lot of people were just wrestling Russell and Russell and he wasn't engaging and Crone is like like just like Hickson saying he's like Marcelo he's like he goes after it he's gonna go hundred percent all he wants is the submission that's grown he's a special grappler special fighter all he wants is the submission and otávio wasn't really engaging and as a father no no no not as a fan as a coach I saw his coach as the fight progress the guy's saying shuit I've in Portuguese okay man that's it that's all you want okay keep going it's perfect perfect perfect and I see a guy just running from the fight and making strategy which kind of upset me completely I mean it's nothing perfect on that in my sense and but in this strategic aspect of his his doing so I have to counter in somehow and then I start to make should try to suggest the referee he was escaping he was tried to avoid the fight because he's not positive points in the first 10 minutes but his negative point so I was hoping for a negative point with dot for this is stalling so and then I started say have free the guy start removing like you know he don't engage he's just moving back like a chicken and as the thing starts boiling I start to say hey man this guy like a chicken and the whole stage was this quiet watching the fight is just this noise gonna overwhelming everything it's like throwing a chicken inside that any for a GG to competitor first of all I mean I know you're right here but I just have to be honest everybody says you're the greatest ever you're the greatest jiu-jitsu competitor of all time so you're here the greatest jiu-jitsu representative of all time your son is competing this guy has to respect you and admire you and you're goin bak the whole crowd is listen to this mean that's a lot of pressure on that guy that had to get into his head yeah because it is going because I was suggesting the referee he needs to be punished yeah and eventually like with 90 minutes or so he get minus points and that's what's exactly what generates him to say okay now I'm honey bee honey running behind so I have to make it happen and as we talking afterwards we've grown come on said dad when I do start to talking like a chicken I felt like he won't explode I'm I don't want to make a mistake wasting the opportunity but I know he will coming so I was just ready for it so we kind of working together you know like the father and son work was perfect he shot right in and then he's already waited for boys over yeah Oh home ross ice cream so I you know weird out like most cities it's always like the south side is the bad sides like nothing Tampa really yeah so he feels good in south tampa is the best area to living really nor Tampa's where all the rednecks live that's where i grew up north tampa north tampa is that all the elevated trucks shit you got it fireworks homemade fire one more in fireworks hunting Gators hunting Gators when you were a kid oh when I went out when we I'll never forget when we went to look at our land my dad bought like a piece of land in North day and north florida tampa he was like we're gonna build on it we went out as a family to go look at it and there are these two rednecks that had chased this other redneck and his underwear up on a mound in the middle of a lake and they were shooting bb's Adam and this is your land this is our land of my day and this is our lake and I that land that that little mound I wish had a picture because it's still there be it's still there and they had chased a boy up there and his enemies in his underwear and my dad was like hey everybody cut it out that's enough than my they looked at my dad they go we caught him fair and square and I was like oh my god and this is private land it's like your land with it was a lake I was a lake they were on there in a boat so was a lake and the land it was an island that was like maybe 10 feet off the shore of where our house that's a big legs it's a pretty big lake so yeah it's not all yours the whole leg that is not all ours but uh but and then the other side of the lake was like north tampa it was lutz it's called lutz we got in the car that day and the radio stations

Florida is considered the south side of the United States for the warning folks outside of town but doesn't matter that don't matter sorry the dick of the country so when you look at like losses like that and winds does that make you play more conservatively and upcoming events or do you just have to play intelligently period and just take the losses when they come um the place where you get more conservative is your bankroll management rather than your play the play from one hand to the next is really about you have to put the magnitude of the numbers out of your head and try to make the best play each time it's on you to make a decision so are you in the moment are u Zen are you still thinking about that six hundred thousand dollars at you I'm pretty good at just getting myself into the moment on the the place where you get more conservative is you lose for a while you have less money than you did before that period started you reevaluate I have only seventy-five percent of the money I did a few months ago should I maybe sell seventy-five percent of my action in this upcoming tournament instead of fifty bras say I say uh that that that's the way in which you can get more conservative if you're going through losing stretch is playful lower state what's the biggest losing stretch of river gone through um in dollar amount and you period diamonds ah let's see i'll give you ever gone through like a couple million dollars in a weekend arm in games where I didn't where I had sold action didn't have all myself uh yeah I've lost I guess my biggest losing couple of days was on the order of 50 million hong kong dollars hong kong dollars which are bigger or less rather so only like six million euro my godson only six million u.s. dollars and personally i had a you
