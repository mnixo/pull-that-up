to one and they stopped already I'm getting on uh a lot there's a lot happening do you have a hot take on this Andy what's your hot take I get text messages from people saying you know give me the inside scoop as to what's happening and what I should do yeah and I don't have a good answer I have the same information sources that everybody else does my concern is not that we shouldn't protect people that are sick and people that are old my concern is that these decisions are being done by politicians and that they they want to do this so that they can be elected come reelection they don't want people to be upset at them for not acting and so they're making these decisions and they're not showing us exactly how they're going to get out of this like when you're shutting down Los Angeles for a month did just the staggering amount of people that are gonna be in debt and and and there's some number that we looked it up recently of the amount of people that live check to check it's crazy it's like half of America the average American the stat I saw was that they cannot absorb an expense outside of the normal over $400 right that's gone that's already gone so already most americans are fucked now just with this dip and then they're talking about extending this to April 19th I just don't I don't know if they have a plan I don't know how they're gonna buy their way out of this like what do you do how do you how do you help those folks I mean I'm the wrong person to ask about that but I would I would hope at least that the politicians I'm sure there's an aspect always if you are a politician in the back of your mind I have to conduct myself in a way where I can get reelected like everything is probably viewed through that but I would hope at least that they're viewing it through the humanity perspective and as far as the decisions that are making I don't think anybody knows what to do yeah I don't think anybody knows what to do either they feel like they have to do something so they're doing something we all need to look at edges elbow because that guy looks fucking great he does it still he's got it he's got it and there's I mean he seems Tom Hanks he says he's just kind of tired it's I I can't make heads or tails of it because if you go the longer you spend on your phone I think the more or your computer I think the more confused you'll actually become because I don't know to be honest who's telling the truth and who is not there's stories of people saying hey I tested positive for this I don't have any symptoms hey I live in Italy three people are dead in my hallway and I got sick and I don't feel that good and then you watch people walking around in zombie apocolypse suits with you know mop level 4 gear on not listening to you know how you know we're walking on the beach yesterday and you know there's there people who's huge social bubbles they don't want to be near each other mm-hmm and from what I can tell or from what I'm reading and again it's it's so heads or tails you know you basically have to be coughed on or sneezed on or touch the surface that one of these infected people have touched or close proximity and there's people on the beach walking around in hazmat suits it's awhile time it's a wild time because of that because there's no clear information and because you're seeing some people that look really healthy and then you've seen the stories that come out of Italy one thing to take into consideration with Italy is Italy has one of the oldest populations they have a lot of old people and a shit ton of smokers those two factors are huge here because this is a respiratory disease well don't they also have in comparison to the rest of the world more generations living in a single household yes with you know I would imagine is going to be you know as those generations move on you're gonna have high-risk people living with people who are lower risk but not transmitting it yes that's the real concern the real concern is you're gonna transmit it to your grandma or someone who's sick there was a guy it's it's weird how the news gives you these stories because this is a guy that was 34 years old that died and they said he just got back from Disneyland he's like fuck I thought you lived forever once you go to Disneyland this is crazy he just got back to Disneyland how like the fact that they put that he just got back from Disneyland it's all heart string-pulling stuff but then if you go deep into the story this this young man just got over testicular cancer he had bronchitis and he had asthma so there's a lot going on that hit the deck stacked against him deck stacked against him he's immune-compromised for sure because of coming off of the testicular cancer and then on top of that with asthma and bronchitis and then he gets a respiratory disease those are the people that really have to worry and I really wish there was a clearer way to help them other than shutting down everything for a month I was talking to Evan haver this morning who called out of the blue and we were having kind of a conversation about this and he brought something up that just about the you know the narrative and it's to me what's happening right now is is it's interesting from a couple of perspectives for one I've travelled into world enough and seen people living in a variety of different living conditions that right now in my opinion at least people are getting a glimpse into what it is like to live in the non-first world mmm where when maybe you mean have a grocery store but if you go there you can't get everything that you want and you can't travel all you know when you always want to you don't have the freedom of movement that you want a lot of people live their life take the virus out of the equation a lot of people live their life day to day in situations just like this or much worse so I think it should be i opening hopefully for people that there's a thin margin between you know the excess and luxury that we have in the first world and how fast that can be removed we can start stepping down that staircase mm-hmm and it shows to me you know it I I try to view the videos that you see online of people fist fighting for a toilet paper I think those are the anomaly and I try not to let the anomaly paint the norm I don't think most people are doing that but there are people that are doing that and there are people who are going in and they're hoarding and buying it's I don't think with toilet papers are getting example I can give you 15 different ways to wipe your ass without toilet paper yeah like you're gonna be okay like if do you have a garden hose I mean we can start there I'm not saying it's the most sanitary pub yeah I think I've wiped my ass with a handful gravel one time because that's all that I had I'm not recommending it but I'm just you know really oh for sure cool it was wasn't like close to yeah Wayne why not I I mean I have had many mega cleaner I didn't really check I didn't have too much time but I've had many days where I started with two socks and ended with one I've had t-shirts that became tank tops I mean there's options that you have none of these I'm recommending for anybody but what I'm saying is the toilet paper is not gonna make the difference between life or there's a weird one the Horde it's a weird one that people are freaking out about oh because we're scared food well but they're scared and I find that when people get scared like we were talking about right before we went on when people get drunk a couple of the layers of they're protective like this is who I want to portray myself it starts to strip away and what I see are people who are super concerned about me and far less concerned about we and the conversation I was having with Devin was you know it'd be great if we were talking about you know the people who are gonna get crushed and I'm not a you know an economic expert by any stretch but are the ones you already talked about her living paycheck to paycheck how about the elderly who are in the high-risk category that are on Social Security fixed income and they can't even go out right now because they don't feel comfortable we're getting groceries that people are gonna get destroyed and I would love to have a conversation about a social construct or relationship that we have where we start talking about you know what are we gonna do to get food and aid to these people what are we gonna do to come together and help everybody out instead of assholes and Target hoarding toilet paper yeah and it's to me a lot of that is driven by fear and a lot of is driven by panic and believe me I'm not an expert at all probably on anything in my life but one thing that I have some experience in is surviving and thriving in high-risk situations that are high-stress which is kind of what's going on right now it's a different type of stress and the most dangerous thing you can do is lose control your emotions or let your emotions take over your decision-making cycle which is what I see people doing and it's it's so dangerous and I think we need to start finding ways to back away from that and start talking about the we greater than me I don't think there's a toilet paper shortage there's a shortage of people with common sense who are buying too much toilet paper which is freaking other people out so they're buying too much stuff which they don't actually need which is freaking up you know what I mean it's just a cascading effect yeah it's a fear cascade you know it's not good it's not good it's also this is the first time we've as a nation have been tested like this with it with a crisis where the country had shut down we have any experience in it so we don't know what to expect what I hope is it it gives me a little bit of flashes is the right after 9/11 because we have had times where the country shut down but it was very very brief mm-hmm but I remember like the Solidarity after 9/11 and was all about we and not about me and I hope that it trends that direction because who knows when this is gonna end I mean my kids are out of school I think for the year yeah I think mine as well and you know what if you're a single parent yeah and you have to work right and what if your kids are getting two of their three meals per day yeah that's cool and and I you know the school system in Montana where I live is already you know they're actually doing a really good job come to these locations you can get free meals but that's assuming the kid has a way to get there because well Montana's scalable right there's a million people in the entire state the state's the fucking massive it's not out of control California is 40 million fucking people and it's one spot it's so preposterous yeah and there's so much poverty there's so many people that are we're barely hanging on as it is and now they're off the cliff and they don't know what to do and there's no real protection set in place now to keep them from being evicted I don't believe you know I know unscrupulous landlords people have been looking for a reason to get rid of the first place fuck man who knows who know who knows what's gonna go on it's real confusing it's real confusing and have you seen the stats like the here I'm gonna show this to you Jamie maybe we could put this up on the on the screen because it's kind of it's it's it's really kind of crazy that this is the choice that they've made to shut everything down um I'm supposed to right now well you know it's funny right they made that choice last night so we got we got here Thursday so a day before they made that decision and the decision was made last night and went into effect and exactly the same amount of people are still out yeah exactly the same amount I mean there's no real law I mean it's more of a recommendation than anything but they do have to close businesses well I think they're hoping that people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we yeah over me but I just you see people not doing that they're pressed yeah and that and that gets rough so here's the numbers right the hospitalizations intensive care unit admission case by case fatality percentages reported for kovat nineteen by eighteen Cova nineteen by age group so this is up until March 16th was just a couple days ago so 0 to 19 there's a hundred twenty three cases one point six to two point five or hospitalized 0 ICU zero fatality so then you get twenty to forty four that's you seven hundred and five cases fourteen point three to 20.8 hospitalizations to two for ICU and 0.1 to 0.25 now you got to think those people have pre-existing conditions just looking at those numbers 45 to 54 that's my age group 429 cases less for some weird reason 21 to 28 hospitalization five point four to ten point for ICU one point four to two point six fatality again you gotta think those people have pre-existing conditions and it gets all the way up to really old let's go to 85 Plus as Callens age that's Callens age yeah hundred and forty for a hospital 144 cases 31 out of 144 to 70 hospitals they so 31.3 to 70.3 hospitalization six to twenty nine ICU fatalities ten to twenty seven so the vast majority of fatalities you look at in people between 75 and 84 which is four point three to ten point five and then 85 Plus which is ten point four to twenty seven point three so it's it's really obviously not good for really old people it looks like you got a 25% fatality rate at the worst case scenario for hospitalized people that have the case but again for young healthy people it's not what it's being it's not it's not the big monster that everybody thinks it is I mean there's people running around terrified that are young and healthy well then there's no concern is older so there's other spectrum too there's the young people running around terrified and healthy and then there's the people who are mobbing beaches in Florida on Spring Break saying our future leaders fuck it ah they'll be gone by the time there are the future leaders but yeah hilarious but and you have to assume though that those numbers are completely inaccurate but I would imagine the number because of the lack of testing but there's percentages are probably still the same mm-hmm you know I think there's probably just bigger numbers yeah it's uh well kids are just gonna be kids man you get 18 year olds on the beach in Florida they're there to fuck they're not worried about catching the co vid 19 they don't even know what the fuck that is their brains aren't even formed yet yes my 9 year old says they have mushy brains I was trying to explain to the 9 year old what uh the the development of the frontal lobe is and I'm like you know because we were just talking about I talked to my kids like they're kids but I also talk to them like they're adults I did the same in that I lay things out and then I explained so I lay things out like I'd laid to an adult and then I'm like your frontal lobe is a part of your brain that makes the decisions and it's not fully developed here 25 years old and so you see the little 9 year old brain spinning I go it's not not really ready yet she says she was just like so it's like squishy brain I go exactly sir nine-year-old ocular I like this is how she explained to my wife and then her and I had this little conversation about squishy brain and I'm like this is this is what the frontal lobe is this is like when you see people that are young they're doing stupid things it's not even necessarily that they're stupid it's is they they're just acting that is they're wild you know they're they're free their parents probably tell them what to do too much the school tells them what to do too much their job tells them what to do too much and then they're out and they have a couple fuckin Miller High Life say no and they're like by the way have you seen the coronavirus song yet I see posters I see it i watch it again I have you seen Jamie roll it let's we can't play it no really think so you need to respect other promote intellectual property how I work wouldn't help them how it works what it means is that on Spotify or even do they have a label they definitely could I think they're comics they could go on and take the video down no no we're trying to help you guys sorry go to my Instagram I was just gonna say this probably is where I saw it yeah I might have washed it fiber yeah the ten times if you want me to no that's okay you're right but the gentleman who who made it these guys admit one of the one of them reached out to me and I fucked up it's Reggie baby be EE to and then there's a fucking Reggie baby EE to underscore that's a fake account those cunts and so I accidentally tagged the fake account it's gonna say that's how mistakes happen but now I got the real tip well it's just some fucking hoax or who's pretended to be him but the fake one is the one that has the underscore after the two those pieces of shit that's the real dude Reggie baby I mean how's your wife think about what's going on she's not concerned about us she's concerned about her mom you know which we should be and I'm concerned about my parents as well yeah you know and more concerned that people are freaking out and that you know there's a lot of people around us that have never been tested and they're not good under stress and this is a this is a very unusual stress because there's no clear answer not from the president not from the doctors it's not no one has a real clear answer of how to fix this when it's going to be fixed yeah and when you hear things about like a vaccine will be available in 18 months like what well and if you continue reading that says if it is available in 18 months that would be three times faster than normal Wow so it that would be on the very front leading edge of what would be possible to get in people's hands normal would be 3x that in osterholm the guy who was on the podcast that really sparked a lot of people to take this very seriously excellent podcast by the way yeah he's amazing and he said that they could have had a corona virus vaccine that once SARS happened SARS which is also a corona virus they could have worked on developing a corona virus vaccine then and that we are far too flippant about how we approach these things and if it's not there right in our face they don't allocate resources towards those kind of things I think our society is kind of defined by its excess and luxury and when you live in that environment and I'm not saying it negatively at all but if you live in that environment if you never leave that environment if you don't bend yourself before the world bends you a little bit shits gonna come off the rails when you get pressed yeah and that's where the behavior of people scares me far more than the actual virus itself I mean I have no control over if I get the virus in how that plays itself out for me I cannot control that but I can control my behavior and how I act and try to exude calm like when it comes to my kids or my family my friends my social circle but yeah I wish I wit I hope that people on the other side of this because it's not gonna be the end of the world but I hope on the other side it gives them an a greater understanding and appreciation and perspective of what we have how lucky we are and then just maybe to think about you know the people what's the obesity rate in the u.s. right now forty percent yeah how about we work on that just a touch considering that's one of the highest risk factors right instead of allowing that excess and you know luxury to define you yeah how about that's something you can control what all times yeah you can't control whether or not you have a disease or whether or not you're old but you certainly can control whether or not you're fat the problem is people in my experience spend a lot of time energy and effort focusing on things that they cannot control and that is definitely one thing that I learned from my old job is that at some point you have to surrender the emotional and mental horsepower on the things that you can't control and only focus on the things that you can which is specifically yourself like you can't control what happens to you but you can control how you receive what happens to you and being scared allowing that to make the decision-making process for you is what gets people in substantial trouble like I'll give you an example for my old job getting shot at is not awesome it's actually it can be quite terrifying and the number one rule of a firefight if you get into a gunfight is to win but the first thing you need to do is you need to shoot back with overwhelming fire superiority and then you have to maneuver right you have to pin your enemy in place and then you have to maneuver but let's say they you get ambushed and you're on the receiving end of that and so you take a knee behind the wall and bullets are snapping your head and you don't want to move because you're scared and you think I'm gonna die so you have fear of death which is totally real and it can paralyze people and instead of moving you sit there and other people maneuver around you that fear of death preventing you from doing the things that you had control over shooting back maneuvering coordinating with your team that fear paralyzes you and external circumstances are the enemy that you're fighting will maneuver around you and then they're gonna end up killing you but the reason you didn't move is you allowed that emotion to take over your decision-making process you have to detach the two chocolate talks about it a lot and it's just reinforced constantly in training in in operations overseas and that be like that's because people ask me what should I do and my biggest thing is just try to remain as objective as possible you see people freaking out that doesn't mean that you need to freak out and you know another way I've had it described to me that made a big influence on me and the way I think about things if you think about two circles like an archery target but there's only two circles there's a the bowl the ten ring which is super small and then damn it doubly where you want to need you what's the big ring the one on the outside yeah like five yes so it goes ten nine eight out whatever the lowest-scoring ring is that would be the other once you get two circles and the big circle is your circle of concern and the small circle is your circle of influence I see and the dangerous thing that I see often is people spending all their time with their energy and effort on the circle of concern what's going on in the stock market what's going on on Fox News what's going on on CNN sharing back and forth things on Facebook that I probably am half am aren't even true anyway no research put into it is there gonna be enough toilet paper what do I do about this they don't have control over any of those things but that's the stuff that they're worried about yeah and the only thing that you should spend your time energy and effort working on are the things directly inside of your circle of influence and even inside of that one there could be the circle of control and what do you have control over at all times the things that come out of your mouth how you behave whether or not you allow your emotions to override your decision-making process the way that you communicate whether or not you decide to work out as opposed to four thousand excess calories in your face every single day if you focus on those things and put your time energy and effort in there you're gonna get through stressful situations just fine because you actually have more mental capacity because you're trimming off other things you can't control mmm the thing about things you can't control those some people or theirs they're thinking that this is one of those things that if you were a paranoid person and you prepped and worried about the future you would have already stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this whereas people that were just concentrating on day to day life didn't act didn't think it's probably got kaalia balance in my tween I mean is it reasonable for everybody to have five years of food at their house I don't think so I mean that's basically military MREs and I hope you enjoy taking a shit every two weeks you know those things man you will shit the clay man those Mountain ops oh my god the last time I ate Mountain ops when I went on a hunt the farts that were coming out of my body were some of the worst smells I I didn't know I could produce and I I know that they taste good they do taste good and I know it's it's good to have you know freeze-dried or dehydrated meals you can cut it's very lightweight you can pack them out really easy but Jesus Christ what is happening internally I sent I lived ninety days one time purely on military MREs which stands for meal ready-to-eat it was the initial invasion of Iraq and that's all we had and so there's a couple versions but there's a cold-weather version and when I was in at least he came in a white bag it was for alpine cold-weather operations so it had more calories and it had more tasty things in there and we had our hands on those but you know there's some good ones like beef stew was my favorite I think it was meal number eight and then there's some terrible ones we called it like five fingers of death it was hot dogs and I don't know when or where these fucking things were made but I mean your bulletproof vest could barely contain it if you were to thread this is like eating a cylinder of titanium they were disgusting and I don't I can't recognize the meat source oh and at first it was like okay I could eat the main meal and then my appetite started going and then this oh there's crackers that come with it so I could eat those because they come with like jelly or peanut butter or jam and there's actually a full economic system inside of the military trading that shit like you can stock up on peanut butters and get strawberry jam oh and there's some pound cakes that are good the Lemon Poppyseed pound cake is the best I don't care what anybody says and the longer it went the less I could eat and by the end of it I was just eating skittles it was all I could do and then we get this care package right before we left Baghdad and it was like a pallet of Girl Scout cookies and like the entire unit I mean not everybody did this but basically we were ineffective for 48 hours because guys stomachs were so destroyed from eating all of the MREs and you'd see guys just take a sleeve of Thin Mints and just bang and then it came a coffee - oh God and so guys you're just laying on there because we were staying you know you'd think it's like this high-speed sexy stuff we were staying in cots in a totally gunned out airplane hangar at Baghdad and there was pigeons flying over us and we would shoot him and they would spiral into people's beds and we would celebrate and guys are just laying in their racks just like just shut down mario's well fuck you oh god they're so calorically dense like you need to be drinking like eight gallons of water a day and you're still gonna be like I haven't gone to the bathroom in four days I think I might die yeah I always wondered I mean I I was eating a can of sardines the other day I was like how can you keep fish fresh and a fucking tin is the idea that there's no air in there is that all it is don't they cook it and put it in there right at the end of the cooking process I guess but then like how is it in there what the fuck's going on how is it okay I don't know weird but sardines are disgusting so I don't like them see that's in my circle of concern I like I'm sorry Dean's and oysters do you have smoked oysters in a can no it sounds delicious I like them the latest addition to my diet is I started buying diced clams and adding it to clam chowder that's about as controversial as I get with my I have a straight meat and potatoes guy one of those fellas I am NOT exploratory with my food at all well you eat a lot of wild game right well yeah but that that's awesome I have a lot of elk and a lot of deer um but I don't you know I don't need to go into the world some people that's exploratory well I've stuck with it now for a few years I would say I'll put like this if I go to a foreign country I'm looking for something that I recognize I'm not interested in sampling the local cuisine I've had some bad experiences is that why you're gun-shy like if we go to Thailand Thailand so I've been to Thailand a bunch and I love their cow pot guide the chicken fried rice the shit out of that that's it but I'm not touching a balut yabba loots ruff we served that on fear factor my Filipino friends were laughing they were like dude that's a delicacy like we love balut eat that little that's disgusting so we were there apparently it's delicious as a new guy and they're like here's balut so you will eat these because we're hazing you and it's like awesome Oh Hayes you they give you a delicacy I don't think a fermented rotten egg change your mindset is it fermented balut Menton oh yeah they bury those things is that the same thing because there's the hundred-year-old egg there's 100 year old but these are definitely buried fermented like when you're peeling off egg it's purple Oh see that's weird because the balut that we serve was not like that maybe there's different ways to serve it because the the purple stuff is that's that hundred-year-old egg stuff maybe there's like fermented balut and then regular balut I just started throwing up before I put it in my mouth just disgusting and of course we weren't sober either so the eggs that we serve people on fear factor we were serving them a hundred-year-old egg that was the other thing that we served they're not really a hundred-year-old egg it's just an expression but it's a that is the I think the idea is that they cook them and then they bury them in the ground or something like that and the gelatinous outer area that used to be the white of the egg is like this black jelly it's like black jelly yeah so we should put that in our mouth that sounds great but see Chinese people love it they think there's a lot of people that actually enjoy it apparently the most disgusting food this is coming from the late great Anthony Bourdain that he ever tried was fermented shark from Iceland he said there are no words to describe the the putrid disgusting smell and taste he's like he couldn't imagine that people would ever acquire a taste for this and it's a fermented shark and he said I don't remember what the history of eating those things are I mean it must have come from some time of great famine or this is the the only thing they had I've had shark before not sure not fermented Mako I enjoyed shark when I was wrong actually yeah what the fuck happened we're not supposed to kill sharks like now if you catch a shark people think you're a monster so it's like shooting a baby deer I'm not a fan of the man in the gray wetsuit I've spent enough time in the water I don't I just know let's stay away I'm not a fan either and I watched that movie the other day with my family the what is the the new 47 meters down or something like that well I don't know that there's the sharknado there's the that one's ridiculous yeah this one is more like a shark this one less ridiculous yes it's a bunch of hot girls in bikinis that cave diving and they find blind sharks that live deep in the caves and then they they get a spoiler or people get fucked up here's an idea don't go cave diving let's just stay out of the water diving yeah I'm not a fan of the water anymore at all anymore were you ever a fan I mean I grew up in Santa Cruz that we surfer doing junior lifeguards I mean I surfed I wouldn't call myself a surfer I could like stand up and fall over on a board right it's like have you gone fishing twice you're not a fisherman no I'm but I grew up on the beach and my summers and did junior lifeguards and then you go get tortured with water and spend an immense amount of time in water and like I'm completely good I don't want to ever go in here voluntarily again good call yeah yeah waters weird it's like I enjoy the fact that it's real I like the fact that there's like there's an alternative world that's connected to us I have snorkeled several times and I enjoyed it for brief periods of time but I'm always very relieved when I get out of the water deep as the water ice imagine snorkeling in like three to four feet of water now where is probably 12 12 15 not that not that deep though I was with Dudley and yeah yeah we're in lanai we went snorkeling it's fun it's kind of cool you see some turtles and shit and some fish not that many fish that's what was kind of weird you know you like you would think cause a whole world down there I'm sorry yeah but why would the fuck they would be by the people why would these fish be hanging around where all these assholes are peeing and I get it you know yeah the ocean is another one - you got to surrender a little bit yeah I mean you got no control over that sucker and you can try to control it I've watched people try to control and they just get they get crushed yet if you see something you know see something underwater like you're basically it's mercy it's like if you were an alligator it gets better than that yeah so imagine doing dives in water that has you know the phosphorescence so when things move through it it it'll light those yeah and you're always with the dive buddy and we'll do a lot of closed-circuit diving so you're rebreathing oxygen you purge your body of the what is it carbon dioxide and you have a chemical scrubber that scrubs out the carbon dioxide so it goes in one side and it goes through this loop so there's no bubbles you can stand to water for a long time I think you talked to Trevor about it but yeah this stuff he was diving so you're what the dive buddy and will do or they will still do now like long distance underwater navigation and you would think there's some high speed computer you have a depth gauge a stopwatch and a compass and that's your entertainment for the sometimes four hours that you're underwater mind you only one of the two people is holding this the other person has zero entertainment for that time period because you're just along for the ride as the buddy so you're holding on to their elbow to pinch them to make sure you're still there but most of the time but if you're the driver the person navigating your buddy will stay on one side of you and you know that you're there cuz they'll check in every once in a while and squeeze your elbow and I had on more than one occasion diving in the dark weird noises under there because with a rebreather you know you don't have the as you exhale so you can hear the crackling and the eating and boats come over your head it sounds like you're gonna die at any time and perhaps I have an overactive imagination I'm just you know I've watched jaws too many times so I'm sitting there trying to navigate and then just thinking like oh my God we're gonna get eaten by a shark but my buddy is on my right-hand side and you'll get slammed by something on your left and you'll just see it go off in the phosphorescence the question is do you look or do you just keep your head down and keep going what do you do I just kept my head down and kept going because you can't do anything I couldn't do anything and if I had looked and I've hit him in a shark I would have probably killed myself just doing a nuclear submarine porpoise hanging out of the water so what do you think it was probably a sea lion or a dolphin or it could even damn near been a shark but it happened to me on more than one occasion and more and two more guys than you would think you're just under there and something bumps into you and you know it's on the opposite side of your die buddy it is not an awesome experience how many guys get lost two sharks doing that I don't know of anybody in the SEAL community who has been lost due to a shark attack that's amazing it's not amazing well I mean the stats are on your side yeah but still you would think one guy like I know guys who've been struck by lightning what your odds are lightning strike versus shark I bet it's way higher lightning strike if you're outside yeah then if you're in the water I know of them cancelling dives because there was shark activity in the area but I don't know of a single guy has actually had an interaction where they got bit wow that's pretty impressive I would imagine there would be a few losses over the years well if you think well but most of the diving I did down in San Diego you're not diving out in the ocean you're diving in the bay like you're going in shallower water you're in and around the piers and I'm not an expert on sharks bite by any stretch so I don't know I don't think that's necessarily their natural habitat I think you might be farther out there out right off of Malibu they didn't realize how many of them there were so people start flying drones so they fly these drones like a couple hundred yards off of people surfing and there's fucking great whites is swimming around you like watch the ocean will fuck you up you have no control over that it's an again so in your in that moment you're like I remember I had these conversations myself just get slammed and you see it out of the corner I it's like yeah that didn't happen let's just keep going for hours that's about the longest I've been underwater yeah exhaustion dive on a trigger in those rebreathers some people have episodes of epilepsy or of seizures when they these oxygen toxicity is an issue and then there be cuz of the chemical scrubber of course the chemical scrubber reacts negatively to water so we should put it in a container and then submerse it in the water under pressure it's held on by a hand tighten screwed oh god damn and you crazy that it works it works really really well until it doesn't and you see people do the nuclear submarine stop ripping their mouthpiece out because it's called a caustic cocktail there's a there's one-way valves in each of the hoses so the loop has to be correct and continuous so when you exhale it needs to go into the scrubber and then when you inhale it needs to come because if there was no one-way valve you know what I mean the oxygen would flow through the system without being able to recharge because if you inhale enough it'll give you another hit of pure oxygen and it can continue that cycle mm-hmm but so if the cannister will start to fill up and you can hear it too like every after every dive you will dump you maintain your own gear but you'll dump out the cannister and the chemical it'll turn at least the stuff that I was using when I was in it'll turn like a purplish color as it's the effectiveness is starting to reduce you can actually do more than one die with it as you open the container up and you make sure that the chemicals are okay and then you tilt it over and on every dive water starts coming out of it and you can hear it on dives too it'll start gurgling a little bit like as you're inhaling oh no oh it's and again you can spend time worrying about that or you can just drive on and deal with if it becomes an issue you can deal with it at that time what do you do if you've got an issue you have to get to the surface it's so when what you do you got to get fresh air you need to wash your mouth out you need to get to a higher level of care so if you are two hours into a four hour swim yep with a rebreather and you pop your head off the surface and you're gagging what do you do there's gonna be a there's always a safety ratio in those training evolutions so you're gonna have a diving supervisor well everybody's underwater you're gonna have a pretty robust network of people that are up there for safety so the dive has been planned you've probably already coordinated with you know where the nearest chamber is you've notified the chamber that you're diving so if you have a pressure related issue you know where the nearest hospital is you have a prime secondary and tertiary medical plan and I think I forget what it was but I think it was you know one dive soup per maybe four dive pairs and you dive with buoys in training so there's boats that are up top that are not only are they there to help in case an emergency would come up but you know boats don't see those little buoys because it's just a little orange buoy traveling along and at nighttime you put you know chem light glow sticks on them which nobody is looking for so boats are up there to basically push other boats away so you'll get up there and literally just you know you wave your hand and the boat will come over and they're gonna get you to a corpsman which is you know the medical personnel on the Navy side of the house and they're gonna start treating you right there but it the chemical the caustic cocktails are gnarly I mean guys will just come up projectile vomiting it doesn't happen that often but every dive you dip you dip that thing over and the water starts coming out of it oh yeah Jesus Christ it's just crazy that it does work that you can breathe underwater with no bubbles it works well works really well yeah most the time you're limited by the amount of oxygen in the cylinder not the effectiveness of the chemical scrubber itself how long is it supposed to last for who I do not know off the top of my head but you an exhaustion dive on a dragger for me you could go somewhere between three and a half to four hours Wow which is just it's mind-numbing that's crazy you could just breathe into that thing mmm it's super quiet the only noise that it makes is when you have a demand valve that kicks in it'll give you a hit of that pure oxygen that's what it sounds like and then other that's pure that's what I'm saying you can hear so much more you hear all the crustaceans down there and all the clicking you can sneak up on animals because you're not making as much noise it seems like it would be a good thing to wear if you were scuba diving or you were spearfishing rather it's limited by the depth because you take oxygen down to depth that's we're gonna get the o2 toxicity issues so on those dives we're talking 20 feet to the surface as well that's it oh won't work no unless there's awesome spearfishing in tiny feet I heard spearfishing is the shit everybody that's done it says it's amazing it's like hunting underwater I'll never be able to tell you because I'm not gonna fall in the fucking water well it's understandable you did your time dude I didn't know I was listening to your podcast I didn't know that you were involved in the rescue of Jessica Lynch that was the second target that we hit and the first invasion of my rack that's crazy it was an odd series of events the you know we went over there I had just finished the selection process for the East Coast command and they actually there are will be the best way to describe it there are multiple squadrons in side of that command all tasked with they're all have the same skill set but you need multiple so one can be on deployment while another one is training and the other one is resting you want to get into a you know a rotation cycle so at the end of selection an X number of people get partitioned off to each one of those and it takes time to get up to speed because the selection tactics and the way that you train or they're good but you get better as you were working with the guys with more experience specifically the real-world experience and so they pulled us out of selection about a month early and sent us over to augment the karzai detail in Afghanistan at the very tail end I mean nothing happened we basically you know you're a deterrent at that point and it's one of the worst missions because you can't it's very reactive security detail stuff you can't really do anything until somebody else does something so you're already behind the power curve it's my least favorite mission set I think but we came back from that and then the Intel started kicking off for Iraq and they sent us over to Saudi Arabia and we were there for probably somewhere between 7 to 10 days that's where I watched Bush give the speech no sonam Hussein has I think it was 24 hours to comply or turn himself in whatever it was and we had already taken a look at we knew before going over there that there were two or three objectives that we were gonna look at so we had already basically planned missions that we were gonna do while we were in Virginia Beach we were planning for stuff in Iraq so we continued the planning in Saudi Arabia and the number one the first target we hit was the number one chembio target in Iraq so to do that you have to get all your shit on this it's called MOPP gear mission oriented protective posture it's like a chemical chem bio suit gas mask which compounds a lot of stuff you have all your normal shit on anyway like there's guys carrying quickie saws in a hazmat suit with a gas mask on breathing through a blower on their back overworking the blower and it's amazing how close to suffocation I've actually come inside of those gas mass it's the worst feeling ever like that you're sucking so hard for air that the mask is like sting cuz you're not supposed to be physically exerting yourself while you're wearing that thing there's a it's just it's harder it's me like putting them because there's a canister on the side how much weight are you carrying around in those days it was probably bodyweight plus eighty two hundred pounds Jesus Christ and that was about average and it trimmed down after that because the actual amount of real world experience at that time was low and it drastically increased so you'd be like you know I think I need this pocket and then you wouldn't need it for a month I need to get rid of this goddamn pocket because it carries sweat and like backpack hunters same kind of thing oh yeah the gear that I wore towards the end was substantially different than the gear that I ward towards the beginning I trimmed I mean I think I probably had ten magazines on me like that first target I think the last appointment I did I would carry four four one in the gun and no pistol so things changed over time but this just for weight just for weight and for ability to move cuz then I would need less food and I would need less water and I'd actually be mobile but on this target so is a four hour helicopter right in we're sitting there we have all of our MOPP gear on but not our masks and we're doing a mid-air refuel on a c-130 so you had a forty seven double you know the big double my propeller so it'd be rotor blades on top of helicopter they're hooked up next to a c-130 in-flight refueling missile goes underneath the c-130 is like see you boys later comes out and it like the c-130 bailed when the missile flew fuck yeah I don't blame him for that either they're literally a flying fuel tank but I think they had gotten enough gas and we had to hit the tanker on the way back as well but so you're just sitting there waiting for three and a half you know three and three-quarter hours and about ten minutes out you start getting your gas masks and stuff long you get a stuff that drape and you know night-vision goggles have you ever looked through a pair yeah your field of view sucks it's terrible it's weird which is why you notice when people are actually using them they will all constantly have movement in their head because they're increasing their field of view and up and down and that's when you can orient them to a good offset to your eye now imagine putting a gas mask in between your eye and the lens of the night vision goggle oh Jesus so you're taking already a limited field of view and putting it into a soda straw so in mind you this is the first combat target I've ever been on so and you're 18 oh no this one T - no I went through how old are you me 42 I was in my at the time this was in 2003 I was 25 okay 25 but you you enlisted when you were really young seventeen junior in high school I signed the paperwork when I was in junior in high school least I didn't you still gotta graduate and then you know continue on but and I was in like the third or fourth forty-seven that went in so you finally get all your stuff on you know and you have a blower on your back so there's ways that you can help the canister if you just have the canister on your mask it's a lot like breathing through a few straws shoved in your mouth if you maintain a loan of heart rate and you're totally chill you're fine but as your heart rate goes up and your demand you know for oxygen goes up you're really limited so they have you know you can put them on your back it's a blower it's a battery-powered blower that will basically push air into the mask and it gives you I would say more buffer space it's like almost like a positive pressure and if you're not doing much it's actually really nice it's just GM and aired in your face and it works well unless you put your weapon sling over the top of that tube which is exactly what I did Oh awesome oh is great is great first experience I lost my nods on my first target ever I went back and got him but it was a fucking shit show with nods night-vision goggles so things that you need to see at night and we'll get in trouble for if you lose it was terrible so we come in number one chembio target in Iraq and we had looked at it from the perspective of like air conditioning specialists and you know from architects to what we could encounter on the ground potential threat satellite imagery of historical stuff and we get there and by the time I even got on the ground there was already a firefight going on the helicopter that I was in had 27 rounds come through the helicopter not a single person was hurt like guys are like reaching up to like scratch their ass and around would come through and dismiss everybody Jesus Christ I take that back the door gunner standing next to me got shot right in the head then about a minute out that was my first exposure to combat just over in helicopter lands and you go and by the time I got to the front door of that structure I was probably as close to be an unconscious due to asphyxiation as I often M doing getting choked out like the world it's just coming down and it instantaneously we could tell that it was a agricultural school like the intelligence was so horribly and incredibly off when it came to that so I just ripped my mask off at some point because I would have rather died from whatever horrendous disease could have been in there then suffocated and then you know we cleared through it and I knocked my night-vision goggles off with a sledgehammer I had to go back it was a shit show so we get back from that the next morning we wake up and I remember having a cup of coffee with a buddy of mine I was like hey man I don't think we're gonna get out of this if things keep going like they did last night and shortly after that a few days after that we got word that Jessica had been captured so we forward staged and went up to Nigeria and the information that we had going into the hospital is that it was a Fed I mean hotbed like 50 to 500 people was the expected amount of resistance that we could have and we can fit 27 people in helicopter so that's what we launched with in the back of our head and fortunately we didn't meet any resistance inside of the structure and it actually was kind of business as usual looking back like there was nothing exciting about that target whatsoever people in the modern day if they were to action that target now with the experience that they have that you wouldn't even register on the radar scope the amount the little or the little amount of resistance that was encountered outside it just would be another day at the office but there was a public story of that and then there was a lot of dispute about whether or not that was accurate there was a like I remember she actually cleared up a lot of it she well she was not responsible for a lot of the things that were said because she was deep into the repatriation process into I mean hurt she's fucked up this day when I met sat down I probably get to sit across the table she hadn't ever sat down and talked to somebody who was there it was when did you meet her I went out again yeah yeah it was one of the earlier episodes where she so she told her side of the story I told my side of the story and we were able to like my gaps and we sat across the table just like this and she still wears a brace she came and gave me a huge hug I mean I didn't know what to expect what happened to her physically um man I don't have the exact details but from my understanding the vast majority of her injuries came from when her Humvee wrecked I do not believe she was buckled or strapped in so she got just pounded and she was not treated well you know it's guys are gonna get the same I mean bottom line you're gonna get raped if you're a male or a female really oh yeah for sure and you captured oh yeah you're going to for sure if you're a male or female if you're a male or a female you're you're not gonna have a good go of it for sure and again I'm not an exact expert on what happened specifically with her but from my understanding she experienced that as well as all the other medical issues but when we she was in bad shape when we pulled her out of the hospital for sure but then so and I remember there were two people with us that were carrying video cameras and there was a little bit of footage that was taken from that like when she was in the hospital bed in the hospital and a lot of the rest of it was from the cameras on the helicopters and some you know the sensors overhead but the narrative from that not a word was said by anybody that was there executing that objective or from her and I think my hypothesis is you know we were a month into that war a lot of that war was based on we need to go rid this country in this dictator of their WMDs we hadn't found any from PR perspective wise it wasn't probably going as well as they wanted it to do and they wanted to have a PR victory but the stuff that was said the stuff that made the news all this stuff that got blown out of proportion none of that came from the people that were actually there it came from all those layers what was blown up cuz I'm trying to remember I remember some of the first reports they were saying that she was gonna be the first female Medal of Honor recipient that she had fought until she had her you know she expended her last round and it was finally overtaking and he talked to her and she or she never even loaded her weapon or weapons and she never said that she fought you know I mean I remember people talking about she never said any of that what do you think was doing that was that the government's PR I think people are often in a rush to talk in an educated manner about things they know nothing about hmm I mean it takes time to to understand the details of what happened she was not in a headspace to give a debrief you know she was literally being flown probably to Germany for her first round of countless surgeries and she's gonna need to spend time with a therapist and a counselor I would assume she would obviously can't speak for but they're gonna you know they're gonna want to do a robust medical treatment and that's really not the time to dive into the details of her exact actions and we left the next morning and flew into Baghdad like three days later like it was just another day on the job and you were off and running you just had it was cool because it was the first rescue of u.s. POWs since what war - and so the rescue of her was she was rescued from the hospital correct and so they had abused her and then taken her to a hospital I get a little granny on the details of what happened in between the wreck and only picked her up because there are conflicting narratives there are there are I don't know what the correct word would be stories or there are reports that they attempted to put her into an ambulance and bring her back to US forces but at that same time the Fedayeen were using ambulances as basically military fighting vehicles so they said that when they tried to do that the ambulance was shot at which makes sense if there was a a trend of people using an ambulance as a military vehicle that would make sense and they would get turned around so they might have tried to bring her back you know that hospital was being used as a fitting staging point because they're I mean they're not dumb people they understand we're not gonna likely bomb hospitals or religious structures so use them to their military advantage Wow Wow and this is your second your second real yep Wow crazy it's great that mean that story was a giant story yep in in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true versus what was the you know the publicity narrative I would say on average taking 90% of what you hear off the top 90% yeah you know it's interesting for me when I was listening to you talk with Trevor people are super fascinated by war in combat and I wish they wouldn't be because it's not fascinating it's actually really simple most often you're not out there reinventing the wheel you're doing the simplest of tactics that you can because they're almost always effective you can build complexity but you have to have a mastery of the symbol first it's not a crazy unique experience it doesn't give you any insight or special powers I mean it doesn't make you unique it's just a it's a bizarre occupation but it's not to me at least it's not fascinating and I wish other people were less fascinated by it because then they would be less likely to be taken advantage of by people who are snake oil salesmen how so I mean your stolen valor yeah and the shit that people try to pull yeah you know when it goes that route and it's enticing in a wartime environment you know the vast majority the military doesn't see combat I think 15 percent or less actually engages in direct combat but if you go to a bar and it's like huh man there's a lot of combat vets in here like every single person in the military is telling war stories mmm you know and it's and and that is to a degree I would say harmless unless you start attaching your identity to that and you start leveraging people's fascination you know Ellie this oh look at this person look what he did let's have a relationship with that person let's give this person this and then they start you know to me the biggest threat to the veteran community is Veterans themself getting so tied to an occupation instead of trying to figure out who they are they get stuck in the rear view mirror looking at what they used to do you know because it is what you used to do it's not who you are and people who can't disconnect those two things I think that they struggle and you see guys looking for handouts and then you know the more that you can create this dossier of who you are it's amazing I mean it opens doors it really does my background is 100% that two-sided knife it'll open doors and some of them I'm not qualified to walk through but they will open it because what they think were fascinated by what I used to do well it's fascinating for people because they're never gonna experience it that's good yeah I shouldn't I hope they never have to right but it's still I mean you understand why that would be compelling to DES least try to understand it or process it in your mind for someone who isn't going to experience it like for me yeah like when me when I talk to you or if I talk to Jocko or anybody that's had a lot of experience I I am fascinated and I can understand why it would be something that you would want people to not be fascinated by but for someone on the outside looking in like I wanted I want to know what that's because the only experience that we can sort of absorb is film like we could either watch Restrepo or watch you know talking about this last time I was on the only thing that and again strip 90 percent off the top yeah I'm sure they're terrible yeah it's yeah and but at the same time other than a pure documentary films are there to make money they're there to put butts in seats so I get it they're in this tug of war between entertainment and authenticity and I have a limited exposure to working in the entertainment world on the technical advising house and if there is a struggle often between entertainment and authenticity authenticity loses because it's not that fascinating it's it's slower than people think it's quieter than people think it's not the case with every single subject that they tried to capture in film probably yeah I mean it's basically everything yeah from romance to fighting to everything it's like it's a bullshit version of it I mean I think that's one of the reasons why so many people have these weird expectations of relationships they watch too many Ryan Reynolds movies and they really think that this is how it's supposed to go down the notebook these movies are really essentially what people use as a guideline for what the ideal relationship is but instead of a really good relationship that you're aware of that actually exists yeah I think people should use caution on anything that they see on a screen of any size whether it's from iPhone IMAX you just ripped 90% off the top well especially a screen where people are literally pretending yes either pretending to be at war I mean was fucking a camera guys there and actors in any cut good job okay we're gonna have to touch up the blood get him more blood let's spray some sweat on them the other talking to the VFX dude okay we'll get that uh you know where you get that explosion in the background give me an aircraft carrier go on this I mean how could you ever make that authentic is that what the what I think Trevor now we're talking about Saving Private Ryan and the storm in the beach at Normandy yeah probably the only scene ever in a movie that accurately represents what it must have been like at that time some of those some of them get it right like snippets I actually think we talked about this last time to briefly Black Hawk Down gets a little bit right you can get an understanding of like the confusion the sense of losing utter and complete control not knowing what to do next having limited information having to make decisions on limited information having to make decisions where somebody might live and others might die like you don't get snippets of that but I don't think there's any one film or TV show that captures it really accurately well it's weird to me too when there's someone who you know like Marky Mark like here's Marky Mark he's in the movie it's Mark Wahlberg whitey boy but it's Mark Albert it's not marcus luttrell yeah like I know Marcus does not Marcus yep that's Mark Wahlberg yeah but he's playing Marcus so it's like wow this is weird that's weird that's inescapably weird when there's a person who's like a super famous guy like Mark Wahlberg who's been in a fuckin million movies but he's playing someone else but you know it's Mark Wahlberg so there's this weird sort of thing you're supposed to do you know this is suspension of disbelief that you have in every movie but look it's gotta be the weirdest fucking thing ever to see someone who you know play you in a movie I think I would just skip that whole process and be like hey let me know how it goes just don't even wanna give a beat for me I'd like first nobody's ever writing a book or move about my life because again exceptionally average military career wise if they did I would say you go have fun and all that you know what I think of it I wouldn't want to be involved in that at all yeah so yeah I think that's a good call the whole the famous guy playing someone else thing is got to be so fucking strange if you're that person if you have any guess achill Lynch leads if they did a Jessica Lynch story and Scarlett Johansson played Jessica Lynch play what she'd probably what in the fuck is going on that's the it'd be a mindfuck for sure yeah yeah well that Scarlett Johansson that's on me what bitch I never said that that is not how it went down what the fuck did they do to my story authenticity versus entertainment yeah I mean that's just how it goes in every movie yeah it's just Foxcatcher it's a perfect example of that I've used that example many many times it's not about Mark and David Schultz documentary or film it's with Steve Carell and who plays that handsome fella Channing Tatum another one of them super handsome fellow he's Mark Schultz who was you know one of the greatest wrestlers America ever produced and his brother Dave Schultz is another equally impressive wrestler it's just top of the food chain world champion wrestlers and the movie just distorted everything that's twisted up everything about their career and and did they even need to know here's the one example that I always use that I'm sorry if you've heard this before but the fucking end of the film Mark Schultz in the movie has a UFC fight and in the real world he had a UFC fight against Big Daddy Goodrich Big Daddy Goodrich is a pioneer of MMA of a famous fighter in the world of fighting I mean he's he's a legend right and Mark Schultz mounted him and beat his ass he's just a top of the food chain Olympic gold medalist wrestler just took him down at will just what you would expect yeah and never a fought again because you had a wrestling contract he was coaching I believe it Brigham Young and they didn't - doing this back in the early days the fc2 was bare-knuckle the whole deal but in the movie fights a Russian guy like why why do you have him fight a Russian guy when he fought Big Daddy Goodrich I mean it's Gary Goodridge is a famous fighter who makes that call some fucking asshole because in the world you know I'm watching it I'm like that's not who he fought why did you change it why did you change him when you could have just had a guy play Big Daddy Goodrich yeah and then have been like oh that's the guy playing Big Daddy Goodrich okay at least they're not fucking me but when I see this Russian guy stand there and then Mark Schultz get to the cage to fight this Russian my way what are you doing why'd you do that why don't you change history did it ruin the movie for you everything ruin the movie for me okay so many who's ruined before then but you stuck at it well Steve Carell was excellent and and Channing Tatum was excellent too they were it was good acting in the movie but I knew that a lot of what they were portraying was not accurate you know they're making it look like Mark Schultz was like down on his luck and not doing well as a wrestler he was dominating he was a fucking stud and then at the end of it just there's so much that they just took so much licence for entertainment to twist up this real time of real world event it's a real thing that happened I mean that that guy the the fuck was his name DuPont did shoot Dave Schultz he really did shoot him and murder me really was a fucking crazy man and Steve Carell did a great job of playing that guy but they did so much Hollywood fuckery - a real story and that sucks because if people like if I watch that I wouldn't know the backstory yeah I would assume that that was to be an accurate portrayal of the history of it yes and it would change the course of at least what I thought about it yes there was a lot of weird stuff to him they made it look like they were doing coke and they insinuated some freaky sexual stuff was like there's a lot of weird why doing this but it's just this is just Hollywood man this is just what producers do you know they think they know better and they want to make something exciting and so they fuck with reality to turn it into a based on an historical event or it's done a real-world story how you just described how you feel about those type of movies is exactly how I feel about them just a different genre yeah oh I'm sure I mean but I but even more insane right because it's it's war which is in the highest stakes that anybody can I mean when you come to if you if you're involved in any very intense difficult encounter I think war is the highest stakes the highest level of all those things in terms of time and the time it takes to achieve the end state for sure no and also the results like what what what is happening well it's people trying to kill other people they're trying to kill you you're trying to kill them you're trying to achieve a result and then the consequences of failure are devastating in a drastic yeah but you know it allows you you can take those experience and do amazing positive things with them and Jocko is an example that I went to with that not everything that happens in the military applies to the civilian world you just can't take a lot of the things that the military does and apply them but some of the things you can do are the leadership lessons which shaka does I mean he's a freaking amazing at it at taking those lessons and applying them and talking about them in manners that people can adapt them hmm but not all the experiences are that way but we should I think because people are fascinated with him take what can improve society and so we don't have to relearn the lessons because you know I can't speak for Jocko obviously but the things that he learned and he talked about in his books or continues to talk about those were taught to all of us instead of military and then somebody taught the person who taught us like those have been passed along we need to spread the word a little bit farther and wider and that's what I'm saying it opens some doors and we're qualified or I'm qualified to go in that door but other doors I'm not qualified to go into hmm but if they're all open and you have your choice you know you can get yourself in trouble but I mean Jaco is one he's an example that I point to all the time if somebody who was taking those lessons that people are fascinated by and recaps elating them in terms that they can apply in their life yeah there's certain human beings like him that are their fuel like you you can go to him and it'll change your state like you could go to Jacko's Instagram page and watch one of those videos and it will enact a physical change and your state and it'll go fucking I'm going to the gym and you literally will go do something I'm getting my shit together I go the opposite I see his watch I'm gonna get the fuck out of my screen I want to start a hashtag like up at a reasonable hour I just want to fuck with it predict a week I was I would've like wake up at 4:20 and like hashtag up before jaakko people got pissed and they didn't realize they know each other like I want to write a book instead of extreme ownership it's like extremely limited the ownership there's no bad leaders only bad teams would be chapter wise just go the other direction no bad audience there's only bad comedians yeah yeah I think Jocko is it's interesting that people would get mad at you because he does have this profound effect on people know they're willing to defend him you know like but that's also you reading comments you shouldn't be reading those I sometimes I have idle time go to youtube watch a fun video cats or something YouTube comments will that's a is that the worst of the worst yeah that's the bottom of the pit because you got to realize who's leaving YouTube comments you think Michael Jordan is out there League leaving YouTube comment no was LeBron James take time between practices and leave YouTube comments probably no no it's failures for the most part it's people with time or people that are at work and fucking hate their job and they have free time where they can just leave comments and said this is the reason so many of them are toxic super judgy I mean there's reasonable comments I've actually like there's some like technology is something I'm very fascinated by and I'll go to a technology YouTube page and I'll watch like someone doing a review of say like a new Linux laptop and then I'll go into the comments there's no negativity it's all nerds just talking about different builds and you know and what with the rating system that and how they break this down and restore that and it's different it's like for them it's like this is just an area of expertise and fascination yeah and but when it comes to social things oh boy that's when things get whacked when it comes to political things that's the grossest of the gross right anything involved in Magga like justjust you're not gonna learn anything from that you can just gonna it gets a little Western in the comments for sure oh it's just mutations it's just yeah there's part of that it's like these natural systems like this too much comfort too much idle time not enough stimulation not enough adversity not enough accomplishment and access to information yes in bitterness and angry and a keyboard that works and there they go off to the races just type in fucking spew it out I'll read it every now and then not mine but I'll read other people's just to see what the fuck people are up to and it's disturbing a shit man it's crazy to me is when I see people responding in the comments to toxicity look what do you think gonna change people's mind it won't and what it actually does is let people know that you are paying attention so it increases the toxicity in my experience from what I've seen they're like oh oh hips it up he took the time to read the comment and reply game on yeah game on yes not good well it's you're dealing with a specific type of person the type of person that's willing to leave a comment on a YouTube page and it's just just overall I can't say I've never left one you've left them I have left a comment on a YouTube page from time thanks in my earlier days when you were young yeah I was like last year mean stuff for know my policy on social media is that I will not have refused to be mean I won't name call and oftentimes when people are being dicks I'll just tell them thank you like you definitely change the way that I think about this I appreciate you taking the time and effort for this well articulated thought just right yeah yeah and then they and then they twist into fuckin orbit that's true that that definitely can happen and that's the best time to walk away is after the nice thank you for your you know dickish calm so I'm twisting in the the other time twist in the wind just like so yeah it's just a weird thing man I mean there's no way obviously to engage one-on-one in a physical way with all these people that are leaving comments but if they did if you just sat down with these people and talked about it it would be a very different sort of an engagement it's just such a poor way to exchange information and I would say into your face anyway they would change the verbage that they used on face to face conversation there's they're emotionally heated again it a lot of though I put back to people letting their emotions drive their behavior and the way they communicate and detaching from that and being objective which is easier to let the emotions do it when you're angry at a keyboard to be very hard to do face to face because there's consequences to your emotional there's consequences for sure but there's also you realize what a cunt you're being have you say something really mean to someone even if you say something mean to a small girl this 100-pound girl in front of you and you say something mean and you see her so that you feel bad unless you're a sociopath you know and then you know there's issues with that as well they're out there they are out there man I know a few they I went to I went through buds with a sociopath the honor man of my buds class is still in jail for chopping people up and then disposing of their bodies with his wife really yeah who are they chopping up I don't know the people but they would bring people back from I know it happened at least once it might have happened multiple times but they would go to bars find a couple continued the after party afterwards elicit and argument some type of exchange they killed I believe was a man and a woman chopped him up he used to work at a grocery store chain so he knew that they the very cyclically removing of the garbage cans there they got you know 10 cent to the landfill more often so he disposed of the body bodies in multiple grocery store garbage dumpsters and then they eventually got caught because in the middle of the night they broke into a Hooters - still t-shirts and cut cop by the cops and I believe it was in her purse they found a Spyderco knife with like hair and like basically tissue still on the knife and I think the woman's ID whoa yeah high-level criminal they really thought this one through and that's the only way they got caught that's how they got caught and I imagine if they didn't break into Hooters yeah of course well first off why the fuck are you breaking into Hooters razor knife you dirty bitch but again so this is you know sociopaths out there and this is another thing that I try to tell people often the best people that I ever was around in my entire life was in the seal community and my mortal enemies and the worst people I've ever seen on the face of the earth was in the seal community as well he was the honor man in my buds class which if I look back it's they he had he had passed more evolutions from a statistical perspective than anybody else in the class they weren't actually viewing him through the lens of is this person honorable or does he you know they weren't grading him by his integrity but it just goes to show you that no selection process is perfect and if you can't separate an individual from an occupation or a uniform or a black belt right if you think that because you have a black belt that you're gonna be an awesome person or because somebody is a seal they're gonna be a great person stand the fuck by mmm and it's not the norm right I'm not I'm not I don't want him as the anomaly to paint the norm but it's important for people to remember that those people are out there and again they can leverage from my background they can leverage the fascination the curiosity people wanted to give back any one of those common questions that I get from people is you know how can I thank people for their service and well hey just say thank you and then on my answer them is be is you know provide them an opportunity if you feel it's necessary but don't allow them don't do anything for them and don't give them any special treatment make them earn it hmm because then you can get a true look at the individual as opposed to perhaps just a shiny object that you were focusing on before interesting so treat them as an individual thank them but treat them as an individual and judge them based on the merits of the behavior and they're worth 100 percent not merits of their background if you have a job you know you like hey I want to provide opportunities for veterans no problem provide the opportunities for veterans but treat them exactly like the person who is in the cubicle next to them if it's in that environment obviously and if you hold the person that was a non-vet turn to a certain standard you better hold the veteran to the same standard don't let them get away with anything because it doesn't help them either right you know it it helps everybody in the organization if you set the standard and make sure everybody holds it it's insidious to an organization to set a standard and well why is this guy getting special treatment like SWAT dude he was a seal gives a fuck it's just a job title and if that person is sociopathic or they are you know there's a bell-curve there's a top 10% and the and and the the top and the bottom 10% if he's in that bottom 10% by holding them to that standard you're gonna get an objective viewpoint of that as opposed to just being blinded by whatever it may be it's interesting but only you can say that or someone in your position can say that it's very difficult for someone who's a non veteran to say anything remotely close to that well I hope they listen then because they don't need to say that they just need to if they need to just live that they need to structure their organization with that framework so it's objective not subjective there isn't it's like people look at being a seal it's not a Harry Potter wand I have probably a familiarity and comfort with weapons and tactics more than your average person but if I'm being completely honest about my old job I could teach a monkey to do most of the things that I did I'm serious I could teach a monkey to do the things that we did it's not we're not out there doing nuclear physics you're out there doing you know we find an individual how are we gonna get there okay let's figure out how we're gonna get there we train to those standards we get on target everything is based on tactics and standard operating procedures or TTP's tactics techniques and procedures and everybody is trained of those standards so you know what to expect from somebody whether they're from an East Coast team or a West Coast team you can meet in the middle and we all are taught to clear rooms the same way and it's just it's it's not complicated actually the blade of make us less effective and efficient would be to make it complicated the simpler that you can make it the better you're going to be mmm that makes sense I mean it makes but it's also the mind of a seal like the type of person that can get through buds that's that's complicated that's complicated in just being able to control your mind you know one of the things that you said and one of the one of times you talked about it was someone who's able to keep their world small when you talk yeah I'm I toss an interesting way of looking at it keep your world small like so people that applies to what's happening right now - hmm so what you're talking about you know buds is a physical test you're actually I would say having gone back as an instructor which I learned much more about the process applying the curriculum as opposed to going through it because as a student you're just like ah I want this day to be over as an instructor you can con us and you also don't really know what you're gonna do the next day as a student as an instructor I can look at the entire curriculum in the story arc of where you start on day one and the product you're gonna get at the end it's a physical test but we're using the body to test the mind we're stressing the body we're gonna make you tired hungry hypothermic we're gonna get you so exhaust to the point that you're gonna hallucinate and we're gonna take a look at how you behave do you value we over me you know one of the first things they do in buds your explain the concept of this one buddy and you don't get to go anywhere farther than six feet away from another human being for that six-month time period that is the opposite of most people's mentality and you can test it early on you yell at them and you'll say hey you got 30 seconds to go run up to the ocean and get wet and in the first few days they just take off and they start running because they forgot about their swim buddy they're me centric and so you bring them back and you punish them the individual that made that choice and then also this one buddy you know to reinforce that people there are consequences to other people from your behaviors and after about two weeks you really can't separate people from their swim buddies so it's a lesson and it's at a beginning point where you can instill this philosophy of we as greater than me and it's one of the most beautiful things I think from the seal community if you talk to people or my experience has been as is in talking to people in their most dire moments where things are getting the word they're often more concerned about the people to their left and right than they are about himself my biggest fear probably I know what it was in the seal community but to this day is that I am NOT gonna be there when somebody needs me that was my biggest fear in the seal community that I wasn't gonna live up to this standard at the people to the left and right held at me and then they were gonna suffer for it I was more concerned about letting them down than myself getting hurt or killed and that starts with that ethos from seal training but it's not a complicated course we're stressing the body to stress the mind and if you look at the people who make it through so when I went back as an instructor as a student when you're going through training if somebody next to you quits you never see them again like there's no hey dude what the fuck are you doing like they're just gone and you continue on with your day because you just want to graduate the program as an instructor you can talk to those people and you can ask really important questions my favorite question is why you said you this was your lifelong goal this is all you've ever wanted to do you left a d1 scholarship to come here because you saw no for yourself no value in the higher education and you wanted to come to the seal community and you quit why time and time and time again the answer I would get from the students is they got overwhelmed so they were doing the opposite of keeping their world small because there's two ways you can look at Budds it's a hundred eighty days long I think plus or minus one or two or you could look at it as a sunrise and a sunset 180 times so you could look at a pie and go oh my god I have to eat this whole thing or you can look at a slice and eat the slice and not worry about the rest of the slices and keep doing that and doing that until the training process is complete hell week is another good example it starts Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon and you get about two hours of sleep on Wednesday that's it it's horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor because you can just totally fuck with the students cuz they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon but almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably gonna make it through because you've invested so much but the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how weak as a five-day pipeline just make it to your next meal they have to you every six hours so if I can stack six hours on six hours and six hours and just focus on getting to the next meal it doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold I am I can just get to the next meal I'll get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's that in combination with some you know the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience and my definition of resilience would be the ability to get bent and come back stronger than you were before the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible which you do all the time by running sprints or you know I mean you're doing that stuff you're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching setting and approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish in the same amount so that's really what I mean it's a physical test but we're just testing the mind can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small can you do the step that you need to do and not get overwhelmed regardless if you're tired exhausted hungry cold I mean that's really all it is mmm it's not a complex training program there's the ocean there's the beach there's some telephone poles there's some boats and then later on we introduce scuba gear and towards the tail end of it you know some demolition and pistol and rifle how many days can you stay awake for where it becomes dangerous to your health yeah I don't know it's dangerous for their health inhale weak what the students probably don't realize is there is a huge safety network for them you don't see it as a student because you're so just tasks saturated there are MDS walking around all over the place there's people constantly you know we're checking the temperature of the water will take core body temperatures on the students we're keeping a very good eye and we're buffering them because by about Wednesday they're brain-dead I don't know how long you can stay awake without suffering some severe physical consequence so they literally get two hours of sleep in the whole week you might get a little bit of break time you know there's a it's actually on the wall at the buds compound it pays to be a winner and the inverse of that is incredibly true it does not pay to be a loser in the seal community and for clarity loser is anything other than first place and the community that I came from the podium has one platform not three so if you win you might get 15 minutes off while we're hammering the shit out of the rest of the class so if you win a task if you win a task I can hell week you'll ask such as about beaucoup race is a perfect one I'm Jamie can pull up a picture its buds hell week boat crew race and there'll be students running with boats on their heads and people get bald spots from it and we'll do races like hey take that boat that's supposed to be in the ocean and you're gonna run with on your head as a crew of seven people three people on each side and the leader in the back and at the end of four miles we'll be done with this the winning boat crew will get a little break and then losing boat crews will get remediated four miles litter boat on your head yeah you know why because it's fun to paddle it in the water and you can surf it so fuck you yep yeah that look at that neck on that front right guy just but don't do short races they'll do long ones and how much that boat way well that's a good question um it looks inflatable it is it's an IBS inflatable boat small but still probably 150 200 pounds and then you gotta imagine sometimes there's water sloshing around in there sometimes it's sand in there because we do let him paddle they'll do races where they have to run go out past the surf zone flip the boat over for no reason other than it's difficult and it forces them to get wet right the boat come back in continue the race but so if you win that you might get you know 15 minutes while we're mediating the class and we know what's gonna happen in that 15 minutes you see people sleeping standing up you see people facedown on a high lick track in the sand sleeping they're sitting there sleeping and it's kind of just a reward and you just Lee Malone see what I'm sleep for 15 minutes give you a little bit yeah wake up bitch pretty much talk to work get right back on that ocean Wow five days of that yeah hmm and it's earned about people in that you learn a lot and you see people push to the point where do you care about me over week and we get rid of the people who cannot prioritize we over me mmm damn arrogance comes out you see it a lot in the the leadership as well you know the students are largely the same like from a physiological perspective ones that are faster runners and from a contractile potential like more stamina or cardio respiratory endurance but most of them are the same that's like the probably like a 3% difference between the students but these little pods of seven people some of them can work together and they're just crushing it and other ones you'll see you know there's oars in the boat so when they run they're stuffed on the top and you'll see they'll be out paddling and then you'll just see a sword fight start with people just knocking each other's heads off with oars oh fuck yeah because look I mean imagine how exhausted you are you are so exposed in raw so suppressed as a human being like from all the physical tools that we have that the real person comes out and sometimes boat crews will just eject a person able hate that person so much because they're they might be selfish or arrogant and they're not pulling their weight and they will just harp on that person or beat the shit out of a person eventually they'll end up quitting now when they do get in a sword fight what do you do do you kick them out if they get in sword fights would you let them sort it out I'm a Lim sorted out plus they're out of the water I'm not going out there [Laughter] other times you're watching it through by nose it seems like that's one of those things that once you get through and once you get through buds and once you get through how weak and once you get through all the difficult physical tasks and you actually become a seal how many people maintain that sort of Goggins jaakko level of discipline and keep training constantly and how many people do the bare minimum it's hard to say um there are people who slip what are the requirements once you once you've gone through all that shit there's very few and I can only speak from when I was in in 2013 though I left last day of June 2 2013 so if it has changed since then I don't know anything about it but you know the Navy obviously it's you're a Navy SEAL so you're governed by the United States Navy they make you do a PRT of physical readiness test which is running pull-ups push-ups sit-ups and a swim I think because we're SEALs and your wife could meet the standards my 11 year old daughter could probably meet that they're not crazy is what I'm saying so the bar if you trip over the bar at that point like you you know your hamstrings don't work or you know just you suck it but there are varying levels there are people who are very like the individuals that you're talking about and then there are others that will let it slip and they slip a percentage point over time there's some you know obese disgustingly overweight seals not many and everything in between so the hard way for me to give you like exact numbers on that I would say more guys trend towards the Jocko Goggins realm because it's a very self critiquing community in most ways it's like working inside of a piranha tank and if there's a drop of blood they're just like yes he'll eat you now mmm we're very hard on each other for sure how much how many of them are involved in martial arts again hard to say because I know it has drastically changed since I was in the amount of so I was telling before I sat down with Henner Gracie yesterday we were just talking about a lot about his interaction with law enforcement and how they got started and it was with the Rodney King rides actually I didn't know that but that's when they started interfacing with law enforcement earlier yeah he had his dad the generation for him they started sitting on a panel you know talking about I think essentially combatives with the hand on hand type stuff with the LAPD that's but that's where it started and it's grown since then when I went through I don't remember much discussion of martial arts at all there was prisoner handling or you know detaining people and cuffing them the terminating point would be to get their hands behind their back and flex-cuf them we didn't use metal handcuffs we would use tie ties you know just cuz there you can put a lot you can slide them in your gear and just easily cinch on them but I think that it has drastically changed since I have been in and I think a lot of that that was driven by individuals I mean I'm sure you see it I mean I feel so stupid being late to the game to jujitsu and I know that it is definitely I want to say invading all of those communities might be a good term infecting it's just it's there's a groundswell from guys who are learning on their own so it's increasing but it was not prevalent when I was in unless you were an individual practitioner doing it on your own or had a buddy that would deal with you really that's interesting I would have assumed that it would have been a core part of training like from the beginning just to build character and to understand what happens if you do lose your gun or if you do are in a situation where you don't have a weapon well there's not a lot of situations in real life that you can point back to from my community where that has happened and quite frankly ego gets into the way and you'll hear guys say things like well why do I need to bro I don't need to go hands-on with anybody this is all I got right here right and that's purely just ego and what ends up happening is is in I was talking about the hen about this yesterday and I have a much better understanding of it now you can elicit actions from people if you don't know what you're doing if you do have to go hands-on and you're trying to detain somebody but you're asking about how much I weighed right how much gear I had so I'm usually would float somewhere between 205 to 215 when I was in so add 80 to 90 pounds on top of that and now I'm kneeling on your back alright and but I don't understand weight distribution I don't understand leverage I don't understand the way that the joints move that well and you're trying to comply but I'm applying so much weight to you that it's forcing you towards a fight or flight situation and you can you can increase the deadly deadliness of these situations unintentionally and get yourself into a position where you might have to take somebody's life but they didn't deserve it it was actually your fault because you drove them to that point because you were not judicious judiciously applying the pressure that you needed to well you see that with police when you watch videos cops trying to detain suspects and then they lose control situation and it's purely because they don't have an understanding of how to control person they run out of tools I have a ton of empathy for law enforcement if you're out on the streets and you have verbal commands and then a Taser and maybe a pepper sprays and there's somewhere I don't even know if they still use that but then your next resource is a gun and you rapidly go through all those off I understand how those situations occur and I'm not trying to justify them in any way whatsoever but I understand what happens when you reach the limits of your tools and you're left with what you think is a life-threatening situation hannah has some great videos of breaking down what goes wrong with police when they're trying to detain someone it's often times two and three on one and they wind up getting killed there's there's videos of guys having a suspect on the ground and a suspect there's not trained in martial arts yeah but unfortunately the cops aren't either and they're doing these stupid things and hitting this person and trying to control them and then the guy gets out gets to his car pulls out a gun and kills them and I've watched a video like that recently so the guy who got me into jujitsu was a sheriff and I actually just the only reason I started this because I wanted him to shut up I had known him for like a year like cousin and for me it's like the harder you push that I mean I'm like I'm not doing it ever I don't care oh you like carrot cake I'm never having a piece of carrot cake I will not have a piece so we're at my house drunk downstairs at the bar and he was like you know we were standing there drinking he tried to put me like a standing head in our I'm trying like this is how I would choke he was like if you start right now you'll never tap me he was a four stripe white belt at the time got his blue belt shortly after oh that's hilarious if you start right now you'll never tap me so he claims he didn't say this he said it so I went to a class like the next day and and fell in love with it and he got pulled into and started you Jitsu because a buddy of his got into damn year life-or-death fight where I live up in Kalispell Sheriff's Department doesn't have that many people on shift and a response time of 20 to 30 minutes is impossible for sure so this guy goes out he's in the fight for his life and like two feet of snow in the wintertime oh Jesus and I think one of the first things that happened is his radio got ripped off that's a fucking problem right if you need to call for backup but fortunately they have procedures like I guess if you check in and then for a certain period of time like you don't people start moving their car on the right direction start coming to you if you don't check in a longer period of time you know the lights and sirens come on so other people came he was okay and he just got his brown belt not too long he's a savage what so what happened to him uh obviously I wasn't there but it was he pulled somebody over for a particular reason I don't know what it was and this is an interesting thing too that I've come to understand better developing friendships with law enforcement you know they they come up to a car and they're just there doing a stop and it's another touch point for their day but somebody in a car might be in the back they're mine thinking oh my god like I have a misdemeanor or a felony I might be going to prison for the rest of my life so two very different head spaces as they converge in this instance I believe there's a pistol that was in between the driver's seat in the little center console the individual went for it it's somehow they came out of the car and it just became a scuffle at that point and they fought until other cops arrived and basically dog piled on the person and ended it and it was over I believe they were at that for like 10 to 15 minutes geez and for people who don't understand how hard it is to go that hard for 10 or 15 minutes I mean fuck well if they weren't in shape and that guy was that would have been death so he found jiu-jitsu he just got his brown belt he's awesome but he started my buddy who made that comment and then I have started they'll do defensive tactics stuff I've helped him out twice where I'll just go and I'll be a role player I'll just you know lay there on the ground and put my hands underneath my chest and they have to try to cuff me and it's an eye-opening experience I mean I've been at this for 18 months I'll be the first to tell you I don't know shit I'm at the point now where I'm starting to realize how little I actually know a blue belt now correct yeah um and it's it's like a foreign language like I can kind of see a little bit of the alphabet but don't even think for a second that I'm trying to put together words yet let alone sentences and so I'll go and you know I did I was a role player for two of those and it was interesting I saw some of the same stuff where you can elicit responses for people like I was I was resisting but not a crazy amount and then the amount of pressure that they started to like applying to me grabbing fingers and pulling my fingers back it it almost to me I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would so they're without that skill or without that tool in their tool belt you run out of options and it's they mean they have a dangerous job very at it as it is and so after doing that defensive tactics it's actually why I created this shirt I was that shirt as straight blast Jim said International SPG is where I trained well I was founded by Matt Thornton and my coach was Travis Davison he was here as well that's the same SPG as in Carlin yeah one of the coaches but so where did it start Matt Thornton started it he got his black belt from Chris Houser okay Chris no doesn't Machado guy correct yeah so when he can Machado I believe powder Matt and then Mike coach Travis who you met the last time I was on is the owner of the SPG's but you talk to these guys and we you know we do this session and you can see that their eyes are kind of wide like what the fuck just happened and the next thing I want to know is about cost and Travis has an awesome job and I think it's SPG why they will give a discount for law enforcement but I feel like it's so important for them and I want them to be better at doing their job for my family so I just made this shirt and every penny that goes from the sale of a shirt I'm gonna start doing scholarships not all the way for the guys because they need to have some skin in the game but I want to get as many law enforcement and first responders on the mats as possible so I want to lower the cost working with Travis and the SPG organization to start with to just get people in the door hmm because I mean you know this probably better thing but like you don't actually have to know that much to radically increase your safety especially if you're dealing with somebody who doesn't know shit yeah the average blue bow could manhandle the average human yes imagine if every police officer or first responder had that ability whether it could be dealing cuz you know these guys are not dealing with people it's not like hey Joe it's great to see you today nobody calls nine when one is like oh my god let me tell you about the most awesome day that I just had are you ready for this fuck it was my birthday we had a party there was a cake the presents were amazing no it's like oh my they're going to crisis tricked we're dealing with drunk people they're dealing with people who are on drugs and I don't want to see anybody get hurt or killed specifically them so I want to have more tools and I don't want them to have an economic buffer do that so trying to raise as much or not raise as much money but cells made sure it's possible and then go all that money towards scholarship in those guys that's organization love it it's awesome yeah yeah I think all martial arts I mean I think they should learn striking for sure yet but I think that out of all martial arts jiu-jitsu for a law enforcement officer it's probably the most important because the struggle for a gun the struggle for you know getting a hold of someone pulling a gun and being able to control their arm and getting a hold of them it's so critical well you can stop stuff early to even just a simple arm drag yeah like you can write you can see people's body language you're like oh okay you don't know this or this is about to get a little you see people start to clench their fence right like you can see those behaviors and a simple arm drag where you can step behind and control the other arm like for a law enforcement officer to understand that concept be able to do that right you're already in control yeah whereas if you don't you see the guy in the next you know you're in a boxing match it's like I don't know maybe you were a Golden Gloves boxer and maybe your teeth are gonna get fuckin knocked out and you're gonna get a knock your family's gonna get a knock on the door yeah so easily yeah yeah I always try to tell people you know what for every law enforcement video that you see where things went wrong when someone was a piece of shit and some cop did something horribly abusive you got to think of the millions of interactions that cops have with people don't go that way daily yeah you're looking at it's a it's a you're getting a very biased perspective of what it's like to be a law enforcement officer and then on top of that that I'm a big supporter of law enforcement always have been because I'm a person who understands the necessity I understand what like what a lawless world would look like and people only want to look at the cops that have done poorly but it's like what you were talking about with seals with anything the bottom 10% and the top 10% there's a there's a certain type of person that's a police officer there shouldn't be a cop they just shouldn't be a cop and a lot of times those are the ones you're seeing in these situations and also a lot of times when you're looking at these videos you're looking at someone who's got severe PTSD untreated and unrespected that they they're encountering every day during countering liars and thieves and at any moment they're pulling somebody over and they could lose their life at any moment they're looking at this car and it's got tinted windows they don't know who's in the backseat now like fuck is there a shotgun pointing at my face right now and you don't know the headspace of the person that you're like I've said it yeah so interesting to me to hear them they're like hey man I want to go home at the end of the day this is my job yeah like I have a family I have kids I work for 12 hours ten-hour shift yeah I'm not trying to ruin anybody's life but you know I saw somebody swerving across the road it's my job an obligation if I'm over I don't know what the fuck is going on in that person's head and then those two things can combine and it's like poof yeah it's a tough world I have nothing I have a ton of empathy for people who operate in that world and if you've never had to make decisions like that in time compressed environments it's hard to describe yeah and I was driving down the street once in LA and there was a billboard where they were trying to hire police officers and they were they were touting how much money you get paid and I remember thinking looking at that billboard that is one of the worst pieces of motivation like if that's your motivation to be a police officer look you can get $35,000 a year to start like hey get out now get out now because if you don't truly love the idea of being a law enforcement officer you're not truly in love with that like and you're just saying oh this is a good way to make 50 grand a year like there's better ways to make 50 grand a year that are gonna have a risk to your life no daily yeah hourly identical a minute basic what you'd want is everyone who's doing it to want to do good for the community and want to make the world a better place that's ideal you know and then you get varying levels in between that and the the people that are just doing it because they don't have another way to make 50 grand a year yeah yeah it's and then it's kind of the same as military to you know the military is a stable paycheck but if you're coming to the military for the money you're probably better off doing a shorter tenure or at or if you want to stay for longer and you want to dive deep it it probably at least from my opinion would be that you need to have some sense of purpose or calling that is coming from that occupation as well because you're not you're not going to which run in the military for sure what you get out of that though the one thing that I noticed from military folks and just from whether it's team guys or just just people that have there's a lot of the level of discipline that I know that you have you know if you if you've had a successful career in the military particularly if you're a team guy there's a level of disciplines that you have that gives me comfort like I know this guy's got a shit together I have selective discipline mmm yeah but you could turn it on up at a reasonable hour you can turn it on like this I can't there's something about wanting to sleep late just to say fuck you that's kind of appealing as well there's the the guy that gets up at 4:30 every fucking morning like Jocko it's possessed it's he's he's got a demon in his head you're not you're not putting that fire out with regular water yeah but there's a the discipline is the big thing man successful military because the military and I think this is a reason why some people will struggle when they get out the military is a very task centric organization they will set for you parameters left and right boundaries and they'll say if you want to get to X Y Z you're starting at a these are the things that you have to do the people who are efficient at traveling from A to Z are the ones who are disciplined to take that next step they keep the world small they focus on the bread crumb in front of them and you once you do that and can understand that concept you can you can apply to any aspect of your life what gets some guys and it got me to when you get out you're like well who's gonna give me the task rikes well who's telling me what needs to be done right and then and the answer is you so you see guys they're just wildly entrepreneurial because they'll find something they're passionate about and then they apply that same concept of just continuing to go forward they'll have micro failures but they don't allow micro failures to impact macro outcomes right because again small versus large yeah and you'll see them bounce around and they it is larger that discipline and it's there's no secret recipe to it it's like people again Jacko's hilarious people like choco what should I do to eat better and his response will be better he answers their rhetorical question with a portion of the rhetorical question yeah Jocko how do I clean up my diet clean up your diet like well there's it's not check it surgery what's going on with people is that they just want to talk they just worry they want to talk about it yeah they want to talk about it like what how should I get going what should i do like what's a good way to do it and you can give them a little bit of advice like my advice is always write things down that you want to do what do you want to write write yourself down a schedule every day okay write yourself down let's get I mean you might have to adjust it based on time constraints and but if you just write down today I'm gonna run four miles I'm gonna do 500 push-ups I'm gonna do a thousand situps I'm gonna do this and that and that and this and then check it off do those things if you if you could just write shit down and make sure you do it every goddamn day write down what you have to do that day it's amazing what you can accomplish my list would have none of those things on there well you don't have to not running for miles ever I think I ran four miles last year well you fucked up your hip and getting shot and you really best part about getting shot it's no running can you run like distances and stuff where is it you still have nerve damage yo my leg is I have the neuropathic damages is gonna be there forever I can run my gait is a little bit messed up so then I have like weird compensatory issues that'd be a real issue for joints as well right it's not smart maybe yeah if people uh let's just say I'm one of my ankles I can tolerate a foot lock a lot better than the other one and people I'm just looking at them and they're just like oh my god I'm good but is it because you can't feel it oh yeah it's totally fucking the that's not good yeah but it's good you make eye contact with them and you can see they're just like I don't feel comfortable cranking on this more you know what I got into man when I i suffered this insufficiency fracture with I I got enough a fall skiing which is my oh my fucking hate skiing I ski because my family likes to ski this is me skiing don't get her don't get her don't get her don't get hurt didn't get hurt but this time I got hurt this is fucking lady she was a noob and she didn't know what she was doing she slid she could she was on this little side hill trying to put her skis on and she just we right into the trail right when I was coming around a corner and I was like I'm gonna kill this lady I got I got a wipeout and I wiped out cracked my fucking head butt slam my knee really hard and I knew something was wrong then I went and got it checked and I did an MRI and it's actually a fracture in the shin bone so I go Creek right so doctors like you can't run for six weeks so I said I got into stair mills stair mill those fucking things just a purple staircase dude I didn't think those would be that hard I believe you know people is like stairway to heaven no that's the stairway to hell turn that bitch up to 15 and good luck with you good luck with you it's a in the beautiful thing about it is it's zero impact you're just stepping it's you're just stepping and goddamn with ferocious cardio you can get out of those things yeah throw a weight vest on that's what I'm talking about or you know they have this Atlas pack that the outdoorsman's outdoorsmen Star Comics have you seen one of those it's the one you put the plate on the back yeah that's the shit cuz you can get 90 pounds on that motherfucker I get to put it around on exactly like a like a real rock sack it's a military rucksack frame exact it's perfect because the the frame is four pack it's a there outdoorsman's make an excellent hunting frame a pack it's like a really sturdy pack that I learned about from Remy Warren and Steve Rinella and these guys just swear by this this one backpack frame cuz it's like super sturdy and it's just excellent for packing out like elk like you know you've had a pack out-and-out before yeah you don't know what weight is until you're going uphill with a fucking leg on your back you know with a back with no a backpack with no frame yeah get some of that party good luck with that yeah the difference between a backpack with a frame like a really melt like a Cafaro a really well made outdoor centric backpack first there's some bullshit backpack that's just designed to have like a laptop in it and you're trying to carry your shit around in that yeah it's a big difference and did this the just the way the the loading shelf is and the way that straps in and the angle that it's supposed to sit on your back there's all science to it so with these outdoorsman's frames you get like the best aspects of an out or pack but you have this big-ass post on the back just like a Olympic bar you slide those plates on it and clamp it down it all sits perfect and you get a insane workout with one of those on one little stair mill oh yeah it'll change if your normal workout is without that and you just start start light people it'll it does some amazing things for sure did you at any point in time consider using her as a jump instead of wrecking my catch them sweet air I forgot I was turning the corner she was right there I was so quick I had a wipe I was gonna kill her I was like I don't think hit her I killed her I was going pretty quick you could have gone up and done like the little skis to decide ha I'm not good at that I'm not very good at skiing I'm competent at skiing but I was like I'm I wasn't gonna kill her but I would've maybe broke her leg yeah you know I mean I want to break some lady's leg I was just coming around this corner and I see her I see this I don't have control thing I'm like fuck she's going and then I see kids this way I'm like I can't go that way shit and it's just time to go down sacrificed body my head was the weird one wearing his helmet yeah but I was dizzy for the rest of the devs like a little out of it I was like oh I got my Bell wrong concussion you think ah for sure something happened yeah because it was a bang it was hard packed snow and my legs went up and my head went down it was a big bang do I have a strong neck fortunately so there wasn't as much rattle as could have been yeah and I kind of knew it was coming you know but I was I was my bell was wrong for sure and then because I was a little dizzy afterwards I went to I was with my 11-year old and we were going on to the ski lifts and I just I was out of it and I thought you know the things come around yep and I timed it wrong my fuck I went too soon I'm stuck and I'm like I can't go I fell down and this lady had to help me get back up yes out of it I was just like not quite there yes very embarrassed sounds like you suffered a head injury yeah I definitely did but it was only like for the day the day I was just a little out of it but the next day I was finals I was woke up prepared for the headache yeah there's no like the post post sparring headache that I used to get all the time I got my bell rung pretty good I think about a month ago actually on Matt's climbing on a guy's back it was a good lesson for me too I was uh slip over the top no I I got both of my hands involved and he rolled and snapped my head into the mat and I don't have a chase planted but I and I didn't again I don't know shit so I'm learning it's a mistake that I haven't made since then but yeah I had my hooks in and was kind of just getting too involved in that drastic movement and it was a full whack doing the same thing in the headache for a few days afterwards dudes get wild when they they try to get out of things and that that's a particularly dangerous move when someone's on your back and you decide to yeah slam them into the ground it's kind of a dickhead move really well it would have been okay if I had had at least one post but like I said I was I wasn't thinking about that that wasn't standing did he try he was turtled I don't think I would crawl on somebody's back if they were standing it's not very advanced you guys you're background it you would probably your digits is probably different than mine but even taking someone's back standing is tricky as fuck because they can just throw themselves backwards and on concrete oh that's a game over it's a death sentence that's what I actually thought about that afterwards because you will see people who you know I'm here because I want to learn to protect myself in the street mm-hmm and if I had done that on the street and had my head cracked on concrete they either been waking up in the hospital or not at all you got to kick their legs out in those situations if you have someone's back and you're standing you got a you got a mean the the options that exist that don't exist in jujitsu one of them is you kick their fucking legs out if you have someone's back you know you actually kick their leg you don't just just jump on them with the hooks in on concrete it's just too dangerous before you get to that position you you want to yank them and do something trip them do something to to get rid of their base but someone who's strong that's so dangerous because someone who's strong can carry you on their back and then just throw themselves backward I'm Eva hardwood floor anything more even against a building or anything anything you want to get them to the ground you want to get into the ground or standing guillotine like you in your front position something that's another one that's really fucking dangerous man see ya guys have gone for takedowns with guillotines likes a guy shoots in with it with for a takedown and a guy grabs a guillotine and pulls back and then this guy's head is the host yes okay a guy on Team Alpha male on your eye favors team line up getting paralyzed for life that way yeah in training on the match yep yeah in training shoots in for the takedown and the guy gets him in the guillotine and they all all their weight together falls on this guy's head and his neck compresses and his neck breaks and he loses his his ability to move for the rest of his life it's that's a common one in fact it's not common but it's happened multiple times that I'm aware of and you know you gotta imagine on the street you know someone tries to take you down on the street and and you elevate and go into a guillotine position and they fall down and slam their fuckin head first it's gonna crack it open probably - yeah it's this there's so many I mean one thing that is a good criticism about jujitsu is the lack of takedowns and that is a real factor in any sort of real world situation the hope is if you're in a bar something like that there's a scramble most things wind up on the ground that's true until you deal with a skilled opponent and if you deal with a skilled opponent who has takedown defense and then you're stuck in the situation where now you're in a realm where you're a white belt and this guy's a black belt look if someone is a problem a wrestler looking strike it's a terrible position to be in and we saw that with a lot of in the early UFC's in particular a lot of jiu-jitsu blackbelt just didn't have takedowns and then they would get involved a wrestler who would easily stuff their takedown and the wrestler was a better striker and those guys got fucked up you had imagine that'd be a quick doubt it's not good I mean the only thing a lot of guys did was they would follow their back and try pull guard and try to entice a guy into coming to their back and then they would kick off their back like those kicks and use those those tactics when he fought Funaki right knee up kick yeah and he actually wanna fucking up foon Aki's knee by kicking at his knee hyper extending his knee friends rugged yeah that's a common common technique you know guys standing over you and you're on your back posting up hyper extend his knee it's just like judo is the best in my opinion for someone who's wearing clothes you know I think every jiu-jitsu guy would really greatly benefit from having a good comprehensive knowledge of judo how deep would you go judo is a good thing to learn man just period first of all those guys are so freaky chimp strong some of the freakiest chimp strong guys ever roll with with judo people cuz judo players man they're just all everything is to constantly list they're constantly grabbing everything is torque and rotation there's so much explosive movement carrying a human body it's right so they're doing explosive movement like sandbag training with another 200-pound person all the time or larger particularly women like Ronda Rousey no god damn strong that woman is she freakishly strong no I bet because she her whole body was designed to you know throw bodies around throw a human body I mean it's like you think of weightlifting right like when are you ever weightlifting your whole body well maybe if you're squatting or maybe if you're bench pressing if you're exceptionally strong or dead lifting yeah or dead lifting those are like the compound movements but like curling or try Supercenter none of those things overhead press very rarely are you using your whole body weight that way I don't think it's advisable to do that with their whole body weight and your whole body weight is way more difficult to control because it's moving and resisting and it's you know try picking up a dead body a person who's out cold it's fucking hard you got a school person you're like if I had to pick up a dude he's 195 pounds I'm gonna pick him up and he's out cold fuck that's hard you got to put 80 pounds of gear on yes I would I could only imagine and guns dangling all over the place so the judo player imagine that but that person also resisting you know like there's some of the freakiest strongest people in the world I just sit down when I start with judo people my haha I watch them over in the corner and I hear just what yeah okay I'm gonna sit down it's a beautiful thing to learn though it's a beautiful thing to learn if you can get someone that'll that'll really work with you and whose technique oriented not someone who just wants you to spar all the time because one of the things that happens with judo a lot when people are just getting involved that there's a lot of scrambling on the feet that could put your legs in a compromised position when your knee blows out how much isn't your time watching the UFC how many of the takedowns do you see or judo based it's not that often but some guys are really good at it and the guys that are really good at it it comes up you know there's there's there's some guys back when Karo Parisyan was fighting karo was a great judo player who was in the early earlier days of the successful UFC was one of the better judo guys and he would hit he would hit hip tosses and all kinds of different judo throws all the time and Ronda of course you would do it all the time too but with Ronda that was basically the only way she would take you down was with like upper body grabs she'd grab she with her move was like to grab with grab the head and then take people down with that and and use judo but it does happen but it only happened you know it happens with skilled players yeah but when when it does happen it's like it's a it's a big surprise oftentimes like whoa one of those people are the anomaly to not the norm I mean they're too trained fighters at the apex of their sport ya know somebody with a moderate level or understanding of judo is probably not gonna have that difficulty in a bar right yeah right well nor is a wrestler yeah you know I mean just and again with wrestling see I always say that if if a kid wants to learn martial arts like there's a lot of good things they should learn but one of the things they should learn first is wrestling because it sucks so hard it sucks so hard it'll teach you whether or not you really want to fight whether you really want to compete yeah you know I've heard horror stories actually Kalin last I was telling horror store wrestling and wrestling Keith cashmere shirts on you know I need to determine whether or not he was talking about his experience other people's experience or he was making up every goddamn thing he was saying it's hard to tell yeah he sells it so he sells it so well though that I don't even care cuz it's so entertaining he definitely could wrestle yeah I got count involved in jiu-jitsu in 96 but I stuck with it yeah and he did not sort of drifted in and out and he told the story last night if we know basically why he stopped he was watching I think it was he said hens Oh was giving a you know basically a little bit of a deeper dive on to a finer refinement of a tea technique you know instead of having your hand in this direction you know rotate it the other way and he said he just stood there and realized I just don't care anymore well Kallen is one of those guys that gets into things for a little bit and then bails on it he's like never once gave him a free bar I know he showed it to me the last time I was down he's everyone drawn it back I think it's so it might have the plastic on the string so you can't draw it back son of a bitch yeah he's gonna come over and learn he's telling me last night I need a tactical shotgun Kallen what makes a shock and tactical he's like the ability to go boom boom boom boom boom boom boom he's like but I need a short barrel but seventh inning he's like seven rounds and I'm gonna use birdshot I was like fuck man this is getting worse every time he's like bird shots what I need right bird shuttle do I'm like bird shots great for birds but so he basically wants a huge shotgun with like a huge magazine tube but a barrel that sits two feet back from the magazine tube so they'll just bounce stuff yeah the the the trajectory of kallen and I with hunting it shows like the difference between us as humans like in 2012 we both went hunting for the first time yeah and since then the only time he's gone hunting is with me and since then he's killed well he killed a deer with me and then I'm assuming where I fit I think that's it yeah I think that's it we went turkey hunting I got one he struck out we went black tail hunting on Prince of Wales in Alaska we pull struck out and then we got we had a we had a bail a day early because of a storm coming in we're gonna get trapped that was the most miserable trip ever but it was really educational wasn't that a meat-eater show yeah I watched that one yeah you guys you guys were like hey we can get a plane in right now well we were about to get stuck and I had gigs I was like I can't cancel gigs and this is fun and everything like that but there's a real possibility I might not be able to get out of here you guys didn't see shit shit we we saw a couple deer and we saw they saw some black bear it was just it was strategically the wrong time to be in that area but it was very educational it was educational is about how good the son felt when I came back like it's only sunny in LA but I called Rinella up when I got back and I was like dude I have never been happier than today like I know it was miserable up there because you think one of the things that was uh like it wasn't that bad but what was what sucked is there's no dry there was no dry there's never dry you thought well I'll be in the tent I'll be dry no there's no dry I got up to take a piss one night and I turn on my headlamp and all I could see inside the tent was water vapor just just droplets and I was like oh there's no dry no and that's getting into every fibre yeah everything every in that tent I had a wet sleeping bag which is adorable yeah wet sleeping bags are adorable it's like oh you know why I have this on yeah I hate the water I would not go there but it was fun it was fun the camaraderie was fun it's always fun being with Kalyn and the meat-eater guys they were great and we did wind up starting a fire one night with Fritos you know Fritos or excellent fire starters the chips yeah yeah those greasy little fucking cunt eat chips those things off those things are fucking delightful very delicious right like I said I have selective discipline stay lit for a long-ass time you just light him with a lighter yeah yeah they still stay lit for a long time it's kind of crazy and so this is one of the guys that worked there some someone knew it someone knew it and then we let the she dose or the Fritos rather and the the Fritos lit these little tweeters are delightful Cheetos are kunti cheetos are not as good as Fritos they look good because they're big and fluffy and then but it's so much much much much before you get to the real there's like air in them they're bullshit I think they're delightful no no cheeto Cheetos yes among Cheetos yeah yeah Fritos your that's an honest snack and you can use like a spoon if you get the party size that's true yes you can and you can also lose use them to start a fire so we lit the Fritos and then we put the twigs over the Fritos we got a little fire going we were so pump because everything was soaking wet so then we started like looking for areas that were less wet you know like under law or you know like on the back side of trees we carved some bark off of those and then we got some wet logs and put it close to that to try to dry it off but eventually we got to we had a whole day like from like maybe like three in the afternoon to like you know three or four in the morning where was no rain which was crazy it never happens up there the rainiest place in North America and we actually got a fire going it was fun but then when I got back home I remember thinking man this is why you have to suffer cuz I feel so good like I've never feel this good about California like usually the rain the Sun is just always there you just take it for granted but this day I was like ah ha the way I felt on my face it's like I was on a happy drug I was like I felt so good and I called him up and I go dude I've never been happy in my life and I think that's one of the things like you really have to get into those valleys to appreciate to really hit those peaks I think that's what's going on right now as you're saying that I'm thinking about like literally what's happening in this country and I hope that you know we get to the point where we see the Sun and we feel it but then we have to also not forget I think you're a hundred percent right I think we have it really really easy in this country what you were saying about this is the reality of third world countries or places where I mean you're under a military dictatorship where you can't get food you can't travel wherever you want to you don't have the freedom to move about whenever you want to and we're in this weird situation here today in California they've put this lockdown on everybody where supposedly until April 19th you can't have a gathering of more than ten people and you're all essential businesses are supposed to be closed like well fucking good luck with that yeah good luck good luck good luck with a whole month of P telling people they can't work this is crazy I had a experience that stuck with me that that I use as like a lens of context from overseas and it was from Afghanistan I was in a sniper overwatch position and I was watching a it was on one side of the valley there was a unit on the other side of the valley and there was a village in between and I watched an individual come out in the morning to the only water source in the valley small stream and watch him just take a shit in the water oh Jesus Christ and then later on in the day another person came out and downstream of that took a bath in the water and later on in the day a woman came out with two kids and got their drinking water downstream from both of those things and went back to their house and it's like okay we have it really really good really really really really good and in that village there was probably a light bulb why did he take a shit in the river maybe he didn't have any toilet paper because the grocery store was out yeah I mean so that's the thing about people that's this willingness to do something that you know is gonna negatively impact others but you don't care because in the moment it's good for you like when you see someone throwing a cigarette out the window of their car that's a perfect example that they don't want that cigarette in their car so they just say oh somebody else I'll handle it yeah but if you see enough of those things or in that it reframes the way that you look at what people complain about hmm and I've thought about that day very often because in that short period of time it's just like I don't ever really have that much to complain about like what's gonna go on right now for the next few months I would guess maybe the rest of the year is gonna be horrendous and I hope that everybody makes it out okay on the other side but the reality is people are gonna die and it's gonna suck and it's gonna destroy families and there's the economic destruction will probably be worse and the physical destruction from a death side of the house but we're still gonna be okay at the end of that and even as if it gets horrendous here we are doing so much better than so many other people on the face of this earth their daily best is not gonna even approach what its gonna look like at our worst as we navigate our way through this my biggest concern is not just the deaths which is a big concern not just the financial crisis which is also a big concern but it's also the government gobbling up freedoms in in exchange for the illusion of safety that's a real concern it's been happening for a long time though yeah but it's it's also whenever there's a real crisis there's always an excuse to pass legislation that diminishes our rights I mean it's just it's makes it easier for them makes it easier for them to do what they perceive to be their job only if people are scared yeah it's you know because they're finding the seams and people's attention span there instead of being objective they're being emotional and that clouds your vision and in a cloud your judgement and when they're not paying attention because they're scared because they're online all goddamn day looking at people taking pictures of the empty toilet paper aisle in the grocery store other people who might have malicious intent are moving on that man intent and nobody is paying attention to it yeah that's where a lot of people that the more what's the best way to say I'm trying not to use the word retarded conspiratorial II minded that don't think very well the first term was accurate yeah they think of it in terms of a gigantic conspiracy and this is all set up know people take advantage of moments yeah and that's the difference that's what really happens where there's moments where they can pass something like the Patriot Act or the Patriot Act to they do it it's not because they've set this up to pass that no they use it as an opportunity because they know that people are scared and they use it as an opportunity to further diminish our rights because it makes it easier for them to control us and that's a that's a real concern right now it's a real concern right now and it's something that people go oh that's the last thing you should be thinking about no it's one of the things you should be thinking about there's many things you should be thinking about right now besides your safety in your health and not spreading a disease and making sure you wash your hands and stay away from old people and maintain social distance all that stuff is important but also recognize what the fuck these career politicians and these career lawmakers and these career people that are in charge of controlling mass groups of people any laws that help you any rights that help you it makes their job more difficult that's something to be concerned with right now I think fear is totally natural I think if you don't experience fear you might trend towards the sociopathic side of the spectrum but it's totally natural it should be expected but you have a choice and how you receive what is going on and you can allow the fear to cloud your judgement and drive your decision-making process for you can can recognize that the fear of something you know fear of death overseas isn't what keeps you alive objective analytical thought process and doing the things that need to be done keep you alive regardless of how scared you are or fearful you are that's what keeps you alive it's okay to be scared but just don't let it just don't let it take over yeah in control you what the fuck is going on in Russia right now are they getting this I haven't heard a goddamn peep about Russia either actually it's a good question I haven't heard a goddamn peep about Russia like there's very little discussion about whether or not they've gotten it I know that it exists in Korea I know they've got it in South Korea I've seen the maps where they color code you know this circular I'm it's gotta be coronavirus Russia doctors say government's covering up cases well of course of course they are well this is what we have to really worry about with a with the dictatorship right that's when what would be the benefit of doing that what would be the benefit of covering it up superiority we want to claim superiority over the testing world all superiority because at some point the scales are gonna tip and it at a point where you can't cover it yeah but that's part of their whole long game their whole game is about superiority in propaganda it's a big part of what they do I mean they're their gross domestic product is so small their GDP is that of a very small European country yeah we look at that must look at that number of coronaviruses cases in Russia not good oh they're okay they got plenty 253 cases Oh only one death did that but that's them saying that yeah the fuck do we know cuz we've had over a hundred deaths now right there's a hundred deaths in this country I believe and I still think that those numbers are incredibly low I think a lot of people are probably dealing if you that if you look at how they describe the symptoms I bet a lot of people have already dealt with it and don't even realize it I think that's absolutely true you look at injuries Elba how many people are like that guy who or fit and tested them I think he got exposure to someone else who had it and so he felt that to be a responsible person he was canary self quarantine and test himself then he turned out to be positive but you know he's updating everybody on a daily basis on Twitter he was concerned also because he has a pre-existing condition he has asthma okay even though he says a stud you know that guy had a Muay Thai fight no you did it's fucking good to he's good yeah fought his ass off I think he won I think he won a decision was a good fight though I watched on YouTube yeah he trained more typhus can be written yeah yeah while he's a movie star shut the fuck up yeah he's an animal I love that guy that's awesome big fan you gotta assume that there are other people though out there who have no idea yes just rolling around that's why I bet the numbers are way higher but the ratios are probably similar well a lot of those NBA players that tested positive for it show no signs but you're dealing with super athletes right with ya lost as low risk yeah super healthy individuals in the prime of their athletic peak you know here he is right here training dude he's I mean this is not a good example here because this is just him tired hitting the pads but he's got skills there's a video of his fight but you can see him here hitting the bag not bad I mean he's you know he's no fucking Giorgio Petrosyan yeah he's not doing it professionally yeah he's but he's fit and he's you know he's got skills he does everything correct he's holding his hands up what discipline once he got there on that left ankle it's taped up probably fucked up his his shin sparring and so he probably put some heavy pads on it probably fucked up his ankle you know like you kick elbows a lot have you done much striking striking training see his knees man zero zero yeah you kick all hot elbows man you know I kick a lot of elbow people are up there he is right here okay he's fighting this is him fighting these are this good video of it it's a real fight Aegis Elba it was for a documentary right so it's Thailand so he he did a lot of training in Thailand by the way while he's a fucking huge movie star you know and these shorts are so unacceptable yeah you could see him getting better as he was doing it but he's he's doing like legit sparring you know getting thrown down the whole deal you know you can't throw somebody down if you caught their foot like that well it's Highland it's a huge thing in Thai boxing that's a big part of the the sport is throws not just throwing someone from that position but just throws you know they grab each other by the head and throw each other to the ground sweeps catching the leg look he's like here he is man he's in his fucking 40s too by the way when he did this and decided to train and actually have a real fight let's see some of the footage of the fight it was a pretty good fight and the guy he fought man was not playing games with him the guy fought was trying to fuck him up I got nothing but respect for people who willingly step into that arena I know but it's just so rare to see someone who's a bona fide movie star that's willing to do this he's a bad dude man it probably says a lot about his character I mean yeah ready for that is not it's not a stroll down the beach at sunset no and according to all who trained with him I mean the guy trained as diligently and as hard as anyone that's a professional fighter he just really went after it and really took it and took the approach of like that this is a life lesson and he's going to go at it with a hundred percent of his being and I just I'm a big fan of this guy I'm a big fan of him as an actor but when I found this out and I watched this I was like okay this guy's a real fucking deal there's very few people that would do this when you're absorbing those knees and those kicks to the high leg what what's walking like the next day after elbow it's terrible even just training when you get hit with with pads on which someone has like big shin pads and they they dig a shin into your thigh it just gives in man everything just like flank is horrible like a charlie horse times 100 but then think of someone who can really kick you know yeah think of someone who can look really fucking turn their body and turn their weight into it you know I've had people ask me to kick them in the leg and I'm like dude I'm not kicking you in your leg because if I kicking your leg I might break your fucking legs why would somebody ever ask first I've drunk and people being silly people being silly silly gooses just kicking one time you look just don't do a full blast I'm like if I'm kicking you I'm kicking you full blast as you asked just cuz you ask is you're so fucking stupid but like I'm not gonna do that I could tear your knee apart like you think it's fun it's not fun no thanks it says the shin bone is such a nasty bone too because it's really kind of designed for slamming into the meat of a thigh it's just think it's got a blade to it you know and if someone's good at it and they're chopping either chopping up or chopping down with that it it it cuts your muscle in half it like pushes it's like that the edge of the shin just separates that muscle tissue it makes my stomach hurt listen to you describe that it's terrible we had a fighter who fought on the last UFC the one in Vegas and he in one of his fights his last fight he had something called compartment syndrome they pull up the card let me tell you who this guy is pull up the car for the last UFC I was gonna pull it up on my phone the last UFC that was in Vegas there was one of the gentleman that was fighting on the undercard who has a scar that goes from the top of his thigh all the way down below his knee yeah he found it that beautiful put that up in the screen so this is from one of his fights to I'd not want to look at this game JB look at the screen look at the screen so this yeah that was the tissue in his leg that's a tube to drain it everything had gone gray and he was in real danger of losing his leg it Austin Hubbard right is that that's the gentleman's name right yeah okay go back to go back to the image of his thigh please so John annek showed it to me during the broadcast I was like holy fuck like I had heard that gray is live mole yeah doesn't look like live down tissue but all of that is from absorbing shins so punishing shins to his thigh had made his legs swell up to double the size that it normally is and then caused like this horrible condition called compartment syndrome I believe that's how you say it and so they had to open up his leg and yeah compartment syndrome is what it is I had never heard that before and I've seen a lot of I mean I would imagine it's probably similar to riot Faber had when he fought Josie Aldo did you ever see that fight no you're riot favorite versus Josie Aldo was the worst punishment I've ever seen anybody take to their thigh and Uriah Uriah took the punishment yes Josie Alda when Josie was in his prime and he tortured you rise left leg so badly that Uriah documented the post fight and then recovery of it I mean his leg had turned to this horrific shade of purple doubled in size and you know he was he wasn't the same person four months can you get wrapped up from that to from the muscle tissue breaking down and entering the bloodstream that's a good question I don't know what you get it's not whatever it is is not good your I don't think Uriah got compartment syndrome because he didn't have to get cut open like Austin Hubbard did but you think of it this it's fairly rare in terms of the amount of fighters that we see fight I mean I've seen thousands of fights I've only seen one person have that injury to the extent that Austin Hubbard had it where he had to get the slice down the middle of his thigh I take it you're I lost that fight oh yeah yeah but man what heart he showed because most people would have quit I mean he was so punished his leg was so horrific so you can get a image of Uriah Faber's leg post Jose Aldo fight it was crazy how bad it was and he just kept eating those leg kicks that was when Aldo was in his prime his leg kicks were so fast it's one of the weird things about him today because he's still he's only 32 believe it or not although hey that's your eyes thigh afterward oh my yeah well that's long afterwards that's long afterwards I mean that's him many weeks later but like right post-fight there's a bunch of images that he shared on social media yeah that's what it looked like like look at his leg look at that leg I mean is fucking crazy look at his calf I mean looks like a fucking linebackers calf that's just all swollen with blood and pus and it's from Aldo just destroying that leg amazing just amazing how tough he is that he endured that you guys can have that kid shit it's fucking Muay Thai and that shit it's just the worst punishment on your legs yeah I enjoy watching it but I know that's much like the ocean no yeah it's a smart way to look at it I don't know how we got into compartment syndrome Oh kgs elbow yeah coronavirus yeah the fact that he's yeah he's uniquely fit and tough guy but this thing about the shin if someone just does it gently like John Jones did it gently to Jim Norton my friend Jim Norton has had is a series of fighters who have done things to him like put him in choke holes and armbars and leg kicked him and also because he asked them to do it and gently just gently just gently gently don't keep me too hard and John just kind of thumps him just give him a little thump nothing like what John's capable of just a little thump it's fucking horrific it's horrific just fold him over yeah there was a guy named Pedro his oh and he used to fight in the UFC in the heavyweight division and he fought Randy Couture and Randy Couture's leg was so fucked up from that fight that it took him six months to recover six months to recover from the leg kicks he was the he's the hardest kicker I've ever seen in all my years of watching people kick legs I saw Pedro kicked the bag at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu in like the late 90s I was there I forget when I was there for and Pedro was just happened to be doing a workout on the bag and this was like the early days of big gyms in Los Angeles there wasn't a lot of them there was Hickson's place and the whore ian had the Gracie and Torrence and then there was Beverly Hills jiu-jitsu was like this kind of high-end mixed martial arts place they were putting together and Pedro was there training and there was this you know one hundred and fifty pound heavy bag and Pedro leg kicks this thing just whoa whoop since I watched his bag bend in half and he does it again oh my god Trung legs huge legs and perfect technique and Marco who lost watch this this is Pedro watch this guy watch this but look how he digs into it do it from the beginning again is that the beginning look at this stomp Pedro has the hardest leg kicks have ever seen in all my years of watching full 360 rotation he went flying through the air yeah like you literally lifted that guy powerful moustache Dan Severn yeah and Pedro would just fought people's legs oh fuck I'm sure he did he blew everybody's knee out Pedro was a monster the monster with the leg kicks man oh he just fought people he he fought Rico Rodriguez and I remember he leg kicked him once and you see the look on Rico's face like fuck this so every time he came close to doing that Rico would just just dropped his back and try to submit him a Pedro was a devastating kicker just even devastating one of the best I'm not a fan of the speedos I just I'm glad to be on that yeah that was an early Brazilian thing they still fight with speedos I'm not exactly sure why I can't think of a single reason why that would make sense to me to fight another strap I think that's what the idea was last thing to ground I'm gonna accept some more handles for people to grab on to then rolling around in that fucking grape smugglers yeah there's something about those that are particularly offensive right the girl wearing a bikini bottom is not offensive at all but a guy wearing a speedo is very offensive like why is it seeing more of a man's thighs is gross I have no answer for that it is yeah if I see a guy on the beach in a speedo I judge him you better have a French accent motherfucker you better be from a country that doesn't know anybody if you're American yeah you bet have been raised wearing those things if we went to the beach and Dudley showed up in speedos hey fuckface what are you doing yeah I would have a serious talk with him I'd be like are you okay if you live in Iowa bro yeah you can't be wearing Speedos where'd you get that you have a midlife crisis you want to tell me about yeah we'd have a chat and if you're gonna do it if you're gonna roll in speedos wear a fucking thong Lester grab a sword to grab on to well have you ever seen the tie cups tie steel cups what's interesting is they still for some strange reason I'm pretty sure please google this our thai steel cups still allowed in MMA I know Kenny Florian throughout his career as a fighter wore a tie cop is this what you're describing made out of metal it's a cup made out of metal so the ties it's a very uncomfortable setup right and what they do is they take this tie cup and they tie it on and it's tied on the side it's not a jock strap because ties aren't paternal a rope like cinching yeah cinching up your asshole g-string style deep into your asshole so that after your fight is on your you've got a bunch of torn tissue up there I mean you're gonna have some problems that's how you do it yeah if you're gonna do it do it like that clamp that bitch in there lockdown and if you get kicked in the nuts wearing those tie cups the guy who kicks you is the one that's hurt yeah yeah and if you're not gonna wear that and you want to get the mental advantage where the thong but on backwards it's not just that but in jiu-jitsu it's a spectacular leverage point like if you this is hump a steel hump where your dick is right and if you get an armbar there oh yes my friend Amir Amir anavar do I roll with him once and he mounted me and drove his dick into my chest with his to steal Thai Cup and I was like fuck that's really painful he's like yeah that's why we're it was like wow I never even thought of that because instead of that position being just a bad position to be in now it was really fucking painful few people can say they've tapped to a dick I didn't tap to it but it was hurt I time to something else here's the deal though I bet some people have oh yeah you would tap to it yeah if you didn't know what the fuck you were doing for sure like if some guy got on top of you and there was your first rodeo yeah he's got a tie Cup on and he's literally in your sternum especially if they're skilled they know today was painful and I was like oh but it opened up a door I was like well of course but then we were talking about leverage points and I was like well a leverage point like for I don't I believe they're illegal in IB JJ tournaments and a lot of jiu-jitsu tournaments because of the fact that it creates this fulcrum because why would you wear a cup when you roll though anyway if it's just well I would I've got my dick busted once I work up when I roll well yeah Diamond MMA cup diamond MMA mix he's amazing I'll get you one you should wear it protect you dick how did you my friend Einstein did it shoutout to Einstein Scott Epstein he's the instructor at tenth planet West LA it's not he wasn't his fault it was just a thing that happened he was trying to pass my guard and he was trying to slice his knee through and he landed firmly on my dick and I didn't have a cup and so I thought everything it hurt but we kept going blah blah blah the end of the workout I went to the locker room and my jockstrap was filled with blood I was like well that's not good and so I peed and all this blood came out and that's not good and but my dick didn't hurt that bad so I was like okay do I go to the doctor or do I treat it like my nose so I treated like my nose good call cuz if my nose is bleeding I was a beggar now yeah happens all the time I'm gonna treat like my nose at least for a little bit before I have to go to the doc and say I broke my dick so I decided well let's see if it still works so I went home and jerked off so when I went home and jerked off it was like you ever get an egg and there's like kind of like a half a chicken in that egg yeah it's like blood and like chaos that's what the load looked like I was like wow it still works but that's not supposed to look like that so I said let's touch and go let's see what it's like in the morning and in the morning it's like my dick just seemed normal it seemed fine I peed in the morning though any blood anymore so I kept an eye on it and then eventually I didn't do anything but I was I was super concerned but I immediately went and got a really good cup and doesn't change the way you roll at all next feel like it'd be uncomfortable no no it doesn't you don't even notice it okay you don't even notice it that my favorite of the Diamonds because the diamond MMA cup is a compression it's a cup that curves under so it goes like to the taint but it's in compression shorts so it's really snug down and it's designed that way and if there's a there's he gave me a bunch of them to give them away so I have one for you we're gonna give one away too recently we gave one to somebody that was here doom guy Oh Hugo Hugo Martin who was one of the shout out to Hugo who was the creator one of the creators of doom eternals this new amazing video game's gonna ruin my life the best I could find is this here shall wear a groin protector of their own selection as ty proved by the commissioner yeah see so doesn't say yeah you have to but that's mm eh that's okay I thought this was the idea yeah see sits male mixed martial artists shall wear okay now other type approved by the commissioner the commissioners may say you can't wear a steel one but Kenny Florian throughout his whole career wore a steel tie Cup cut to jujitsu diabetes Jeff says you can't do that yes you can't okay Eric that's right cannot be fast of hard material that may cause harm to opponent out okay see that's why because the steel Cup is a significant advantage if you get into a position you're in an armbar position it's like doing an armbar over a rock as you say it seem like it's supercharged in the other two points it's yes it has a big effect it's really good but Kenny said that he'd never had to worry about getting kicked in the nuts because it always hurt the opponent we heard him and then Tie Fighters I mean you think the wig ties kick they could kick better than anybody on the planet and they're always throwing leg kicks so the odd the possibility of kicking the nuts is always there so with them that tie steel Cup was imperative and they went for function over comfort so the tie cup is just not a good time got a sidetracked into a previous question - okay in France swimming loose-fitting trunks are not allowed to be weird by men to wear tight-fitting who is the governing body on this fascism I love cool I guess I don't know they want to see the outline it's super creepy don't want to see what you're smuggling yeah they told me yes I checked who's enforcing this I don't know someone Monsieur Monsieur yeah your shorts are too loose what do you have in your shirts that's probably quite James Bond's always wearing speedos and that I guess but isn't he British like he's hanging out in like pillows and it's true is just complying with the local laws I guess yeah good point Google Thai steel cup yeah I need it so you can see what's this bad boy is now I don't recommend this for Rowling's I think it's rude to your training partners but like I said my friend of mere he fucking open my eyes to it because I'd never thought about that way okay see that's what it looks like when it's fully leather because it's oh that's a diamond one so that's the one that I use that's the shit and like I said I'm gonna give you one before you you leave here you'll you'll you'll swear by it just one good dick injury and you're gonna go okay this is not worth it and again I was doing jujitsu for probably 12 there it is that's a Thai steel cup I was doing jujitsu for probably 12 years before I had this dick injury so it's not that common so that bottom strap at the old Thai got through with you right through the crash [Laughter] thank you not comfortable I'm sure it sucks but it's I think in a Thai fight it's probably mandatory or yeah that might be getting a gunfight too might have ricochet yeah yeah right someone wants kicking the nuts and they're just hitting metal no thank you yeah well that's what Kenny said Kenny said listen if somebody kicks me in the nuts it's bad for them makes sense probably wouldn't do it twice yeah I mean you rarely see nut shots in Thai fights and I really think that's probably a big part of it cuz they know there's a fucking steel cup there just a barrier plus in a fight like that I don't think a nut shots necessarily gonna end it to you well nut shots can do terrible damage there's a guy that fought in the UFC Brian Greene and in barring one time he decided to not wear cup I think it was like just the last couple rounds of sparring and he just said look I'm just gonna go lie to whatever some guy kicked him his nuts and it's not exploded so he lost one of his testicles you got to think of how hard a person can kick you know think about a guy like style bender kicking you in the nuts think about you know like a real good kickboxer kicking you and it hit that little mushy little organ that makes all that sit against something to flatten it and splatter it and it can never heal yeah they explode man your balls can explode not good you know so that's what happened to this one gentleman who was a professional fighter he was a military guy I'm pretty sure and lost a ball what do you think's gonna happen with professional fighting as this goes on in what way with the UFC yeah the cards that they have lined up dude they're gonna fly it on a battleship they're gonna take khabib and Tony and put them in international waters and helicopter everybody in I don't know honestly I know I mean they can't have the crowds no they can't have crowds not a while I mean this fight is supposed to take place April 18th that's not that far from now where is it supposed to take place supposed to be in Brooklyn but it's not gonna be in Brooklyn they've already shut that down yeah they've shut it down this is it's they don't know how long it's gonna take for this virus to run its cycle yeah and it could conceivably take a year I don't know man this that's the weirdest thing about all this is like sometimes when I'm in bed at night like I'll get up to take a leak or something like that uncle this is crazy like no one knows what's happening no one knows what's going to happen and then we're relying on politicians to make these decisions and these choices and based on disease experts who weren't adequately funded or prepared to take this on in the first place apparently the Trump administration and got rid of the pandemic office there was a whole office it's supposed to be I've seen both the yay and nay on that one people like fact-checked it is not true and then other people are saying that he did that's a good question because the woman who asked Trump kind of caught him off guard and he wasn't aware of it yeah there's so many stupid fucking there's this one lady that there's this video of her saying I heard that someone in your office referred to it as the cum flu I saw that yeah like in like is this the time to worry about this he goes who who did it she they didn't know and then they did the same thing to Kellyanne Conway and they're asking her when she's like well do you know my husband's half asian my children Rajon how do you think I'm Breit like what do you I'm not gonna do in hypothetical she's like this is a nonsense conversation but it's this goddamn social justice narrative that people are still trying to push even in times of crisis who called it the come flu like if Bobbi macfay s-- called it come flu and you got a video of a hey Bobby don't do that that's kind of fucked up yeah but do you don't even have a name you said you heard someone called it to kung fu and this is what you want to talk to the president about you have one goddamn question the name of a thing died circle of influence versus circle of concern also this is something that they know makes people upset and it's something they know that it can get a rise yeah and something they know that can contraction in terms of a news story which is the exact opposite of what they should be doing exactly well this is what you you know you the one good thing about this is it highlights how much nonsense we put credence to how much nonsense we spend time paying attention to and that stuff when you're just trying to get food and toilet paper and stay healthy and not get a fucking killer disease all those other things throw they get thrown out the window and that's the good thing about this that's the one of the only good things the other good thing I think is I'm hoping this gives us a greater sense of community I mean I'm hoping the people come together I really do I really hope people come together and they realize that this is we have had it so easy and it's one of the reasons why we complaining about stupid shit is because we had it so easy yeah and I hope it tightens this social contract that we should have where we're taking care of older generations and everything in between yeah and I hope they do if they didn't used to have a pandemic Department that was shut down find out that's true since we're here was we are in the middle of talking about this did the Trump administration closed down I've seen them in multiple toasts where it said they did and then multiple where it said they did is the problem with today there's so much bullshit out there Andy so much bullshit it's so hard and it's easy for guys like us we have you know hundreds of pounds of meat sitting around our families are fed you know we don't have to worry about it like a lot of people do would you give that meat away to people in need I'm giving that meat away I'm giving it to all my riches and giving it away to a lot of my friends but I try to give something to Duncan but his wife won't let him come back why she's scared yeah she's scared well they're their new parents we have a one-year-old she's you know she's a young girl yeah his outfit was amazing I know yours is not bad either Bob warned that one man is my go-to I'm too stoned the outfit NASA suit with something less it's a Power Move though yeah you could just sit there yeah I'm in space bitch yeah meanwhile Duncan's got a face mask are those fucking ghillie suits are so uncomfortable fuck he kept falling down like I'm saying that you like a fat white trash lady in Florida that's got a halter top oh yeah it's just like you gotta kind of keep pulling that thing up while you're yelling at your husband the concept is great they don't work it's just so heavy you sweat your ass so if it's exhausting just take all that shit off yeah I would feel like just sick subalpine camo would be just as effective you're hiding when I went through Sniper school they gave you a ghillie suit and before this there was the shooting face first and then the stock stalking phase and you're like taking off burlap in these intricate patterns and we did stocking out in Nylund which is the deserts of high desert of California by the chocolate mountains and there's just a couple it's sparse some trees some brushes ghillie suit fuck me and you're crawling and the Sun is hitting you and it's like it's glowing it's just like huh and then so you spent like months getting these things ready and then you just got scissors out just cutting all of this crap off just renders wait what the the light reflects to it differently as so what you're better off - this is grabbing local like foliage in the area and just jamming it in there okay and you can move it's just they're miserable it was horrendous experience the idea of kammo with animals is so interesting to me you know because when when I first found out that animals don't see things the way we see things they see movement yeah but makes sense you know like they have to that's that's what keeps them alive something twitches like what the fuck was that is that something real you have you seen elk kind of look in your direction not even sure what you are yeah like what are you yeah like bitch you don't even know yeah it's like this weird movement thing where they like just waiting to see movement if you don't move long enough he could stay still long enough they just go about their business yeah but then they come check back again that's what they bust me patient sometimes from time to time now that you're living in Montana how often you getting to go hunt you know I actually didn't use my Montana tag last year I thought I didn't I had success in Alberta I got a bowl there in a mule deer and then I had success on that last day in Utah and I didn't I didn't have the room for any more meat so I ate my Montana deer and elk tag oh wow yeah well good for you yeah the opportunity is there for sure though I almost feel like for me I would have maybe gone and donated the meat because it's like one of the things about and people say why would you do that one of the things about hunting is I think you have to do it a lot it's like stand-up or jujitsu or a lot there's a lot of things where the experience is so intense and so alien from everyday life that you have to be accustomed to like one of the things about fighting that I always found like I fought way better when I fought often because of like like one of my biggest tournaments at r1 was the American open then I won right out I fought one week and then I fought the next week and I'm like I feel so normal it's feel so normal to fight like I just did it there's our currency aspect yeah yeah it's the same thing and all this stuff like the skydiving in base jump and stuff I used to do the more you do it it's you're on autopilot yeah you get used to that experience yeah the farther from the exposure you strike yeah it doesn't feel quite right or then you start like is this how I do this like is this how you route that my first hunt every year is always weird that's one of the reasons why I really like going to Lanai first because first of all there's like an actual ethical imperative to kill animals one yeah they have to they need you to be a savage murderer No yeah they fucking have 30,000 deer in a tiny island with 3,000 people yeah so they need you to do but and it also it's really hard to do like bow hunting on Lanai one of the things that Dudley and I found out and cam on our last hunt last year the we go how many people are bow hunting this year is like a lot well how many people are successful he goes we had a hundred and fifty hunts 150 hunters last year one was successful everybody else pulled out the rifle like why whoa one guy was successful bow hunting in the time that we were there to the time that we were there again you know oh here my gosh shit man they're so wired me got to tell you yeah I was there it was crazy but you do get a bunch of reps out like if you had a little rust you need to duck yeah knock off that is where it's gonna you'll be yes if you get this zone there and you can start getting in on them you are gonna be a ninja on some western Rocky Mountain stuff the one axis deer that I shot last year Dudley and I crawled for a good solid hour and a half till we got to position mean we fucking creepy creepy crawled until we got behind this bush yeah and then I shot this deer like 50-plus yards from my knees and and whacked him and it was like that was a hard-earned oh yeah harder and kill and that's a far shot on one of those things yes cuz those fuckers are so fast I vote we have a video of me shooting one at 80 and the deer is just sitting there eating feeding yea the arrow because I have a lighted nock arrows tracking in in flight headed to the pump station 15 yards away he's like he hears it he's gone so yeah this hours going 290 feet a second 15 yards away from him he hears it and he's gone and then by the time the arrow got to him his physical body was no longer there it's like here he is it's going right there and then the arrows are he's like Chum by when I was there with barklow he had a a merman behind him and I think his Shah was inside of 40 and the guy was taking high-speed pictures just and you see the arrow release and the animal is calm and in the next frame this striations that are visible in the everyw to include like its nose every muscle in the animal and the arrow is just like a little bit out of the bow and then by the time where the arrow hits the thing is like halfway off the frame I'm like yeah well we found is you got to hunt him in the afternoon because it's windy and they don't hear anything we had four days out there where it was like just enough wind that it would swirl and barkal and I just trudged through and just discussed the more in the most optimum ways to like commit suicide in the evenings cam shot one bedded at 70 yards he hit a frontal shot at 70 yards right in the pump station because these campaigns could be savage but it's like the perfect shot at 70 yards and like that's how you do it like they don't hear it because it's so far away yeah I think was better than it was windy that first one I actually shot there was bedded - yeah that's a way to do it if you can catch embedded at least you have this like window where they have to get to their feet before they can run it's not a big window that's not a big well are you talking about an animal that evolved get away from Tigers yeah no they I've never been around an animal that was more tuned up or keyed up than that and also the pressure they get hunted 365 days a year and then there's snipers that come there every day just to reduce the population because they have to right they have to and but also they feed the locals they eat great yeah I mean they're eating the best meat on earth hard to describe to people how good access deer is so delicious it's so delicious for elk over it just by a touch well it's a little more tender than elk which is interesting because they're so fast you think like I had some elk last night it was delicious but like this is a chew to it you know elk is like I like it but my kids aren't chewy how was that elk heart you it fantastic elk are tacos so good hard pass on that no exploratory with my food all you tacos but I needed to be like out of the sirloin well when I went carnivore one of the things I started eating is I started eating a lot of liver organ meats yeah I buy a lot of beef liver and buy that all the time whenever stores have it I buy beef liver no it's really good for you I'm gonna take a hard pass on that too mmm it's good leave it off for me that's fine you deliver all of that eggs I've been eating a lot of eggs did I best I ever felt was when I went carnivore for a month strict carnivore for a month I didn't do anything but carnivore like occasionally I'll have like a grape or something like that and maybe I ate all of what you come off of it oh because I just committed to it for January yeah and I'm not really off of it I just I'm mostly eating that way and then occasionally I'll fuck off and have a piece of apple pie like during this apocalypse I've been kind of eating whatever because I'm figure like well this apocalypse is going on I'm just you know taking calories cuz I don't want to be a prissy diet person when you know all I can have is rice variable discipline I'm in the same way I can eat an entire trash bag full of popcorn and I will sometimes but it's just a concern is it could get to the pole like I don't want to have my body adjust to eating regular food when that might be the only thing available I'm really concerned that could we could come down to a supply chain problem and a food problem and you know if that does happen look it this is one thing this is one thing a virus what if one thing gets compounded by solar flares that knock out the power grid or an earthquake or multiple things that could happen simultaneously at any time we're gonna find out who people really are really fast yes yes aren't Andy we just hit three hours we did yeah that's how you do that I guess how crazy is that 3 hours and 10 minutes it's over it's 3:10 now and we did it for is it 310 or we did 3 or 2 all right 320 it's according to that thing don't which one's right this one it's 310 oh that one says 3 203 20 is the date you fucking
