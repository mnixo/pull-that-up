the gyro can experience hi Duncan hi I've always been are we rolling yeah I've always been a fan of Jimi Hendrix was huge huge fun and not just I listen to his music all the time which I do I listen to Jimi Hendrix at least once a week for the longest time when I would land in any city my landing music have landing music that I put on the airport as soon as the the thing good boom food child every time fucking years went oh it's a longest time and that's one of the reasons why I decided to call Todd past experience the obvious tribute and of course of Jimi Hendrix it's been Hawaii I saw which was piece of art and what it is is Jimmy his mug shots or a series of his mug shot isn't it the same was til he was arrested in Toronto same photo huh it's just about change so who's the artist oh fuck three hangers dunking today might we've had some pretty epic podcast petain might have the most epic ax steel man yeah awesome you're fucking gonna dude yeah I think we hit it we covered a lot of work I had the right mixture of alpha brain pills yeah marijuana alcohol and coffee yeah it's perfect no need everything yeah we should have some vitamins we'd taken to the next line yeah he might even take a time travel because there's a few times we were searching for words if we have the vitamin yeah with it nailed it how old was eaten I think you um he died but he was 27 what year did ah that was 64 I think he died in 69 this is me one was what 69 Woodstock was 69 oh it says man said yeah oh it's over before Soniya 69 no I'm gonna give me a pork cooking for I think he directly not not much longer afterwards all right you know choking on his own vomit like like a champ like a champ um he's a late night podcast or fucking hit or mess sometimes they work sometimes it all right you know it's a different vibe and sometimes people are tired you know I worked out worked it's not really worth but I was on the Sun all day and you know you get a little a little tired loopy but you know I have a weird fucking reported when we do podcasts they get very strange I know one it's not just a podcast every conversation we have gets weird yeah we both go to places where we wouldn't necessarily go without each other you know we might I don't know but I find myself there way more often with you and super comfortable with it you know whatever the fuck it is yeah man we definitely like have an awesome synergy man I just got to get a fucking flotation tank I'm thinking about starting a Kickstarter or going to how far away from Burbank I could do that but I've got this garage it's just dying for a flood listen any time you have some time officer today you're more than welcome to come here it's kind of anytime yeah you know just come on over come on over and use it how often do you use it alter every day no no I believe in taking days off I think you can get too addicted to the experiences so it's a freaky experience you know I'm not I won't say too addicted but I like going in there absorbing something coming out and then sort of applying that to my life and one of the things that I think about psychedelic trips about meditation about times in a tank which I think I find to be different than meditation and different from psychedelic trips it's sort of a combination of the two especially when it going it's pretty tense but it's not quite a psychedelic experience that in the regular sense because a good part of the the visual stimuli and the effects that I'm getting is because I'm floating in fucking warm saltwater you know and I feel like I'm flying from space and have no sensory input going in so it's it's a weird combination between the two things which in meditation and psychedelic experience but I I think one of the most important parts about any of that stuff when you are experiment experimenting with consciousness or pushing the boundaries of thinking is we're going to be able to apply you can't be a cripple in this world a mental cripple you can't you can't you know just only want to get high or just only want to escape or on our meditate in a while my instinct when I see like monks is to admire their virtue and admire their their discipline but also some time to me you're not getting a pussy having sex you're not having fun you don't listen to good music up there you got part in you don't ever get a little too drunk when I really eat a little too much food you know you don't ever go to see a movie left laugh a little too loud come on man what are you doing you missing you're missing a big thing I understand that it's difficult to manage this experience but don't tell me you got it right with this minimalist approach because that's nonsense no-one's got it right yeah but they on me and I'm not gonna play devil's advocate can i play monkeys advocate maybe they look at us the same way because they've plugged into some kind of thing that's a million times better than music or fucking maybe they've plugged into something bigger you're right maybe maybe not though maybe they're my scared puss is wearing orange ropes they don't get the XM ever ever never even have cars they never got a fucking Shelby gt500 and heard that fucking engine growl at four inch pipe run boom hit that first gear and fucking wet sided ah just fun and all these things buggin who's funding all these things people have invented great music and awesome movies and and really comfortable blankets they've invented all that shit to make life more awesome I bet mom would get blowjobs from other monks maybe do you really want that we go now do you want monk blowjobs Brown enough enough thanks for everything CSUN party rolls on high when I'm on the road I get jet-lagged I take them they're great for hangovers too I don't know why I don't understand the science behind Duncan was raving about them yeah I guess you gave him some last time he did it people are going to think that this is some sort of a big commercial push like there's some reason while we're talking about this other than the fact that it really works because I the problem is I have a financial interest I was company yeah yeah so people think that it's all core I'm just info hired Tim Ferriss yeah I heard that their author Tim Ferriss to come because I showed it to us so what'd you think about the ingredients this thing is that he thought was great so there's a perfect combination and then he took her they tried and he liked it at people there's some idiots on my message board they were accusing me of hiring him well even if you're just joking that it's so annoying like stop Jesus Brandon so pretty quickly you uh yeah I feel pretty quick with any holidays yeah 15 yeah 15 of us is here man take two you said he felt it Oh Tim Farron said he felt it right away I don't think I feel it right away you know I you know felt it within an hour to I think it takes me a few hours at the very least to feel any effect of it you know I always want to be careful of like what is the placebo effect well I might bullshitting myself well the main reason why I say I'm not bullish myself is because of the dreams the drive never had dreams like this before there's no way that that is bullshit that's because I didn't expect that so what had happened it was a very tangible result of something new that's been introduced into my system and that's what's been new this alpha brain shit and the other thing it does is it I know I don't sound like a smooth talker right now I'm tired I've been working all day I do seem it seems to me that my words flow out better I'm searching for words last I feel cleaner I feel like my mind works more crisply do you agree without what you feel totally it's what's that drug that writers use at all it's like natural adderall for me that's what Duncan keeps saying Duncan keep saying it's like a mile and I'm scared of it that sounds awesome adderall scares the shit out of me because I think I would love it you know some some productivity drug that's me that I'm not fucking on medians take your friggin really I mean it's a feta means science is what it is I have a friend that it's dated a lot of girls that worked on speed and the nightmare story told me so let's get straight anime like arrows were in their mid 20s they're all they were all prescribed it going through grade school like yeah it's an ADHD drug or a DD whatever but basically like so adderall is just rampant yeah yeah there is no comics yeah any kinder takes it does he yeah he just started though and he said it's changed his life for medicine like he went through the day he's not like a pill head Ryan got prescribers changes like mess around he said that you really bad a DD well I don't know if that's something that I do it in I can't ask a whole coke drips like like I do it it makes me have my coke flashback well kid yeah I mean you can abuse it last a lot of people do that now they'll cut up the pills and snorting but like I get I have some 30 milligram pills I take a quarter of it yeah if like I'm just completely wiped out it was it do for you hey I'm here Wow yeah what is the crash like what it's over no you ever worry about the right for anything Oh constantly with whoa everything no but I know about the no not with the no not because of the adderall like you know I think about like I don't really think about him often but like it's smoking and drinking and right you know getting closer to 40 it's I know well 44 dude yeah well you exercise yeah I do but it's like a lot of us fighting father time make sure that doesn't slide too far back take vitamins all day and monitoring my health get my blood work done and drinking this crazy green shit are you getting all this shit this green drink I drink every morning drink the first thing in a day - Kevin James taught me about it because he he lost incredible amount of weight he lost like 80 pounds there looking great a slim Dobbin yeah what he did was he started drinking this really healthy plant-based smoothie at the beginning of every day so every day starts off with his plant-based smoothie and the idea is first of all it's very there's a lot of roughage is fiber that cleans out your system and it sort of lubes the way up for all the food that comes behind it yeah the idea is to start off your day with one of these things and just sort of like cleans the track and it makes all your food digests better chew your food much better you know don't eat shit with a lot of chemicals in it and so he just didn't altering his diet that way his party just for just fuckin changed he was basically eating an entirely plant-based diet for the first time in his life just changed his health changed everything changed the way you know the way he felt he would get up in the morning and feel fucking fantastic like all this life you know he's been a big guy and you know he's getting older his joints were starting to her and he said I would get up I feel like a fucking old man he goes I started drinking this green drink and drinking it every morning it's a lot of you kinda busy no no no it's not prepackaged no let's show it this shows the show you make it yeah are you doing jail well this is my green shake that I make every day this is what I learned this from Kevin James the loss like if you lost like 80 pounds right in this drought and what it is mostly is fresh kale kale cucumbers celery a little bit of ginger and throw a pair on there as well and we did prepare you everything about mixing an apple in there so I take all this stuff and I bring it over here and you know what this is awesome for first and foremost your poop it's amazing Oh your poop just slides this every day first thing I chopped up is there a reason why I use a blender instead of a juicer yeah because the the idea is that when you're juicing things you're not getting all of the plan you're not getting the fiber which is great for your body and what this is is having to break it all down chew it and chew it and swallow and eat all these vegetables what should be boring as fuck really to eat up in this state except the pear you know it's kind of boring so what you do is you blend it all up and drink it let's shake this is the it's called a Vitamix and it's meant for specifically for this celery in here do it do it alright comes out looking like the Hulk's loads yeah I'd probably do everything except the ginger Oh Ginger's kids for any man how should that Justin's super good for you and I've been doing this everyday for a few weeks now it's one of the nicest things about javi on the road when I'm home I get to eat super clean and healthy so between this and all the vitamins I take well alignment I take from the earth take fish oil estas drone hi yo do you think you need that yep alpha brain of course got to keep my brain working Koko's me Android me super see complex vitamin D 3 D stress complex

that you don't have to do what I'm doing so you don't have to do this stacking all your stuff and going the stores and buying things we're going to put together things so just a little comment one a day a little packet unlock it pull it out take it other you probably not going to take as much as I do I take ten of these a day it is fish oil yes for real though I feel fantastic and my mind is super clear and there's a lot of people that bullshit that that think this is bullshit I think this alpha brain stuff doesn't work I fucking think it works ma'am it works great is me crazy dreams and
