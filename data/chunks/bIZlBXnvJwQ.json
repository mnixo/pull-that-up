the girag and experience yeah it's interesting it's new it's something you know yeah it's something real you know in this world of packaged bullshit you know over and over again some of these fucking bands that they're just keep pushing it's like what did this fucking bullshit on the highway yeah fuck speaking of bands oh by the way we're sponsored by the fleshlight so anyway we're sponsored by them and what we're talking about before we got into that was this thing on the highway today in Los Angeles there was a band and was the band called Imperial Stars imperial stars now I didn't know about this I lucky I missed this I didn't leave the house today but what had happened apparently was these guys got on the highway and they they heard their their stop their truck and turned it sideways so that the created traffic jam and then they started singing yeah the biggest piece of attention whoring maybe anyone's ever died stood on the truck playing music by the way like they had like you know these dumb motherfuckers probably thought that this was like this is like the opening scene in our movie man this is it it's like they were so wild like this is how they got discovered they got on top of the truck they stopped traffic and the fucking music was so good people didn't care man yeah get it yeah and the crazy thing is is they actually I listened to the song I don't have you've heard it I have not heard it and if I want to hate them I know if it was really good I would have been like damn there's no way it could be really good because if it was really good they wouldn't be willing to do this it just may have to be a douchebag you have to be a douchebag to want to stop traffic and get on the news and do all this at other peoples expense right because you want to be known for your fucking music fuck you especially in this city where that fucking yeah bro what about people who are on the way to the hospital what about people were on the way to serious emergencies what about people that lost their job because of you that was the one day they were late again over the mark oh yeah you live them you know maybe they had a fucking thing if you're late again this month you were you're fired and they're fired because you fuck you dude yeah even if the song is all about traffic on the 101 that's the bad thing this song is all about and what sucks is that every news place is going to talk about this and you know there's so many dumb asses out there that's mourning like for this whole trick and they're gonna become their Twitter count went up today I'm gonna bet that I may be you I'm sure they did I'd probably fall listen I would hopefully they'll say something really stupid but I mean that we we just have to discourage that kind of shit you can't do that man you can't you know it's one thing if you want to do something for publicity and it doesn't fuck with everybody else's life but when you want to do something like that in LA and you want to stop traffic just so that you get attention essentially like this is how we're gonna make it man this is it's a brilliant publicity stunt like you guys are idiots and that's an idiot move man it sucks and look you know maybe it bounced back from it and you maybe fucked up and maybe you guys were all high on coke and it seemed like an awesome idea I'm not saying your shitty human beings you fucked up though you better hear this song fucking song like this alright that on this computer remember that's right you can't get doing the iPad yeah so I listen man I totally understand the appeal for all these reality shows where all these people become famous for no reason and then people go fuck man it's all just about getting eyes on you then once you get eyes on you you can be a business and you can even use that for good you can go all Oprah style and fucking save the world with all the money you know maybe Kim Kardashian's gonna do that so maybe all this will become a good thing but because of that people are trying to find ways to get attention outside of the normal shit outside of being recognized for something recognized for what you do you know this fucking D Antwoord is perfect however you say it Diane would die Antwoord die Antwoord that rap band that we're playing out we don't we haven't there's no publicity stunts there's nothing they didn't fucking start a fire in a mall all they did was make badass music and it got on YouTube and everybody's like dude this is the shit check this out this is fucking cool it's real smart they did it the whole clip is like two minutes long is this the song yeah dude and it's really poor green-screen of okay so it's a this is really low we'll try it out I got your number to get you watch me go watch me run if you have the energy so it sounds you know it sounds like to me is like a fake video used inside a movie you know like Tropic Thunder look at this video that's on its that's what it sounds like to me that's a perfect way describing it dude that is the perfect way to describe fake videos is to try they're playing musicians right yeah exactly dude look like he even had a wig on - yeah boys got fabulous hair don't hate I think yeah they're they sounded like they're playing musicians they're trying to get famous it wasn't bad I mean it was I couldn't say it was terrible I just hope there's no like copycat errs you know like Mike acoustic people you're not putting their bikes in the middle of highway hmm we have fuck people we had that guy might have started something I know the economy's bad but what the fuck people yeah you know damn what if that does happen what do people start doing that all the time now I think they're gonna make a make a example out of these guys they're probably going to charge them a lot of money yeah well what if it's nothing what if it's like no it's got to be something there's got to be something big because they block traffic that's like a felony I think what they did for publicity is I think it's fairly serious right I think I think they could go to jail it's very possible to go to jail for something yeah like unlawful restraint you're an officer yeah I could put like a kidnapping charge on endanger - you put human beings in danger you close off the highways and make make it tough for people to get around ambulances you know someone's dad could have died because you know there's a heart attack and they rushed him to the hospital and they can't get there in time because you fucking decided to sing in the road you can't fuck you know that's just dumb and everybody you know everybody should react the same way to them even if you like him he's like that was a dumb move man this is something so not cool something should start from this like it's a new tradition every time you see these guys in public you have to throw a tomato at him this should charge them for everybody that was late think about all the people that would lay thousands and thousands of people that were late their their employers have to pay the person for the time that they weren't even at work because they were stuck in a traffic jam because these asshole they should all like that shit like they could just stack all that up they should like to find out okay what do you get you get $50 an hour all right this guy gets 20 bucks an hour and this guy okay I'll just go 45 minutes and we'll calculate it up and you know and owe you a million dollars you fuck yeah this guy was auditioning for Ironman for he could have made this much money yeah yeah you crazy yeah I could get crazy like I had a fishing in a dream I knew it was gonna happen for me everything in my vision was absolutely perfect and true except you decided to sing on the fucking freeway what would have been smart if they hired these guys that these guys were homeless guys and they were they made like this fake video up just to make it look like they were the ones singing but the real band hired these people to get in trouble to go to jail so they wouldn't get in trouble I think and the problem with the band like that is that anybody that would come up with a stunt like that it's not gonna be good right he's just not gonna be good right because I obviously aren't famous yet what's not even naughty and not famous yet obviously there's a lot of good bands that aren't famous it's up being famous in the music business a fucking weird thing it doesn't really make sense it's not that easy it's tricky you know it's like but with the internet like look at this D Antwoord thing yeah you can get famous you just have to put something together and their shit was cheap I mean it wasn't there was no him no the high tech nothing to it from South Africa you know about exactly man I mean they did they did it right you know it's but it's it's tricky like to try to like get record sales and shit and get in the door and get played on the radio and everything it's like man it's oh it's a fucking funky business and it got gutted because of the mp3s online but the music business is a state of shambles you know it's interesting with something like this D Antwoord comes in and shakes things up but it's annoying when you see the other manifestations of it like these assholes with their fucking bus on the highway right it's just it's just sad that someone would decide to do that that you would be so fucking selfish and stupid you would want to block off a main route just so that you could you know we can make it man Lukas fucking make it what are the odds those guys aren't annoying as fuck here's is a quote that the band describes himself as rock stars living on the edge they're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends that's a real quote shut the fuck up swear to god fucking LA Times calm and we right now the fuck in a band band this is a subtle comedy weighted but I'm starting to like them try to become I think I just became Eterna rap this is a subtle comedy my bad internet this is a subtle comedy dude no I think we're missing out or miss now I'm on LA Times Co where's this quote it's about three sentences and members arrested after blocking 101 freeway okay at out late times blogs and every day but I want you to read it how they wrote it oh my god where's where's yours is it the same email and it's saying like you met it to you here you want to look at it right here yeah okay the ban describes itself says rock stars and this is in all caps with an exclamation point living on the edge they're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends okay it says they debuted in 2010 with a hardcore hip-hop album wait a minute are they rock stars or are they hardcore hip-hop artists they can do anything that is crazy is that a new thing that's going on now like hip hop and rock it's just this altogether it's just a setting in GarageBand nowadays so they can do anything they wanted right is that what it is yeah hmm the band described itself I'll say this again for those of you haven't crashed your fucking cars in Furious white-knuckled anger at these cunts the band described itself as rock stars living on the edge they're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends that's a real quality scene the truck - that was yes / that was like it looks like Wayne's World yeah picture them it looks like something from wayne's world it looks vague it doesn't even look real I hope this is not a movie um it might be they might be brilliant it seems like it is seem like a fake band inside of a movie there just is no well if they are come on man then they're really fucked because if they make a movie and they closed the highway down for a movie like that yeah no I don't believe that because first of all you would have cameras everywhere you'd have real cameras you wouldn't have fucking little YouTube cameras they're gonna do a stunt like this they're gonna have to have like real permits but look how could that photo is it's crazy photos perfect they turn the car sideways turn sideways that's perfect lighting it's perfect it even looks like it kind of caught salmon if this is a movie I'm gonna be really mad and I'm already mad this is double man I'm hoping that these guys are like Andy Kaufman this is brilliant you know their before we're sorry no you're not like that maybe the quote is so bad this band describes itself as rock stars this is all in caps living on the edge they're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends right that's what they're known for is this guy my neighborhood this guy he's fucking crazy he hangs out with his friends there's no he's known that way yeah yeah say it like you lived in Glendale though if they're totally changed the whole sentence you'll remember walks does we're living on the edge you know they're getting we'd like to get crazy and hang with a bit of Flint's men is that an Armenian guy you're doing what is that I said I don't have a Swedish Swedish Wow listen I think that these guys if if this is a scam and if this is just a hustle then I don't know on the fence I'm on the fence now they decided to make a bad band on purpose I might think this is pretty fucking funny if this song was good that's what I'm saying remember when we went to see that band Steel Panther yes that was good music fucking awesome good music if you haven't seen those guys Steel Panther or this they do this like 80s thing where they play like all the like the best 80s rock and the the dude does the most insane Ozzy Osbourne impression round it's all like hair metal stuff it's all like you know like in it's good man it's good music but it's like this like hilarious good music parody on but you love it because you know they're a fake band right you know but they're good these guys what if they are fake been to but they didn't do the good part of the music so it doesn't go together it doesn't work it has to actually have good because if I like these guys and I respect them I actually have to get into their music and I'm not what am I gonna hang out with these guys have become friends with it's just this brilliant performance piece let's just make the worst most cliche bland dumb rap and we'll do it with like a lot of confidence and let's see if we could sell it what if they just want to make friends maybe this is just a friend thing like they you won't like their music but they just want to be your friend well they do hang out they're friends they're known for that right don't forgetting crazy and hanging out with their friends right it's a big friend thing how many people right now are gonna change their avatar their fuckin signature under their avatar on the road board now too he's known for getting crazy and hanging out with friends you fucking dummy you shut up dummy makes god damnit everybody's dumb yeah I mean because of this band Joey Diaz wasn't here today yeah this fucking band these cut holes when they decided to do that Joey Diaz is uh he was filming something today and he wasn't gonna be able to make it over in time with traffic so we flew solo because you you twats
