trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night okay there's very few things that are painful is listening the bad corner work yeah oh that's fun oh yeah yeah went down to his liver and the cord across across I go he just went you don't want him to throw a right hand right now you know let him keep that here so the liver has protected and I go yeah that's an idiot exactly you know who doesn't yeah see that did you watch the fights this weekend yeah I did which think busty paying out and that was amazing that is so crazy I've made the four three or four last punches he gave that mean they're on an inch they're all exact at the same spot he's got a really good position yeah I just stopped him and he could hit hard he waved it off but then he guillotine and we know eleven guillotines I believe that he had betray and tied one huh we you know one time I said I want to feel it like a whoa this is a really tight Milton buddy he got out yeah he's an he's a freak athlete he really is and he's a very likable guy he's awesome yeah steep is a good guy we were talking about composure yes sir you're so composed like in Brazil when he fought for bricio was like gonna stare down he's just dead faced he's got his own dead face it's not like a fade or dead face or cane dead face he's got his own dead face but those guys they can just stay completely calm you know in that incredible environment of being there in Brazil forty five thousand plus people screaming for Fabricio Werdum and he just shuts his lights that's one of the things our own or main battle right it's being able to control ourselves and he's looks to have mastered that ability to control his own emotions make sure he's directed energy in the right path so steep a good job grasshopper he's a bad motherfucker waiting to see if someone got into his head the way like you and Dominic were going after each other or the way Conor got in all those head right yeah it was good point that was a master class and fucking with someone's head absolutely me Connor took although completely out of his element where he was just so frazzled by the time they actually met each other inside the Octagon it's just I think that the ovary minister is the same as home and a Rosie you know you're Rousey is intimidating everybody the way she is and she when she started to stare down that's when she lost because she realized Holly didn't care read all right she was just there I'm going to hurt you that was an ssa masti everybody's intimidated by ovary men you should be because he's a monster but I think open could see in his face already he's not intimidated this guy as absolutely you know and and then when you fight a guy like that that that little voice starts playing in your in your mind when it gets bad you know and that's why maybe we saw these crazy things of running away you know which I say it's a good thing because I said the same thing against Conor McGregor but you know for a big huge heavyweight it doesn't look good you know and now you set yourself up more as a victim because he's following you in fact that all is an input in your in your own brain because now you start telling yourself oh hello everybody thinks I'm I'm hurt or that I'm afraid am I afraid I mean oh there's the whole doubt thing that goes on in the - always these two voices I say so one voice wants to quit that the other voice wants to go right you know you're a really bad situation and they say okay call it quits color quit and then serve the other way way we're not gonna let's just let you see what happens you know and then suddenly you come out of the situation like I was I was about to death in my second fight and and and but then the audience started cheering for him and then my ego to go over I go okay I get out of the situation and then 36 later I knocked him out to the knee to deliver and I go okay this is the last time I'm going to think like that because default the bad boy stay away from the bad voice [Music]
