alone in a hotel room I was supposed to do an episode with my pal Duncan Trussell but Duncan Trussell caught what is being referred to as the nerd flu apparently when people go to comic-con every year they get what they call the nerd flu and what the nerd flu is is people that are like I guess either they don't get out much and when they do get out their immune systems are severely compromised and these fucking bugs just run rampant through this sea of dorks something like that or maybe just a factor of having so many people in a room together or so many people in groups together I don't know the fuck I'm talking about but Duncan's sick as shit that's my point so Duncan couldn't make it today but he will be back on Monday so what I did was I put up some questions or I put up a post on Twitter and let people ask me questions and I answered a few of them and so that's this podcast I hope you enjoy it please welcome me the Joe Rogan experience strain my name's Joe Rogan podcast by night okay alright ladies and gentlemen so I am in a hotel room right now in Atlanta Georgia and I almost didn't make it to Atlanta I almost accidentally went to Chicago I've been traveling so much lately I literally forgot where I was going I don't think you're supposed to say literally there actually I actually forgot where I was going I went to the gate at American Airlines and you know when they call first-class all the first-class people like who that's me everybody else has to wait well I was one of those assholes and I've went up to the gate and gave the lady my phone you know because it's it's in your phone they scan your phone and she puts it down I go back she goes sir this is for Atlanta and I look up and the plane was going to Chicago and I was like oh dummy so that was me I was one of those guys you know in a big rush to get on the plane that I'm not even supposed to be on but I made it here I love Atlanta land is a badass place it's a fun town I did a special here in 2012 just always enjoyed it here it's a good city it's an unusual city it's very uh no I just got its own thing but a lot of cities are like that a lot of cities have their own thing I'm sitting here in my hotel room I was going to do a podcast on the plane and I put it out on Twitter I said you know if you got any questions I'll answer them and I was thinking about doing it on the plane because the plane had Wi-Fi but there was this lady behind me with her kid oh my god some people just don't fucking pay attention to their kid they just they they just don't they just don't do anything her kid was going fucking crazy first of all he was kicking the back of my seat constantly just kicking it not like putting his feet up and resting just thump-thump thump-thump he's a cute little guy he's a little tiny fella he's probably only maybe two or three at the most and I really like kids maybe I would have been irritated if I didn't have to I probably would have been but what was irritating was the lady was ignoring him um and she was laying there with her eyes closed she was big fat lady and her kids going mama mama mama mama mama I mean yelling and I finally I sat up but I turned around looked at her and she looked at me like there was something wrong with me I was like bitch talk to your fucking kid he's screaming at you and you're ignoring him some people just decide that because they have to deal with the burden of taking care of a kid and you know kids they have a short attention span they want your attention when they want it they don't want to wait they don't have any patience their fucking babies it's it's a you know two to three-year-old baby and she just wasn't having it she thought she thought she should be able to just relax and that everybody else she I guess she just didn't take any consideration at all all the other people around her while her kid is fucking screaming she's just laying there with her hands folded in her belly actually like this fat belly her hands were laying on top of her fat belly and it wasn't pregnant I don't think she had three kids there she might have been just really into dick she might have another baby on the way but I think she was just fat I'm just gonna guess who's fat and this fucking kid was screaming in her face and she just kept her eyes closed so I god damn it pay attention to your fucking kid lady um but it was pretty evident right away there was no way I was gonna be able to get a podcast going and just talk into it without this kid screaming in the background which I mean might have been funny I don't know a bitch more likely it would have been annoying so I didn't do it but I'm here in my hotel room right now it's 5:20 and I have a show tonight at 8 o'clock so I got a couple hours here to kill so I figured I'll do it here and was going to have my friend ian mccall on if you've been on the podcast before he's been on fight companions before and he's one of the UFC's top flyweight contenders he was scheduled to fight tomorrow but his opponent Justin Scoggins did not make weight it's very unfortunate because Justin is a very very talented guy and I was looking forward to watching that fight it would have been a really interesting fight one of the big fights on the car that I was looking forward to but so Ian's wound up training for six weeks and weighing in all for nothing he decided to weigh in any way just to prove a point he fights that flyweight which is a hundred and twenty five pounds which is it's a brutal cut I think he probably walks around somewhere around 150 if I had to guess and he's got to cut all the way down to 125 he just decided to do it anyway just to make a point cuz he's a professional so um hopefully we'll do a podcast later with Ian you know what while I'm doing this I'm doing this on my own woops I'm doing this on my iPhone and I realized while I'm doing it that I do not have airplane mode on now I do so people can't call me because I think if somebody calls you the recording just stops so it's ongoing now folks and sitting here my mic stand is a diet coke can and so I'm going to read some of this shit that people the questions people asked on on the Twitter so I'm here I'm doing the Laughing Skull in Atlanta tonight for two shows it's a cool little room but when I say little room I mean it's fucking tiny I think it's I think it seats 80 people and I was just here a couple months ago for the tabernacle I was at the Tabernacle Theatre which is a big-ass place and I just decided like I don't really have that much new material because really I was working on just tightening down all the material that I had for my special and once I recorded special now I'm in sort of like I guess you'd call it subject acquisition mode where I sort of sit around and try to figure out what I'm gonna what I'm going to expand upon like what what ideas I'm going to start planting and then try to make them grow on stage this is the this is a scary part of doing stand-up I wouldn't say like obviously it's not scary but this is the the most troublesome or nerve-racking or or exciting it's the most exciting time of standup the most exciting is certainly like the actual filming of a special that's very exciting and the idea that it's done and okay I did that material the best justice I could do and now I'm going to release it and then the most exciting part after that is this this period that I'm at right now where I don't have shit I don't have any new material I have a bunch of subjects I have a bunch of ideas that I wrote down on my phone I have a bunch of subjects that I talked about on stage a few times but they never really became bits and I will eventually piece those out and I'll put those up on a cork board with index cards to take index cards and I write the subjects down and I slap them up on a cork board so I can look at them in my office and I've got a few of those but man this is about as fresh and embryonic a state as my stand-up is ever in it's there's a period that I've been over the last few years I've been doing it every two years every two years seems to be like a good number for me like I guess I could probably do a new hour every year but I don't think it would be it's at its best and some of those bits they get better as time goes on and I would love to have what I think is as close to the finished version as I can before I release it so um so two years seems to be the time that and so there's this period where you sort of slam down the samurai sword you hammer it down get it to the best edge that you can get it to and then throw it all away and start from scratch so that's where I'm at you know so uh these kind of podcasts probably help subject matter is it's just up in the air I mean I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna talk about so let me get to some of these questions I'm kind of rambling here let's see what we got here how can we help Governor Gary Johnson grow on social media etc that's a good question governor Gary Johnson I should tell you as this former governor are you always ago it was like you know they say President Carter like Jimmy Carter's obviously not the president anymore but they still call him President Carter I don't know how that works but what I do know is that he will be on the podcast next Thursday with Doug Stanhope so Gary Johnson and Doug Stanhope together because doug has an idea a great idea that we're going to announce on the podcast I guess I could kind of announce it now or talk about it now what Doug's idea is is to do a live podcast during election night an election night coverage podcast and do a series of podcasts actually live from the Comedy Store so the idea is we get a bunch of different guys who have podcasts and gals and you know whoever signs up for whoever we decide to have on it but I believe bill burns in I believe Marc Maron's in Doug's in I'm in and what we're going to do is we're going to do these podcasts live and either we'll all be on stage the Comedy Store at the same time or we will we'll mix it up and you know we'll have like shifts or something like that or I think it's probably going to be as as informal as possible so that's the deal I'm uncomfortable here because I'm sitting down this weird way where I'm trying to lean into this microphone and I think when you get too close to these things it picks up a bunch of pops so let me see if there's a better way to I want to change the volume of this oh here's another crystal that's the a that's the answer that how can you help Gary Johnson um you I think a lot of word-of-mouth you know just talking about tweeting tweeting about it people will read your tweets even if it's only a couple people they'll tweet it out it spreads um you know tweet anything that you find that's interesting interviews of his maybe my interview that I did with him on the podcast other stuff you can find of him on YouTube he's the most reasonable guy in my opinion running for president and people don't take him seriously because he's a libertarian and it's either democrat or republican or waste your vote that's like the mindset that we have here in this country i think that this election is probably going to change a lot of that i think that what what we're looking at right now is probably one of the worst cases of i don't want to say the lesser of two evils i just i don't like it I don't think you like I don't think anybody likes it I don't think that what we're what we're being offered right now is the best the best options available I think it's the only options because I think the job sucks I think nobody wants that job but Gary Johnson apparently wants it but just it's a fucked up job I don't want to sit here and dwell on politics and talk politics with everybody but it just to me is one of the most depressing times ever for picking a president steven crowder from louder with Crowder he's been on my podcast before he just put a video on youtube about all the reasons why you shouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton and he details all the different times she's been caught lying and not lying about little shit lying about big crazy shit like the origin of her name she said that it was named she was named after someone who was like the first guy to climb Mount Everest the but something like that some someone to climb Mount not not not that I don't know what it was anyway it turns out the guy who she's claiming she was named after did what she was claiming he did when she was six so there's no fucking way that's true she lied about that she lied about a bunch of things she lied about Benghazi being motivated by a video I don't you guys remembered that but there was a video that someone put on YouTube that it was some video about Islam and it was really bad it was like a terrible terrible movie some like ridiculously bad like amateur shitbag movie and the word was the word on the street for a while was at that movie was the motivation behind the attacks on Benghazi and his total horseshit and it was what the narrative was though for a while and I mean baby Hillary Clinton didn't know any better but either way it's a it's an interesting video to watch if you are you want to watch this video and decide why you don't want to vote for Hillary but there's plenty of videos out there that'll let you know why you shouldn't vote for Donald Trump either I mean fuck my rambling about here I'm I'm being political we have a cup of coffee here so that's that's the answer Gary Johnson if you just you know tell people you enjoy he's a fucking reasonable guy I got hung out with a guy a shot pool with him he's very reasonable hmm could he survive the barrage of the the Trump the Trump bets what do they call the Trump conds the guys are really into Trump I don't know those debts out that's a fucking weapon he's got it's like back when Opie and Anthony had the pests they would turn the pests on them but then eventually the pest turned on them it's interesting um so that's the Gary Johnson answer who's fatter Tom Segura or Bert Kreischer that's a very good question - very good question I don't know if you realize this but - my very good friends Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer - both hilarious guys and they have decided to um do this thing where they're calling each other fat they're both I love them both to death but they both lose a couple of pounds they could both lose a little and they've just decided to have this public thing where it's like hashtag bird is fat hashtag Thomas fat I'm going to move my phone to this new thing ooh that's better and so they sell t-shirts like half hashtag Thomas fat and hashtag birdies fat t-shirts and all the proceeds for the sales of those go directly to them so you're not helping any fucking charities no starving kids are getting fed they're just going to buy food and get fatter and Birds case he's probably going to buy boxes of wine burnt drinks boxes of wine in an evening and someone's try to explain to me how many bottles of wine that is and we don't really know I could Google that I'm gonna Google that right now let's find out if you had a guess how many boxes of wine would you say let's take a quick let's say guess how many or how many bottles rather how many bottles of wine are in a box are how many bottles of wine are in a box here goes I'm good before I click on it I'm going to say I think I think was nine I'm gonna say nine that seems like a lot for bottles okay Oh No okay six six and two-thirds bottles are here it was 750 milliliter bottles how many 750 milliliter bottles are there in a five liter box of wine it's six and two-thirds and if it's a three liter box of wine it's four bottles mmm I bet he's drinking the six and two-thirds in a night I think he's done more than one I forget what he said but he's definitely drank at least one box in a night on a regular basis so that's four bottles of wine I would be dead I don't know how he does it always is definitely fat I mean that helps it and then it's also there's a there's a tolerance issue when you drink that much all the time you bought your body just gets used to it there's um you know your body's like okay this asshole is going to be pouring poison down the hole every day time to get used to it so that's why mmm Mythbusters Mythbusters how many bottles of wine in a box I've been told a box of wine is equivalent to five bottles now I got to see if its truth or a myth what kind of that's not a myth it's a measurement this is just somebody's wacky website so that's what the Bert and Tom like who's fat thing is all about so if you if you see hashtag Bert is fat that's what that's all about or hashtag Tom is fat which is sort of a retaliation and they would call Bert Chrysler I don't know Tom's podcast with his wife christina pazsitzky they have this podcast called your mom's house it's fucking hilarious it's really funny and its really it's really unique like it's really their own kind of thing I went did it once but it's really fun they have their own vibe they're the they're the pound-for-pound funniest couple Tom and Christina it's close it's like Bonnie McFarlane a rich vos are right up there but um man Tom I think Tom and Christina might have them by a hair buy a all right next question boy some of these questions are fucking terrible will the doomed podcast ever happened that's a good question soprano pictures yeah probably will I just been crazy busy I'm editing the comedy special right now when that's over I'll have some rest and relaxation time and yeah we'll probably but we're going to do is it probably won't be like a regular podcast because it probably won't be that interesting to listen to or watch will have it just like as like a supplemental thing or will do it on twitch twitch is this thing that these young kids are doing these days twitches this I'm sorry if this is popping I might be too close to this if I'm popping my Peas twitches this thing that young kids are doing words you're watching video games being played by other people and it's really popular hugely popular in fact they make money from it they they play video games and they make money playing video games like uh who saw that coming nobody right nobody ever thought that it would be interesting to watch people play video games but when I used to play quake people used to get into these things called demos like you would watch guys like there's this this kid named Thresh he was like the big gamer back in the day the big quake player is like one of the best in the world if not the best and I would watch his demos just because he could fuck BOTS guys up playing that game in a way that I could never do and I think if you can watch someone do something like what I was competing in Taekwondo tournaments one of the things that really helped me a lot was I would go like when I was coming up I would go and watch like big-time tournaments like I went to Colorado Springs to watch the World Cup and this isn't like I would say like 1986 I think it was and I went to Colorado Springs to watch the World Cup because I knew that the best fighters in the world were going to be there the best Taekwondo guys guys like herb Perez and I'm trying to remember some of these names there was this guy nassim Rob not all remember his last name but he was this bad motherfucker from the Ivory Coast boy I'll remember it as soon as his podcast is over I'll remember his name it's driving me crazy Patrice Patrice remark that's his name Patrice remark was his name was not not seen not seen was another guy who's also a bad motherfucker it was a bunch of them but anyway these guys were like at a very high level um much much better than me and I remember going and watching them compete made me better I remember seeing that level of competition and then also in my mind I had higher expectations of myself and a higher higher higher ceiling I guess of potential like I looked at all these guys and how good they were and I realized what was possible so it sort of ramped up in my mind what I needed to do to be at my best and immediately afterwards I went on to win one of the biggest tournaments over one which is well one of the biggest in Massachusetts the Bay State Games which is right after I got back just from watching I got better guaranteed point is we would watch these things on these demos in quake so what you could do is there was a you would hit the tilde key the tilde key is that key that's right below the escape button on your laptop or your your keyboard rather and it would pull this drop-down menu like a control panel not even a drop-down menu it's just like it was like code like Doss and you would have to type in certain things I forget what the how you would do it but you had to learn like what little symbols to use and stuff it was almost like kind of coding but you could you could type in demo and you could run a demo and then later on I think they put it in the menu the actual menu of the game but in the old days like especially the quake 1 days you used to have to used to have to know what to write in the code and then you can record demo and you would record a demo and this way you'd be watching the gameplay out from the person's eyes like you would watch their screen like what they're seeing when they're playing the game and it made you better it definitely did and I think it's exciting to watch too it's exciting to see if someone could pull something off like I'd watch this Thresh guy or there's another guy named immortal he was a bad motherfucker and he was another guy who's like one of the best in the world you'd watch him play you just got cheese because he would he would hit guys like did being in midair like jumping and he would shoot them in the face with a rocket just he was so good he would rail guys the a railgun is this this super high-powered thing that shoots this I guess like I don't know what a rail is a ball or something like that but it has this cool like tracer behind it like this laser tracer like poom and it's almost like instantaneous the the speed and it's faster than a rocket and you'd be able to you'd have to time it just absolutely perfectly and these guys would be able to do things with those rail guns that were just so impressive to someone who suck like me you did watch it you watch it through their eyes like fuck and it just made you realize how bad you sucked and how good they are and how much you had how much more you had to work at it that was like one of the weird things about those games is how deep the rabbit-hole goes like the guys who look really good they were so much better than than someone like me who was kind of okay like I was okay as long as I was playing somebody who sucked or somebody who was like at my level we just really didn't know what they're doing and I was fucking playing a lot I was playing like eight hours a day at one point in time sometimes even more completely obsessed I would it we did would fuck up all sorts of aspects of my life I wouldn't get anything done that would be constantly like just engrossed in improving my performance in this fucking crazy game and playing it online too was so exciting because you'd be playing against a bunch of people and these people would be you know in real-time essentially there was a little bit of lag in between when you would shoot and when it was show up on the screen dependent upon how fast your connection was but if you had a pretty decent connection like cable modem or something like that and you know the person was near you like fairly close in the same city or something like that or at least in the same state you get like really commensurate pings and you would have these awesome matches will you be basically playing in real time against each other it's just so excited and these levels that you would play on if you've never played a 3d shooter like unreal or quake or doom or there's you know a bunch of them now but these games that you would play the graphics would be so intense there'd be all these wild maps that you would play on it was just really exciting and so much more exciting than any other game or any other thing that I've ever done before you know outside of fighting in a competitive way it was just completely engrossing so I really had a problem with it for a long time if you listen to this podcast for you know any length of episodes I'm sure it's come up more than once I know I talk about the same things over and over again sometimes and that's unfortunate but I always feel like somebody something listening doesn't know that story and if I don't tell that story it's not going to make sense the people that are the hardcore people that have heard this podcast you know listen to a hundred plus episodes you probably have heard that story but you know that the real issue is how many people that are new they're tuning in for the first time haven't I don't want to leave it out just because well I'm worried that someone's already heard it so I always try to put that caveat in it for those of you who have heard this before I'm sorry so my my video game career as far as I wouldn't call it a career obsession my period of obsession lasted a few years and I eventually had a quick cold turkey I had to walk away because it was just really interfering with my life and here's another story that I've told before but I'll tell it again just because people haven't heard it there was a guy who was a manager at the Comedy Store was a really nice guy his name was Rob and Rob was in the back of the comedy store once and he said he was addicted to EverQuest and EverQuest was like World of Warcraft is one of the first one of those role-playing games those multi-person weird world games where you you know I'm a sorcerer and you have our cloak and go get a bag of gold and there's wacky fucking games but he was super addicted to it and one of the things he said was he said I'm so good at making money in the game world but so bad at making money in the real world and the way he said it was like this revelation like what the fuck is wrong with me he was really devastated he was sitting there he's pale looked like you had seen the Sun in weeks he looks like you hadn't sleep and right his eyes were all fucked up from staring at a computer screen every day and that was the moment I think where I realized like uh yeah like these fucking things will SAP you of your life like it might be fun while it's happening but it's when it's over it's not fun like the memories they're they're weird memories like if you play a game like say if you play a baseball game and you knock a home run out of the park and everybody cheers and you run the bases you high-five your teammates you have a good time that's a real memory but if you play a guy in a video game and you play for eight hours and you beat them in some some crazy match when it's over II don't feel like anything really happened I wonder if that's the case if someone's playing in a major tournament maybe it was just me because I have the I had the the thought in my head that I was wasting my time I thought I'm should be doing other things I have things that I need to be doing and I'm fucking off and playing this video game and so I had like a negative attachment to the idea of playing a game and maybe if I was like one of those dudes and like one of those Starcraft games if you know if you're familiar at all with video games but if you if you are familiar you know that they have these crazy Starcraft tournaments in Korea and I guess they have them in America too and they maybe Europe as well maybe I'm just talking on my ass but in Korea I know they're huge and they fill up arenas I'm talking like like a fucking Colosseum like 20 five thousand people and they have these giant screens and people watch these guys play video games in real time and they cheer and they know like the moves so when someone's doing something good they get crazy and when someone's make a mistake don't like oh no it's weird it's weird to watch them I believe there's real money in it like I know there's some guys that do play in video games in tournaments and professional video game leagues that can actually make real money and then they make that money on that twitch thing as well twitch twitch comm I guess they somehow another I don't know it's been explained to me but I forgot there's uh I guess people I don't know if you get paid for how many people are watching you or people donate or I don't know they make money they make money off of twitch so there's that so maybe those people that are playing these big-time Starcraft tournaments maybe to them it feels the same way as it would feel if you were a major league chess player and you want a tournament I swear because some games are highly respected in some games nobody gives a fuck about like games they carry their own sort of I don't know not really prejudice but games have their own little thing that are attached to them right like chess chess is a thinking person's game if you tell someone you play chess like ooh you must be smart right you tell some of you play poker they go oh you degenerate gambler fuck like there's there's games that people don't appreciate like you tell something yeah I played for professional pool they go that's a thing you know it's not like something like someone saying they're a professional chess master I'm a grandmaster of chests it becomes that that's like very respectable grandmasters very close to Grand Wizard though so that's one of the hilarious things about the KKK they've wizards the Grand Wizard the like what he's a Grand Wizard of the KKK he's a he's a wizard be a fucking child you're a wizard uh how the fuck that I get their point is there's no point I have no point point is um video games uh they scare the shit out of me because they cost me a few years of my life not really I mean I had a good time I had fun learned learned that I have a problem with games along the way but already knew that because of pool and I knew that because of martial arts too because martial arts it's very similar in a lot of ways to games most recent podcast Bryan Callen we we talked about that with we're talking about Josh Waitzkin who is a famous chess prodigy who I feel like he was the inspiration behind the movie searching for Bobby Fischer looking for Bobby Fischer searching for Bobby Fischer the movie with the little kid who was a chess master I'm pretty sure Josh Witkin was a big part of the motivation or the inspiration for that movie and he went on to become really fascinated by jiu-jitsu was a student of marcelo garcia pretty sure he's a black belt now he's a brown belt back when i was communicating with him on online we're sending e-mails back and forth because my friend Nathan was training with him and he connected the two of us together and you know josh is a fascinating guy and he was also responsible for marcelo garcia putting a lot of content online I believe hope I'm not wrong about this but Marcelo MIG in action was a really interesting website where Marcelo was constantly rolling with people rolling with new people in a school and he was you know people would come in and train with him like Eddie went down Eddie Bravo went down there and trained with them and they film it they put the role on the sparring session online they're all very friendly sparring sessions but you know competitive and if you don't know marcelo garcia he is a fast and character himself he's a brilliant brilliant jujitsu player who's a really nice guy and you look at him he's like kind of baby-faced and smiley but he's just one of the best in the world and he doesn't compete anymore he's getting older and you know he stepped down but I had a the opportunity to watch him compete in 2003 in Brazil in são Paulo Brazil that was back when Eddie Bravo choked out Hoya Gracie are tapped out Harley Gracie with a triangle choke it was the first American ever Tompa Gracie and in that main tournament that's this huge Abu Dhabi submission tournament the star of the show was marcelo garcia he was without a doubt the star of the show he fought this guy he had a match with this guy Viktor Shaolin Ribeiro who was a very respected jujitsu guy and he choked him unconscious and it was just a wild scramble he caught his back and Shaolin tried to roll out of it and Marcelo just sunk it in deeper and deeper and before Shaolin could even tap he was out cold and Marcelo was just running through the competition I remember we're all watching him going holy shit who is this guy just came out of nowhere and was just so dominant and so dynamic and he had some really specific moves that he liked to hit and particularly the way he would take people's backs he was so good at chokes and he also had a really scientific approach where he wouldn't what if you guys can hear that the fan just kicked on do you care no one cares right shut this bitch off off yeah it goes um but he he had an interesting approach where he had a few techniques that he would do but he would do them extremely well like he didn't have this gigantic arsenal that he would attack with he would attack with guillotines and you attack with rear naked choke s-- and there was a lot of things that he wouldn't do he wasn't a big guy it was like a big muscular guy which is one of the more interesting things about him when you look at him he wasn't a scary guy he wasn't like there's certain jujitsu guys you look at them you go Jesus like who's a marpa ha res is one of the best examples of that because he's like just built like a freak like he's built like the comic book version of Wolverine he's a short guy with giant muscles just thick fucking neck just terrifying guy rips people's legs apart too and doesn't necessarily let go when they tap he's kind of known for that which makes him even scarier he's injured a lot of guys but he looks like a scary guy when you look at marcelo garcia he's like a really smiley guy and because the fact that it wasn't a very physically nothing he wasn't physically strong but he wasn't a freak athlete wasn't just explosive dominant just really muscular guy he developed just razor-sharp technique and leverage and that's how he won his matches with that's how I once matches which made it even more impressive really and his his main techniques were chokes so most of the time he's putting guys to sleep or or forcing them to tap but there was a lot of techniques that were really common well-respected techniques that he just never used and he would openly talk about them like the Kimura which is a famous technique it's actually called the double wrist lock in catch wrestling catch wrestling when people think about pro wrestling we think about pro wrestling you think about like Hulk Hogan and the rock and the theatrics and these pre scripted events but wrestling used to be at one point in time it used to be an actual match like there was actual professional wrestling and there was a style of wrestling called catch or catch-as-catch-can think that's how they would say and catch wrestling there's like these guys like Karl Gotch and farmer burns and a lot of guys who wound up teaching some modern-day MMA fighters and grappling competitors like Josh Barnett Josh Barnett is probably the most famous and the most successful catch wrestling enthusiast and practitioner like Josh Barnett has tapped out some really famous Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitors like here and Gracie or Dean Lister Dean Lester being incredibly impressive because Dean hadn't tapped to anybody and I gotta want to say at least 10 years when Josh finished him in this competition called metamoris mm-hmm but that's what wrestling used to be and they had a bunch of submissions like a lot of the submissions that we think of as jujitsu submissions also existed in catch wrestling and I guess when people are you know grappling and the people been grappling through at the beginning of time I mean when people first started fighting that's probably how they fought each other they probably grabbed each other and got close enough to bite or hang on to each other and then slowly people started realizing hey you know when I do this it seems to keep the guy away from me or when I do this I can hold on to them or I used to hold them like this but now I realize when I hold them like this it works even better and when I do this it really hurts who want to do this it doesn't hurt so they you know I mean back in the days of the the Spartans and the the Romans if you look at some of the statues like I was in Italy recently we were we went to Rome and we looked at some of the artwork of the Vatican in particular there's just a lot of statues of guys wrestling a lot of a lot of looks like grappling holds and grappling positions so it's been around forever but what Brazilian Jiu Jitsu really was is these guys who are not very big Elio and Carlos Gracie they weren't the biggest guys in the world they were small and they weren't physically strong they figured out how to use technique and leverage to overcome physical strength and one of the matches that a Leo got in early in his career he would have these these crazy matches with people he had a match with this guy named Kimura and Kimura caught him in what catch wrestling would call a double wrist lock where you clamp down one hand on the wrist and then you throw an over hook around the arm and clamp your other hand down on your wrist so you have one hand on his wrist one hand on your wrist and it creates this awesome fulcrum point and you can manipulate someone's arm but marcelo garcia always felt like that position required a lot of physical strength and he wasn't a very strong guy so he just abandoned it he just decided wasn't an option and he was just going to concentrate primarily on things that were sort of what just had ultimate technique to them and chokes pretty much have ultimate technique and one of the reasons why i choke is an ultimate technique is if someone lands it perfectly they you go unconscious whereas an armbar like guys have gotten their arm broken before and come back and fought and won and had their whore arm awfully hyper extended and come back and won like a perfect example in jujitsu is Hajer gracie versus Yaka rey is a very famous match between two guys that are competing in MMA now but back when they were fighting in jujitsu they were amongst the best in the world and Roger Gracie caught Jacare in an armbar and snapped his arm and jock Rey would not tap he would not tap and he fought out of it and eventually he was ahead on points when he got up when he got out of the armbar but his arm was just destroyed so if I remember correctly I think he might have even tucked his arm inside his belt just kept going until the time limit ran out and then raised as one good arm and got all excited and you know had one because he gutted it out would not tap when this guy snapped his fucking arm and this is by the way professional Jiu Jitsu this isn't even MMA this is not like you know a Ronda Rousey match or a Conor McGregor fight where they're making millions and millions of dollars I don't know how much money this guy was getting paid for for this Jiu Jitsu match in his sponsors and how much it was actually worth to him but as far as his pride it was worth it to him to actually get his arm broken instead of tapping which is fucking crazy uh so boy that's a long and circuitous I've lost my own train of thought my train thought was that there's certain techniques that you you could really hurt a guy but they don't have to quit and hogr Gracie landed the perfect armbar on Jacare broke his arm and Jacare still won the fight on points at least I mean if they had been fighting old-school Gracie way Roger probably would have eventually got him because jacory really couldn't defend himself correctly anymore and he would he would eventually since he's only got one arm to defend himself Roger probably would have wound up choking him or catching it something else but you know it's entirely possible he wouldn't and it's highly possible the jockey even with a broken arm could have gotten him but the point being when you choke someone to sleep sort of break their arm they can't do anything they're done you you put them to sleep and that was marcelo garcia philosophy he realized that he could just put someone to sleep and then there could be no debate as to whether or not he was going to win and no debate as to whether or not the the move was actually efficient or effective it was obviously effective the guy was asleep and that's what we saw in brazil when he fought shaolin and just put him to sleep I mean in seconds - it's a crazy crazy video that you'd watch on YouTube so Josh Waitzkin who was a student of Marcello's put all of tell those moves and sort of just sort of like as something that people can learn from and grow from and put it all online so games doing podcast so Josh who was a obviously because of his a chess prodigy is fascinated by games and chess being one of the most intellectually inspiring games got really into jiu-jitsu as well so I just know because of the way I got into martial arts and the way I got into video games and pool it's just there's something about those weird challenges that can really they can really excite the mind the only problem is I don't necessarily know if they have the same kind of real-world benefits as getting really good at a sport or getting really good at an actual physical activity where you move around and do things so I don't know but we will eventually do a doomed podcast and I will I will prepare myself where I make sure that there's no fucking way I get completely and totally addicted anymore because I've been there I've been there it's not the move I can't add all the time for that anymore uh other questions here who will do international pay-per-view instead of you if you don't know what that question is about I decided recently I was again at one point town was going to not work for the UFC anymore I was going to just do these fight companion podcasts that I do with Eddie Bravo and Brendan Schaub and Bryan Callen sometimes and and other people sometimes too when those guys are out of town I did one recently with Joey Diaz was one of the best ones ever but what did it what the fight companions are as we just sit around we watch the fights and we talk some shit and I'm not working that way um I just work a little bit too much between stand-up comedy writing stand-up comedy doing podcasts researching the guests researching subjects researching potential guests and then life you know all the other things that I have to do was exercise yoga forget about family time all that other stuff is you know that else is a lot of time that is already accounted for and then there was a UFC and I had to figure out what things I wasn't what what things I could cut back on I wasn't going to cut back on family life I wasn't going to I don't I don't want to cut back on my recreational activities because they keep me sane for for me I need a bunch of stuff that I'm interested in I can't just work even though work is awesome I love doing stand-up I love I even love doing the UFC I love it I love it I mean it's it's a very exciting job and it's an honor to be able to do but it but it's it's work and it requires energy and it requires focus and I feel like at the end of the day you only have so much energy and so much focus and you could be in a situation where you almost are too fortunate and you have you have too many things you enjoy and that's where I kind of found myself so so that's what I decided I sided decided what I'm going to do is I am going to only do North American pay-per-view that's it no more Fox shows no more long international flights because first of all those things fucking wreck your body they wreck me I would do them and then four days like I just got back from Italy it took me like a week like at least four or five days before I felt normal again it's just your body's all fucked up you're jet-lagged you're confused you're exhausted you just feel you feel like you're at 60% all the time you're always trying to push through and it's a drag enthusiasm and having vitality like physical vitality and feeling good and feeling healthy is a big factor in life for me that's that's a huge thing I like feeling good I like being healthy when I know something is going to make me feel physically bad and make me feel unhealthy I try to avoid it as much as possible you know sometimes I give in like maybe I'll have a couple of drinks with some friends and we get a little crazy and the next day I'm like oh you dummy I've done that before obviously but even the like a hangover I feel better in a day those fucking jet LAG's like a flight for the poops a flight from Sydney knocked over the phone a flight from Sydney Australia that shit takes me a long time to get better from I don't want to be complaining here my point being I try to avoid things that make me feel shitty physically and unfortunately a lot of flying makes you feel shitty and especially flying long hours so who's going to do the International pay-per-views I think what the way they're doing it now is Dan Hardy was a former fighter and he's been a guest on this podcast either fucking awesome guy super smart dude super tuned in really interesting and intelligent guy and Dan actually trained with Dan for years back in the day when Dan used to train at tenth planet jujitsu whenever he was in town he was getting ready for a fight he would come to Eddie Bravo's gym and train I trained with them multiple times super nice guy so Dan Hardy will probably do a lot of them and then of course Brian Stann who's fantastic was also been on his podcast he'll do a lot of them and then there's also Kenny Florian who's also great he'll do I don't I don't know how they work that out like who does what but those are the ones we're going to do it so that will be the answer to that you fucks um I don't know I mean I really don't know um I don't know what's going to happen with this new ownership thing either there's a bunch of new people that took over the UFC now the UFC is still going to be run by Dana White which is one of the reasons why I decided because you know Dana and I are close we've been good friends for a long time and one of the things that I was really nervous about was the idea that Dana was gonna leave and some suits were gonna take over and then I was gonna have to have meetings with people they were gonna tell me what I could or couldn't say or give me advice on how to do it or any of that stupid shit I was like fuck this that was like it was answering the question for me like what am I gonna cut back in my life as soon as I heard that they were thinking about selling I was like well there that answered it for me but as time went on and I really thought more and more about it I really thought that I would miss it and I don't want to and also I mean I don't mean to sound corny but all the love that I got from people online it influence might be my my thinking - made me think that I probably should think about sticking it out so that's the answer to that what do I think about the Fermi paradox that's an interesting question if you don't know what the Fermi paradox is the actual definition is you know find here the actual definition is it's about aliens the question is where are okay here it is where is everybody the idea is if there isn't is named after I'll go to the Wikipedia the Fermi paradox is named after and Rico Fermi it's the impaired --nt contradiction between the lack of evidence and the high probability estimates those given by the Drake Equation for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the Drake Equation is it's a equation that's here I'll go to the Wikipedia that it it's used to arrive at an estimate of the number of active communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy hmm and the Fermi paradox is if you look at all of the stars in our galaxy alone billions of stars and billions of galaxies hundreds of billions of stars hundreds of billions of galaxies men of them which are many many many years older than our galaxy many years older than our planet the question is why haven't these aliens contacted us where is everybody so that's the question the Fermi paradox I've thought about this a lot so I'm actually happy about this question I have a feeling that our ideas about what a society or what civilization does as it advances are based entirely on our idea that we are dependent upon the monkey body that we're dependent upon the physical flesh and the idea of being somewhere in a measurable way that that's the only way you can experience something I think that that I think that's that's an error on our part I don't think that we are going to be attached to the physical body forever this sounds like hippie nonsense silly woowoo bullshit but this is my thought behind it I think that first of all we are moving closer and closer every day to being integrated with technology and by integrated with technology I think initially it's going to happen where there's going to be some sort of a chip that we have in our body whether it's something that we use that it helps us it enhances our vision or enhances our mental function or our ability to communicate with each other or our ability to access information it's entirely possible that it might start out as some sort of a helmet that we put on that lets us you know like maybe like a ball cap with electrodes on it and you put this thing on and it stimulates areas of your brain that allow you to see these images and maybe perhaps like some sort of a screen like Minority Report like it'll be in front of you where you'll be able to access data where you'll be able to ask it questions I mean I have this a Serie function we have this hey Siri function on our our phones that people get pissed off when I say it when I say those words on the podcast because if you have an Android phone you don't know this but if you have an iPhone you have that option on if someone says those words hey Siri your phone goes pudding-like you're asking it a question so you say hey Siri where does a fellow get a blowjob around here or whatever asking some questions and it will actually answer you you could say hey Siri called Duncan it will call Duncan hey Siri navigate to the Hollywood Bowl it will give you the directions to get to the Hollywood Bowl in real time it's amazing and it's science fiction it's something that just a few years ago was completely outside of our imagination we really didn't think they were going to have something that sat on the table next to you some small little sliver of glass and metal and whatever the fuck it's made out of electrodes no it's in there silicone so you could talk to that thing and say hey Siri and it would you could say hey Siri what is the Fermi paradox and it would Google it for you this is all something that's going on right now and this is just one step it's one step in what is really as long as human beings stay alive as long as we don't get nuked as long as we don't murk ourselves as long as we don't get fucked up by a supervolcano or an asteroid or some polar shift or some natural disaster as long as that doesn't happen and we just not we not obviously not me but people smarter than me who do this kind of shit they're going to continue to innovate and as they continue to innovate we're going to get technology that is more and more powerful and I think more and more integrated in our lives and in our physical bodies I think it's going to reach there's going to be a bottleneck we're holding a device in your hand it just doesn't have the same effect or do the same amount of things as they could do if they actually put it in your head and I think people are going to fucking volunteer for it I think they're going to volunteer you're like they volunteer for braces like they get eyeglasses at the optometrist like they get faked it's a people guy they're going to get these things put in their bodies and it's going to be really common and maybe won't even have to be in your brain maybe that'll be the the hold back people like I don't want soap in my brain and they'll go well we don't have to do that we put in your wrist it'll communicate with your brain through the the nervous system or through electrical impulses through your tissue itself and maybe that along with some sort of a hat that you put on that allows you to interface with the Internet that's going to be a step but somewhere along the line if you listen to guys like Ray Kurzweil who believe ray believes that you're going to eventually be able to download your consciousness into a computer which of course gets really fucking weird because what are you then are you still here's the question if you download your consciousness into a computer are you still existing in the physical sense so if you exist in the physical sense and your consciousness is downloaded into a computer do the to get to talk to each other or are you like do you end your life in the physical sense and then begin one in a digital sense and is it even a life but if it exists and some sort of a matrix like state if they can figure out a way you know there's a lot of people today that just they just they're not happy with the life that they've been handed with the the roll of the dice maybe they have physical deformities maybe they have poor health there's a lot of people that just got a shitty hand when it comes to life like life is not even in the the cards of the deals I'll have to tell you this you all know this right and if someone came along like what was that guy's name the matrix the guy who wound up selling everybody out who just said he wanted to be famous or rich or something like that he's eating a steak in the matrix and decides to give in that that kind of existence someone comes along and says look you don't have to live this life in the physical sense anymore instead of being dependent upon this monkey body and the tooth Fang and claw of natural selection and evolution and this just the struggle the struggle of being a fucking human being instead of that you can exist in this perfect state where you are constantly in love and just filled with joy and having a wonderful life filled with only positive experiences and you can enjoy this with with no negative repercussions you could just you you can become a part of the matrix a part of the thing whatever they're going to call it and from there you will be the architect of your existence you will be able to decide this idea that law well the bad days they make you feel good about the good days you know there's no sunshine without rain you know you got to have good and evil well that's that's here that's in this state in this physical state yeah you have to have good and you have to have evil as we know it right now in this life we do appreciate our loved ones when something terrible happens when there's a tragedy happens we we do appreciate the people that are alive when someone we care about dies those are all desert all true but is that the only way that we can appreciate each other is that the only way we can enjoy life some people would say yes but I don't think they'd really know I think that's just we're basing that on what we have experienced and what we would currently the data we're pulling from being a human being living on earth if someone can engineer and this is not something that might happen in a year or in a hundred years but we might be talking about something that happens in a thousand years or 2,000 years who knows but around the same time where we think that a technologically based civilization would develop the capability of star travel of being able to travel not just into another solar system but perhaps you do another galaxy but maybe hundreds of galaxies away who knows but that kind of incredible ability to control your environment we might not ever get there we might not ever get there because we realize that being there physically is not nearly as important as the experience like you know I've often said this about psychedelics that people say oh you know you have a psychedelic drug experience yeah oh you're imagining things are happening you're hallucinating yeah well sort of yes but no like it might not actually be happening like if you have this experience we take a psychedelic drug and you are transported to the center of the universe and you are communicating with love love in the form of beautifully lit neon geometric patterns that are constantly changing and morphing and they're filling you up with wisdom and and joy and appreciation what people said well that's a hallucination you're taking a drug and having a hallucination maybe but either way the experience is still the same like the experience of meeting God because you took mushrooms and and having this incredible meeting with the the divine force of the universe if if that happens in real life or if that happens in a psychedelic drug trip the feeling and the experience are still the same it might not be a real physical thing in the sense of you might not be able to take it and put it in a pillowcase and throw it on a scale and weigh it but you can't it who's to say you could ever do that anyway like it's the exact same experience of meeting God it might be just as good is my point so this idea that well I don't want to live in the matrix man only in the real world I sure what's the benefit of the real world I mean is the only reason why we think that the real world contains some sort of benefit for us is because that's the only model that we have to go on that this is the pattern that we've been following our whole lives that this idea that you know you live and then you die and then you do your best along the way sometimes you got to push through the pain sometimes you got to fucking get up in the morning when you don't want to get up and you got out you got to work hard and when you work hard it pays off and you get a good life and you know your discipline equals your freedom and aww there's a lot of thoughts that we have about living life that are applicable to this physical knock on wood life it's real life that you and I are experiencing right now everybody listening to this podcast you to plug your phone in you had to listen to it on a computer you got to touch some things and something had to happen for you to it free to experience something in a real sense but that's just because this is what we're used to we're definitely not used to if you talk about human beings if you went back 200 years ago we're definitely not used to the internet were definitely not used to movies 200 years ago we didn't even have fucking cars if you wanted to picture something you had to draw it we're used to all these things now we're used to photographs the idea of not being able to take photos on vacation is alien the idea of having to get in a boat and travel across the country like I was talking about how I just got back from Italy if I lived in the 1800s I would have had to been on a boat for months I would had to made it from California all the way to New York and then I had would have had to been in a fucking boat and gone across the ocean the same way my grandparents did when they were little kids my grandparents came over here from Italy when they were like I think my grandfather was like seven years old I think he said I would have had to have done all that stuff it's not going to happen right so the idea of no photos is alien the idea of no movies no no no no cameras no TV shows no radio there's no radio back then what the fuck you couldn't tune in to a radio show in 1800 it didn't have them they didn't exist all these things that are now a normal everyday part of our lives were alien just a few hundred years ago which in terms of human civilization and certainly in terms of the life of human beings the existence of human beings it's a not even a blink of an eye this is all new and we couldn't imagine life without it I think if time keeps going or if rather civilization keeps going over time if we don't do something incredibly stupid or get fucked up in some sort of a natural catastrophe we're going to come up with an ability to manipulate our environment our world our perceptions our mind to create an artificial world an artificial universe that's impossible for our little fucking chimpanzee brains to to imagine I don't think we have the capacity to do to connect all the dots I think with each new invention it opens up a new complete realm of possibility like you couldn't say to someone in 1800 one day you're going to have Google because they'd be like what the fuck are you talking about but one day you're going to be able to talk to your phone what the fuck is a phone but one day you're going to be able to talk to your electronic device what's electronics what do you what the fuck are you saying we will wizard you would be saying something to them that didn't make any sense at all and that I think is how we have to look at the possibility for two or three hundred years from now there's going to be new things that get invented along the way and you know in the Old West Was electricity the metals new ways of connecting things and then teletype and Morse code and all these different things got invented before they invented computers the Internet well we're dealing with right now when when you look at to 300 years from now I think it's entirely possible that these ideas that we have about what the future is going to be like there's there's big chunks missing there's chunks missing from our thought process and it's because these paradigm shifting revelations inventions and innovations they haven't occurred yet and when those things do occur I think it's going to forever change what the future will be and as these things occur whether it's the ability to download consciousness or whether it's the ability to record thoughts in in your own mind record memories dreams that's a real possibility what they're thinking is there's going to be a time where you are going to have a hard drive I like a virtual hard drive or a physical hard drive rather like someone's gonna put an SD card slot in your head not an SD card slot something probably much smaller it might even be as small as like Ray Kurzweil has said as a cell like a blood cell like one red blood cell in your body that's a machine or a computer or camera or some sort of recording device this thing may be able to record your thoughts record how it feels to be you like say if you are you know fill in the blank if you're no know who Ashton Kutcher let's pretend you're Aston Kutcher if Ashton Kutcher decides to record his thoughts and his life in his day and to take it and upload it to the web and you could feel what it feels like to be him you know or maybe someone who you would always love to find out how they think you know like maybe Chris Rock like a great comedian like how does Chris Rock look at the world where is he coming up with material how's this guy think but how does he feel about himself you know like a guy like Louie CK who say very self-deprecating how does he feel about himself you know maybe guy like John Jones so great fighter or Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson how does he feel about himself how does he think what did what does it feel like to be him what does it feel like to be Mighty Mouse for a day what does it feel like to go through a workout you could actually feel it you could experience it you could beat him for a short period of time I think that is inevitable I really do I think that is as inevitable as recording a picture of your kid blowing out their birthday cake and you're watching a video on your iPhone when you're doing that when you're videotaping someone's wedding when you're videotaping a sporting event you're holding your camera up the UFC and you're watching the fights you're capturing time you are capturing an image of something we're so used to it we don't we don't even understand how fucking insane it is it is so insane that you could take something that's so small it's not even as thick as a deck of cards you take it out of your pocket and it could film hours of shit hours you can capture hours of images and then you show it to me and you could have been on the other side of the world you could be in New Zealand and you could be filming some insane mountain view that was in the movie The Hobbit and it could be you and your friends and your backpack in there and you're laughing and joking you make a video and then you can send it to me through the fucking air and it could reach my phone on the other side of the planet in seconds this is nuts it's nuts it is completely fucking bananas but we're really used to it and it stands to reason to me that this ability is only going to accelerate they're only going to get better it's only going to get more more in-depth it's only going to get the experience it's not just going to be visual right now it's visual and it's two-dimensional it's going to be virtual it's going to turn into a virtual experience then it's going to be something that involves much more than just the simple senses of sound in sight you're going to have it's going to there's going to be feeling there's going to be neurological responses there's going to be memory there's going to be then it's going to be emotional you're gonna be able to feel emotions I think we're going to be able to record thoughts and ideas in the same way we're able to encode and record visual images like photographs or or audio like this podcast like you know I'm sitting here right now with times 634 Friday July 29th in Atlanta I'm recording this you might be listening to this a hundred years from now in the future you might be saying whoa like I was listening to this Alan Watts recording the other day that was on universal basic income which is a constant subject right now it's been going on around the idea of if you actually just gave people money so they could live so I didn't have to worry about making a living it would open them up to a lot of other possibilities and this idea that putting people on welfare or the dole it just makes them lazy might not necessarily be true and that it actually might be better if we didn't look at it that way if we just looked at it the way of once your basic needs are covered then you're free to express yourself in a much more natural way without desperation and that desperation doesn't always mean you're going to make the best decisions and it really would cost us less if we gave people money okay anyway point being this is an Alan Watts discussion where Alan Watts was making his speech about this from the 1960s so it was more than fifty years old I think somewhere around fifty point being it's it's entirely possible that this recording that I'm making right now some day somebody might listen to 50 years from now 100 years from now 200 years from now and they'll laugh the laugh at how wrong I got it or maybe they'll laugh at how I called it and we will be living in some sort of a strain world where reality is not something that you measure you can't like take a ruler to it or you know and measure the temperature of it or put it on a scale it might be something that exists in some sort of a quasi reality setting uh where it's it's real you're experiencing it but it doesn't exist in a physical form that's entirely possible that that's our future it's entirely possible that we through technology figure out a way to create not just an alternative dimension but infinite alternative dimensions infinite alternative existences so this idea that we're just going to get to a certain point where we realize that we could build a spaceship the size of the Empire State Building and fucking shoot off to Alpha Centauri and set up shop there and you know find some snails and turn them into people I don't think so I don't think we're going to be traveling I really I don't think that's the future I think I think we may for you know the next foreseeable future for the foreseeable future we might be sending robots to Mars like we're doing now and might send them off to Pluto and to this other planet so we might get invaluable data about the the nature of our solar system and you know there's this planet that they think is outside of Pluto's orbit past the Kuiper belt now they're calling Planet X and people have talked about this forever there's some China's planet out there that's I think it's more than four times larger than Earth and they're pretty sure it exists like 90 something percent sure yeah that's all awesome and fascinating and amazing and beautiful but I have a feeling that our future doesn't exist in a physical sense the way we think it does I think we're married to this idea because it's all we've ever known but I don't necessarily think it's all we're capable of I think it's entirely possible that one day we might create a whole new world and this also might be possible with with the advent of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is another fuckin rabbit hole because if you wanna you want to get your mind blown listen to not I don't think it was the last one I think Sam Harris and I have talked about it twice we talked about it I think the last podcast and maybe even more in-depth the podcast before it might be both of them I'd have to go back and remember I've done more than 800 fucking podcast now so even though my memory is pretty decent I really lose track of which one was what and what was happening when but the point being the conversation that I had with him about artificial intelligence was a mind-blower a real mind blower where it's in my in my eyes it's one of those things just like we're talking about technological innovation I think everyone would say everyone I mean just it conservative people that are dreamers if we start talking about the potential for the future are is there going to be innovation yes everyone would say yes everyone everyone would say yes if people don't blow themselves up if we don't get hit by an asteroid if Yellowstone doesn't explode and wipe out everyone on North America will we continue to make better electronics where we continue to innovate will we continue to make new inventions everybody would say yes everybody well that's the case artificial intelligence is almost inevitable if it's a hundred years from now if it's 200 years from now whatever it is one day eventually they're going to figure out a way to make something that could think for itself mean Tesla has fucking cars that drive themselves now you can press Auto Drive or whatever the button is that you press and these fucking things will drive they hit the brakes they make turns they follow the navigation system they have sensors that detect cars they brake at traffic and it's fucking nuts and it's just crept - nobody saw this coming ten years ago nobody thought in 10 years nobody thought in 2006 ten years from now we're gonna have drivable driverless cars cars that you take your hand off the wheel there's a hilarious photo of a guy they snap pictures of them on the highway I think was outside of San Francisco where he was asleep asleep at the wheel going to work and his car was driving down the highway this is this is all new right and what is it going to be like ten years from now I don't think we know I think we could guess I think we could have beautiful ideas but I think when every new invention gets created in every new door that gets opened up by new technologies it creates the potential for a bang of other new exponentially increasing new technologies so with artificial intelligence I think it's entirely possible that we can literally create something that creates universes something that creates universes that don't exist in a physical sense like you go to the moon you pick up moon rocks you come back to earth but rather something that exists in another dimension that we find portals or gateways or that we find frequencies I've always thought that it's it's possible that planets themselves or that rather reality itself is like a station on the dial and I've read that scientists believe that there are at least eleven dimensions I don't know how they understand this I don't know how they it's but that's when they get to those you know those yellow legal notepads where those guys scribble shit down on it you know what the fuck is that but you have to be a theoretical physicist too in order to understand what the fuck they're writing I think those guys have come up with some equation that they all agree upon where they believe that it is entirely possible that there are eleven dimensions at least and this is today in 2016 right if you ask scientists in 1955 they probably look at you look you have fucking three heads that's a blink of an eye 1955 compared to 2016 it is a blink of an eye it seems like 60 plus years for us but it ain't shit in terms of the world in terms of human history and in terms of the you know the evolution of this bizarre talking monkey it's it's nothing and in that time things have changed in spectacular ways I think it's entirely possible that through especially the invention and innovation of artificial intelligence and its ability to innovate its ability to improve upon ideas that human beings have created because that was one of the most mind-blowing parts about the Sam Harris podcast was he said that within weeks they will be able to do 10,000 plus years of what it would take us as far as innovation so the world will change so fast once artificial intelligence is is when once it goes live once Skynet goes live the world is going to change so much that it's almost impossible for us to understand it's impossible for us to guess I'm standing up here now because I'm kind of freaking myself out in my and my throat is getting a little scratchy that's what I think about the Fermi paradox I think I think that we're going to outgrow this idea of being somewhere in a physical sense and I think that if there are aliens they're going to contact us through our own minds they're going to contact us through dreams they mean aliens might exist in the form of imagination imagination itself might be like a kind of energy like a kind almost like a life form if you look around at the world obviously imagination is something he else comes out of the brain and people create things and it's just you know the idea that it's a life form is ridiculous I get it yes you're right but the imagination is responsible for every single physical thing that human beings have ever created this building that I'm in right now came about because of the imagination the phone that I'm talking on came about because the imagination without the thought of these ideas without someone saying hmm what would happen if we took this mud and turned it into a square and then dried it out could we make a brick who then if I stack a brick on top of a break dude I'm making a wall and that all came out of the mind it came out of an idea how amazing would it be if we found out that those ideas themselves were alive that that is the way these life forms express themselves much what much like the way disease expresses itself inside your body like when you catch a cold right you have a life form that's growing and feeding off of you and your body's out of balance your immune system is battling this virus this disease you could look at it on a microscope oh look it's the staff virus or it's the flu it's malaria always got the malaria virus well what is that thing well that thing is a life-form it's some sort of an existing living thing that's trying to multiply multiply and grow and ultimately it would like to keep it would like to kill your body I'd like to take your body over and it would love to spread itself to a bunch of other people and take out a bunch of folks and that's what happens every year with the flu or every year with malaria if you want a harrowing tale of what it's like that malaria listen to my friend Justin Wren who's been on the podcast many times who is just on the last episode who goes to the Congo regularly to build wells for the pygmy it's just an amazing guy just beautiful person who is doing this incredible thing and helping these people but motherfuckers caught malaria three times now it's scary shade malaria is some sort of a weird life-form right what have ideas were life-forms they're just life-forms that exist in a non-physical way and you can make yourself more accessible you could catch these ideas better you can catch these life-forms you can catch these things that will ultimately lead to the transformation of the very world around you they've developed air conditioning these ideas have made heat they figured out how to harness fire they figured out how to take rubber tires and put them around metal wheels attached it to a frame and allow you to fall asleep inside of as it takes you to work that's all because of imagination knows that of that imagination is is something that you can't measure it's not a physical thing you can't can't show it you know you don't take I'll go a litmus test you can't go to the store and hey I tested positive for imagination no it's it's just there and you access it and you you you sit around your daydream and you lay on your back in the grass and you come up with an idea what the fuck is that we don't know we don't know we totally take it for granted but if you look around this fucking spectacular world that you see in front of you when you step outside of your house this bizarre world if you lived in a natural world if you lived in a jungle or if you lived in a mountain setting and you had never seen human civilization you were confronted with it for the first time you would freak the fuck out you'd be like what kind of bizarre thing is creating these enormous structures with a glass and stone and on a scale that is it is impossible to comprehend a human being creating a skyscraper one person no no they had to work together how many people hundreds okay how they do it they have metal to use machines what machines yeah yeah yeah they have combustion engines with that well explosions controlled explosions inside of a metal structure that powers these gears and these gears can lift up things thousands of pounds and carry them through the air and then they they put these glass walls on top of these buildings like what the fuck this is all because of the imagination and this this this idea that the imagination is just some sort of like oh he's imagining things Oh silly he's a dreamer it's been kind of put in our head since we were young because we're taught to be pragmatic or we're talked to taught to be disciplined and taught to to you know to go out there and get things done and pull yourself up by your bootstraps and all these like hardcore sort of I don't know what the word I'm looking for organic ways of looking at productivity in life but ultimately this imagination is going to lead us to create something that can change the very nature of what life is so if I made any sense at all to anybody but me I'd be fuckin shocked but that's my answer god damn that was a long ass fucking answer is almost seven o'clock here and I gotta leave soon so maybe answer one more thoughts on the Putin Russia Trump implications around the Democratic Party WikiLeaks email reveals I think that they were saying people were saying that Trump was going to get in trouble because he told Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails or hack the Democratic Party wiki leak emails that's ridiculous that is really ridiculous I think that is one of the dumbest things this idea that Trump should somehow another be accountable and held accountable for espionage how about the fact that the Democrats were plotting against one of their own how about the fact they were working towards getting Hillary Clinton to be the the nominee for the party they're working towards that they're supposed to be impartial he's a Democrat too and they were actively trying to make her be the the representative for the party and then when the woman who has to step down because the emails she has to step down because it's revealed that they were actively plotting to get Bernie Sanders in as or excuse me Hillary Clinton in over Bernie Sanders she after she steps down immediately gets hired by Hillary Clinton like immediately it's it's so transparent it's hilarious I think what I was saying earlier that one of the good things about a guy like Garry Johnson is we're realizing how stupid this fucking two-party system is we're being hosed whether you're a Hillary supporter whether you're a trump supporter you have to admit that they're not ideal neither one of those people is ideal you see all those people that are at the Democratic convention and they're all smiling and laughing and they don't really believe she's ideal they believe this is all we have right now Hillary Clinton was giving a speech and her fucking husband Bill fell asleep he fell asleep I mean apparently he's not in good health right now he's not doing so hot but he's sitting there in the audience and if he if he's in such bad shape that he can't stay awake he should be in bed somewhere he he fell asleep in the audience that's how fucking boring and stupid these things are and it's a hoes job and it's a hoes job that I think is just going to be here for a little while longer it's going to be like powdered wigs it's it's it's a nonsense way to run a nation of 300 million informed people there's too many of us now there's too many of us and people know too much it's not 1800s where you needed this sort of representative government because you couldn't get to those people and they couldn't get there in their opinion to you it's not the case anymore we live in a different world um that's it I'm going to end I'm gonna end this fucking thing I'm going to try to get ian mccall on and either I'll attach it to this podcast or I'll put it on a second one depending on how much Ian and I talk but this one is gone for an hour and 34 minutes which is I was like what the fuck am I going to talk about meanwhile I couldn't show the fuck up it's weird what I'm doing these things because you try to not be conscious of the fact that you're doing one of these things so you're just trying to like let the thoughts flow but in the meantime it's like you have to resist the urge to think about the fact that you're talking and that you're talking into a phone and that you're trying not to fuck it up and you're trying to be as honest and transparent about your thoughts as possible while still make it entertaining don't say too many ohms don't ramble too much is weird I've done these before in the past but I haven't done one like this a long time it just shows you how talented bill burr is because that fucking guy does one of these every Monday and every Thursday bill burr if you ever heard his podcast it's awesome so bill burr Monday morning podcast but he also does a Thursday version of it which I think he calls the Thursday afternoon Monday morning podcast but and honestly Bill is um he's good friend of mine and a brilliant comedian and is also a guy who's singular in his focus and I really admire him as a comic and it's one of the things I was thinking about when I was thinking that maybe I would stop doing commentary I'm like this fucking guy just does stand-up I mean that's what he does he just does his stand-up and look at the results they're amazing he's always got new shit he's always killing it I love watching his act he's out consistently funny but he's very singular in his focus and anyway I'm rambling uh bill burr a Monday morning podcast check it out it's awesome if you haven't heard of bill before as a comic he's not just one of the best alive today he's one of the best ever he's one of my all-time favorite stand-up comedians so with that let's end this fucking thing so thanks for tuning in I may do this again or it might be completely fucking burnt out or I might freak myself out about how goddamn crazy I sound when I start rambling about artificial intelligence and the the birth of alternative dimensions and universes out of the mind of monkeys but until then alright that's it goodbye thank you appreciate the fuck out of people and talk to you
