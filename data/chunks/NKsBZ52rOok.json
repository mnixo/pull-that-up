a highway at night and you kind of hit that thing where it's like you just everyone stops talking for a minute and you're looking out the window and you can feel like I'm just kind of staring off no one's talking and then after like 15 seconds of silence Julie goes they would tell you by the time I saw a guy cut open at the tenderloin in 1979 his stomach split wide open I was like what and I just

the story here so he ties it all together with so he went on something just something he got an appearance he told the story a mug and her hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig on fire and all of a sudden he blew up overnight because yeah I realized people like those stories I never knew that I had stories from the part of the country I'm in in the neighborhood I grew up in I thought everybody had these stories he's like chill son and I thought I'd tell you i mogul hooker and lighter wig on fire you go yeah well I mug ten hookers and let ten wigs on fire like I didn't know I had stories well in their way it's a swap meet in Jersey they called what do they call a market something like that yes and I was a Cajun I used to go to where they used to do that the bicycles whatever those street car races yeah and next door to it they had what whatever was called and you'd go there and they had pretty much shit that was stolen it was just a festival and they tried the table free because everything was 50% off even the sneakers I remember and then we found out that the guy would go to the fucking factory and jump over the fence and take over the sneakers hell mistakes all right so the regulars mm-hmm they would take those and just sell them at those for swapping work at swap meets oh and then we found out we cut into his action I swear to god we could we we cut into that action and the Binaca action the naka of those tubes are blocked breath spray they would throw thousands of a mount with the little things like the chemical was off you start blinking through much like the chemical be off then it was better spray real nice really people would spraying and you see what happened it's not regular Binaca what is that teargas it was like the TAS [Music] the Spanish kid that was a frittata and we make him jump the fence and we'd have thousands of tubes Oh we'd saw him for 50 cents a piece on Monday the 6th and 7th grade hilarious but there was always three kids that complained it was a little like the chemical imbalances on Facebook even friends with me from high school the pussy wouldn't get wet so they should call the dry hump offender in Jersey needs to call a fair view to check Xena also said she had some type of VD so they called the Laurie jack you know like she's got the jack live it now when they CDC sang a song he's got the jack Jack Jack's I used to call her name and Jack like that was her like they just tormented this girl Oh saw my car I got a score I got coke she's got money I'm gonna fuck her I'm excited we go back to a hotel we finally registers like $30 they asked us through one of the Jacuzzi in the room and shit was one of those dirty hotels on Tunnel II as you go on in New York City we went in there we walked in and she was rule number one you are not gonna fuck me it's 5:00 in the morning there goes my fuckin there goes this night and honestly she looks at me she goes well if you could guess the color of my panties I'll fuck you I'm like okay red and she goes take green but good enough we started snorting coke eat mass I mean it was filthy I went to her five in the afternoon and Doug Flutie was throwing that quarterback that puts down the 1984 83 Doug Flutie I was waking up she was naked Rissa thought fucks Turtles man now his fucking his killer I mean music is so hard to pin down it's just it's funny too because you know we had a bit of it we had a falling out recently and I I'm you couldn't find a bigger Sturgill fan than me I just listened to his record on the way over here and it's a fucking masterpiece but he also won't fucking talk talk to me right now what happened well here's the thing I don't even mind talking about right in an interview I said that he was in but is honestly what I believe I think he is you're gonna laugh when I say it but I swear this is where I fucking believe I think he's a paid CAS s I just let that sink in forcing I think he's taking motherfuckers out and they got this farm and they had these horses there was over a hundred hours of footage of these people getting fucked by animals and one guy they tape it mm-hmm no there's a video of it you can watch it you want to see absolutely look things go wrong all the time you can crawl up on the couch you can declare yourself a victim you can give up or you can recognize that that's just part of life and wake up the next day with a smile on your face and continue to move forward and just do your best I've told my told the truth I think it's really hard to do any damage to somebody who's willing to tell the truth regardless of the consequences and then I admit mistakes I think mistakes have a way of so compounding themselves just because people don't acknowledge those mistakes so given this pitch all I want to do is just get in the polls that determines who is in the presidential debates I think that if I'm in the presidential debates I have an opport unity of actually winning because of this package that you've allowed me to present here today Joe thank you that's why the bad girls club show is the greatest single team if I haven't seen it Oh put a bring up trailer for it if you're listening this is gonna be good they just get they get it like we talked about this eight pieces of garbage and then he is fuckin make them drinking stuff him in a goddamn house for three four three months and it's it's they had to go to the hospital for the fights dude fights they've had this year particularly it goes I'm over there trying to twerk and this bitch is like you know she trying to work next to me she's right might work space and it's like the bitch can't work like me you shouldn't be in the same level and then it's like having fights like two adults each other's facials bitch cuz you ain't on my twerk level that's why I'm up in your face cuz you ain't on much work level Tom Cruise II like a traveling King you know like he's got many many trailers like and like base so like you know you arrived in a situation you think right era my prejudices about Tom Cruise all the things I've read all the things I've heard go prejudice right like we meet him he blasted me with such affability and charm that they melted away ice cones then the pure heat of the man sweetness you go like on the sofa it was my birthday during that film I got a big basket full of like you know yoga related things and stuff like that this sort of forceful presence you remember in a shake your hand remembers your name to remembers details about eggs I could break if you mentioned your arm II or something in the conversation next conversation you'll mention that on e I went round he's asked then I was really really late cause of that fucking monkey actually flying up it like he was not working that day away went Mandy's asked he was he when he would married Katie Holmes and was that little famous Tom Cruise Suri Cruise was there and all all lined up I went now I was very very late and like they do eat and and there goes ah well do you wanna still eat I mean yeah you know Willie and I had to sack like I'm sat with you now Joe obviously Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and the little darling one I was fuckin eating spaghetti like is that's a complicated thing to eat Victor Cruz's looks as long isn't it I've tried that lady in the Tramp shove that shit in and then the next course I think was the sauna which was weird because that's two pasta courses then I think there was like some cupcakes and stuff involved all the way for it i sat opposite Tom Cruise talking about communism which I bought up as a topic which in retrospect was a mistake why well because don't bring up communism let me ask you this I got a P can I hear in the spring bottle water I just whip your dick out bro okay guess how much it's not small enough for that don't piss all over my floor here yeah you could do it in there just just cornhole that i'm bucho but we have to go soon anyway because I got to get something that's nice we put the camera near stick over the meat go first folks that's the first time anybody's peed on the pocket don't take a photo of the dick it's blocked well yeah you're gonna cuff I'm insisting you guys stay taking a photo of your dick bro what okay that's a full kombucha definitely don't drink that you're gonna piss in the pickles too and God Oh bro how'd you cut off stream for sure you dribbling on my car but it's like fully piss are you fully pinched holy piss this cock Jamie pulled up the fuckin definition is this an urban dictionary better definition I think than the one you gave oh how dare you a damask elated millennial liberal male who often speaks of white privilege and modern feminism blames white men for all the world's problems hmm the new definition er put it now they're the definition unlike me John I like this though there goes chat again with the megaphone telling everyone that he's a vegan what a kook okay I like that did you do you stay in anyway in touch with those kids from back in the day from kids a bully do that you ever it was actually funny after the Ultimate Fighter um I got invited out by one of the guys um and just because I think a couple of people well just yeah I saw one of the guys who was on the main guys and he's like hey that's just so I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth and so when we go out here whatever I'm like alright I'll go and well he had actually brought me into a the sushi restaurant and all around the table was most of the people that were not most there's probably like eight or ten people but they were some of the main kids that were at that party when I dressed up and everything why man if you if we'd have known you were a fighter or you know you could kick their butts and we wouldn't done that to you I'm just like it so I told my own the bathroom just left from anyways only time I ever done anything like that but I just like I can't can't be around these guys and I don't think we should talk about Trump if for a long time but but that's he's got a lot of charisma say we want another guy he's got a ton of charisma that scared kind of charisma yeah he's got like this mean guy charisma you want him to like you so you say things like you don't even believe yeah because you want him to like think that you're on his side so they won't come after you yeah it's a bully charisma yeah that's absolutely right but it's charisma nonetheless like that's the and that's the thing about stars and movie stars which is like that is like you're watching this guy you watch Denzel Washington waiting for him to snap he never does but your wait you can tell he's gonna he just doesn't it's like Robert Downey jr. I feel like with Robert Downey jr. you're watching a guy not do cocaine yeah he wants to do everything in him wants to do cocaine so you're watching a guy not actively not do cocaine from second to second that's such a good analysis yeah that you're just drunk you just watching this guy this thing this car accident that never happens I know somebody talk to a cop and they say that when how they started working and then 11 years later oh yeah going into those areas where these things always happen and after years and yeah it just it just wears on you for sure and I know from the air just me growing up in situations you know me yeah I wouldn't want to go back I barely go back there you know so but it do give you nerves your nerves heighten it naturally kicks in 100% you know and like yeah and some people can't handle those nerves mmm you've learned how to breathe quietly you don't know like somebody you could walk down the street and somebody can put a little pistol out on you and those things though I've been driving on the street with my ex lady and she was talking and I was like get down cuz I saw a guy draw on a corner and shoot across the street at another guy I don't you and as this gun went up we drove under the the fire right it was long was long oh my god - and as he went up we went under oh no we got a second shot off and I drove and I was like man that was crazy like I'm that guy I made it like you know he made that was crazy and she's like you can call the police and I'm like for what is he like to tell what happened I was like no I don't want to and that's how crazy is the way you don't even want to be involved because you got to go to the cops and I know calling the police and he's like he described a victim I was like white t-shirt blue jeans that's all I see it and it was like was he black and it was just a long pause there's a long pause they like sir is he black and I like my analytical black man men do that all and I have several of those in my own not nuclear family about my family of procreation so my rule don't say who but rude all right and and here's another thing that you never admit that you're wrong Yeah right because admitting that you're wrong makes you lose face hmm and that's such a detrimental dynamic to have right I mean you know I might come home at night and I've had a tough day and I might respond curtly to my dog I actually will go back and then hug my dog because I have enough self-awareness to realize that I didn't give her enough attention right so I have enough humility to never mind you know another human my dog is just as important to me and if I responded curtly I will sort of apologize to her yet I've got family members again this is not my family of my wife or kids but the family that I was born into that have never apologized about anything because they come from a cultural landscape where to apologize to your child to somebody younger is to lose face a parent is always right and I mean that might work when you're two but when you're both now adults I think you sort of have to get out of that and realize that we all make mistakes and we all have to own up to them like I want to see me get beat the fuck up just Jamie I'm is it Jamie showing a video of me about to get my ass kicked by Nick Diaz how you get destroyed really bad I would imagine if the game is realistic pull it up come on I get fucked people want to see it wait but they might have uses your secret character they might have you uh got some bullshit skills might have you juiced up I got it is a maggots umbrella with gills let's hear Mike cuz you know I'm super casual fans so my commentary no brother with the leg kicks I've never heard this before oh oh brogre with the leg kicks brooke Rogan get kicked in the face oh oh Rogan with the kicks Diaz is back of that Rogan missed oh oh really I kicked in the chest tattoos accurate look at that and a lot of Scientology training in terms of what it imparts to people is a quality of being direct being assertive being confident being in charge and being okay with sort of dominating the situations that you're in it's one of the reasons that I think it appeals a lot to actors because it it's it works I think for people who have any sort of insecurity or who are going into situations of uncertainty and it allows you to almost reprogram your circuits in some way and be okay about using assertive body language and and speech and it also imparts the sense that you have all the truths necessary to save humanity from itself not just Humanity on earth but through it throughout our time and space and it is your obligation to ensure that those truths are saved saved for posterity and communicated as widely as possible in a totally unadulterated fashion because any adulteration of the message means that not only do they not work they become toxic and dangerous is it good I like it let me try something give it a go what do you do with it just take a little bump put it under your lip a bump a little pinch like a cocaine style bump now we're never done that either I'd go less is less than what you asked plenty for you is that too much that's good okay where do you put it just in any way you put any lip you want okay uh-huh yeah it's gonna start to burn a little bit and I can't get cancer immediately I don't think so I mean now you shouldn't I get messages every day from people that lost 100 pounds right little feeling healthy the problem is we're dealing with Buganda and you can do one of two things you could either just say well you know this is this I think I swallowed all that tobacco yeah talk on yeah I was wondering why I'm so hot you got a bag Ilan I think it's gone are you calling yeah swallowed it bad boy I don't know what I'm doing all right chew and drinkin so all right something like that like Chris Brown like fuck is underage cousin and then piss on somebody no those are Kelly oh you're combining like three different black people I don't know who fucked their cousin but our Kelly was peeing up because it needs to put with us lately and molest them no that's the other guy that's Bill Cosco got it Jesus Christ and they're crazy like what the fuck man I can't tell black people too hard I just realized that you confused are Kelly and Chris Brown is that bad Anna clothes are off by like 15 20 years what if one of them is our age are Kelly is ours he's 49 and when did he play basketball he didn't play basketball he's a singer singer got it he sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him stupid questions yeah like did you oh you had someone do the bird as fat thing I had that was the best one yeah you know if you ever at sometimes when you go hey um you know ask me about farts or something right they'll be like like so they they know not to they check themselves on asking something provocative or that's not 100% PG so I didn't know how would go but I go oh ask me what birds so fat and the lady goes okay and and then so we just are in the middle of this interview and she goes white bird so fat no no that's a good question like I just rolled with it you know and then it grew and then a hot dog eating champion a guy that was in the Nathan Scott Joe and she placed any place yeah he's like one of the he was like a super competitive eater like a Kobayashi dude yeah yeah this guy this guy whose side you play the audio on this it's incredible life-changing stuff um dropped about a hundred pounds eight months he drops a hundred pills my cheek light day for the year but while prepping just dis amazing water richer Drive two giant inspirations first my wife that's alright second anniversary today I want to say hi to her and there's a comedian I love he's a big giant fat guy just like me Burt Chrysler he's still way bigger than I am maybe I can inspire him now explain that why do you think they did that do you think they did that because if they overturn your case if they can somehow or another because they don't want a fact check but is that it or is that discrediting you in public that was a gigantic hit movie but if they dis if they can discredit you it makes that movie still valuable not only that it stops me from running for president don't and if they can discredit me do you want to run for president I thought about it even live in New Mexico well I do i from Mexico would have had to have forsaken that that's why I didn't do it the the no the the reason why you didn't run for president cuz you would had to forsake and live in New Mexico I would have gotten I right now I would might fuckin win I know I think I could have won no the libertarians contacted me twice to come to their convention they wanted to nominate Jesse come back to America and not come Ken and I chose not to do it because I was up for the campaigning I was up to taking a taking on the damage and republish and up to do the job for four years where I'd have to end my lifestyle in Mexico because people don't realize when you take when you get one of them jobs like President or governor your freedom leaves that day you don't have freedom we're pressured and to get this money then why aren't we making fuckin more why Eric am i a bartender in addition to a paleontologist in addition to somebody that's on TV if I'm making all this Big Pharma are sorry big paleo fucking money if I'm such a shill okay yeah is that why I'm a month behind on my car payment right now is that why I'm trying to scrape together rent fuck you get aggressive oh I'm very aggressive hire these guys prestige fame and attention there's the bandwagon effect and crowd behavior and then there are people an entity wait but wait wait wait wait little wait the bandwagon effect and the car in and crowd behavior like Flat Earth bullshit okay we're only seven minutes and 53 seconds into a twenty nine minute video fuck all and I but I have a feeling I mean I don't I don't know for sure but my guess would be that if you wanted to find people who said yeah Trump grab my pussy it wouldn't be that fucking hard it's not like you're looking for Bigfoot [Applause] pretty easy to hunt them down look Eve I guess right yeah but so so it wasn't like a hard thing to do it's a breadcrumb trail yeah very simple very easy and so it's like when you realize like that then you start feeling this weird compassion for him you're like my god even with always like maliciousness and like weird perviness and stuff ultimately he he's like a fucking bowl that got put into a goddamn ring with a matador he's been doing this kind of bull fighting for like 30 fucking years for better for worse and he's we're watching what we saw last night I guess and what's interesting about it a big part of what's interesting about it is he came really close to women I mean he's still in the neighborhood of winning right plus or minus 11 points or what that means is between now and how many days do we have until the elections 21 days listen man a lot of crazy shit can happen in 21 days shift people's opinions no but apparently again from all the stats now look man I try to get I can't say any of that stuff because you don't even know if it's true they're all just talking on TV and they do brainwashing all of us to let us think that they know who the fuck's voting like I don't know if she knows how to be just herself that's a good point I mean I my problem with Hillary is it's purely an operational one I know that if I had handled I mean even in a conservative way if you look at what she did with the email server and her colleagues her cohorts did uh and you say okay it's it's you know in conservative way I'm looking at how bad it was if I had done that I would have been sent to present I know because we had various counterintelligence you know operations and also you're trying to find the leak you're trying to find the problem and you know you watch people get banged up for less egregious acts than what she's been involved in so my problem with Hillary is okay you know you one set of rules for everybody the the system is is broken in that respect but given the choices you know and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of compromise and capable of not just just breaking the entire machine and you have someone who's just he just got stepped off the set of his reality TV show and then lied about everything and a an elbowed his way you know onto your television set and never left because you know CNN couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else it's it's amazing well he's a product of attention because they realized that there's a the heated race right the heated race this guy was really famous and in a heated race this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune in to him so everybody had to tune in to him so because of him saying crazy stuff he accelerated the amount they were talking about him so they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people and but he's created a wormhole in our political process now where there's nothing so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who liked him that so he can just keep it like nuclear bombs of craziness that the the press can't ignore that every time they think okay this is the crazy thing he said that's going to harm his candidacy so let's shine a light on it it just helps him you know he could just he could you know he could either get on Twitter right now so you know who I'd like to fuck I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj hahahahaha and and it would work for him it was there for me you would see a you would see a tweet store of a billion people who say I'd like to fuck Nicki Minaj to go get her and it's insanity that's where we are when people said I was a trump supporter what they meant was they may have only seen part of what I was talking about I was writing about his skill as a persuader and what I mean is that I noticed in him the skills that I've developed over decades for persuasion but I had a higher level that I've ever seen meaning that he is the most persuasive living human I've ever experienced yeah it looks and like Trump kind of kicked our ass to Stalin it's pretty fucking weird what's that it's 264 to 215 right now is this bill we Arnold Trump this is a weird a corner I feel like the me let calm down because Trump won ah the crowd went weird on us like I was responsible was the night such a beautiful night that was probably the most fun I've ever had on a podcast i keeps I've said that before because I had so I've had we've had some fun ones together oh yeah but that man might have topped it off I don't think I've ever laughed any harder like burr had me laughing harder than I mean she's hard you can laugh and at the end of it 1:30 in the morning Trump tweets him at 1:30 in the morning little Jon Stewart is a pussy and would be hopeless in a debate with me I wouldn't even do that I'm I'm gonna I'll be the dude that means he was walking around talking to himself yes they think they do briefed him for the next presidential thing and he goes all right I will see you later and he closes the door he's walking around his gold totes awks it is tell rum I can do jerk-off would say I'm a fucking asshole is fucking good he had probably some woman they're going Donald don't go on the Internet don't wanna fuck this shit I have taken the shit from him fucking liberal media I'm fucking tweeting this thing out dude fuck you II probably like pressed it all down I think we just violated the new laws this is like that Hillary commercial they have the little kids watching politics bullshit little kids don't watch politics there you go it's all about the future what I'm not comfortable with this you're not comfortable with what we're doing Trump saw Trump's winning New Hampshire Hillary's winning Virginia really and there's a little kid here someone somebody decided it was a good idea I think that's totally illegal right you can't have a fucking baby on stage while people are talking about eating fake pussies that was before that was not responsible that sure I didn't but if the killer's in the flowers before we shut up by the way do the elk spend delicious I made this American chop suey with it and my wife gave a fucking bad review before anybody even tasted it and everybody just said fuck it like that she goes it looks like Hamburger Helper I've been chowing it for like four days like I out of respect for that fucking elf that you shot it's like I'm eating all this shit I don't care if it's fucking bet does it make you more aggressive what oh no Joe you fucking lunatic somebody gets in my face that might cause me to get more lunatic ain't a little bit of protein you had to beat the fuck out of people for like three decades before you could like chill smoke a little weed put on your little rascals hat and just fucking chill out can I say have you heard that study about like you know how they tried to figure out like if everybody they always say like anybody can be President of the United States right like anybody everybody in America has the same opportunities but what they found is that some people have one opportunity and other people have many opportunities and that's the difference so are you saying the world isn't fair no but you're saying I would have been a mark like a molesters and wet dream i molesters must have I remember watching a kid get molested one time oh no not not like molested but like it was definitely a an assault boom and we're live let's go change the champ let's go jail if you said anything else other than let's go champ is the first thing you said in the podcast would be a giant we had to start it off right it's the champ shed in the cannon let's go champ by the way pleasure meeting you finally YouTube shows well champ let's go champ I appreciate this so much positivity is happening right now champ all around the world people saying let's go champ yeah I couldn't imagine a champ I wanted to commit suicide and now I'm walking everywhere I go people going cheap hahaha this this is a sign that I'm back you're back I'm back let's go champ let's go champ thank you everybody tells beautiful thank you Jeff so I didn't expect any support from my from my colleagues and and it isn't that I don't care if I got it but it's here it's in some sense it's irrelevant it's irrelevant to me because my goal was I'm not saying those goddamn pronouns and the reason I'm not saying them because they're made up by left-wing ideologues and I don't like left-wing ideology I don't like ideology period and I know where corruption of speech leads and I'm not going there so let's just talk about what happened you tested positive for some estrogen inhibitors yeah SGO blocker yesterday in blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids we're we're talking about John this whole things going on with John based on a test that took place on June 16th the reason that relevant when I went through my thing I was he tested positive for some estrogen blockers those don't really have anything to do with anything they don't help your bit they're silly I think you might have just revealed something yeah he tested positive for two estrogen yeah but you just no one else knew that there you go I'm revealing it that dare you yeah well broke personal information that's what we're doing here though right Wow but this is like this is like the only way than anybody could find that out is if you talked about it boom it's out there right and that we're doing here aren't we creating some news it's a big news day basically did you take so I took a I took an off-brand cialis bill off-brand it was it wasn't actual cialis but it was described to me as being a cialis and so I thought it was a cialis and I I just took it GOP son and leaked the information during my last podcast so it's out I was concealed has leaked out information it could be is it what he said to me out there I know nothing I didn't hear anything I was not there I'm not talking about honestly I'm in a weird position because I don't think you're supposed to I don't think he's supposed anybody's supposed to be talking about the medical results until like it gets released I don't know how it works I really don't I want to plead ignorance great I plead ignorance all day rattle name I think he probably took boner pills because that's they have all that shit in them you know like they have boner pills have steroids and um do I have a boner pill and me like opening right now because I just found a Jo's gas station over here it has like the best right I've never seen these right on is known for his love of the boner pill he's what you call a boner pill connoisseur he's actually read blogs about boner and directed me to reviews of boner pills they're terrified but they mean these things have steroids in them they have a bunch stuff and if you already wasn't the last thing he got busted for cocaine or something if you bust if you do cocaine a lot of guys take these because you can get hard off of having cocaine and so if he takes boner pills then he's gonna test this is a little too much speculation where's my deeply respect no I didn't think I got lucky I thought that you felt drug test when you're doing sketchy shit right but didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit some Chinese man station Rhino dick pill I I am look you know about the Rhinos my friend Ryan my friend Brian called it oh he was on the podcast he said John likes to party I bet he took one of them dick pills um no um that's funny he called it yeah well he was he was on [Music]
