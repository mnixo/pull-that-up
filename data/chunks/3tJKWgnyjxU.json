hello freak bitches well there's this thing speaking of guys who are in the business of doing heroic acts there's a you've heard of the fireman fantasy I mean that the fact that women find guys while firemen to be very attractive and actually turns out that there was a study that was done that actually shows this to be the case and I discussed this in one of my articles on psychology today if you have a guy approach women either wearing a fireman suit or not his chances of getting her phone number increases quite substantially really if he is wearing a fireman so how do they know this where do they have the same guy not where the firemen with the same approach in the same same word same script same everything one version it's called the field experiment in one version you you approach women at a cafe wearing the stuff and another version you don't the guy who actually did that research is a French psychologist his name is Nicola Egan and I've actually covered a few of his studies on my website my most read article ever over maybe three four hundred thousand readers is one of his studies where I was simply because we're gonna talk about the blowback issue now here again it was a study where he looked at the likelihood of women being picked up as hitchhikers as a function of their breast size so he actually had the same woman and they you know artificially manipulated her breast size and on different days she would stand there and and of course it turned out that men were much more likely to pick up the woman if she had the same woman if she had bigger breast size so I just summarized that study put it up and then I remember I'd gone on vacation came back from a vacation found out that it had completely gone viral but I had a million hate mail not just from readers but from fellow Psychology Today bloggers who were arguing that I was you know peddling pornography because I had a picture as the teaser image for that article I had a photo of a woman sitting in a passenger seat with big wood large breasts well it seemed appropriate for the topic given that that's what the topic of the study was but by putting that image I was objectifying women I was treating them as mere sex objects and so even though I had nothing to do with the study and I was simply summarizing somebody else's work I was a horrifying pornographic peddler isn't it funny that just a photograph of a woman with large breasts is considered pornographic but now listen to this so then I've also written articles on Psychology Today where I talk about all the kinds of issues dealing with penis size you know so do women want a guy with a bigger penis are they more likely to have orgasm if he's got a bigger penis if you're in a gay relationship man man are you likely to be top or bottom as a function of your penis size that study has been done by science and so and for those articles I put sexy images of men so then I wrote to each of those people who had written the hate man I said well for in all fairness you now have to write an equally hateful thing because I'm also sexually exploiting men's bodies of course they went away and never came back we have the I think this is one of the coolest times ever to be alive I really do and I think that one of the reasons why it's one of the coolest times ever to be alive is because it's just so chaotic it's so strange and no one can do anything about it no one can stop it no they're gonna try to net neutrality they're gonna try to put the brakes here and charge people for that and you're gonna you're in trouble and you're on a list I'm gonna watch you what do you try to be anonymous you fucker I want to know where you were we were we were talking about this right before the show like all that shit that's coming out like all the corruption and anger and government incompetence I'm starting to believe that it has to be there because that's what wakes us up to we don't need so many agencies we don't need like so many wars and so much bullshit let's just decide things for ourselves and of course we need some walls we need some police we need some roads and that's really it thank you very much you know like have a nice day we don't need you archiving fucking baby photos yeah that's been we've gone over the wine and so you're seeing that people realize that people realize that banks are ineffective in greedy people realize that the old media is dying out they don't give a shit about their viewers so they're just moving to better stuff and it's happening across the board in pretty much every industry even um I had this woman Tiffany van Gogh II on my show recently he was another podcast host and she was talking to me about how all these grocery stores now have an organic section that's taking off and so you're seeing like this we have new standards like that's I think what's happening is that we have higher standards than we used to and so across the board is better stuff yeah there's no doubt that things are getting more complex and harder to control there's no doubt and there's no doubt that these old systems whether it's like afternoon when you watch the news at 6 or 5 or whatever the fuck it is it seems like you're watching a parody right the anchorman is becoming more and more I mean when you watch if you try to watch like the LA news try to watch any of those channels local news at 5 o'clock it's like these people are aliens right miss you I think these things were not supposed to exist forever and that's why to us it seems so kind of silly is like it's supposed to be dying out that's like then it's the new season new stuffs gonna come out it's kind of like fashion right like every year it's gonna be something different that's the way it works now it's a corporate media and centralization top-down type stuff is dying out and I'm sure it'll continue to exist in a bunch of different forms but that idea is getting weaker and weaker [Applause]
