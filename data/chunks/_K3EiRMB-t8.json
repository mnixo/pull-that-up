hello freak bitches you have amateur fights yeah I fought in the amateurs and dude there was a time when I thought you know and I think that's why I can you know deal with the fighters and I understand you know like dealing with the Ultimate Fighter there was a fucking time in a day when there is the only fucking thing I cared about was boxing that's why I literally walked out of that place because I loved it so much that that's all I fuckin wanted to do the problem is you go out there and you start fucking you know that that's what I wanted to do for a living and then the reality starts to set in and I'll never forget I mean I I've told the story before but I was in the gym one day and there was this dude who was a local fighter I don't say his name you would probably fucking know if I said his name I guarantee you you know because he was famous in the Boston area you know like a local guy and he came in one day and he was like he's in his early 30s he was like 31 or 32 and he was fucked up you know he was punchy he fucking moping around kind of throwing fucked on ice I remember the day that I looked at my said fuck what if that happens to me and then the minute you fucking start thinking like that you're you're you're not the real deal you're not no matter how much you think you want it or you think you do was the day I realized that I wasn't and I was fucking like wow so then you start going how the fuck am I going to make a living doing this and me and this dude Peter Welsh from Boston started you know teaching people how to box basically you know businessman and stuff because the business model wasn't if first it's like martial arts if you want to take a martial arts class it's fucking 50 martial arts studios anywhere in any city anywhere in the world there has been since I was a kid right any mmm lack of martial arts schools around your place when you were growing up no so if you want to buy but if you want a box you got to go and fight go get your fucking head punched yeah you know enemy especially you know the places in Boston oh yeah yeah the Somerville boxing club you had the fucking place down and don't McDonough down in South Boston yeah yeah and and and some play the petrol Nellie's down in Brockton yeah in places like that and you went in and they would fucking you'd get your dick knocked loose right if you came back maybe they'd fucking work with you but even guys that liked you would do that like I got I got trained by Joe Lake and that's that's what he did with me he just stuck me in with guys in a box they all do good luck be that who they all do yeah yeah that's they do it quickly - like what right right from the beginning find out how much you enjoyed doing this do you really want to do this waste of my time here - exactly right I'm gonna teach you how to throw some punches and then we're gonna put your headgear on let me put your fucking Vaseline on your face in there kid show me what you got the first time I ever went into box they had me do fucking ring circles you know what those are right we go laterally around the ring fucking coming in every day that ring circles ring circles ring circles ring circles and I was like the fuck I paid my dues I paid my fucking eight bucks you know what I mean oh I fuck you got mad one day I said I came here and learned how to fucking box me I've been running around in circles for fucking weeks he's like oh you want to wear my box right yeah fucking get like fucking geared up man love yep they throw you in there and they beat the fuck out of you yeah fucking drop me 50 times with body shots punching my fucking head in the worst of the body shots when you first started you start taking some body shots from a guy who knows how to throw them and you know your fucking lips are bleeding your nose is bleeding you're fucked up you get out you're completely morally destroyed you know what I mean because boxing is never or sparring is never what guys thinks it's going to be you know you watch too many fucking movies you go in and you think you're going to spar and you get chick Tatia but then you know I went home that night and I remember laying in bed thinking the whole night fuck I got my ass whooped that slug was that and I went back to the gym the next day and that was it there it's not working with you very few people actually want to fight they just want to kick someone's ass surely they understand that kind of kick your ass - like this is not going to be an even exchange and if you're not willing to go to war if you're not willing to take like big shot and be in pain and push through you're never going to do this this is you you have to figure out somewhere along the line whether or not you willing to take punishment whether or not go through punishment some guys can so that was what I bought what our business was based on you know to be Peter I yeah you could come you could come into the real gym where real fighters trained and you learn how to box just like white-collar Bob yeah so it was like you learn how to box but you didn't get your ass kicked every day but some guys you know start train for so long and get to the level where they want to start sparring but you rarely ever have white-collar guys that start sparring to want to do it if I can get you know like say you get that first ass weapon and and a lot of times what happens is it breaks and breaks out into fights you know and we had we used to we used to bring the inner city kids into you know we had this idea we're bringing inner city kids and you know in Southie back then it was still very segregated so we're going to bring in blacks and Hispanics and all these other kids and bring them together and you know we're going to do all the fuck we used to bring these kids in man and we start training them and stuff and then as soon as guys would start sparring you know how many fucking situations we had were guys would come back in with bats like there'd be a bad sparring deal come back with bats or they come back with their brothers or some kind of just every fucking day that was so that whole let's bring in the inner city kids and fucking try to where it didn't go over well yeah that's plain that experiment and then work to that's a lot of work it's interesting to see the the attitude you know that used to exist back then the boxing gyms and now that people are where we're seeing this evolution in mixed martial arts where the beginning we saw a lot of like gym wars like that would be like a really normal occurrence in gyms where guys would just beat the fuck out of each other you hear about fighters getting knocked out in the gym left and right left and right but now I think people are starting to realize like well there's no fucking benefit in this like what's going on here like we're gonna we're looking at a gigantic multi multi multi-million dollar business and this is how we're treating our commodities and our prospects where we're throwing them at each other and let them blast each other and dudes are getting punchy way before their time we we both know gyms where guys they get Chinee way too quick and you go well how's this guy like would this guy had an iron changes three years ago I was taking fucking gym wars he's going through gym wars on a regular basis yep that was shoot the box that was the deal at shoot the box and Shogun himself said like we realized you know after doing that for a while we can't do that anymore we iight that's how it wasn't boxing to that when I when I was involved in boxing some of the best fights I ever saw her in the gym oh yeah you know oh hell yeah one that one day I saw a a Livingstone bramble and Roger Mayweather oh fucking go at it at a fucking gym in Vegas yeah another time why one of the gyms because because we all work together I worked with Mayweather I worked with Nick one kick arm Floyd when Floyd was first coming I mean we all work together in these gyms you know and uh one time there was this dude he was a heavyweight his name was Tracy and him and Roger Mayweather fucking got into it he was Tracy was a young heavyweight 24 year old kid heavyweight and Roger was fucking 147 yeah in his 40s geez I just like what you say motherfuckers it's at the fucking gate into it both off back and forth I go shit here we go and I got in the fucking ring and start a fight man yeah yeah they started fucking fighting and at the end of the round when the bell went off Tracy tried to stop and Roger fucking lit him up and he goes no rounds motherfucker no round so they just kept fighting straight fucking through until fucking Tracy quit oh my god Roger fucking whooped his ass and he fucking quit and it's in 40s yeah and then and then when he quit Roger hit him another eight nine times after he fucking quit and he's basically like don't have a fucking mouth off to me in this gym a 147 pounds 40 year old yeah but Roger a black mamba yeah you know a lot of people don't know Roger you know a lot of people everybody knows Floyd but Roger his uncle in his time he was bad motherfucker he had a piston right hand yeah he had a nasty jab and he would fucking slam that right hand in he was a bad dude for many a year I've seen some crazy shit happen in fucking champ boxing gyms man crazy shit
