the Joe Rogan experience alive in paradise I'm in Hawaii right now and I was gonna I was gonna watch the Bisping fight the Bisping Kelvin Gastelum fight live and do like sort of a breakdown of it what was happened but the shit was going on like two o'clock in the morning out here and it wasn't happening I have been eating like a pig and drinking I've been doing vacation type shit I'm a strong believer in that you need to do vacation time it's like vacation time is important you can't just be working all the time occasionally you have to just fuck off and so that's what I've been doing I just been fucking off so I was tired and I decided I am NOT gonna stay up late and so I watched it in the morning I watched it this morning and I've got a couple thoughts on it first of all Brendan Schaub said this on his Instagram and I could not agree more I don't think you should be allowed to fight three weeks after you have a brutal fight like Michael Bisping did with GSP he got rocked he got choked unconscious and then three weeks later he's fighting a really dangerous young and up-and-coming Kelvin Gastelum and Kelvin is a beast he's got nasty boxing and that is what he showed in that fight he hit him with a beautiful straight right jab and a right hand behind it and oh my goodness it was just that kid is just on fire he's just on another level right now I'm super super impressed with Kelvin Kelvin has got lightning-fast hands and he's he's an interesting guy because he's what I would call a tweener and what that means is that I don't I mean I think Kelvin in in the best best of times like if if Kelvin has the best camp and the the best performance it's entirely possible that he could beat anybody at 185 pounds but should he be at 185 pounds boy I don't know because Chris Weidman is that 185 pounds and when Chris Weidman got Kelvin to the ground it really did look like you're talking about two completely different weight classes and Chris Weidman was able to choke Kelvin out and obviously Weidman is a former champion and there's absolutely no shame in losing to Chris Weidman but it's just the way it looked when you were watching the fight to me it looked like two different weight classes and there's a lot of people that think that really Kelvin should be fighting at 170 pounds if he got the proper diet and he was doing that for a while it was at one point in time he was my Dolce was working with him for a while and he had his diet in line and he looked fantastic and then you know just things happen and he didn't want to pay the Dolce money and I don't know who he's working with right now as a nutritionist but I just I think he's a phenomenal fighter I just don't know if 185 pounds is the right weight class for him it could be I mean it could be that maybe what he really needs to do is just lose some body fat put on some muscle and maybe 185 pounds will be his wit class it's just that constant debate of whether or not you should leak in your body and drop down to the minimum weight you can or whether or not you should fight at a natural weight and have a healthy body it's it's a real good argument and I'm pausing right now because I'm pulling something out there's a girl that just died in Australia she died very recently she was preparing for a Muay Thai fight and it's just it's just part of what this sport is about unfortunately it really bothers the fucking shit out of me I think it's the scariest thing I think yeah here it is teenager dies training here it is the the girl's name she was 18 years old and her name was Jessica Lindsey and she died while she was cutting weight she was an amateur kickboxer in Australia I cut weight a bunch of times when I was doing Taekwondo tournaments and it is brutal it's it's terrible I'm I was bad at it too I didn't do it correctly I just worked out real hard the night before and more rubber suits in the whole deal and dehydrated myself and I didn't realize right myself well either so I felt like shit the next day when I was fighting and a lot of wrestlers back in the day used to do the same thing my weight cut though was nowhere near as extreme as some of the MMA fighters do some MMA fighters I mean they're getting on death's door and I just I just think it's one of the most disturbing and on most unfortunate aspects of MMA Kevin Lee said before his last fight with Tony Ferguson that you know he felt like he was he was dying when he was cutting weight and he made the weight habib nurmagomedov who's the if not the best one of the very best lightweights in the world undefeated had his body shut down last time he tried to make the weight and he couldn't make the Tony Ferguson fight they pulled him out and took him to the hospital I mean I'm I'm beating on a dead horse here because it's something everybody knows everybody's aware that it's a it's a terrible terrible aspect of our sport and in my mind it's contrary to what martial arts are supposed to be about so in that sense I encouraged Kelvin to stay at 185 pounds because obviously the guys knocked out Vitor Belfort at 185 he just got knocked out former champion Michael Bisping at 185 pounds I mean he could knock out anybody 185 but a guy liked Chris Weidman who's very smart about cutting weight he cuts a lot of weight but he does it the right way rehydrates the right way and he's just a fucking beast he's just so much bigger and when he got Kelvin to the ground and submitted him with a head an arm choke boy it just really seemed like that's the wrong weight class for Kelvin and then you see Kelvin next fight like Bisbing and fucking lights him up in the first round now would he have been able to do that if he fought the Bisping that was training for Georges st. Pierre I mean if Bisping did not have the Georges st. Pierre fight and just went right into the Kelvin Gastelum fight would the same result of happened it could very well have the way Kelvin hits he's fast as fucked his hands are beautiful he throws really crisp straight punches and in this sport it's there's not a whole lot of guys who have crisper sharper hands at 185 pounds than Kelvin I mean he just has beautiful head movement and boxing and when he moves in for the kill with those hands whoa you saw in the Vitor Belfort fight I mean he just fucked Vitor up with those straight punches and he throws them efficiently and they have snap to them and just and on top of that he's a very good wrestler I mean a lot of people forget how good his wrestling skills are on top of all that he's just a real threat at 185 pounds a fascinating thing because it's just such a wide open division he just called out Robert Whittaker who's the interim champion of course and called out Whittaker and wants Whittaker to to fight him next but of course Robert Whittaker is waiting for the big payday I would too if I was him to fight George st. Pierre so it's it's a wide-open division now that st. Pierre choked out Michael Bisping and then gelt Kelvin just lights up Bisping and of course you've got to think that Weidman is still in the mix I mean even though Y been lost to Yoel Romero and then lost two gay card Mousasi he's still in the mix he was winning that Yoel Romero fight in my opinion until he got caught with that wicked flying knee but that's the danger of fighting Yoel Romero you√µll Romero could do that to anybody in the world he's just such a fucking freak athlete so really really wide open division I'm bummed as fuck that gay guard went over and decided to fight for Bellator but I get it you know I mean these guys got to go where the money is and at Bellator he easily could be a champion I think he could be a champion in the UFC as well and maybe we will see him in the UFC again I mean he could easily fight a year or two over in the UFC and then come back over K guard still relatively young but it's nice to have competition I think competition is good for everybody and I think it I think it really elevates the sport it elevates the level of sport I in it you could see by the results that a lot of these UFC fighters are having especially lorenz larkin who is very good he's a very very good striker he loses to Lima in a bid for the title and then loses by knockout to the always dangerous Paul de Leeuw so I think Bellator and now especially in that 170 pound division you've got Rory MacDonald Bellator is really showing they have absolute world championship caliber caliber talent over there so to get back to that fight I agree entirely with to get back to the piste being in Kelvin Gastelum fight I agree 100% with what Brendan Schaub said that you really have to protect a fighter from themselves you really can't be letting a guy fight three weeks after an absolutely brutal fight like that it just does not make sense it just does not make sense I don't think it's smart I mean I understand the UFC needed someone to fill in and short notice because Anderson Silva tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and they did not want to lose the Shanghai main event so it turns into an even bigger fight when you've got the former middleweight champion right off of his lost three weeks later fighting again but it's just not smart I know Bisping wanted to do it I know Bisping would probably do it again if you asked him to do it yeah if you asked Bisping to fight in a couple of weeks we'll probably probably do it again and and someone was talking about him fighting in England I believe in March which boy I mean that's less crazy but still crazy right because we're basically in into December so you got December January February three months off really and then March but of course during that time he's going to be sparring and you know you know Bisping he's a fucking animal he's not gonna train easy he's not gonna take much time off and there's a lot of debate as to how much time a fighter should be forced to take off after they get knocked out and here's the thing about that you're seeing guys when they're fighting and you've seen them getting knocked out and you're seeing them fighting you know X amount of months later so you saw Bisping he didn't get knocked out by Georges st. Pierre but he certainly got rocked with that left hook and then he got choked out when he was on the ground out now for people who don't know a lot about MMA getting choked out he's not nearly as bad as getting knocked out it's there's almost nothing to it the way to look at it is if you look at a garden hose and you know how you've been to garden hose and cramp it down and it stopped the water from coming out that's exactly what happens to your fucking brain when you get choked out when you get choked out it's basically cutting off the blood your brain you wake up and you're fine you don't have memory issues you don't have balance issues for the most part especially if you've only been out for a couple of seconds um it happens all of the time in training I've seen many many guys get choked unconscious I've choked people unconscious they come back and they're fine it's not that big of a deal but you got to realize before he got choked unconscious he got hit with a big and left hand and hurt and it was a great fight before that both guys were were giving and taking fighters need time off after fights so you're seeing that right you're seeing the actual competition between George st. Pierre Michael Bisping but were you not seeing as how many times he got hit during training did he get rocked ever did he get clipped and dropped did he get dropped and hurt and take a couple days off and get back to training again only he knows only his camp knows and most of times they're not talking but you hear about it all the time a matter of fact I was talking to Forrest Griffin once and Forrest was telling me that before he fought Anderson Silva he was knocked unconscious twice in training that's fucking crazy I mean here he is about to fight the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time next to I mean if there's there's the there's three guys in that debate right my my number one guy right now is Mighty Mouse I think just he he represents the highest skill level but does he represent the highest competition level in terms of like the guys he's faced I don't think so I think number one competition level is John Jones John Jones has choked out lyoto machida Rampage Jackson he's beat Rashad Evans he B Alexander Gustafsson he beat Glover Teixeira he beat Vitor Belfort he beat Daniel Cormier twice I mean fuck he's beaten everybody I think you look at competition wise John Jones is a very strong argument for the greatest of all time but Anderson Silva's fucking right there too man and Silva in his prime I think when you look at the way he knocked out Vitor Belfort with that front kick to the face when you look at the way he fought Forrest Griffin and in that fight that we were just talking about and ko'd him like a magician the way he fought Stephan Bonnar literally put his back up against the cage again Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin they're just no disrespect they're not at the same level as lyoto machida or Glover Teixeira or some of the guys that John Jones is phased but it's the way Anderson beat them I mean Anderson was just in his prime he was a fucking master like a real master so Forrest Griffin fighting Anderson Silva after being Kayode twice in training camp is just insane but these are the things that fighters do when they have to do them you know you're talking about a giant payday you're talking about a big fight you give the guy a chance like do you want to fight do you think you could fight yeah yeah I could do it I could do it and they go out there and they're compromised and they get clipped and you see it immediately sometimes sometimes you see guys they get clipped and you don't know what I mean they get hit with something and look at any done any time when a person is throwing a punch or kick at you and it connects it can put you out but there's no doubt at all no doubt about it that the resiliency of a fighter after they've been ko'd is compromised there's just no doubt about it when you see a guy who's been Kayode and then you see them get hit just weeks months later they cannot take a shot the same way their brain is still recovering their body is still recovering from the concussion and you you have to figure out a way to balance being a risk-taker and seizing an opportunity which is a huge opportunity versus concentrating on having a long and healthy career now that said for Michael Bisping he's kind of at the end of his career I mean he said essentially that he wants to fight one more time in England which would be beautiful for him and I hope they give him you know a good match up so it'll be a good fight for the fans and I hope they give Michael some time off like you know give the man some time to really relax and then go through a real nice 3-4 month training camp get in excellent shape and give his best effort for one more go at it I would like to see that but it might be the hardest shit in the world to talk a fighter into retiring or two for a fighter to figure out when to retire I was just talking to Matt Brown um he came to see me in Denver and I was telling him us like dude that fight that you had with Diego Sanchez what a perfect way to go out beautiful spectacular knockout classic Matt Brown fight just blood and guts he's one of my all-time favorite fighters to watch for sure because he's so fucking ferocious you knew when you were gonna go to see a matte Brown fight if Matt Browns fighting anybody win lose or draw that guy was gonna have to face hell Matt Brown would bring it in the ferocity intensity that that guy would bring inside the Octagon this is unrivaled and I think about Matt is he's he's not like an unbelievably physically gifted guy he's not like some Kevin Randleman character you know there's been guys that are just physical freaks you know Anthony Rumble Johnson there's a you know Brock Lesnar there's guys that are just physically they're just freakish they can do things that are just incredibly unusual and then there's guys that their mind is just unbreakable they're just a fucking warrior to the core down to the cells that's Matt Brown and Matt Brown can lose he's lost before but he just loses because his body gives out it's never because his mind gives out I mean that guy is coming to fucking kill you every time he gets into that octagon and I love that about him I mean it's one of my all-time favorite fighters to watch for sure and when I was telling him congratulations I mean it's an amazing way to cap off a career it's like I might not be the last one so he's still you know even I have to going through all those wars you know he's in his 30s now I believe he's like 35 I think he is maybe 36 and you know still wondering I think he's 36 still wondering like is this it good one more do I do one more one more because the thrill that you experience I mean obviously I've never fought inside the Octagon so I'm just guessing but the thrill just fighting in general it's such a much higher level of danger and excitement than most people experience in everyday life and it's incredibly addictive and it makes regular life seem dull and gray in comparison when those guys get into the octagon when a guy like Matt Brown smashes an elbow down on Diego Sanchez and Diego slumps and goes limp and the crowd goes insane and you know when just when Matt got into the Octagon there's a crazy video of the fight while we're watching the fight Matt steps into the Octagon steps through the cage and fucking roars I mean roars like you see it in his face you see it in his eyes he just opens his mouth and screams that motherfucker was there to fight that's what he loves to do and it was finally there was finally happening gets through the training camp steps into that octagon it's go-time that is as exciting as life is going to be for him or for any combat sports athlete and it is incredibly incredibly hard to give that up once you've experienced that man I mean you've seen in these guys it's so hard for them to know when to walk away but I think it's incredibly critical to balance out the glory of combat sports the glory of giving your all and going out on your shield sometimes and sometimes winning with vicious knockout or incredible submission but knowing when the body has taken enough knowing when your vehicle is damaged to the point where you should not be engaging in competition anymore and it's different for everybody and it's so hard to figure out when and some guys just know some guys just know and they go you know what I'm good that's it I don't feel it anymore I'm gonna step away TJ grants a good example that here's a guy that was supposed to be fighting for the title he's about to fight for the UFC lightweight title and nobody ever heard from him again he was suffering from concussion syndrome he just had a real hard time recovering from a concussion that he got in training and never fought again took a regular job he's done some training training fighters and stuff but never decided to get back into the Octagon again Chris holdsworth it's another example got a training injury got hit in the head and training real bad got a concussion and decided to stop and that was it very hard for these guys to figure out when so next Saturday December 2nd there's a big fight it's a rematch between max Holloway and Jose Aldo you also have Alistair Overeem and Francis and Ghana on that card whew Henry cejudo and Sergio Pettis Eddie Alvarez and Justin cagey who just those four fights right there holy shit holy shit I know I talked about Holloway versus Aldo before what I like about this fight is first of all the first fight was very good until although ran out of gas and Holloway took over all those Kamp was saying that going into that fight Aldo had a leg injury which kind of makes sense because really didn't throw many leg kicks but he also didn't throw very many leg kicks against Frankie Edgar I think the strategy for then for that fight though was that he was worried about the takedowns of Frankie Edgar so he had decided to avoid being taken down one of the best ways to do it would be just to avoid kicking in just outbox him and he did that very well in that fight and won a pretty clear unanimous decision this is going to be a different fighter I mean max Holloway is in his prime he beat although the first time around is he and he's incredibly confident he's gonna be able to beat although the second time although those said that he had this leg injury and it prevented him from throwing leg kicks but that it's better now and that's one of the reasons why he's excited about fighting Holloway again now if that is the case and if although is in tremendous shape because he took this fight on relatively short notice he did not get a full two three months training camp I think it was five weeks maybe more I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that I'm not looking at it right in front of me but I know it wasn't a full camp because I know it was supposed to be Frankie Edgar Edgar got injured and so all those steps in so we're gonna find out we're gonna find out if Aldo can make the proper adjustments and whether or not the ability to throw leg kicks is going to make a difference because all those leg kicks classically in history have been some of the very best in the game if you look at his fight with you Riya Faber it's one of the very best uses uses best use of leg kicks maybe in the featherweight division ever and just smash your eye off a bird's leg to the point where I mean it's one of the all-time grossest and injuries in MMA Uriah is left leg was like twice the size of his right leg and how to do a bunch of crazy therapy to recover from him cleaning hyperbaric chamber and you know he documented it your eyes he's such a cool dude he's I love that he did this he he documented a lot of the injury online to show everybody like look how fucked up my leg is and that's all - at his best is Aldo the same guy now I mean he's gone through 29 professional MMA fights at the highest level he's been champion for a long time and you know he's had some Wars the second fight with Chad Mendes was a war of course he got stopped quick by Conor McGregor the fight with max Holloway was a war I mean he's been through some some really tough fights does he still have that same level you know we really don't know and we're gonna find out hopefully we're gonna find out from an inch shape I mean I don't know what kind of camp he was involved in like how hard he was training rather before he entered into camp for this championship fight I'm hoping that he was in good shape and that's one of the reasons why he was so eager to take the fight and we're gonna find out we're gonna fly on Saturday night and that's very interesting but maybe even more interesting is Alistair Overeem and Francis in Ghana because our over it was one of the most experienced guys in the division of course Overeem is the former dream heavyweight champion former Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion and former k1 grand prix champion one of the very best kick boxers to ever fight in MMA without a doubt but you want to talk about a guy who has been in wars like let's Google Alistair Overeem's overall record because it's got to be fucking crazy as far as the number of times he's been stopped I mean it's really fucking bananas let's go and look well first look at his MMA career it will count this up and this is no disrespect to him I'm a huge Alistair Overeem fan and I'm not saying that you should retire or anything crazy like that but let's just take a look at how many times he's been stopped just in MMA okay so he won two fights in a row fantastic victory over Mark Hunt he killed him with knees and won a split decision over Fabricio Werdum or actually a majority decision won one of the referees I guess call or one of the judges called it a draw I thought that there was a very close decision but I thought that for Doom was gonna get the nod quite honestly let's look at the times he's lost though steep a Miocic when he fought for the title knocked him out okay before that Ben Rothwell knocked him out before that Travis Brown knocked him out before that Antonio Bigfoot Silva knocked him out brutal knockout so that's just within the last four years in the UFC he suffered four brutal knockouts before that Sergey Kharitonov knocked him out brutal knockout in 2007 ten years ago Mauricio Shogun who uh knocked him out also in 2007 he lost to Ricardo Arona he got stopped in that fight he tapped two strikes hoji rio Nogueira stopped him little nog stopped him his corner stopped it by it's a TKO that was in 2006 he got stopped by Fabricio Werdum but that was a Kimura on that a submission Shogun who stopped him the first time in 2005 so Shogun knocked him out twice he TK Odom in 2005 and kayoed him in 2007 before that little nog beat him by decision Chuck Liddell Kayode him in a fantastic fight we're over him was really coming on strong gets Chuck and then Chuck caught him with some brutal punches and K owed him that was in 2003 before that Bobby Hoffman a lot of people forgot about Bobby Hoffman way back in rings Kayode him in 2000 and that's it for MMA so just MMA Kos right the first ko loss we have Bobby Hoffman then we have Chuck Liddell then we have Shogun then we have little nog then we have aronia then we have Shogun again then we have kharitonov okay we already have seven that's kharitonov then we have Bigfoot Silva eight Travis Browne nine Ben Rothwell ten steepy Miocic eleven eleven stoppage losses in MMA I mean holy fucking shit that's crazy 11 knockout or stoppage losses in MMA then you go to kickboxing Badr Hari stopped him in the k1 Grand Prix Final in 2009 he stopped him he got stopped by glaube Feitosa in key occasion verses K 1 2004 he got ko'd he got stopped by Bernard Paris in k1 Holland that's in 2000 so one two three Keo losses in kickboxing on top of all the other MMA losses that's a lot of fucking stoppage losses folks and it's led people to question the durability of the current guy but what we do know is that Alistair is extremely crafty and one of the things that I like about Alistar these days is since he's gone over to Jackson and Winkeljohn in Albuquerque he has become much more elusive much slicker on his feet moves around a lot more and doesn't just try to smash people the uber iam the guy that we saw fight brock lesnar when in his UFC debut that was like classic uber which is jacked to the tits smashing people running through people he would meet force with greater force now what you're seeing is we've seen as the ouster over in the fought Junior dos Santos who fought an incredibly clever fight moved around well he was very very slick very difficult to hit and then started scoring on junior and then eventually caught him with a beautiful left hook and ko to him that's that to me is the interesting Andrei Arlovski is today a guy who realizes that perhaps he can't take a punch like he did when he was younger you know he's been in a lot of really really tough fights as we just went over and realizes like hey now I have to be smart now I have to be clever I have to move around a lot I have to use my skills and his skills are substantial in my opinion he's the best right up there with Mark Hunt of course who he just beat the best heavyweight kickboxer ever when it comes to credentials he's the best kevie a kickboxer ever in MMA really no no a heavyweight kickboxer other than him and hunt have ever won the k1 Grand Prix and hunt won it he stepped into the finals as an alternate he had lost earlier that night not to take anything away from because of course marcotte is still just one of the all-time greats when it comes to kickboxing but when Mark Hunt won he one would go to that record right here Mark Hunt won the k1 Grand Prix he won it he lost that night mmm see see he's he's fought the k1 grand prix a couple of times he lost to Semmy Schilt he got a TKO by a spinning back kick and he won well he's got damn he's fought a lot of fucking awesome kickboxing fights - so he lost to Ray Sefo in 2001 and the semi-finals and then he won that night he beat Stefan Leko so he lost to Ray Sefo Ray Sefo apparently couldn't continue and then he came back to win I'm getting that right yeah looks like he beat Stefan Leko in the semi-final well it says semi-finals says wins K 1 Grand Prix Championship 2001 ok he fought Fransisco figlio but that was in I'm looking at a different date that was in 2002 or 2001 he'd be feel it anyway I'm rambling did you notice yeah I'm talking too much but so he's fighting Francis Francis in Ghana and Francis in Ghana who is right now ten and one of the UFC 10/10 one with zero draws so 10 wins and just been smashing everybody and if he looked at his last fight against Andrei Arlovski that was a fight where it's like probably one of the first fights we really got tested we really got to see what happens when he fights a former champion and a former really world-class fighter and it was a good test but now a bigger test is in front of him when he's gonna fight Alistair Overeem they mean we've seen him so far four times inside the Octagon he stopped Curtis blades by knockout he stopped bull han I don't know how to say this guy's name again me hi bitch me hi I remember how to go Boyan me hi ovitch I do not remember how to say homeboys name then he stopped Anthony Hamilton by submission showing that he has submission skills as well and then of course just knocked out Andrei Arlovski in his last fight it's a very interesting fight because the the question is is in Ghana ready for a guy who's got the skills of Alistair Overeem the skill the experience at the highest level the craftiness is he going to set traps and is Francis and gonal gonna be fall for those traps the other question is can all can oust her over him take a shot from in Ghana and Ghana has legitimate absolute one punch knockout power extreme confidence and he's fresh and in his prime right now actually entering his prime I mean arguably he hasn't even reached his prime yet because in Ghana is one of those guys that at 31 years of age is near his physical prime but it's still learning he's still getting better at the sport and as he fights better in better competition you're going to see more of his skills shine you're going to see where the holes are in his game and you're gonna see how he responds to adversity hopefully we're gonna get a chance to see all those things in this fight if Overeem wins there's a very good argument for him being next in line to fights deep ABO chick the real question about the heavyweight division the real question other than you know who's next for Steve Bay the real question is the health of Cain Velasquez Cain Velasquez in my opinion is without a doubt one of the greatest heavyweights of all time he's just a force of nature when he's in shape when you when you see the Cain Velasquez that beat Ben Rothwell when you see the Cain Velasquez that just storm the division when you see him in the second and third fight with Junior dos Santos that Cain Velasquez is a fucking monster the question is after all the surgeries back surgery knee surgery shoulder surgery can he come back and be that guy again as a fan I most certainly hope he can but we're really not going to know another fight in the card it's very interesting is Henry cejudo and Sergio Pettis Sergio Pettis is the younger brother of Showtime Pettis Anthony Pettis who was the former lightweight champion and Henry cejudo of course is a former Olympic gold medalist the number two ranked flyweight in the world and Henry is coming off of an absolutely spectacular ko of Wilson Hayes I was blown away by him in that fight and that fight he looked like some sort of a karate master I mean that was a it was a very very interesting fight before that he lost to Benavidez and Benavidez of course one of the most experienced one of the best guys in the division and he lost a very very close fight a fight where I've talked to his coaches afterwards and they were really pissed off by the decision they thought sudo could have gotten an odd but he rebounded and he rebounded versus Wilson Hayes and looked like a completely different fighter the thing that excites me about this fight is two things one the potential of Sergio Pettis Sergio Pettis is a young kid he's one of the youngest guys in the division he's the extremely talented younger brother of another extremely talented fighter so he's had martial arts in his life you know most of the time growing up he's 24 years old now he trained under the great Duke Rufus who in my opinion is one of the very best guys in the division in terms of his ability to coach fighters he's fucking fantastic Diouf not division I mean I should say in the in in the sport Duke Rufus is just an amazing striking coach he's a former world Muay Thai champion himself outstanding kickboxer and extremely na Abell about both kick boxing and MMA and one of the best guys in the world at training kick boxers for MMA I mean he's just fantastic and what we've seen from young Sergio we saw him get submitted by Alex casseras early on in his career and alex is just slicker and caught him on the ground and and then we saw him lose again to Ryan but knowing I I think that these losses especially for a young fighter are absolutely critical I think you find out what you're really made of you and you see what you need to improve upon and in fighting tough guys early on like Alex casseras like Ryan binoy I mean and we're talking about two years ago he fought but knowing he was 21 years old so or 22 years old he's 24 now so he's a really young kid still learning still growing on the job and has looked fantastic in his last few fights looked really good against John Moraga and looked even better against Brandon Moreno in his last fight which was a five round unanimous decision victory so this in my opinion is gonna be the toughest fight of his career because Henry cejudo just has that Olympic gold medal winner mindset the mindset of a guy like Sahu toe I mean this guy is focused on being a champion 24 hours a day and if you look at the way he fought against Wilson Hayes I mean if if that's indicative of the kind of improvement that this guy can make and Kyrian Fitzgibbons who is another fuckin phenomenal Muay Thai coach he told me that this kid is just a sponge and just can learn so fast at a ridiculous weight and I think you're looking at athletic prowess in Henry cejudo but I think maybe perhaps more important than that you're looking at his mind his mind is just ultra sharp and focused and and determined and he's just got that championship mind so I mean that's why he is an Olympic gold medalist in wrestling so he's got unparalleled wrestling skill in the division and then on top of that if you look at the Wilson Hayes fight you look at radical improvements in his striking and movement I mean he looked like a combination of a prime lyoto machida and Conor McGregor vs. with his movement against Wilson Hayes I think a lot of guys are realizing that that karate style if you have all those other bases covered if you have great wrestling if you have submissions good takedown defense and good boxing skills as well as Muay Thai everything else that karate stance that sideways stance that we see employed all the time by wonderboy Thompson that we see we see a bunch of different fighters of course lyoto machida a bunch of different fighters use that stance inside the Octagon Conor McGregor it's a very difficult stance to deal with it's if you're good at it if you're good at that movement that in and out side to side movement Michael venom page has a very unusual take on that fighting in Bellator he likes to fight like that too and of course he's a former point fighting champion that style is fucking hard to deal with it's really hard for guys to judge and if you're dealing with a guy like sudo who's lightning fast on top of that and starts moving like that with those world-class wrestling skills with excellent striking you know classic striking boxing kickboxing very difficult to deal with I'm very interested to see what style he takes or how he approaches this fight was Sergio Pettis he's quite a bit older than Sergio being 30 that's a really interesting fight I'm very curious I just do not know how that one's gonna play out one fight that I don't know how to is gonna play out but I'm fucking beyond pumped for it is Eddie Alvarez and just engage he just engage he is a fucking savage and so's Eddie Alvarez and the Alvarez is a beast anything a lot of people are looking past Alvarez you know Alvarez had just come off of that brutal knockout loss kind of a humiliating knockout loss to Conor McGregor and then after that he is involved in the the no contest versus Dustin Poirier I believe that was an eye poke that is I'm trying to remember how that fight went down but I do not I feel like someone got poked in the eye either way it's a no contest so that obviously doesn't move him up the ladder any and he's got to regroup yeah no contest here it is yeah yeah this was a ok now I remember what it was it wasn't an eye poke it was a knee to a downed opponent and it was fucking phenomenal fight well played out against Dustin Poirier they were going back and forth now I remember the fight and Poirier had Alvarez in some deep trouble and Alvarez rebounded and Alvarez I believe hit Dustin Poirier with a knee while he was down yeah that's exactly what happened and interesting yeah see this is what happened Poirier Alvarez you know herb Dean was affected defending it saying that Alvarez didn't intentionally need Poyet and if I remember the fight is a crazy war Alvarez had been rocked Poirier had been rocked by a was bloodied and Alvarez hit him with an unintentional knee that could have resulted in a disqualification win for Poirier and Portilla was saying that he looked at it as a win which is interesting so anyway poi rebounded from that fight obviously and stopped Anthony Pettis in his last fight so that the division is just crazy and unbelievably hot right now and everybody waiting to see what the fuck happens with Conor McGregor rebounding but Eddie Alvarez with the no contest and before that the KO loss to Conor McGregor desperately needs a win and he's coming in there against one of the most fuckin savage guys in the division just engaged showed in that Michael Johnson fight what he's made of and a lot of people were very excited to see him inside the Octagon he had been fighting in the world series of fighting and looking like an absolute monster but against what a lot of people thought was just not the same caliber of competition as the UFC offered and so they wanted to see what would happen if he fought a real world-class fighter and what we saw in the Michael Johnson fight it's adjusting gage he who fights I want to say reckless but he puts himself in danger and it's one of the things that makes him so exciting he forces his will on people he's a ferocious striker and an excellent wrestler as well and just fucking puts it on fighters he tests their will he puts tremendous pressure on fighters and the the fight with Michael Johnson was just a pleasure to watch it's so much fun and fucking crazy there was so much chaos in that fight and a lot of people were introduced to just engage he from that fight the hardcore fans had known him already from the world series of fighting and had heard about him through the internet but the the UFC fans and the people that were watching that night they really got a chance to be treated to just the kind of chaotic fight that is really gonna bring like a the casual fan when they see a guy like just engaging fight it's really gonna make you a fan of this kid just his style it's just there's very few guys I mean other than I mean Matt Brown who I talked about before but even Matt Brown is capable winning so many different ways whereas gage II he's gonna probably try to knock you out or get I mean he's even said himself that he might get knocked out you're probably gonna see me get knocked out he said over the next few years he's got that mindset this kill-or-be-killed mindset and it's just absolutely fascinating to see this kid compete inside the Octagon because he's so fucking crazy because he's such a fucking animal inside the Octagon he just got this undeniable killer instinct and indomitable spirit and just there's levels to this game there's levels physically and he's got a very high level physically but there's also levels mentally and that's what excites me about just egauge is is the the mental level he just has zero quit in him and he's a hundred percent ferocious so him fighting a fucking animal like Eddie Alvarez that's just a recipe for a good time and we're gonna get to see that and we're gonna get to see that next Saturday night live on pay-per-view whoo so how long we've been doing this here 49 minutes boy I can fucking talk a lot huh so also on the undercard here's another fight that's a big fight this is Charles Oliveira versus Paul Felder Paul Felder continues to impress I'll tell you what Paul Felder's a fucking phenomenal commentary guy - he did commentary guy color commentator he did a fantastic job doing commentary for Dana White's Tuesday Night Fights show and as content the canoes day night contenders show and he's done some UFC events now as well and just excellent great enthusiasm very knowledgeable great talker smart articulate guy and he's fighting Charles Oliveira Saturday night now Charles Oliveira is a guy who has had mixed success inside the Octagon and his best he's been incredible and he shows a great range of very technical striking and very very solid Brazilian jiu-jitsu but he's had some tough losses the the KO loss to Cub Swanson his he burst onto the scene with an amazing victory way way back in the day see that's not even Efrain Escudero what's his second fight inside the Octagon actually and he got him by standing rear naked choke that was a big fight because Efrain Escudero had won the ultimate fighter and it was just it was a big victory for him and he went down he lost to cowboy Cerrone he got Kayode in the first round he lost to jim miller he got submitted and then the Cub Swanson KOAT got beat up by Frankie Edgar in a very fun fight three round you honest unanimous decision then max Holloway put it on him and stopped him in the first round then Anthony Pettis submitted him so he's had some some ups and downs Ricardo Lamas KO diem excuse me Ricardo Lamas finished him by submission in the second round so he beat will Brooks by submission in the first round of his last fight and got back on track looked excellent in that fight and fought that fight you know it was like it was a real do-or-die fight for him against will Brooks a guy who was coming over from Bellator a guy was very talented and oliveira wound up submitting him there was a big victory for him and in my opinion this is one of the most dangerous fights for him right now at this stage of his career because Paul Felder is a fucking killer he's an animal he's very very strong physically he's a big 155 pound or as Oliveira is a smaller 155-pound our guy was fought at 145 before but just really had a hard time making that weight Felder's gonna have a power and strength advantage and Oliveira is going to have to be crafty and in my opinion his best way to win this fight is to get this fight to the ground and that's gonna be a tall order a very tall order Felder's just a very aggressive very durable and extremely aggressive guy at a hundred and fifty five pounds can I say aggressive one more time I really loved his fight against well he's got had some amazing fights inside the Octagon but what would I liked I liked his fights against I liked his fight against Barbosa because the Barbosa fight showed him against one of the very best strikers in the division and he got out struck he lost that fight but he was in it every second of the fight and he was trying to wind up until the very end he's had some ups and downs inside the Octagon but he's won two in a row both by knockout both in the first round and the Barbosa fight in the Ross Pearson fight were two decision losses that he got split decision against Ross Pearson he beat Danny Castillo and a spectacular spinning backfist knockout Jason saga before that I mean and the Barbosa fight I think was just a good example of like where this guy's hard as that fought against one of the best and fastest strikers in the division and was in it to the end it was a real learning experience for him and that was also fight of the night so I think Felder at this stage of his career is really coming into his own I don't think he's in his prime yet I think at 33 years of age we're starting to see the very best of him and he's got an incredibly bright future but also you got to realize that 33 years of age you kind of got to get after it right now I mean this is the time for him and for Oliveira Oliveira has got to capitalize on that victory that he just had over will Brooks and you know he's a little bit younger at 28 and still got massive potential and an incredible amount of experience for a guy who's 28 years old so this fucking card is just stacked this card is stacked from top to bottom I mean you've got cowboy Oliveira versus Yancy Medeiros is on that fight and david tamer is on that fight the fight card as well against Drakkar close now that's a fucking sleeper that's the big sleeper fight there because david tamer is a fucking vicious striker I mean real world-class striker and he's only 28 years old and david tamer really let everybody know what the fuck is up when he fought Lando Vanara a lot of people had no idea who he was up into that fight even though he had won two fights in a row by KO in the Octagon when you got to see that kid compete against a really talented striker like land of anata and just out strike him every step of the way you really got to see how good he is and again at 28 years of age I don't think we've seen the best of him yet I think he is he has just got a massive massive amount of potential and that's the fight that I think is the big sleeper fight on his car a lot of people are just you know not quite aware of it and the guy is fighting Drakkar close Adah know with one draw and very fucking dangerous fighter as well you know he's coming from two victories in a row in the UFC and this will be his probably his most dangerous fight against tamer tamra's just a wild fast dynamics Riker with legit world-class kickboxing Muay Thai skills very very fun card so that's gonna be next I mean I also t-shirt Torres is gonna be fighting the karate Hidy Hidy karate hottie Michelle Waterson that should be a fun fight as well tecia Torres he's an outstanding striker and Michelle Waterson who employs a lot of that karate style is whether we're talking about that side warts side waist dance she's got good kick boxing skills as well good submission skills and tisha Taurus is gonna most likely try to keep this fight on the feet there should be a lot of fun I mean Michelle lost her last fight to rose namajunas but she beat Paige Vanzant by submission before that in a very very impressive fight angela Magana should be her by submission before that and jessica Pinay she beat her in Invicta by decision before that and you know she's uh she's got a lot of height behind her one because of she's got a unique style she's fighting out of jackson's in Albuquerque New Mexico and she's also a very beautiful young lady and of course people like that that's a very interesting fight the whole car this is like a great card from top to bottom it should be a lot of fun but again the sleeper fight like I said is david tamer and york are close keep an eye on tamer that motherfucker is wild oliveira versus fell there should be a lot of fun Alvarez versus gage do not go to the bathroom do not get popcorn while that fight is going on as long as it lasts I fight will be chaos I think so who Dover says Pettis is gonna be a very interesting test to see where Pettis is at this stage of his career and to see of Sahu toe can continue to show these massive jumps and leaps of improvement that he showed in his last fight against Wilson Hayes the Overeem and gonal fight fuckin'-a man that could be chaos I am interested to see whether or not Francis and gana can catch Alistair Overeem or whether or not he finds himself against a guy who's far too crafty for him at this stage of his career I mean we're really No he fought Arlovski in his last fight but with all due respect I do not believe that over arlovski is in the same category as over him I think overing represents another level of danger and on top of that overing is a very good ground game that a lot of people are forgetting about Overeem won the Abu Dhabi European trials he submitted Vitor Belfort I mean Overeem has legitimate submission skills submitted Mark Hunt over in can submit guys he's got good wrestling skills as well you got to remember he took Stefan Struve to the ground with a beautiful take down that TKO'd him when he got him to the ground um he may choose to try to take Frances Inc on to the ground we might we might see that we don't know it's just it's a very interesting fight to see where in Ghana is at this stage of his career and the biggest test of his career so far and a fight that Overeem was looking for Overeem believes that he has the skills to put in Ghana in his place Andrey established himself as the number one contender in the heavyweight division that makes that makes me very happy to see that fight I'm very pumped and then of course for all the marbles in the featherweight division max Holloway versus Jose a motherfuckin aldo for the title you know with a guy like although you got to remember you're talking about a guy who was the best ever at featherweight for a long fucking time you're talking about a guy that up until that Conor McGregor fight had beaten everybody that they put in front of him he rebounded fantastic from that fight with the Frankie Edgar fight then got beat down by max Holloway I want to see where he's at right now I want to see whether or not he can rebound and I want to see after 29 professional MMA fights at the highest level at 31 years of age does he still have what it takes to fight at a world championship level and can he come back better than ever now with max Holloway he is he's a fucking killer max Holloway has everything you want to see in a champion a Championships mindset the way he wanted to go down at 25 years of age - I mean just keeps getting better he's not even near his prime the way he wanted to go down to Brazil and beat Jose Aldo in Rio and the way he said it that he wanted to fight him in his country than that and that's what Kings do they go to the other person's Kingdom and take their throne and that's what he did very exciting fight so I'm fucking pumped for next Saturday night um now to answer some of the criticisms and questions a lot of people been saying hey man you should probably do this with guests I am absolutely going to do this with guests the only reason why I didn't do this one with a guest is because I pitch I'm on vacation and I felt like I owed everybody one because this is how I was gonna do one of these things every week

bring some guys in that are interesting that I don't think maybe maybe some of you folks have never heard talk before so that'll be cool um I'm also going to ask questions or have you guys ask questions so what I'm gonna do is for the next one I'm going to put a post up on Instagram and allow you guys and gals and non-binary folks to put how long do we have to say that for non-binary any of you are out there for non-binary is it really important to address you do you feel left out if I don't humans I'm gonna allow all these humans to ask questions and we'll pick some good ones and throw
