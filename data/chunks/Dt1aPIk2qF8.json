thank then he realized that his friends were telling you stirring just stopped our recording for some reason alright man probably the fucking man out back on it the man ladies and gentlemen refresh your browser's people the man apparently was just fucking our ass that's crazy like if you just went off air and then everything came back on by itself yeah he took it with his friends you want to be a downer because they're all tell ya this is you told that story as long as I got fuck it but he didn't feel anything so we lurk all right but then I didn't want to like be the one left out so I look fucking I'll smoke with you guys just here pass it things like Taysom and then he realized he can for the first time like years and years could actually sit there with those legs and arms like crank we got Shawn Roush maybe I could help him I don't know I just know where the guy does not smoke pot no that doesn't that doesn't smoke weed you would think that Doug would smoke weed Stanhope does not like weed really yeah he's done it I've done a mushroom Stanhope we get DMT please step now wait huh he'll go to other dimension what is it a pod it is like pop Mesa paranoid it is like I understand that there's no side effects of everything for everybody well what the paranoia that pot gives you is really it's almost like the opposite of alcohol because alcohol makes you look through a tube alcohol you look looking the world through yeah whoo to not seeing but marijuana is the opposite marijuana like release your button blinders yeah I see it in front of me bring it right off your bucket is that gonna blipped did it okay just so you guys know it's not me fucking it up at you streams just talking over it if you can't see red band you need actually scarpino straight to the computer fuck it you can't blame Brian ladies and gentlemen don't be mean this is difficult to figure all the stupid shit out ultimately I would love to have this on my website on Joe Rogan net but right now I don't think the technology is available it's not quite ready but this is ideally the best way to do a show you know this is way more fun than doing some some show that's on television that nobody gives a shit about you know I mean this is we could do whatever the fuck we want you don't have to look at it I don't want anything from you you know that no one's getting paid Yeah right just for fun you know you have interesting people over and you talk yeah right I mean when how many times have you done what's about brunch I'm just girl blaming me I'm gonna get my hands yeah another great Brian on this in the Conan situation make time to be done like a talk show and like you prepare for it's like a big deal and then you you know sit down and talk to someone for like seven minutes you know like I didn't even say anything yeah did we get to talk about anything I mean I had a few topics that are kind of got out of the way a little bit but barely said anything and then and every one of those shows are set up for that reason that it's just nothing you just leave there going I that was nothing anything I didn't need yeah and then nobody goes though some great appearance you go okay you words it's like you if you're in Chelsea Handler's show yeah the those guys on there say like four or five words and then you're done yeah and then they're done yeah it's real weird and people go oh you're great and that's what they want requires a short attention span bing-bang see this guy real quick but I mean that's that's the if you want to go for like if you want to go for like the abbey you know just just a shot in the dark with people that's the book you should give them you should give them the shortest quickest little things as fast as you can so they don't lose interest or so but another day do you want the people that lose interest that easy to pay attention to you know no I'm happy yeah because you're doing a numbers game yeah but then again I mean how many times you seen a YouTube clip nice try could open it up you see nine and half minutes you're like fuck I don't want to start there were all those people yeah yeah yeah but that's a a YouTube clip is totally different than something like this you know this is like cool because you can throw this on at work you know and you're you're doing some boring fucking thing at work you could throw this on and watch it while

Drew but by the way we were talking about dr. drew I think his stance on pot is retarded but he's a really nice guy I've done a show of the love line show and he's met her lunch times he's a really cool guy and he told me that he was in Hawaii and the the fucking paparazzi were taking pictures of his crit of his kids yeah him and his kids yes in k-town or something well it was for something that they make money man you get a like a juicy picture I'm creating two dried leaves you know how about that picture of John Travolta kissing that dude somebody got paid for that how bad was it kiss I saw one of the lips clam yeah hmm I saw one of those lasers when you freeze fighting a kiss it'll never look like a casual piss it's awesome I love how John Travolta rocks a fabulous wig you know and just yeah man is in some pictures he's balding another 50 she's got the best head of hair ever it's awesome the TMZ I saw one of the guys who works on TMZ one of the guys here we show soon so at the airport and I wanted to go up to him so bad with the camera just sticking in his face and ask some dumb questions and I probably could have sold that back to TM that even things I wanted to do as a sketch dad will do it just go fucking or I run the guy that does TMZ kit can he handle a 15-minute show without taking a drink of water cuz he has like his sippy cup that he just there's no way that waters are so dog just it's evil because those guys are making fun of people that are on TV yet every one of them wants to be so famous and is enjoying all the fame they're getting from being on the show but but that's legitimate to because some people like the way to bitchy like they wish they could be that bitchy and they like watch them it's like a form we're going to take a lot of other shots of handlers show - yeah let's shout on people we wish we could work with yes yeah yeah yeah exactly but you know what there's a place for that - it's the same thing as like rich people that get upset at poor people it's like people were not famous they're like fuckin pick out go after Tiger Woods you know go find him he's got a billion dollars fuck him like some woman actually said this on the Jimmy Kimmel show she was running a website where people could find people's houses and or no no it was a you would say where the celebrity is at any given moment continue $10 don't you understand that there's like stalkers and this can be dangerous and she goes well I'm sure that there's sleep well on on you know all their money like a bag full of money it's like really that's how you look at it like if you're willing to cook that yeah put people like especially young girls like you know how some dudes get fuckin really nutty about young girls like they get crazy like that one girl that got shot it was like when I first came to Hollywood some girl got yeah it was on a tiger yeah even though I like hair she was really pretty yeah it was like a childhood not childhood star but like 22 year old yeah should become famous when she was like young and some dude just got obsessed with her found out where she lived she opened the doors shot her in the chest Wow people to understand how scary like stalkers out when I used to do radio in Detroit this girl within me 15 16 page letters not one piece of white left on the paper so it was written sideways anyway about I had fun going out with you looking for houses shit that never happened you know I heard about your secret messages that it uh and then she went away and then she came back and every time I'd be in Detroit she would leave these letters when your wife's gone and it's just us and you know crazy stuff so I want to go get a restraining order against her because she was showing up at my shows and what I would find out where I would be and the judge wasn't fuck her no no no gosh uh but it was job yeah yeah yeah I just wanna know who's trying to figure how far back was this yeah yeah no Moses it was uh it's been about 10-15 years and to God wouldn't the judge would not be what she wanted he wanted to hear her side of the story now I had a stack of papers this big of her saying she came to the radio station I worked out with some of my stuff she goes John Loftus it was an empty can of tuna fish whoa junk mail and baby shoes well and then I'll she'd go to your house Walt no this is from her place I guess and then I had stacks of letters saying I hear the secret messages that you're giving me I will respond to them when you say this it means this but when you go to revile a restraining order the judge you get less than a paragraph to write why you don't get to hand in any of the psycho stuff oh so then and then he saw that and then the guy who did it for me goes he's a dude he probably thinks you're a pussy that you can handle the job know that because I'm a guy and I had this girl stalker the judge thinks that yes I care pussy or guy handle the girl don't bring us involved it was his attitude so I couldn't I couldn't find I was the judges attitude that's what no you know I don't want long ago that was before that chick up no no this I tried to another cup I tried notice a couple years ago but it doesn't a year ago but it doesn't apply to California so I go through all this work get it done in Michigan they come out to California doesn't mean anything you got a refile in California she dropped flies in Texas to see you doesn't matter now you have to file one a text really and I'm sure I could imagine up with this information yey-hey well you know pretty murky to actresses just died yeah her mom and her husband has been doing it toward all the talk shows and I got to catch it today on The Today Show yeah it's how fucked up your daughter just died in their fucking they're just sitting there like for no reason not promoting anything we're trying to like do anything but just like I've seen them on like four different talk shows no last night it's weird but I do it for money and they do it just like the people attention or whatever says only about the daughter the worst like and coming up we have Britney Murphy's mom and Brittany's Murphy's mom's just sitting there and she knows the cameras on if it was not for our family no no you you find it on huge are with Hulu or whatever and it is disturbing to watch like it was so gross in the husband was so it was the accusation what is the girl now well what's the isn't there like a current about it were seeing it was drugs but then they said I got there just wasn't exactly IEDs or something like that it was just awesome happen when she was young and I think it was a weird situation with oh really it just came up shower is talking about heroin and all their jobs and social basic I don't know yet but that's kind of weird that they still the well is know what but isn't kind of what the husband did want an autopsy yes you think I think that's very fine for a thirty year old person does you want to know what the fuck happened I'll do a show there he didn't look Jewish one to conclusion it's against your religion yeah basically what happens if you murder a Judah that's fucking crazy that makes it easy to murder you guys no no listen it's good you have to be able thought this out girl that's got our bodies we will get them on your bodies yeah but you you're dead but if I just oh yeah yeah our cops can't give you an autopsy yeah but because I just we just poison that but now they know what sort of drinking it was your mother's neck for suicide we're making choked himself yeah yeah that's the story I'm sticking to it yeah no autopsies I think there are certain situations where they say if they're afraid it might be like a generative that a word heart disease like the kids should know if I should get treated for congenital I don't know right no no could unit I don't know but it's not what say all of that but not just randomly to figure out what the cause of death is still like he's dead yeah but they've any kind of it you know young actress dies and there's medication around there's a lot of money to officers they will automatically do no matter what what he whatever somebody says don't ya or when I tried I guess I can't waste the money yeah he will commodities depression change the topic yeah hey do you guys like cats ha ha what do you think about Oprah she's so generous yeah no thought of paparazzi don't give a shit about me somebody asked me a paparazzi chase me they would make zero dollars of my pictures there's no benefit taking pictures of me you have to stay just under that level of Fame you have to stay in the level of Fame where nobody comes the fuck so you can still work and you know you have to worry about your bills and you can go out to dinner but you don't want to fuck your crazy the best at the throne is easy at that Vince Vaughn Wild West Comedy Tour like premier and then there's a party that concentrated some hip Club whatever on Hollywood and uh so we leave and all the pop you're out there waiting for prevents Vaughn and Justin Long and stuff and runs he's like beating you degenerates your fucking piece of shit you know he's like giving it to them and they're like here's a guy from parties all right yeah um no that's that's hilarious yeah you know can't go to places like you know who's the best at staying out of that shit when in controversial life you consider him Mark Wahlberg how guys never the tabloids he's a giant movie star yeah he stars in gigantic blockbuster movies and yet he's never in the tabloids that's amazing you know who else and he never even does interviews Nicholson yeah just away from everything well David would always catch him doing something creepy dude you know a lot of shirt off at some beaches and looking like bloated yeah look at shared he's still like we're in a seven he's rocking it with 20 year old chicks it's awesome it's really crazy Nicholson like he enjoyed you know they did some interview with him real recently we was talking about the different dates he goes on and you know one night he'll go out with a woman that's in her 60s and next night their 20s yeah you know I mean just you know he was talking about sexually who's talking about friends you know like his acquaintances that he has a very varied life but you know you gotta appreciate that yeah dudes getting twenty year olds these fucking 70 that's how bad as he is that's pretty crazy right he's defying nature with his fame with his ability to pretend it overcomes the natural order is a good to pretend it was not he should be John in a natural or hands-on with sex that's not yeah well it's maybe she wants a companion his age especially there was no viagra yeah you know I mean if there's no viagra that would take a lot of dudes out of the game take a lot of dudes out of the game a lot of old rich dudes feel like what's the fucking point you know but right now they can you know Brian Holtzman have to joke about that you know I like that because now these young whores have to fuck these old men and he goes and that is that sperm it's like paint that's been in their basement for like a year you know that paint working that's it's not a first product later man he's hilarious not quite tell the fuck how you picked out for you on it that's it yeah he's one of those dudes this there's a few dudes that over the course of my doing stand-up comedy that I've always gotten how the fuck that guy not make it he's one of them right yeah he's so good so funny Brian Holtzman if you ever at the Comedy Store in LA that's where Brian were where he works out you call the Comedy Store call a comedy store and ask when Brian holtam is going to be up especially if something goes down the news like I can assume he's got some fucked up five minutes on Haiti right now you know no one laughs at you like oh no but you laugh at anyway I had always heard about he did this thing Oh Jay but it was like amazing I mean look at one time you try to do it again it wasn't quite as good just an awesome said about that and then 9/11 happened and it's you wouldn't put him on because we were closed he was happened to were closed Tuesday Wednesday Thursday just nope and then we opened up Friday Saturday and she knew that he would get up yeah help us so she made the talent quarter called him said listen we can't push on I'm sorry but it's just judge one would he's one of those guys that would take the opinion most fucked up here by default he would automatically let go after the victims and there aren't you to wrong why were you in that building yeah yeah what were you doing at Billy it's just like his take out of me so fucked he went on Sunday though cuz it open like it's open night and uh he did about 50 to 55 minutes and it was maybe one of the best sets of everything stand-up was there watching stand-ups that I disagree with 95 percent of this but it's so fucking goddamn good because he's so crazy his stance was fuck the cops he goes well they're not heroes now why because it did a job one time because of out of all the belt people jumping out of a building I went to a fucking cop is below me take him out to this is on 9:15 you know what everyone's like what are the crops doing these seeds I don't remember oh I can read that you remember when that shit drowned her kids yeah yeah yeah Holtzman goes on T it on stage like three days after this Jimmy Johnson kids he goes ladies and gentlemen I heard those were bad kids I heard a neighborhood that blocks away they sat that close to the TV was fill in their fuckin milk those kids will not be missed alright oh my god people all I look to Hyderabad kids that's one of the the most brutal and fun each other people's brains and comedy is geared like is in my brain just you know it's weird how you fall into whatever style of comedy like I would never even think about though that were you know his pipe holes words on things but me Juan's really friendly like if you talk to him like offstage like he's not a dark guy at all very nice here's always go get me coke when I was working to cover both not gonna hate this one so called classic from the back thanks man even go back very bad I miss that dude he's the factory sometimes - is he yeah yeah because offset time I don't find out when he's playing and go per for me and he was always so cool he'll night he is it the fact of sometimes he was are such a nice guy it was one time I got banned for Paulie banned me for like a weekend and Boltzmann was so so nice about it or what I said what Paul damning for a weekend kill what I got mad at him because you got mad at him and Dean tried to corner me about something and I told him he was a fucking idiot and that you know he doesn't appreciate the comedians that I'm not working for him it's when what after the minding his store came out it was it was like he all the sudden was running the comedy store it was all sudden you know it wasn't it wasn't like just a TV show anymore now he was because the Connor store we've always done for free you know I always not only did I work there for free but I donate all that when I had when they were giving me checks they gave me her thousands of dollars with the checks I never cashed him because I always knew they were hurting for cash so when it came time to do their taxes I had to donate all that money back to them and I paid for the sound system I mean I treated that place like it was our place you know it was a place grab for for comics to the mics were cutting out and that's sad that sounds like broccoli and Rogen bought it's like fuck it just we gotta fix it I got that's not the other line shit I went and got the top-of-the-line CD recorder so dudes could make sense ease and I put it all in there out of my own money because just for love of the club then all sudden paulie's running I'm like man I ain't working for free for you you know I'll do it all for your mom but for you no that's not bad on that about who gets the store I think he won port collie one yeah I think his brother gave up that's what I heard always brothers of all the years I've lived here I think I've been in there one time really and I feel great I've been in that deaf bar area just hanging I went with some comic but I don't think if everyone had staged a cow see that walk by a certain he was like I think I've been here four times and never I'm so crazy I'm not although the rear has never really been performing in Los Angeles that's what that's what he was like yeah they've done some improv I've seen your damn yeah it improv and then I think I think I'm banned from the Laugh Factory would ya we're talking about guns and the dude owns it's a real pacifist and Jamie banned you for talking about guns yeah that was on for the next week and then uh I got call him said no you got called they didn't just not really love it no I called like whoever don't like so tomorrow was so good yeah no I got asked and then because you talk about guns not on stage waves offstage conversation what you like what you have gone down means you want to kill people I'm like no I enjoy you you have done yeah I enjoy shereena but if they came in my house then then I killed them listen Jamie quit worried about what comics have in their house and yes Lord I was reducing little kids the Michael Jackson oh so that's a way bigger problem on Iran you know I'm in now this is a nice time looking around joke around Jamie is introducing these children that are on the make-a-wish Foundation when I was a make-a-wish or someone that's how was it was sick he was introducing them to Michael Jackson you say introducing I say pimping what's the difference hottie buddy repenting he's a genius buddy does not want to fuck the ass I still I don't think that uh no I didn't do it him I don't think Michael Jackson fuck those kids because I think where are other bodies there would be not just one Kitty fucked he'd be fucking hundreds I think Holly fuck eight to ten Queen time I don't think you did I think it's I think it's much more likely that we talked about this before yeah I think it's much more likely that he's just completely fucked up and was molested when he was a kid and abused and he grew up in the public eye and he grew up as a baby I like being famous and just he taught her to go back you jog is there I was gone ahead I believe in the power of huge rumors and I think what about a treble in the ass do you believe that one I'm going to

recruiter show up at the grocery store I worked at it was for the Air Force I thought of it I went to my high school and then I remember him how old was that you know like 17 18 and then when I wrestled in high school then he this recruiter I don't forget saw our heavyweight and goes yes I'm looking for John Heffron and then this guy started laughing he's like he's too small because that

used to be a safe way to not go to war who are in and you're helping people you're stealing money duty and split families up and it's my life well even look if you look at Rambo members all National Guard guys went after Rambo and the whole movie was making fun of these National Guard guys yeah they don't not to do anything hey I gotta get back to the store here's and now the National Guard guys are as bad acid as anyone else yes oh dude I do Jiu Jitsu with and he was in the Army Reserve for 20 years and 20 days left in his 20-year tour 20 years 20 days left they sent him to Iraq for a year and a half so what they start before that your time is over did you just lock you in it doesn't matter and they can bring you back they can bring you back any time they want they recall you they're hurting so bad nowadays I'm surprised you're not just like oh you're an Eagle Scout you got a fucking Iraq okay I think I got about a truck there's a lot of dudes you go over there because they think they're doing the right thing there's a lot of dudes like Pat Tillman do to join the army and join the night they think they're they're doing it to protect this great country especially then in like 2001 2002 people watch that getting fucked and that's what happened with Pat Tillman I mean he was a huge critic as was his brother of how fucked up things are over in Iraq and Afghanistan and and you know obviously wound up killing their killed friendly fire I remember a year ago I want I did a show and it got back to hotel room and I googled oldest age to join army well I was like you're gonna be old as fuck right nothing bumped it up range 40 to 40 flights 33 but that's a 20 years longer than that would you be most of their or well you do it no stretch this officer corps aboard I heard a couple things one they would like say I join it you know 40 they give me a job that and take a nineteen year old out of that job in the throw that 19 year old online so like the older guys is like but I know one of my wife's friends she's in she's an Airborne Ranger she said she has privates in her thing that are like 37 38 years old private you know just guys give robbery huge man that have no fucking money and they don't have anything in their town and there's no option like if like someone do what's the difference you taking care of it are you gonna go to war or he's like oh yeah yeah that would be a major problem I'm tired of general it's like open at war for eight years dude NASA's 2000 well yeah yeah yeah we been at war for eight years man join the military for the last decade is but no joke yeah you know it's just what the fuck man it's when I was a kid Vietnam ended when I was a little boy and I remember thinking very clearly that all this is a good thing because now there's not gonna be any more war okay obviously I'm gonna hate war you're never gonna go to war again and then when I was like 21 was the first Gulf War me and my buddy jimmy detillo were sick we had an apartment together and Waltham Massachusetts me it was ethnicity leo she took Ginny's hangout wall FEM and was sitting in front of TV and the fucking the first tribe to happen and they showed the missiles coming in bombs going off and I was like holy shit and wheat me and Jimmy watch it like we were watching a football game you were like dude we're at war baby shit i'ma being in college then and the two guys I lived with who are all reservists and then they got called up so they were probably 20 21 years old 22 got call up and went down to they were going to start to help train at the time everybody was like just give me a draft did you draft so we all thought because we were that age were 20 21 were like holy crap we're going yeah oh yeah there was a serious bucket yeah yeah so scary man I remember when the first Gulf War happened we're practicing basketball it was overnight some play some high school play and suma came in like the play barn the plane the planes bomb by just how things are gonna play bombed oh why are you breaking up a practice for that so it's yes I'm a little happy about it yeah the whole thing is so surreal I got woken up I don't remember who woke my absolutely what called me and told me that America's on dynamic the absolute said America is under attack it was like watch her on the news America is under attack and we just are so removed from all the shit and joy goes on in the rest of the world we are so removed from what war really is unless you talk to someone who's actually been over there and come and they have a very different opinion of it but we're so fucking removed from it over here when I saw that shit on TV I was like what really like this isn't a movie I was like your heart starts beating faster it's like all the sudden this team you're on is under attack you know I mean it's not you but it's like we're all in this team together and then you don't think about that through your day-to-day life you can say you're happy to be an American shit and you believe in democracy and I'm a Republican but you don't really realize you're on some team and setup team's attack right and then you like so dudes that did nothing do two didn't yell these dudes came over and killed them just because they were living on this part yeah they were living in this patch of dirt so people were killing that's it I thought that was only movie shit my brother's over there now is he up character just got called up again oh my god yeah that's what happens when you when you go through a tour if you sign up for the military Dick Cheney instituted some new situation where they can just kind of keep bringing you back so he's still an active reserve so you knew who's eventually gonna called up again but when they were in their choice of pressure on their tours and they were bringing them back yeah Oh Randall mascar how long or even has the same question over and over and over again there's some dude asking a question again I've seen a tent road you just show order damn joke it's more women all right why are you reading it I'm rewarding him you know I just so I will tell ya when people ignore you sometimes you ever make a joke like in public and nobody laughs and then you hear somebody like make the same joke again because they assumed nobody heard them well it's like you look at the response and fucking hate that to me and they didn't find it funny the worse that someone thinks you weren't listening and they say it again yeah one that means it's not in the moment I mean you're following to make this joke those guys says all the branches other than the army are overloaded actually no no I believe that al had now I think he's probably telling truth I would think in this economy I would a lot yeah a lot of people are you know a lot higher than look at what was it how long two years ago New Orleans you know didn't have enough people to sin they're gay now two years ago wasn't it wasn't a lot more than two years ago when was Katrina what year was a I made it was longer cuz that was when I first heard about Kanye West huh Williams like George Bush hates black people so you're out I was Whaler that's my favorite was was Michael Myers reaction because he's just a Hollywood guy he's like oh I do not want to be associated with a just so uncomfortable I know he got so I mean that was like one of the blackest because dangerous things like my I had this picture of George Bush does not like black people hates black people right you say hates or does not like George Bush they say hey fucking hates yeah he said hates hates black people yeah you know why why is that guys still on TV he's like me loving to the white mother but now he's on TV because he's a douchebag and because people are looking for him to do something wrong he's like his face brown on TV or is evolved it used to be like here's this young artist now it's like this guy's such a cock like having close to the calcium probably never get being stupid and everybody hate him and it will get you million hits on YouTube you know if when he took that microphone away from that girl he'll be hated forever you don't do that what was even worse was his fake apology on Leno later with Brian workup tears that he couldn't quite do it oh he's so so weak and he was just saying it's gonna take a step back and he's not gonna work on some show he's know what she's shut the fuck up the my favorite is one that he says just please just let me be great just let me be great Bush George Bush doesn't care about black he doesn't care yeah that's what I thought it was thank you or attaboy yeah hate is a burger I'm worried like hate might make Mike Myers flinch at pee a little yeah made a little little dribble go this could ruin my career what happened to that did Mike Myers yeah it's dangerous to me because they're actually making a new Austin Powers yeah that last morning what it's awful that last movie was death Sorrentino put him in put him in Inglourious Basterds and it was horrible it was so like why is this good he wasn't being funny so then it's like why would you put clearly someone who's known as me too so eat of like a barge that last I was a weird rub me the wrong way I was like you you're doing the same movie but yeah but it's an Indian so I'm Erica excavator wasn't bad because he wasn't over two years ago it was just like a little bit like I never saw that that's a great movie here's ago uh people are asking to take us to take a break why because we've been on straight for a while does that mean they can't leave the fucking screen I don't know thanks my good bathroom I get up well we're not all gonna add us yeah we're done we're done 4:30 and I have to do some sort of an interview with some people

and usually SNL would either but groover macGruber it's a take on this with my read on San Nightline there's a movie I make a movie and they get getting a new preview that's about that just came out there and the funny thing about SNL movies is that they usually always have the best parts in the preview there's not one part in these it looks good you guys it's that is the worst when you go to preview and you just sit there and go oh what the fuck are you doing why would someone like promote this yeah there's nothing worse than babcom because at least bad dramas hilarious bad drama showgirls or something like that those are genuinely funny movies you know I got some left behind there they're the the rapture videos that that fucking / cry my boob makes holy shit are they awesome they're so good they're so beautifully stupid watching Kirk Cameron get owned on YouTube is one of my favorite pastimes he's so dumb I just saw a girl for bakery is amazing did you really the one would meson debate team I don't remember what it was but it was like a group date funnily burr and a few other people we got driven there funnel hydrolyzes yeah it was it debate movie and I remember the big climax at the end was like because some teacher taught them in the clear move to the rest of the movie that he sounded like he was being real but he really wasn't and then later it was like he's serious about that I'm caring I'll see you Kirk Cameron loves the cock I guarantee he loves the cock yeah there's no doubt about there's no way he's that crazy gung-ho Jesus the rapture no sin no masturbation no exhaust fucking gay as the day is long that's uh you know said things were lighting it with every fiber of his being trying to stay on the straight and narrow like girls and me want who just wants fuck off talk mouth is that Hershel Walker was talking about when you doing his fight uh-huh Strikeforce and he said he doesn't masturbate yeah but he's crazy Herschel Walker's got like split personality disorder yes you know I've heard he was trauma related I thought it was trauma related he said that yes I ever get his Heisman Trophy like he's got all these different but don't think about how many times like I must have had concussions I don't know if he's a big Russian gotta though he plays football everybody gets concussions plaintiff all right whatever I get it no up quarterback like who's had the most look like eight ever but that's corner take blindside hits all the time she was standing there it's my fucking crush them hell with the hell motion yeah pretty much but anytime you get hit yeah okay even if you're not getting concussions a little you're getting fucking rattled even if you get up and you get back up when you get smashed into by some giant dude who's you want a full clip even if you don't go out and even if you don't have a concussion we're like your pupils are dilated you got some brain damage son you just got jarred now that's that's reality when you do that shit over and over and over again footballs one of the most dangerous I saw Ben Roethlisberger last week know what Ben Roethlisberger is their big quarterback whoever it was about a Kurt Warner who threw an interception of what to make a tackle and then he just got well I decided and you see him on the ground with the trainer's over him and he's like talking but you can clearly see he's not making any sense he's like no no I'm old and you're like the guard stays play that's nuts Bank happens a lot one concussion once I bought a UH Danny Bonaduce hit me in the back of the head we were sparring knock in and I kind of went down but he said it was a slowest knockout ever like I went to one knee and he goes are you okay and I was like yeah I'm good and then I went to

whatever and I go WOW spawn and done then she's like you look and then we went to the UH doctors and then I lifted up a foot and then there's a nun the whole thing yeah that sounds like a state of when you get rigged up and somebody's like well there's no football place instead do remember that Reichman said he would play a whole quarter and didn't remember playing the whole Joe dirty fighter such a virgin I thought Patrick Cote and I was an awesome fight Patrick Cote caught him with a big shot to hurt then dirkson wound up taking his back and choking him out it was fucking chaos great

raincoat or when Tim's he'll be um got cracked in the first round he woke up going into the fourth round yeah he didn't know what RAL was he thought the second why was the fourth round we thought the fourth round was the second runners off but sorry mr. or the fifth I think it might have been the fifth because I told them I just the last round he was like what the last round like he thought it was like the second round like he was gone two races already got autopilot this is your classic your body try not to die do you know get random nerves is just right on my throat yeah blasted I love like striking training I love like hitting the pad and hitting the bag and and spawn somebody you can trust is fun yeah if you can find that guy that knows 70% is 70% you know you're 17 punch you in the face wrestling in your cock problem I got close yeah the same thing that's why I like I like I enjoyed ring like you said we're doing literally I go let's go 40% because I got too much and if you know people don't know when you do are striking spawn the whole deal isn't you don't hit each other hard you look you hit each other like a little bit but you don't try to knock each other around yeah there's nothing and so I'm like and my problem is is I don't get in close enough so I told the guy let's go for tea that way if I do get drilled right face it's not gonna so then I throw a kick but I'm throwing a kick at 40% which means any little kid could grab that kid yeah it's not going fast so he swoops it grabs it and then blasts like Jesus as hard as he could after you after it catches my foot and then I'm just laying there anyway yeah that's what I'm gonna do more jiu-jitsu because the worst thing it's going to happen to me somebody's gonna tap me out you know I mean that could be that smoked weird ah you can buy occasionally but it's more of a a gent non gentleman sport it's just a small technical or tectum when the worst thing what's happened is I feel like that and I'm not going man I just weird plant we're gonna separate a little bit of faith that slow down good guys don't hurt you good guys the leashes you know I worry about like with a guy like Eddie if he gets your arm he's gonna have full control he's not gonna pull it back and happen you gotta worry about your strong blue belts that are just starting to learn how to tap people those the ones you know or you know like just real hyper aggressive and they don't know how to relax yeah or super powerful white belts who just learning moves the most you'll get has been losses all over your fucking when you bar somebody especially like if I find a place wherever I'm performing that's a better story for them you know is being knocked out that comic that way better is going to enjoy hey I want to work on getting inside you mind if I I'm gonna although some places that you go to we're done people don't try to do that at all like what I want to a mall Easton's place in Boulder yeah uh when I moved there I start training their people couldn't in nature yeah everybody was cool there was no assholes there was no agro dudes no one trying to tap you no one getting crazy when they were trying to tap you but they were you know the minute yeah one trying to rush yeah you know they were just rolling it was good is it's all from how cool the instructor is the instructors cool to the people cool like Eddie's so friendly and so relaxed and so cool to everybody that everybody in the whole gym carries that friendly relaxed attitude you know you go John jocks the same thing John jocks a real nice guy so everybody there's nice and it was so far talking he want to hit it and then I was like and they seized up you're laughing like Dawg you got so high spent the first five minutes of class talking about some History Channel document beyond UFOs the first five minutes like dude they got scientists man you're not only NASA NASA man is going yeah yeah it's like it's on the History Channel shits filling down I'm like how high are you right - you did you did you once once to 1.5 times a week please still empty I mean even that once ya get you're talking about it I just get so mad myself like

just be like Rondon take a couple weeks off they tried do your act like how's it go you don't even remember your bed so you have to like review your recordings I forgot a shit thoughts have extended period often I forgot shit I was like yeah I know I can do something here I don't have any idea you forget a lot of shit I forgot completely forgot how to do this move to break the arm bar blues called the Silverado it's my favorite move and I was a purple belt I completely forgot about it right revealing it the other night I'm like oh yeah it's bigger that's how it goes in you know I forgot how to do it but it was like one of my favorite moves it's weird jujitsu there's so many moves that's the crazy thing about it is it's do you think it's it's not matched right you think a year from now some guy would do something in writing no one's done comes off what other people do it yeah so they almost based on what you do and then but then no one has ever thought to defend this move yet because what I meant it's much it does get invented then you've got to have a counter there's this new move there dudes have been doing real recently called the Japanese necktie and it's just come out like I think ioki was the first person to do it and in the broom yeah it's no Japanese neckties like a it's sort of like a Darce but you you you grab it you grab it with a cable grip and you turn the guy's head up towards his chest and you have your chest pinned on it's fucking nasty because it's one of the bandits new it's like I don't wanna know this before I write yeah or in this position all the time they're trying to get the dogs choke but really there's there's a even better choke that's right there so as soon as you lock up that gable grip you get on top of God you just tuck it under and you're bending his fucking neck towards his chest your chest is on top of his he's got no air no blood whatever do those drills and it's Liz crying oh I always pretend like we have an odd number of people in the class I don't know no actually you're gonna hurt yeah but you do it anyway you got to relax just let them let them yank your neck around it's not your inputs can find serious pain yeah but you got to get used to that no one's gonna hurt you doing that you know but it's going to be uncomfortable but that that moves it's so important to learn how where where it comes on because like a Japanese necktie comes on so quick the Peruvian of tattoo it's like well you're gonna guess and you're just jumping back and hopefully you don't go too far but it's a spazzy move it's awesome love proving necktie and Japanese necktie both of them with a shit they fuck you up man it's a terrible position to be in I think the Japanese neckties even mom proved Ian's pretty badass to the proving you got your weight on top a little noise the Japanese necktie you're kind of like on the side and hooking it but it doesn't matter it's so good such a powerful move like that oh I think we're done do you agree right okay speaking of Japanese people I'm like I've ever seen a Japanese guy wear it well what about that fucking Japanese video game that video you posted and we should end with that because that is the most bizarre fucking thing I think I've ever seen on internet yeah there's some crazy Japanese video game that's like these two muscle-bound gay guys weren't diapers and they're they're a human bicycle and they're riding on the road and they're getting chased and I mean is one of the gayest weirdest things Japanese lead that lead the league is weirdness is so strange do you know if you people don't know there's like you can go to vending machines in Japan you can buy use panties like that's real right yeah you go places they sell used panties buddy gonna meet white coming up on one other day there because you up one of those here just all you do is get a girl to put it on real quick throw in a bag yeah yeah I think you don't have enough people there
