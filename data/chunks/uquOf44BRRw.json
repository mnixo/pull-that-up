I mean you're seeing all these new approaches constantly changing some great minds involved yeah that's what I like that mean Ferriss a hobby and I mean I'm on the list can go on out but that's what let me come now a bit more of a nerd because you call somebody fights and you you try to have a life as well but I'm really now getting back into okay let's catch up and see what these different minds are saying well and you yourselves or even you know listening to this it's just always so cool to to hear different perspectives and okay yeah what's gonna work that's super important for all of us I think that's why BJ's gonna do good really I truly believe because he changed camp I think a talent like BJ in his training in Hawaii you know he kind of dictates whatever he wants to do he's so talented he schools people around and that's why when you put people like that on the pressure they get tired because they never experienced that in the ring because she's so way ahead above her for everybody else so if they want to do extra three rounds with any prey and he doesn't want to do it he's gonna I'm not gonna do I think it's a bad trick at Gregg Winkeljohn you know and there he's got all these guys gunning for him it's a legend I mean I'm I can only imagine the spark sessions they have going on I think it's going to do really well for him not with this opponent yeah Rodriguez is really good okay but I mean the fees a Hall of Famer done everything up we saw against Frankie Edgar what is it we talked about our podcast last win was Matt Hughes 2010 do you why do you think he's still fighting well he probably feels like he didn't do it right he probably feels like the fights he took with Frankie we had that really bizarre stand up he decided that he was gonna fight that way because it was more efficient and they didn't use as much energy as like widening his stance and he I think a lot of his career he was concerned with losing his energy in the ring yep a lot of his crew he's worried about gassing up so then he went with mark burnovich right so he does these two camps with Marvin Marinovich at least two camps correct he did sean sherk and I think he did Diego Sanchez I know he did Diego Sanchez because I know also that Steve Maxwell was training Diego Sanchez got Sanchez in incredible shape but that was BJ in his prime and when BJ wasn't tired when he was in she was joking around about it like when I have a six-pack what was it he was just a different animal back then but it was only sustainable for like a few fights I think like BJ it's for whatever reason it was hard for him to get totally motivated to get into that kind of shape again and when he described it it sounded hellacious like he couldn't hold his daughter literally literally so tired after working out that he couldn't even hold his kid and they have a very specific training philosophy to the Marinovich is and in a lot of ways some of the guys that like Nickerson who trains under his philosophy and speed of sport in California they want strength and conditioning to be number one priority number one you already know how to fight I love that yeah and the idea is if you already know how to fight well so since you had a fight you should just work on having the most incredible aerobic threshold that goes back to Frank and yeah but even Franco with uh why am i he's gonna kill Maurice Smith with their partner show you at the beginning that's what Frank was all about was that couldn't because it's Hardy was so boss back when Tito lost to Frank I wasn't the same buzz going back to the airport that Tito jumped next to me and he starts asking me question about stamina because I always said it's the most important thing you can never have enough stamina the most important so he start asking drills and doing the oldest things and then he became that crazy psycho cardio cardio right you know and he start beating everybody so forth at the Kendall Grove and into the Ultimate Fighter you know what Kendall came out of that show and that's what he told me he's like it's all cardio man everything is about cardio when and but again cardio also what about the nerves then and how much panicking and your emotions drained like what I'm saying there's a factor in it but but the actual real cold hard cardio plays a factor too right then it also plays a factor in your nerves yeah because if you know that you have a small gas tank yeah and especially when you walk through the ring did I train hard enough you know if you know that you can really go you know after work I will do seven six minutes rounds to the type at full blast that's like 42 minutes and but that was after a workout but I knew that nobody did that so I was not gonna run out against because we'd have our fights in in Japan but it's the only way to do it chances they go hard and I had guys coming who couldn't do warm-up in my class this is a 20-minute warmup it's the basra to work out with the sprawls and in a minutes we built I fill him up with either push-ups or with the kettlebell swings so it's 20 minutes straight people come in who had a fight like in two weeks in Japan and he couldn't do it they had that man I said don't fight he said what do you mean I said this is the warmup he didn't even start now and notice to say they lost because of cardio over there but yeah but how do you do this I said it's just baby steps it he's get yourself to the point where you can get through that and she'll warm up full clip and then dream hard yeah just keep doing it [Music]
