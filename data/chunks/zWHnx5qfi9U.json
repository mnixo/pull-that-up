stupid little fucking tube of paper that sucks endangered dangerous chemicals and you're telling me that I should be worried about the end of the world you're into the world is happening right now I'm watching it you're inhaling you're addicted to a fucking little stick yeah you're into the world's already here stupid the world is not necessarily predetermined we knows how this is all gonna turn out that's part of the fun of the movie that's part of the fun of the theatrical production that is your life's true if we knew everything that was going to take place it would be so boring if you knew that you were now in heaven and you get to bang some chick anytime you want for the rest of your life and you get to eat all the food you want it for the rest of life you think that it would be awesome but it's not dude you got without risk not without failure you need all those things you need to struggle you need struggle it's part of we are some sort of a monkey that creates things and if we don't create things whether you create ideas whether you create relationships whether you create houses where you create jokes wherever the fuck you put forth that's what makes human beings happy if you're just living in the clouds banging chicks and eating food you would fucking live in hell you don't think you would but eventually you would be in hell you would be in some weird situation where a giant part of what it is to be a human is removed from the equation yeah and it just goes back to what we talked about with welfare you you you've got to work to get something you can't just get it there has to be a struggle or you don't evolve and as soon as you introduce the option of no struggle you introduce the option of you know when people think that the struggle is over financially it's one of the reasons why when people are successful a lot of people go oh man you sold out um you know he's not hip anymore the struggle is never financial destroy did the best part about overcoming the financial struggle is now the struggle gets to be about thoughts and ideas so now the struggle gets to be about creating shit now the struggle gets to be about getting the center of what the fuck this is getting to the center of what is this life and you can guess what you can think about what is this life a whole lot more when you're a comedian that gets to wake up at 1:00 in the afternoon and it doesn't necessarily have to do anything all dating is sit in front of your commute computer drinking coconut juice and smoking pot and reading line you can think things through in a manner that the average person does never get a chance to do you get paid for it too that's what that's what kind of stand up is putting in a little funny light but kind of like surprising people with where you're taking your idea yeah that's what I mean yeah it's it's it's putting forth something you have to it's it's got to be hard man I've write shit sometimes and I'm I fucking go over and go man this bit sucks there's something missing in this bit like I know it's there but I don't know it's there and then there's this thing that I've just figured out how to do like over the last couple years where I used to have a theme like I would say okay today I'm gonna write about viagra we're gonna sit down we're gonna write some shit about viagra and then I would start about that and maybe you would go in a different direction but not too far off path now I just sit down and I open up a page and I just let it go right I just get high as fuck and I let it all go whatever crazy thought out and then in the morning I get up sober and then I look at what I wrote and I go what the fuck am i talking about like sometimes I write shit sometimes when I'm high and I go back and read it and I'm like this doesn't even seem like it's me writing this like who the fuck wrote this it makes sense sometimes yeah sometimes yeah sometimes it doesn't though but that's part of the that's part of the whole zone that you get into when you're creating something you can't be afraid of looking silly I knew you for so many years where you never do anything yeah well what was your turn what did Stanhope could you no no Eddie Bravo Eddie Bravo for sure 100% he he was a really good at jujitsu and we were hanging out together just because we took classes together and he gave me some private lessons and tied me up in a knot we I was training with this together guy was taking private lessons with his black belt so very nice guy had good intentions but I could roll with him but I knew his game you know and you get to a certain point where you could roll you know I could tap him out and in it very rare but occasionally I could get him with something and part of it was him like being rolling nice with me and rolling easy to me and let me get things but also I knew his game well when you start rolling with someone else you realize oh you got to roll with a bunch of different people you can't just roll with one person because Eddie Bravo just went right through me he just destroyed me part of it was because he was way better than me and really an amazing jiu-jitsu guy like he's a genius a jiu-jitsu genius a true genius every sense of the word but it was also because I sucked I thought I was good because I knew how to wrestle with one guy I knew his weaknesses I was physically a little faster than him I can do things but then I started wrong with other people I was getting tapped all the time I was like okay I got a joint class so anyway Eddie said you know I'd be happy to give you some private lessons I said oh awesome so we went out we got some lunch get some private lessons and we start talking about creativity and life and music and stuff because he's a musician and he said that he writes his best stuff and he stoned and I was like that doesn't even make sense like you're high and you I'm thinking when you're high I was like oh you dope you know you loser you know like the moments in my life where I had been drunk I was embarrassed about those moments I never like look back at the time I was struggling I can now you know now you know they were fucking hammered and we're talking shit at the bar you know it's fun but to me you know I'm in control of my shit now so what if me and and Brian and Joey Diaz do shots at the in the green room and the Portland you know helium well I don't feel bad about that I feel like we had a good time it was crazy and next day I had a headache he doesn't mean but back then I was embarrassed about anything that I did that wasn't positive and anything that I did that might make me a loser anything that I did that Michael yeah yeah yeah so he he was so adamant about how we'd made him like really creative and I was like all right let's do this come on pull over so we smoked pot and we had some ice cream and it was amazing was the greatest ice cream I've ever had in my life and I couldn't believe that marijuana made this ice cream so fucking good I had an ice cream sundae but hot fudge and it was the most incredible I the sensation of eating the food was so heightened I felt like a fool I felt like I can't believe that all my life that started yes that was it you know it was like I was talking to him and he's this fascinating guy I mean Eddie is a very fascinating guy he's very he's a free thinker he had a really hard childhood man my childhood was not my childhood was not not terrible it wasn't that it wasn't ideal I had a lot of shit happen to me I think a lot of us did all of us here did but his was horrific and because of that he developed this ability to just fuck you like push people away like focus on his goals and see things in a different way you know he had he had this ability to like he's got this ability to look at life and break things down and a lot of times when we have conversations he comes at it from a completely different angle than I do you know and I like that about you too you will often do that too and Duncan will do that all the time I love when people like when I have a friend that's a close friend that's very smart that will take things in a different way I don't necessarily always agree with them but it's a it's a fascinating thing it's almost like you if you if you value their opinion and if you talk to them about things like you have one more you out there interpreting interpreting the world from another possible angle yeah and so I met him and right away I knew him like this guy's smart as fuck he's a weirdo he's figured out some shit about jujitsu and if you can get that good at jujitsu I'm like you can get that good at a lot of fencing you're a bad motherfucker and he's a little guy I'll get he's not strong at all so he got really good at jujitsu all based on technique and leverage and he does everything the right way so you know you you you learn from a guy like that so I I met him and I was like okay so obviously there's some good to this weed you can't think that it's all bad I couldn't believe in my whole life I thought it was for losing it is imagine you sitting in the first couple of times he's like I can feel it in my hands Eddie oh yeah I was totally like I'm like complete rookie shit I remember Joey Diaz I said so the Joey Diaz once he goes look at this fucking rookie get the fuck out of here I forget what I said to him but we saw some crazy some crazy rookie pot experience to me to me I was calling him like it was the most profound thing that I ever heard he goes get the fuck out of here with that rookie shit he'd talk to me about look we're getting high motherfucker that's what's going on Joey Diaz will break things down I got sucker you ain't I by 2:00 in the afternoon go fuck yourself there's actually a t-shirt that we put out on higher - primate com sold out instantly we got new ones coming out folks I swear to god I'm I got a lot more this time I'm buying as many as you can and proceeds to go to the Joey Diaz weed fund so all the t-shirt money is right now he's got a fat check coming to him he'll keep him in weed for weeks so this that t-shirt should pay for all of joeys weed for the rest of his life that's my goal if we keep you know if he makes enough money off this t-shirt every month just to cover all of his weed expenses plus a few a few nice dinners here there I think it's fucking winner of a shirt man I can't wait to wear it I don't even have one we don't have one it says if you it's based on something you said once in the podcast and by the way he says all the time it wasn't just that moment he says it all the time now he says it all the time he says if you ain't I will call me up sometimes and I answer the phone and just go if you ain't ID by 2:00 in the afternoon go fuck yourself dog I ain't playin dog I ain't playin right now I got the banana bread from the Russians banana bread is the bomb diggity son that's not yeah where does this banana bread is to psychedelic right that fuckin gave me a heart attack cocksucker I can only do a couple impressions but I can do them it's not that good if he was in the room I could really do him I can I can imitate people it's okay did you I have real mad TV during with when Matt Braunger was on know there's a guy we had on the show have you ever seen IKEA Heights no what is that it's these guys that now I've this guy Matt Braunger who was also on MADtv we had him on not atomic stickers and Christina's show but he was talking about how he was on this thing that you can find on the internet it's fucking hilarious where these this comedy trip goes into an Ikea they do like a CSI type show in the middle of Ikea like without IKEA knowing like they have employees are that are part of the production that will like take it like the employees of IKEA and get them distracted and then they'll have like full-on like gun guns and cops shootouts you know like in the middle of like a bedroom in IKEA and they so they used IKEA as a stage for CSI it's fucking hilarious it's one of the funniest things they had to stop doing it because they just we're getting kicked out every episode like these guys are actually doing a TV show and the set as IKEA yet and set is like really great and it's all there in a kitchen now and then they're in the basement that's what ideas we know and I guess supposedly like like they can't do any more cuz they just gotten too much oh please keep doing a change in some alt Walmart I'd say the last one they did laughs like kiya hai ya kiya hai last one they did they had like a zombie attack or something like that I was thinking thinking with instead of doing it again and getting in trouble kiya act like they move like cuz like like act you know how like in TV shows they moved to different cities and so like Marc probably will we probably don't even need to give them that idea they could have said yes it's over they're kicking us out no they're gonna heights calms like IKEA heights calm in the podcast we had Matt on with your mom's house number 14 a deaf Squatch on 19 hilarious that's a that's a great idea every now and then you know one of those ideas comes along we like wow yeah that's one of those that's it that's that's stellar it is that's what I love about you know I love being in like the comedy community is such an interesting community you know I mean it feels weird to even say that you're a part of it we're all we all have this weird sort of I don't know you just have like a weird sort of like humility about the business and you know it's it's so it's a weird thing to even say like yeah you know I'm a professional comedian yeah that's what I did seems like it seems it seems odd and weird somebody said best to me you know you're professionally funny you are professionally so I'll show you as you are pro it's all right so it's a weird thing it's it goes contrary to the idea of being or what makes you funny in the first place yeah but but being a part of the community like you're having people like you as a friend and having people like you know Nick Swardson come over and Carolla come over and all these people that I'm like wow Nick swardson's hanging out here yeah and Adam Carolla's really sitting there and you're really sitting there it's a fuckin greatest thing ever wouldn't the great the greatest community to be a part of people who make you laugh it's true it's like a part of this crater natee or something I always feel like you know boy when you've done the road and when you've been on stage and you know so different audiences are so different you don't know how they're gonna respond you've got you've gone through something we were at the backstage of the UFC and it was a big UFC event and if fuckin place was packed but Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly showed up and I saw Jim Norton and Bobby Kelly and I shot towards them like a slingshot like I made a beeline to them because I knew that's where the fun talk was gonna be you know Jimmy fucking Norton is there and Bobby Kelly I've known Bobby Kelly since we were like 21 yeah Bobby was with Allen the Monkees and Dane Cook and that like they were an improv troupe and I was the headliner and they would open for me we did a bunch of those uh aku-aku Zadok Doherty comedy Hut's so we worked together a bunch of times when those guys were just coming up I was like a couple years ahead of them but they were cool so I've been yeah I hung out with Bobby Kelly like back in the day like so I've known him since we won't even know I'm Bob and sure I've known Dayne forever I knew Dan before he ever did stand-up like on his own he did it in that troop he didn't in Alan the Monkees do what they would do is they would do sketches and you know they were taking chances it was creative stuff and then they would each do stand-up they would each do like five minutes of stand-up and then I would go onstage after them and it was like it was kind of like I wouldn't say like they would they were opening but it was so much different than an opening act they had a lot of shit going on like they did it was getting funny guys yeah yeah so and you know so I've known Bobby since like I said I was like 24 you know he was probably a couple years younger than me like we're 21 so I see them and man like it's what you're saying it's like these are this is like these are like soldiers they're like feller fellow fellow travelers in this weird world of show business I do too I was I did a New Year's Eve show and I was in Ontario at the improv I remember just stopping and I had to Michael my hand I went you know I really meant this to I said you know I feel like a successful person like I can't believe I get to do this for a living and I said if I die tomorrow I got I can't complain comparatively to what how most people have to live their lives their country and I get paid to make people out for two hours a night and I and I get to do whatever I want when I want but like the lottery it's not easy you know like there's a concept there's there's a lot of a lot of weird shit that goes on in the creating of material and the going up there and fucking around with it do you know it and it never gets easier no like it really doesn't but that's why it's so satisfying when it comes out I just did it just like we were talking about with welfare and the lottery and all that shit you you with you have to have the only thing that's different to me is relationships relationships I want no work yeah I agree I want friendliness and I don't have to work for that I want to fight all the time like just people that think that you have to fight yeah and I think that's that's a crock of shit you just gotta find something he a nice person and find someone that doesn't want to fight benefit with Garry Shandling and Kevin Nealon and where'd you guys do this at the Wilshire theatres for children with AIDS and this is last weekend and we all went up and did it we all each did I did a half hour but you know the rest of the guys did like 20 minutes and it was we just had so much fun it was so fun and it was it was everybody was hilarious and Brad Garrett fucking killed me he's up for him in Long Island opening Eastside , in 1990 was killing Doris Roberts and she was in the audience is like I told you she was 90 but when she did this show for Craig on it how are you drinking are you drunk sweetie yet you know moose killing everybody this black woman was in it and in the thing and she was really only because look at her from the Civil War it must be so different now for you isn't it I mean killing him I he was amazing or the civil right and he's just saw a reverend but he was fucking killing the room and then we were all backstage and I'm winning I'm Garry Shandling and all these guys are good in some ways you know big you know they've done a lot of stuff in comedy for 20 30 years and they were all talking about how they just all have so much reverence for comedy and it's still not easy no matter what and it's still a challenge and you still you better respect that bitch just better respect you better respect that bitch cuz if you don't you'll be up on stage realizing you didn't respect it and eating it and there's a bunch of people paid to see you don't so true that motivates the fuck out of me ever gets old you gonna be on stage for an hour my friend bring the money you said that one time I did I'm a long time ago this was fucking 13 years ago I did Friday nights or something that your emceeing and I gotta but I did this weird story and you were like and you were like really common and he said you know you do the most unusual shit he goes but you'll never do that shit on the road in some cities they'd be like fuck but you gotta bring the money if you're gonna do an hour you gotta bring the money guess what you got to be fucking funny for an hour cuz people lose their attention span that room gets quiet quick even if you're famous Michael Richards out of here or so do as people get angry they're on your side for you got five maybe seven maybe if you're Brad Pitt and then hit get get get get get and it just fucking tumbleweeds he turns the other way you're a dog barking the distance and they fucking hate you yeah it turns the other way yeah what a surprise monetizing his madness one of my friends says that is a good way of putting it Jeremy Piven is the smart guy yep yeah that's that that is what it is sort of I mean it's also you know he's trying to figure out some way to get the public on his side because he's got some giant lawsuit no no can crazy you think I mean winning winning winning that's called winning with the goddesses that's a guy that's a guy cocaine that's 25 years of fame by the way in Hollywood you're an 800 gram Warhawks and we're winning and Warner Brothers still has this big posters for the rocks yeah Bryan comes home so I thinks it's all a scam to make two and a Half Men the biggest show ever next easily from his back and his triumphant return he thinks it's all orchestrated joking joking porn stars almost threatening to stab his wife winning yeah he does apparently according to Hollywood insiders yes apparently according to Hollywood insiders he actually has a very good point because the guy didn't show up for work late it wasn't like he was missing set shoots and costing them money he was always fucked up they knew he was fucked up from a long time ago they hired him under the premise that he was his party animal and guess what that's what he fuckin plays on the show he plays a watered down version of the real life exactly it sounds like a big dick contest that's it it sounds like it sounds like him and that guy who's the executive producer there waving the dicks around in the exam an executive producer doesn't want this junkie back on his set and he wants to move on but he's gonna ruin the fucking people job say was that he was able to he could strangle a girl anything else and then he made fun of Chuck Lorre on that yeah radio show and that's my god yeah well that Chuck Lorre guy we talked about on the show before about all the shows that he's produced he produced grace under fire he produced Roseanne he produced Sybil he had a deal with cunt after cunt after cunt and he developed the ability to put his fucking foot down you know and that's why he's so successful that guy's got a gang of TV shows and listen man the bottom line is Charlie Sheen was probably very creatively unfulfilled you know and it's not to say the tune half-men wasn't a good show because when honestly I never watched it I've never seen a single episode not bad so I don't know I watched like maybe one scene once I'm happy for Jon Cryer yeah I met him a long time ago we did a college together in I think he did I'm pretty sure it was him it was he's about because he was in the a before that I couldn't believe that I saw there was one of the first guys I ever saw that had been in a movie I did a stand-up at this college then he did something else it was like bigger in the same College pretty in pink yeah it was something yeah somewhere on those I'm pretty sure was Jon Cryer a long long long time ago but the point is that you know he probably mean the guy was in fucking platoon and Wall Street he was in two huge Oliver Stone smash movies I mean and they were brilliant performances here we go so when he's playing this silly guy in this silly show year after year making mad mad loot the money piles up but then the ability to break away from the mundane becomes more and more extreme just like the Catholic girl that wants to suck a dick and he's not being challenged as a grown man you can give yourself a fucking problem yeah you're gonna find a way to challenge yourself you're gonna create a problem for yourself yeah that shit happens all the time you get somebody gets exactly what they want they're a little too young to handle it or they get exactly what they want they have nowhere else to they don't have the imagination to figure out where else they can grow they get into fucking trouble too much money no imagination and you didn't earn it you're fucking even if you did her what I do respect the Charlie Sheen's trying to do is apparently he's trying to evolve his show so he's bringing in comics and Russell Peters is gonna come on he's gonna tell us about it because Russell's been opening for him he's great someone please on Twitter verify Russell Peters the real Russell P that's him he's great he can't get verified wait he's having guests on the show or comics Oh for comics what they do is the comics will interview him there's a video of him interviewing Russell Peters where a lot of Russell Peters rather interviewing Charlie Sheen where Charlie Sheen talks about accidentally leaving his gun out and Kelly Preston was living with him and she dropped the gun and shot her it shot the toilet and it ricocheted and hit her yeah yeah yeah she got hurt you know crazy junkie shit yeah you very well could it but Charlie just has good writers for the this show they've probably learned from the mistakes of the past that they actually have to make this thing interesting yeah but I mean this story is a true story but apparently who knows how much of his journey but Russell Peters was interviewing him that's it and then Russell says a bunch of really funny lines in between it and just fucks around with it and so now that sort of become sort of a show you know but I think they need to incorporate other things like they need to incorporate music and some other shit I think it should just end I haven't thought about Charlie Sheen in like three weeks yeah that's you everybody's he's gotta he's got something there's some sort of an interest to the country he starts dragging together a show yeah that's what I'm saying it's kind of fascinating who knows I mean look the guy that whoever the fuck the guy is inside of him that was the guy that was in Wall Street or was the guy that was in platoon that guy's a bad motherfucker and if he could find who that guy is you know people lose their way and regain it it happens you know and it might be through this humility that he gets out of getting fired from his fucking job and bested in this just what dude he's done like a hundred million bucks or something I don't know a lot of it might be a real estate a lot of times dude he was making more money than any human being had ever made on a sitcom he's making two million dollars are fucking out but he's definitely out of mine he's got some cash if he doesn't he's Creole - not really yeah but some pay to raid you the internet gurus never dude Charlie Sheen bankruptcy Charlie Sheen I bet you're hoping right now emotion Charlie was going brother while Charlie's winning while you're here doing your what is a podcast great good stuff it's really really traveling well doing well for you big-time production here was that real foam over that microphone good luck charlie smoke weed and stay away from that cocaine yeah that's all those highs this is not there's not the good it's fine nobody ever did blow and went yeah and all these problems I did a bunch of blow I'm dead it fucking worked out yeah in the history of the world that's never been said yeah that's not good that stuff's bad for you that stuff fries your fucking noggin did you know Jimi Hendrix died when he was 27 yeah turn that crap outta Janis Joplin whenever I wanna bang Morrison Morrison because I never I have any any sense of delusions of grandeur just look at what Jimi Hendrix compost and it was only 27 27 no Internet they were like 23 20 that's ridiculous ridiculous like think about that they were they were all like educated they already know Jimmy Page has a whole fuckin library like a huge library of like on black magic and stuff Wow Jimmy Page's is a scholar he's read those guys have read a lot I had this conversation back then I had this conversation the other day with the lovely Britney Palmer she's one of the ring girls you're seeing ya know your friend Anthony I just saw anyway she's very nice person and she is fascinated by the 70s in the 60s and she's a painter and she makes all these uh she's making all these different paintings and we were having this conversation like I'm the same way when I listen to music nine times out of 10 when I'm driving in my car I'm listening to my ipod and it's usually like some some like 1970s Zeppelin or in some 1970s Allman Brothers or Leonard Skynyrd that's it to me just resonates you know when I listen to old music from like that era for whatever reason it just resonates and I'm trying to figure out what is it that time what is it about the Jimi Hendrix what is it about Jim Morrison well it was it just because it was the first to that shit was it was it because it was the first this giant evolutionary breakthrough for a lot of people back then thought their music was counted for something in other words they thought that their music could actually change something and a lot of a lot of what happens with artists is cynicism at times have a certain cynical stamp on them and I think we live in a very cynical time the notion that nothing you do as an individual certainly as an artist could change anything at all that's very prevalent among artists so you don't have people who are doing stand-up for example to try to break a social norm or shatter a social norm you certainly don't have a lot of musicians saying my music is actually influenced the political atmosphere remember it was after we had been through in the 70s we've just been through and we're going through a terrible war in Vietnam and and you know how many people died 54,000 men were killed that's a huge number where if you compare the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq it was it was four thousand deaths and a lot of injuries but I'm just saying that in a very short period of time we had also been through a world we've been through a number of that we were in the Cold War we'd been to World War two and everybody had an active memory of that that shit life really counted and mattered and people didn't live as long and there was this lose this idea that you better hurry up and get through it and make your fucking stamp while you still have an opportunity because if you looked around and let's take 1974 and you looked around at the world half the world was starving to death and and and for the moat and half the world was living under communist dictatorships which was essentially slavery and half the world was a very dangerous place in that war and by the way there was an arms race called the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States and a lot of people really were like you know what we could all fucking just blow up the next more is gonna be where the cockroaches and the rats are the only things living and there's always there was always that saying that if there is a third world war i think was Einstein who said be the live fourth world world they fought with sticks living the living will and the living will envy the dead right that idea you'll be he said I don't know what's gonna start the third world war what weapons will be used but the fourth World War we fought with sticks great yeah but the point is that I think when you live in times of great uncertainty and times of great hope and times of great violence remember in this country we come off a number of assassinations Martin Luther King Malcolm X JA John Kennedy Joe Kennedy and it goes on line I mean there was this notion that we were in a real battle and a real social battle for our souls man you had Pete you had two governments sending young boys off to die in a war most people hadn't even heard of that fucking part of the world and there was this idea that we're losing we gotta we gotta get in the streets and say something and do something more importantly if we do so shit will change and people were getting the hose down and black people didn't have the vote until 1964 it was only ten years old so when you think about how extreme things were not only that but how uncertain and how it was the beginning of so many different ideas that were competing that when you get a very term but society and turmoil usually and and what's very positive about is you want a cross current of ideas you want ideas bashing heads like fuckin Rams and when you have that provided you keep the violence out of it but there's always gonna be a little violence but when you have that and people who where they're fighting for their souls with an idea you're gonna get something pretty fucking cool and you're and you're gonna get certainly very volatile artistic expression and a lot of that expression can very well be Miles Davis who is saying I'm a black man in America with you know and I still don't feel free or whatever it might be or you could have beeper I what Bieber is candy compared to think about how much we music counted back then right jazz was the only place that a lot of black people could really express themselves honestly through a fucking horn so if your hearts broken you either sing it or you shoot it through a horn because if you say otherwise you're gonna get fucking hung or shot or arrested that's what it was to be black in the 1940s 50s 60s and even the 70s for a lot of them that's the bottom line it goes on and on so things were way more dream and I think in today's world where everything's at the touch of a button where everybody has plenty to eat even if it's not healthy food and we feel safer and I don't think and I think we're cynical I don't believe that what we do and what we say can really change the world and back then you did you think it's the numbers just too many humans now no I mean there's still people that rage against Michigan I don't kind of the same kind of shit you know I think we're going to face another we're gonna face we're always gonna face challenges as people and as a world and those challenges may very well bring into question our own survival I don't think so and for a long time I don't know you know what's really changing the world this thing we're on right now the Internet yes is this is a big change very much the way we are right now our parents were never like this these these conversations were never held and it gives more potential Jo for the notion that all of us could get together and springboard into an idea and a major shift and with something like this like right now live there's 2,000 people listening to us live and this is a tiny fraction of the amount of people that will listen to us over the next few months you know it's gonna be hundreds of thousands of people and these are people when they start looking at the world the way you're talking about it the way you know stepping back and describing and saying what is it what would is it to live with passion what is what is important in this life what is what is the fun where's the enjoyment where's the where's the real true passion in this world like what is it for you what is it for you and if you don't fucking find that your life's not gonna be fun that's right and if don't get saddled down by debt don't get caught up in a lot of but but also things you backing on that great point is is you've got to find a way to keep yourself inspired yeah find ways I don't care what it is don't really be doing what you enjoy doing and be you do stoke that those fires and one of the things about stand-up is the fear of bombing also gives you another added incentive and motivation that I think some artists are without you know when they just produce books or just produce you know they're just wait for reviews but the fear of actual physically being in front of someone when they don't like you that's so much more intense than a shitty review it sure is because you feel yeah and it's not you just I mean look just life is temporary and we all need to wrap our heads around that if we all just step back this whole world is moving on momentum and that is our number one problem as a race we're moving in the way that our ancestors have been moving and we don't no one ever just stops and goes whoa whoa whoa let's just settle down and talk this over let's have a 30 day summit where we're all the leaders of the world get together and try to figure out how are we gonna redesign the human race to make us all function together how is there gonna be a a reasonable distribution of the natural resources of the earth so that one country doesn't grow rich because they have the fucking missiles and the nuclear bombs and they somehow another it's distributed amongst everyone so we get to some sense of fairness and I'll work together to make sure that people don't have too many fucking babies so we don't run out of food on this crazy Rock like let's let's let's organize this thing let's do it together the only way that's gonna happen is the kids that are in college right now or listening to shit like this or going online and researching the world and looking at things in a way that we never have the ability to and the access to information that we never had access to and they're they're getting a chance to see the world from a fresh eye and fresh perspective and realize that this is some weird thing we're all running in the same direction hoping that someone knows where we're going they're the future you you College motherfucker with the bong right now this is for you there will be some in the system right now there will be sensitive to it in the next wave will integrate and the next wave of people that are trying to be politicians would be like Gary Johnson will be like Ron Paul they'll realize there's freedom and love in telling the truth and really trying to do the right thing instead of being some bitch to a corporation which is the most common most politicians are most politicians are little hookers they're stick their ass up in the air and some corporation comes by and drop some money in their pussy and that's what they are and that that's what we have to realize we don't do you don't have to be like that the fuck who cares the fear factor guy and the guy from the hangover to telling you how to run this world take notes take blame the weed for the last five minutes of this rant this has been a good poem it's true man you know and I hear and not to say that this is why we're doing it but I hear it all the time just Cass changes the way people think and I think you know having a guy like you in my life has definitely changed the way I think and I think you know all of us together we help each other and I'm very happy and very proud that we can they can put out this resource not just for entertainment this is this podcast but also you know it gives you an opportunity to hear another point of view that you might not come in contact with in your life I don't know too many people like you you know it's it's hard to cultivate them I've done a real good job of trying to keep as many interesting people in my life as possible because I think it's it's enriching and I love you love conversations with you we have the craziest fucking conversations but we have had more on a regular basis since I put together this podcast and we have in the last few years that's why I like doing it that's why I clean your podcast so we can hang out and talk yeah this is so this is actually these are great conversations that we have they're fuckin awesome that you never really do when you're just hanging around there's a lot of it's grab-ass you're just getting this yeah by a bunch of other people but it's focus you're forced to sit down and focus talk about what's important to you you figure things out as you're talking well could you imagine all the people that are if you imagine if you're standing in front of 400,000 people you would never feel so free to talk and do boring releasing dog we did 50 with with Jimmy Norton we did a crowd of 50 and it was
