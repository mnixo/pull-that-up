trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day no your life is very different right now that it was a year ago it is how crazy is that yeah are you a year ago you were talking about like not doing this anymore you like I gotta figure out what I'm doing I'm now hated you're the fucking world champ what's your I am talk about a frickin 180 yeah my career in life wouldn't have been different a year ago than it is now you know strange is that how that can just oh yeah in an instant you just never know what does that feel like it's like when you wake up in the mornings you have to go okay I'll wear the belt smart you see that's real pity no for real I'm happy it's um it's enlightening it's fun it's it's great to be the champ I I love it honestly it's a completely different yeah you know year ago so frustrated because you know when I lost her on to the last time I knew I had a long road you know and to work my way back up but I thought I had done that and when I beat just a guy it was announced like you know this is gonna be the number one contender Eliminator fight and then afterwards they're like yes it is you're gonna fight Ronda then I felt like the carpet was kind of just pulled out from under my feet because they're like just kidding Holly's you know Holly's fighting and they announced it without telling me so that's why I was so upset I don't take this shit lightly you know yeah like I was training my ass off already I'd already reached out to a girl in France like I can't say her name right things like Geoffrey I don't some french name but she beat Ronda and judo so I'd already like been making plans with her to train with her and fire over here and she was changing things then I was like feel like such an asked like I feel like an idiot like I look like an idiot because here the announcement was made and I didn't even know so I was kind of upset about that but you know we talked about and we smooth things over and and I took it personally at the time but I don't think it was meant personally it was a business decision and I understand it that at the end of the day that's what it was and it all worked out so the UFC is in a weird position because they're both a promoter and sort of a sanctioning body yeah and that's really rare mm-hmm a matter of fact I can't think of any other sport where that exists yeah you know they have just this ability to decide like they'll they'll just decide like this person gets a shot like the whole McGregor situation is a perfect example that yeah like all of a sudden if he had beaten Nate Diaz or if he had beaten dos Anjos dos Anjos didn't get injured he beat beat dos Anjos you fucking know for sure they were going to have him fight Robbie Lawler like for sure and they were just gonna like figure out a way to do something with 145 pound Tata and why wouldn't they do it if there were business people because that's where the money is I mean it would been if he had beat dos Anjos and then went on and fought Robbie Lawler Jesus Christ when you talking like a five million pay-per-view buy event they'd have to do it it would be insane but if that was like a sanctioning body like you've seen it before in like boxing like someone won't take a mandatory challenger and they get stripped even when they just won the title it happens all the time like where a fight would just win the title and then they have this mandatory challenger who nobody knows they'll go fuck that fight I'm gonna go fight Canelo Alvarez I'm gonna fight this guy or that guy and then they get stripped like because there's like five different sanctioning bodies like boxing is way more of a mess so there's like pros and cons doing it the way the UFC does it but from a point of view of someone like you it's probably much more frustrating well you just never know what to expect like you get curve balls all the time in the UFC don't know what to expect you know like a lot of people were so pissed off at me for for the Holly Holm not having the rematch right away but it's like it's not it's not my choice you know yeah because of you I don't know because they think that I like turned it down or I should have went in there like guns blazing for Holly and like put myself out of my shield like no we have to have the Holly rematch you guys you don't understand but um you know they call me up like Amanda July 9th I'm like okay yeah obviously noted UFC 200 how the fuck do you say no no you don't you can't say no that's what they come up with you like I'm in yeah and yeah you know I was like do you relax most people don't get immediate rematches in a career like unless you are Conor McGregor or onder you know someone that's really got a presence you don't get an immediate rematch like I didn't when I went back in Strikeforce when when I lost to Ronda I didn't get an immediate I've never gotten to me to rematch my career I would have loved to immediately rematch Kat when I lost to her but you don't get it sometimes you got to work your way back up and you know hope for the best but we will I'm sure we'll fight each other again she's fighting Valentina's Chen Sheng kono yeah I have to laugh when people say like that we're scared to fight someone you know like people are like oh you're scared to fight Holi again like you can't listen those people scared is not a relative like it's not a term that I feel like fighters really we don't we don't have scared the way normal people have scared you know yeah like a normal person would be scared to get off their couch and go to the gym you know to spar or something like that's what we do like we live like what most people would you know shit their pants Sidhu on it then you would have to be a fool to not know that it's a dangerous fight so it's not a matter of not being aware of the danger yeah but it's a matter of managing the consequences or mentally I think you did a fantastic job at the Holi fight like literally you did in that fight other than the fifth round which is the most amazing part of it but you did everything we were talking about like what you have to do to beat her I'm like she's got to stay on the outside she could have very her rhythm and she's got to let Holly come to her like she can't rush in because you rush into Holly it's like rushing into Machida or rushing to anybody who's a great counter striker you saw the wrong to fight Ronda just came bulldogging on her and tried to out bulldogger and you just you can't do that with Holly she's too fast good footwork to her striking is so precise her her counters are so clean and her movements very hard to read it gets very unpredictable I remember well a couple times I tried to maybe come forward and get her to go to the fence and I couldn't tell whether she was gonna jet out to the right to the left like she was like two steps back left and oh yeah you know like ah you know like I couldn't even tell like she gave no indication of which way she was gonna go yeah well you just did a fantastic job of varying your approach to your speed was different like you you you did a lot of fainting you varied things up a lot and you could tell like she was like almost like waiting for these moments to happen when you're gonna come forward and then you wouldn't come forward and then it becomes like a test of patience like who's going to get outside of their comfort zone who's gonna take chances who's gonna who's going to engage yeah and she also has that weird stance too was she kind of halfway sounds like a boxer and halfway stands like a karate person yeah she throws like a lot of side kicks on front leg techniques yeah she's she's she's a tricky one but we put together a really good game plan I was happy with that okay he did but it was a fifth round a fifth round was crazy god when you grabbed ahold of her and then eventually got her back and got her to the ground it was so crazy because every aspect of from your initial entrance to the takedown to getting her back there was nothing a hundred percent about it it was all touch-and-go it was all a scramble it wasn't like you had complete total control over like maybe like Demian Maia versus Ric story like he Damon Maya gets rich stories back he's got him locked up and then he anacondas him and squeezes them and then it gets him it wasn't like that it was like you were fighting for your fucking life and you knew there was no time there was no time you were likely down by like at least one round and you were headed into the fifth and final round and maybe if you won that round you could have got the decision but fuck you're fighting the champ you know who knows who knows what's gonna happen you take her back and then when she tries to shake you off the top and you hang in there and you hang in there and you see you like and I watch them like oh my god she's gonna go out and when she went out and you climbed off her and she was unconscious like holy shit holy shit what a moment and I was inaudible it was incredible it was one of the best moments in all of women's championship fighting as far as like like an extreme extremely dramatic moment where like you're you're trying to accomplish something she's fighting tooth and claw neither one of you are exhausted so it's not like anyone's like physically compromised it's just a fucking mad scramble between two killers and you get her and you got her back and then you get it back and you sink the choke and she's trying to fucking shake you off and you hung in there and when she rolled and you're on top of her and you hung on to it you realize like oh my god she's going out yeah she is she didn't even tap she was throwing punches in the air while you were choking her unconscious I kept waiting to myself like when is she gonna tap it didn't in my in that instinctual moment I'm so used to in training you get people in a choke you know they tap so I'm waiting for that tap and I'm like good god like when is this girl gonna tap like I know I've got her when she'd you know tap on it and then then I felt her like I saw her you know from my peripherals kind of do something I wasn't quite sure if she was tapped what she was doing until I watched the video later and I felt him pull me off and I'm like that's the feeling that we fight for is that feeling that that feelings like I did it I established my dominance you know it's a it's a it's a prideful sport in some ways you know it's hand-to-hand combat with someone else it's like you know I did it tonight it was better it has to be prideful because otherwise there's just certain sacrifices and certain fires that you're just not gonna walk through like you have to have every fucking motivation you have to be Zen but you also have to have an ego there's to be so many things going on for you to achieve that highest level of greatness it's like walking on a tightrope you know people that are just like that perfect balance you know walking between buildings that are you know hundreds of stories high or you know and then it's like it's kind of like that I mean you have to have the perfect balance and everything has to meet perfectly in that moment including the training camp not overtraining did you ever hear that video that um the video is not that good but the audio is is awesome it's between the fourth and fifth round and it's my corners what they're telling me this or the fifth round it's such an emotional video for me when I watched it it makes me relive that moment and Bryan came in there and essentially he was like Misha you've got to get after you got it you have got to put your chin down and Mike Tyson this chick that basically means just get after her I get get in there get after it take the risk risk getting knocked out go for broke and it goes you know plays instead around and basically he's just telling me fucking Mike Tyson er like get after her you know bulldogger do whatever you've got to do he's like cuz you're running out of time and I remember in that fifth round still trying to get out of that that mindset of like I had to find the perfect opportunity have to be patient because the whole training camp was you know patient but persistent you know patient but persistent don't run into anything because you you know you'll get caught you get knocked out you'll get need you'll get kicked you'll get punched so don't do that but you got to look for the opening when it's the right timing it's all about timing and after I took her down in that second round and I just beat her up that round she was so um so cautious in the third and fourth and so perfect you know her game plan was perfect to to beat me to stay just far enough out of the range and keep me from not wanting to come in I couldn't find an fect opening couldn't like get in on anything there wasn't mistakes that she's making and then in the fifth round I just decided you know you're gonna have to you're gonna have to take the chance of getting knocked out this is this is what it's boiling down to you know you've got like three minutes left on the clock and now it's do or die it's either you go in there you go for it you do rush in she catches you you get knocked out you know you gave it everything you got or you can make something happen finish the fight the question was really like whether the second round was a 10-8 round on all three judges scorecards it was yeah was watching it that's what the judges say yeah well it should have been but but what I'm what I meant was the question watching it was like I won like when we were when you were headed into the fifth round what my question was was I wonder if she got a 10-8 round for that second round because if she did then this is like oh this is an even fight so what's happening right now like what were yeah how the judge is looking at it okay going into the fifth round it was even yeah yeah it was tied that's crazy that was such a crazy moment does another time the Indian the post-fight interview where I almost cried like a bitch I get so emotional yeah it was it was incredible but Somali meats are hard to explain to someone when you're there and you you you get to see someone like you who's worked so hard for something for so long you know so when I said to you like how does that sound like what does it sound like that you're the new women's bantamweight champion of the world like was that sound and you were just so overwhelmed it was so crazy like to see me right next to you while you were saying that and you said when you said I'm waiting for you to say that for so long this crate this crazy moment crazy yeah cuz I you know what was what's crazy you talk about the mind the power of it I had visualized that moment so many times but I felt like I was confused in that it was hard for me to distinguish that that was the real moment I would got it I would imagine it was so and it was so we you know so surreal I would imagine I to this day it probably seems fake yeah it's really weird yeah sometimes I have to go back and like man that really did it really happened it really happened right there oh it's pumped J thank ya look it's so excited if you had like if auras were real you know like fucking if you had Chi it was coming off your body for sure put a blow on the whole whole state I was yeah yeah everyone would have fallen over and been shaking papers flying cups fly into the air and carpet would rip okay that's gracious yeah that was that was the best best moments of my life for sure I could only imagine could only my mean and anyone that watches that sport that moment when you choked her out and in the whole exchange of the fit my even like that really the whole fight because a fight is like I mean in a weird way I mean we call this martial arts and there's a lot of people that have a problem with that but in my mind that there is an art to what you guys did in that fight and even what Holly did because up until that fifth round mean like you said especially the third and fourth she was doing what she wanted to do she was she's and there was a display going on there was like there was a performance going on on top of this being a competition to watch it as someone sitting there watching and calling it I mean this is a work of art and to have it in that way this is such a masterful performance with such a masterpiece moment and that to me is like one of the best moments in MMA because it's such a fucking hard thing to achieve to become a champion and for someone like you had tried and tried again you won the title in Strikeforce yeah and you're trying and trying again and trying to make this happen and you know you think you're getting boxed out and then the Ronda fight didn't happen after you beat Jessica I and then all of a sudden you have this opportunity and it comes to together in one of the most powerful ways we've ever seen inside the Octagon I was amazing well thank you that was that was quite a great narration of everything that's had to happen to to make this come true you know in it it's a it's crazy because um it was ten at the same month ten years the like the month um that I had had my first fight wow it's been ten years yeah so it's crazy because you think ten years ago there wasn't even I mean women's MMA was a joke like it was I mean knowing to me it wasn't obviously but to most people it was expecting at best something that kind of threw on the card is kind of like aha you know watch the chicks fight you know right hopefully it'll pop out cuz they didn't respect us as athletes you know that's that's what we that's that's the debt see honest truth that's the uphill battle that it was like nobody took it seriously we didn't make any money we were fighting for bread crumbs at best I saw Holly um once since since a fight and I was really actually kind of nervous about it because I was like she was um at the Jones OSP fight those happen and um we were both of the VIP party and my friend Heather Clark used to train Heather Joe Clark sexy fighting this weekend in Rotterdam anyways she was like you should go and talk to her was like yeah I want to I just I don't want to come on like how what do I say what's up bitch like what what do you say to someone that you just you need to throw hug say hi I know that's what I did you know I just went up and was like you know how are you and she like if she came back she's like you know I'm just really bummed I didn't get that rematch like I know I was like don't worry I was like well we'll see each other a few sure she's like yeah she's like I hope so I was like I hope you still have it just like you know I want to I want to see you again future I'm like yeah I totally get it I've been in her shoes before I know how bad that sucks and she wants that back but you know we were friendly but it's amazing how both of you are so nice like Holly's one of the nicest oh nice she's such a sweet her dick you lessly nice well if you didn't know she was a fighter you'd be like no fucking way and then you find a 19 time world boxing champion be like what the fuck are you talking about I know how is it possible how's that nice lady a killer yeah some tomfoolery yeah it doesn't make any sense like if she doesn't fit the mold either like both of you guys are really interesting representatives of MMA and great representatives because you break that mold you no fan of her manager though oh yeah yeah why I don't know I don't even know if I've ever met him in person I probably haven't maybe I have if I did it wasn't memorable anyways um I guess he went like Dana went down so tainted Dana told me this Dana went down to Albuquerque before this fight ever came together of her and I right and he said look you guys need to wait for Ronda trust me that's the big-money fight that's the fight you want to wait for he went down and he told me this face he went down there to tell them don't fight me should take they didn't want to give me the you see did not want that fight to happen right they wanted you know severe the rematch should be the first fight and Holly's manager told him we want Miesha Tate and Dana said he threw up his hands was like fucking kidding me he's like she spent the baddest you know other than Ronda for years now and you want to take her lightly you think you're just gonna walk there he's like yeah we got this like she's gonna be a tune-up fight who's her manager I don't even know his name okay I don't know he's a lady but he told Dana that that they said that they thought that I was going to be a tune-up fight
