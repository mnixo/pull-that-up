hello freak bitches have you ever seen that Russian lady that can pick up I think she can carry like 32 kilograms for their pussy it might be more than that and let's say it's like more than 70 pounds I believe I haven't checked yeah she has this ability to like I guess they put like a ball and then attach a string to a ball at the end of the string is a weight and she puts that ball inside of her pussy and just locks down on that motherfucker and they can literally lift up like 70 pounds of weight it's impressive I've been stood I've stood at one end of a strip club and had a in Bangkok had a Thai stripper Maya dots from the other side of the room out of her pussy and pop a balloon that I was holding up my head Wow and she was she could fire those things with such aim I don't know why I was so stupid because I could have gotten taken an eye out but what kind of speed speed like what she must have been a good 10 meters so maybe 30 feet away from me oh my god she's firing him across the room fast enough to be able to pop a balloon with accuracy with accuracy that's insane now how is she doing this is she have like her elbows to the back of her knees and she's got her like her pussy up in the air now she was standing up I'm trying to picture exactly what position she was in GS she was sort of nail nailing and like standing kneeling wait no sorry not not kneeling bent knees bent standing upright and with a thrust of the hips boy shooting it out why it's bent knees standing up are facing you facing me wow that's crazy that doesn't even seem like this that's like shooting a gun in the air when you're pointing it at the ground it doesn't make any sense how did she do that she might have had a hands on the ground to be honest I wasn't focused on her fucking position I was focused on whether she was gonna take my eye out I had my eyes closed most of the time well she had her hands on the ground now it makes perfect sense so she's like a table yeah table sitting upright yeah how's she getting the air to launch that thing no that's what's confusing about that it was so many things that she was doing like that they have all kinds of tricks thankful question they were pink started out with ping-pong balls you know all the classic things also razor blades no it's not pleasant it's an amazing what people will do if you're confronted with a town filled with drunk tourists who have already seen everything they've seen muy Thai kickboxing fights where sixteen year old kids a fucking shinned each other in the head until they go unconscious they've seen legalized prostitution everywhere ladyboys everywhere everything is chaos just fuckin scooters with 37 people piled on them and what do they got to do they have to adapt what's after its its evolution its adapt or die you know you have to adapt you have to figure out how to how to how to stand out well you got to shoot a dart out of your pussy honey that Josh Zepps is head yeahthere's I mean you want you want to make the the argument that people are malleable that's that's like one of the best arguments like yeah that that's not to mention like I mean I've been to shows there where they're just like I remember the finale to one show where it was like a bear about maybe I mean dude my background my religion I mean this shit that we have done yeah is it just it's like everything that they're saying that every Muslim is doing right now it's like well we've done that in spades it wasn't a couple of extremists it was the leaders of the religion you know Crusades the Inquisition the fucking pedophilia it's dude they were in bed with the Nazis yeah you know when Jews went to find like way to hell at all I would tuck my riding lawnmower or whatever they went up at the fucking Vatican like some of this shit was there now always over those yours sorry yeah they were on both sides they were just like listen I don't know how this is gonna shake out you know a lot of people in Europe will like that they've always done that you know there's there's a dance of course the Germans make you know you got to think they're gonna win it's just too small an island Oh Paula country it was a big country like the United States and they made shit like that'll be pretty one of my favorite quotes from a German general was said one tiger tank was worth four American Sherman tanks but the Americans always had five that's a great quote that's what it was it was fuckin McDonald's we were just cranking a ma like fucking quarter pounders with cheese it is crazy when you think about the fact like Audi Mercedes BMW like BMW used to make jet engines making that technology was in their tanks dude when I was I mean this shit I've been reading is like when American soldiers killed somebody German they dropped the American gun and picked up the German freely yeah like our machine guns I guess overheated or there's a toast you know come on man you like common earring you know how it is a minute that we got the Corvette we got a couple but most of them are kind of Amana Carla yeah we have like old muscle cars what I like is I like the old muscle cars because the way they look and the way they sound but the way they drive compared if you took like a 1980s Porsche or even a seven he's good to look in 1973 Porsche I got 1973 911 they staked handle pretty fucking good oh yeah the pretty goddamn good I mean not like a new car but pretty good the American what the American excuses is we had all this land so he could have straight roads what they had over there dude those were like the original cow paths when they will bring in fucking divisions to town and they just paved over them basically and then all of a sudden you how do we go 200 miles an hour on this that's why you know Formula One has right and left turns best will do is just drive in a circle over here I love it dude I love that the more I travel the funnier we are like we're fucking loud yeah we got a lot of shit but we're not bad they try to make a seem like we're bad but we're not but it's just we just are a product of where we're from and who's kidding human its is it any more fun than just stomp it on the gas two miles an hour to straight line that Bentley 1929 Bentley God way to get to his newer shit look at that mercy hold on back up that Mercedes look at that thing nineteen whoa look at that it's amazing nineteen thirty count count trow see oh that's the sound of the engine yeah oh you click on it you get a salary and this is why their tanks were better than ours look pretty that I shit 1930s is like did you get started in this business you seem like a fairly normal person granted I've only met you for a very short amount of time you seem completely normal it's a really good story I was 17 years old at the time and I was traveling abroad I was actually exchange student in Japan and I was really lonely like I stayed with a host family and I don't know any Japanese and I own this book English and so I was online just all the time like you know I mean this is kind of before MySpace or Facebook or anything like that but I'd go to different like social networking sites and talk to people and one day this guy starts talking to me and he's a total pervert he's like into getting peed on and he really has a thing for like pantyhose and and so he strikes up a conversation with me because he just thinks I'm very attractive and all this and I was kind of like grossed out by him but intrigued at the same time you know and so I was like okay I'm talking to a guy online you can't do anything to me so I kept the you know lines of communication open and we'd talk here and there and and he always tried to convince me to meet him you really want me to pee on him and like I'm not gonna do that I kept turning him down and then one day he's like all right like I get it you're not gonna meet me but I just I think you're pissed should be bottled and sold like I was like alright buy it then like I didn't think he was serious I was like as guy's full of shit but I was like fine buy it and and he did he bought a 12-ounce like well just like this of my urine for $250 and after that you specify the ounces that have to be I don't think so no I think just a bottle just a bob yeah right and yeah from there I was like oh there has to be more guys like this I found me on accident like this was just a mistake like what would happen if I went looking for guys like this like have you promoted it yeah or like kind of sought it out and so I was like okay I've heard of like women selling their use panties before I know that's a thing and so I started searching to see if there was like a website that like I couldn't be on or something that catered to that and and I did I found this auction site that's just like eBay but it specializes in like use panties or socks or pantyhose or anything like a woman can wear can auction on this site and so I was like oh that's yeah this is it and I'm doing this and I just started selling all sorts of stuff [Music]
