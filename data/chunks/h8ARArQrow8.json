the girag an experienced I remember the first time I caught speeding I was 16 and I just didn't have the money so I thought if I broke down in tears the cop and the worst thing is my brother is a cop and he reported it to my brother and then my brother teased me in the near future my brother used to do awful things as a couple of my brother my brother is a name Danny Nugent I think that's a bad to say you should remember the riot squad now and I got I was driving home and at 17 which is still not a legal age to drink in Australia and I'm driving home and I had two beers now I would have been under the limit but still not even allowed to have two beers in me because I'm 17 right I get pulled up I get breathalyzed the guy goes please breathing the tube and I said my brother was a sergeant at that stage and I was like go you know Danny Nugent you know Tony Nugent is uh you know it's right I think you guys know I never heard of him right so he goes up to his vehicle he's there for like 15 minutes I'm just sitting in the car just panicking now he comes back out and he goes step out of the vehicle is there a problem anything over just step out of the vehicle right now as I step out he cuffs me and smacks me under the bonnet of the car right and I start oh Jesus Christ like this right and then I hear my brother laughing on the radio like he's actually gone back to his car radio the station talk to my brother and he says good shit out of him you know I mean because it's cops and the guy I was just joking with you I'm wiping tears away from I was like good joke guys well done thank you Hutton is just doing the same thing but on a more base level just on a smaller level in a way yeah you just doing it I mean you cutting out the middleman and you're cutting out you cutting out the middleman and the animals living completely wild just like a concept behind hunting that certain type of people do it's called fair chase yeah and what that means is that you're not dealing with an offense in environment that you're only hunting in an animal that's truly wild a wild animal that can go wherever it wants so in order to harvest this animal you have to figure out how to get close enough to it you got to stalk it you got a you know you got to understand where the wind's blowing like there's a lot of factors involved and when you take that animal most likely that animal would not have even known you existed until it died like out of nowhere it just dies right and it's the most ethical way but yeah that animal still scares fuck if it sees a person yeah the reason being is people like me that'll shoot it right now see that where's not bad you know just chilling out waiting to and it seen it hasn't just seen its friends be slaughtered and hung up yeah it's not trapped yeah you know it's a wild animal you're going out and getting a wild animal but it's also a wild animal that's most of the time they're aware of people and then they don't want to be anywhere near us yeah the real tripper is when you can go and you can see a wild animal that probably never saw a fucking human being let go up to the Yukon or some shit yeah and then they freak out or they they don't even know what the fuck you are the caribou terrible just look at you like what the fuck is this sometimes antelopes will come towards people cuz I don't know what the fuck they are yeah like what the fuck are you I never seen you before oh yeah Point Blank yeah well not that close you don't get that close but they will look at you but sometimes antelopes have encountered people and sometimes caribou encounter people and once they've encountered people they get way touch here yeah do you have a catch phrase when you hunt when you hit one I need one oh yeah oh yes that it blam blam we eaten him that's awesome you can't spray this that's the perfect one for pig hunting you know what I realized I realized a long time ago that cops and security guards do filler talk and they do filler talk so that you won't talk to them so if if a cop pulls you over and goes license an ID please a license a register please and then just sits there you'll start going hey man what what what I do or I was just keeping up the flow traffic I wrote it but instead they always come up and go sir when I'm gonna need you to do for me right now let's go ahead and get your license and registration out for me okay right now and meanwhile they're doing this kind of patter that doesn't mean anything what I'm gonna need you to do for me right now is to go ahead and get your license but that doesn't mean anything other than license and registration they keep a nice sort of white noise buzz I should call it blue noise it's a noise that cops make that stop you from going what what I hey I was just pulling out of my driveway they don't want to hear that bullshit so they just keep that low-grade talk going because it's only the cops that through the for me right now and a lot of preamble into what I'm gonna have to ask you to do for me right now is to go ahead and get your license and okay right now like do you ever speak that way to anybody I mean if I wanted you to pass me the salt would I would I go Joe what I'm gonna have to go ahead and do is ask you to pass me the salt okay right now or when I just say pass me the salt can't hang out without of any more this is too many words no great yeah I'm convinced they talk so you don't go what why am i turning around what's this mean why I didn't do anything yeah yeah no I totally understand but something that last for six hours what seems like a fuck yeah boners that lasts for six hours yeah all this problem all this problem did you wear a fanny pack or something to like actually just took one last night so I'm on it right now I'm amazed how you can feel comfortable over here no he's breathing so you're saying you went out last night or did you just stay home alone sometimes you just fires well no up just to let everybody know what's up wait I got a massage last night so I just did it before that a massage in quotes air quotes creeper we live in trying times well you know what we need to talk about everything that's the problem can't just talk only about passion people get bored the same goddamn speeches over a number you brought up the boner anyway you're welcome boners all day so explain to me boners do you know when they're coming later like is it like does it keep you like a whisper yeah like we're slinging New Year's know the demon boners on its way holding between the worlds opens up just to Creegan the boner spirits come flying through your fucking nervous system your spirits you feel them yeah and potentially I think that ayahuasca you know we're now discovering that it's good for so many things you know therapeutically for addictions for depression for tea PTSD and that sort of thing and that's all to the good but we shouldn't make the mistake of thinking ayahuasca is only for sick people you know it's it's we're all wounded and we all need to understand something about our relationship to nature potentially the paradigms that are emerging in ayahuasca tourism or these more you know these ayahuasca centered spiritual communities in the States potentially this has the this may transform mental health care in this country it may transform psychiatry and from that it might transform medicine and it might actually transform all these other institutions that we have to deal with whose values have become twisted over 2000 years of bullshit and indoctrination you know and these institutions are not going away and they're fine they just need to rediscover a moral dimension to the consequences of their action if that makes any sense you know our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom and that's a problem that's the problem we've got to become wise and when we couple that with our ingenuity and our cleverness then we'll be on the way toward saving the planet saving ourselves
