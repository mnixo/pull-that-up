[Music] and I always find a way to get my shit together and and dig myself out of situations and like and ultimately rise above that's beautiful as long as you don't count on it right oh now we're I'm sick of getting in my own way and like like UFC 200 let's talk about that I literally what happened I did everything that I could to be back in the position to win that belt bet I was getting ready to just show this triumphant amazing story of someone who just made it through a hit and run situation had almost had everything taken from him and got it all back and then um and then um I'm sorry I'm thinking about so many things at once when I've been so let's just talk about what happened you tested positive for some estrogen inhibitors yeah as Chewbacca yesterday and blockers that a lot of people associate with people who take steroids people take steroids they want to restart their system or if you want a testosterone boost you take clomid or clomiphene and these are these are standard drugs in the steroid users world yeah yeah I'll new for me yeah basically did you take so I took a I took an off-brand cialis bill off-brand it was it wasn't actual cialis but it was described to me as being a cialis and so I thought it was a cialis and I I just took it so why is a guy like you needs y'all's have a huge gun jail it's too big it's too big we don't have the resources to get it normally yeah you know I am your partner no I wasn't even necessarily partying no I've taken like Mel enhancement before and for people who haven't taken it you literally you know you go from being like that to just it puts the twist in the punch like it it's it's a good time you know [Music] that's gonna be a quote that's a good time now what was this like one of those gas station rhino pills yeah those things no I had a teammate basically tell me hey he was talking about how his girlfriend's a pharmacist and he he's capable getting all this stuff and and all that type of stuff and I was like well I don't know I don't do drugs or anything like that and he's like you ever take a cialis it was like yeah usually I got a cialis and I was like well you said you don't do drugs or anything like that but you had done drugs well yeah yeah but no he was talking about all these pain killers and all this different other things on top yeah that he has because his growth is a pharmacist and I was and he was she getting this off-brand stuff from was like I don't know people get a lot of stuff from China I mean that's what happened with Anderson yeah Anderson got liquid cialis from China and it was tainted yeah well look this happens I know for a fact that I mean everyone knows for a fact that happens the the supplement industry has a giant issue with the people that mix the stuff like if you have a vat and you're mixing up whatever creatine is something like that and right before I mean if this is done in some country or some place it doesn't have excellent standards it's not scrupulous you could be scooping up steroids in the batch before that and you just throw the creatine in it and some of it gets contaminated yeah they don't clean it yeah and that's pretty much well I'll get to that but okay so you take this off-brand cialis yeah the guys like you ever do you ever do like see house by a grows and all that stuff and I'm like yeah I've you know I've had no Lee Heitzman pills before and he's like oh yes yeah listen I'm like oh this is great so I ended up taking one of the cialis pills and and I thought everything was fine and dandy I had no clue what happened I was now having something else in me that was illegal I took the see house bill on June the 14th June 16th you saw I came over to my house 6 o'clock in the morning hey what's up guys that coffee going offering everybody Warner bottles super nice hospitable come in I'm laughing and joking with them I had no clue that that test was gonna be the test that derailed my life and you know right before our UFC 200 my manager Malky calls me over to his hotel room he's like hey I want to talk to you man I know what's going on he's like hey you're not gonna be fighting are you talking about it's like you know you didn't tell me you didn't pass your drug test and then the level of hurt and just and confusion and I literally had an anxiety attack and I had never had one of those before what does that feel like I felt like the whole room just came in on me like the whole room came down on me and I was just I couldn't breathe I remember opening up this hotel window looking for a balcony so I could just breathe and realize that I'm like not trapped there's a little the window opened that much I thought what the fuck so you don't jump out Hotel in Vegas were freaking I'm breathing they don't want game they're sleeping through the second I'm breathing through the thing calm myself down and and I instantly started thinking about the weight of I had the weight of the world literally on my back I knew that I knew that I wasn't gonna be fighting a few hours before everyone else knew the public knew and I just I could already start hearing everything even my own cultures been looking at me like just their hearts were on the floor like I had done so much to get back to fighting at UFC 200 like get my life in order getting the people around me in order get him I had my health my mind you know just being in order to beat DC and and like literally right now I've done so much so much right things to be back in a good position and right now you know people look at me as if I still don't have my shit together but the only thing that I did was I took a pill that I thought was gonna give me a boner and literally it's caused me a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and a lot of just threw me back here in any way shape or form when someone gives you this pill and you don't know where it came from you don't know what did you think man I don't know what's in this no I didn't know I didn't think of it because um I have been dealing with the Athletic Commission I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken little gas station dick pills before like you know like and I've never failed the drug test ever did you ever think that you might have got lucky no I didn't think I got lucky I thought that you felt drug test when you're doing sketchy shit right but didn't you think there might be some sketchy shit some Chinese man station Rhino dick pill I my friend Ryan my friend Brian called it he was on the podcast he said John likes to party I bet he took one of them dick pills um no um that's funny you called it yeah yeah well he was he was on I haven't I've taken him several times before and with the Nevada State Athletic Commission I always passed my drug test and and I know that I would never do anything to keep this sport I have a lot of pride in my work ethic and knowing that do not like I've been skinny my whole career whooping people's ass I'm not a knockout artist I went because I'm smart and you know I work hard but with you with the nob Nevada Athletic Commission I never had an issue and then I was suspended when you saw the game so I was never really educated on how serious you shot it really was like I I came back to the game and there's a hole if we got this new company named USADA instead of Nevada what were you suspended for when you saw the king oh they run into the sport I understand we came into your house so when you started came into the sport I was suspended because my head right and so I never had even met anyone who worked for you sada I've never been set down under your side a seminar what to do what not to do and how serious it is and what could happen if you do this and only thing I knew is I had to report where I was at like if I go to LA for the weekend I got a loose I don't know that I'm in LA because we make a drug just me anytime that's the only thing I really knew about you sada I didn't know that doing something that I had done several times before could all spend lose me a fight so um the only difference was I had taken like little gas station pills and I've taken viagra before this was this teammate gave me something that was cialis I thought the only thing that it would do is make me bigger and and stronger for longer that's all I thought was gonna be happening right I and then when I find out that that I just felt the drug test do you know that via viagra is actually illegal in the Olympics I didn't know that yeah you can't take that stuff the viagra is a performance enhancer so it's a vasodilator I believe I believe that's how to describe it and it actually has athletic performance enhancing properties to it how does it how does it help you I don't know we'd have to look into that but I think it's similar to in a lot of ways to nitric oxide supplements like a pretty like a pre-workout yeah yeah it does something to open up your blood cells and get you pumped I mean that's something not just to your dick but to all of your muscle mmm yeah I don't know if I would want to be pumped up one during a fight I don't think it works that way I mean I don't I think it actually can possibly potentially help endurance well yeah I know but I know that athletes take it for that reason that's why it's spam from the Olympics yeah but um but yeah you know I understand that wasn't your intention it was not my intention I had no clue that I needed to report this to your side up because I thought you know literally I was reporting everything goes what supplements what pre-workout what you know my amino acids right my protein powder like you thought I had all my stuff what happens once you find out did you how'd you narrow it down to this pill I literally I went through my supplements and I handed it to I hired a private lab and a lawyer and we started handing and giving them everything that took which isn't really a lot of stuff at all you know stuff that everyone should take fish oil basic basic supplements protein protein powder fish oil you know liver cleanse that like or whatever just just grapeseed extract that kind of stuff yeah just very you know multivitamins for men basic very basic stuff okay and and then and then get nutrition was like you know we we've scanned all of our stuff we know it's not from that got nutrition website though is fucking hilarious welcome to the GAT nutrition website and the moment we found out about that someone said john sponsored by cat nutrition so we go let's check that out got nutrition there's some fucking dude is Jack they have a lot of great great products that you want to get big and strong then you can definitely go to them you know but as soon as we saw that we were like what and the holy fuck is he taking oh no I mean but people saw you you got gigantic completely completely natural that's why I've great pride in being the natural athlete but um but uh so they got they got all the get stuff tested and clear right everything was clear there's gas you have other things that you saw don't regulate absolutely but the things that they gave me they're super smart Bell and out and all the products I was clearing and and so my managers I think outside of the box like did you take anything that could have possibly been I was like I don't think so then I was like well one of my teammates did give me this this big pill and he's like I need those so we got those pills tested and sure enough they and their ingredients they list it about five products and their ingredients and they actually there was actually like seven products - that weren't listed in the ingredients the to estrogen blockers were never in their ingredients so it was a tainted pill it was know what I'm saying yes so um so the you you saw I was able to tell ok this was totally an attention and there's no way no way in hell John would take these estrogen blockers I'm perfect first of all there was very small traces so it wasn't like I was loaded up with estrogen blockers right and why the fuck would they put estrin blockers and it pulled a dick pill we believe that the factory that created these these dick pills were maybe manufacturing these pills in a dirty laboratory or whatever and they're because this contained just tainted yes because each pill that we that we had tested some of them had more estrogen blockers some had almost no estrogen blockers some had small traces that none of the pills were consistent so it was obvious that and we certainly tested several different packages so it was obviously that that these pills were probably getting made in the same machine and there was just traces right literally which is enough to show up in your system yeah literally we found some of these dick pills that had none no estrogen blockers damn yeah exactly so I took one that was just contaminated enough and literally I got tested two days later and it was in my system so it was it was obvious that was a complete accident right and even and even if I would have reported the dick pill to you sada they would have read the label and the label would have never said that it was a nitrogen blocker in there and I still would have had a dirty right we sold an item it's contaminated where does that leave you how much time did they suspend you for I got to spend it for for a year but from starting from back in July so now I fight him to live mm I love you sada I love what they're doing I don't agree with things like that I don't agree with things like that because what you took does not enhance your performance though it does it's especially in such a trace amount I feel like in certain circumstances like there's been several fighters like Chad Mendes he has I believe he has eczema and he was taking an eczema cream that had some sort of was it a hormone precursor or a hormone peptide I believe some sort of hormone peptide I think that enhances the the use of this cream I don't know the full I'm obviously not a doctor or a scientist but I'm there's something about suspending someone for something like that it seems ridiculous yeah well in my situation they they the the even you sought his lawyer he show he showed a little bit of remorse I can feel that he felt bad about what was happening to me because I think he can rewrite even the arbitrator's they could tell what had actually happened right but their problem was they said John was just negligent like you didn't you should have reported this pill but Datsuns it seems to me that's silly I mean that's not even if I were to a reported the pill they would have read the ingredients and they would have never saw that there was a trace of that wasn't advertised so why suspend someone for something like because they say because they said it there was zero tolerance policy it was just like I was the first fighter to ever take them to arbitration and and they were more upset that I didn't let them know that I took the pill then what actually happened there's like the rule is you tell us what you take mm-hmm and we can point you in a different direction but I never told him what I took my whole argument was even if I told you what I took right it still was never on the label yeah so unless you guys were going to spend all the money to take it to a private letter or take it to a laboratory to test this individual pill you know what I'm saying I still don't read into the same situation I think it's great to protect people from people that are cheating I don't think it's great to punish someone for taking something that has a trace amount of something that does them absolutely no benefit whatsoever and clearly it wasn't supposed to be in it and wasn't supposed to be in that pill and clearly wasn't being taken to enhance athletic performances right that seems silly it seems like a mess right it seems like a mess that I mean I I understand there's zero tolerance policy I don't agree with it and this award the Chad Mendes situation you know there's there's weird ones like Yoel Romero he tested positive for something they found out that it was in one of the protein powders or something he was taking it wasn't supposed to be in there wasn't listed that way and they gave him an abbreviated sentence you should have no no no partner whatsoever but I mean my whole thing Joe is I'm so grateful I'm so optimistic man and I'm always looking for light in every situation and I think that's the way I deal with things I just I'm always I always believe there's gonna be good at the end of the day that's just how I am I'm just so grateful what most people would be so upset with themselves and all this type of stuff I'm really not I'm upset about the fans that I let down who flew out to UFC 200 and things like that but as far as the whole situation I'm just glad that that my name would no longer be associated with steroids rather be boner boy or whatever you want to call me you know whatever you want to call me but steroids that that was that would have really that was really bothering me so I'm just glad that it's out what actually happened
