the girag and experience he travels his Roble I won't lie to you I've traveled a great deal what were we talking about right before the podcast started where you have to bring this up on the pile about so I did a podcast today with a guy from crack comm Dan O'Brien wrote a really funny book called how to fight presidents to see who is the baddest ass who's the one guy you wouldn't want to fight and who would win in a fight if they were pitted against each other it's like it's in some ways the greatest book of all time and like I said I go this is this is gonna be the greatest podcast of all time it was a funniest thing because we got into a heavy heated argument about who would win in a fight and you got to put a couple presents up at the top of the list you got to put Abe Lincoln because he was renowned for his physical strength there is fun he fought vampires too right well he did if wait but he isn't a movie you use an axe but Abe Lincoln was 64 and had what that that disease where your arms are longer you have really long arms like longer than your body if crazyland and he was it was known to be really strong and and very very tough hey boys I think you also have to think of people that live during that era there are a lot tougher oh yeah they grew up doing everything with their hands right building things Andrew Jackson was a gentle sigh mean he committed a little something called genocide if you talk to historians they're like well he killed a great deal of Native Americans with extreme prejudice so he that's not I wouldn't that's a strong word what do you think that Steve I don't think disease transmission counts I agree is that what he did he was a soldier and and did I mean he was a he clearly probably killed a lot of men with his bare hands that with him I mean that was Behrens was certainly with a gun or a knife I mean he was a pretty warlike fella yeah and in fact challenge he had a number of duels historians are actually he got shot and lived most of his life with a bullet in his rib cage at shitty guns back then there's a debate how many duels he actually had when you have when there's a debate on how many duels you're fucking president you're a bad motherfucker or you're an idiot right keep getting in tools well he got shot cuz he let the guy take the first shot he goes take the first shot guy shot him then he shot the guy and lived that way for the rest of his life he had he had a gaping wound that would you know cause problems periodically you take the first shot Andrew Jackson of six - he was drunk George Washington six for who was a tough guy George Washington was six for he was people weren't that big dad no he was a giant I'll tell you six for Jesus Christ Washington was as big as this motherfucker so much George Washington could have beat my money on George's wooden teeth it's got a fucking goofy wig on pull that wig off that wig off he's not gonna know what the fuck to do he's gonna search for his wig he kicked him in the dick next thing you know you're pulling out his wooden teeth to beat the shit out of him then there was Lyndon Johnson who's also 64 but Teddy Roosevelt who practiced who boxed wrestled and practiced judo with the guy who brought judo to the United States Lee of the first judo guy and was obsessed with all things wrestling and fighting he was about 510 and very thick but a very sickly kid died of heart disease had a weak heart so I don't know my thing is Gerald Ford played football and could have played for the Bears as a middle linebacker that says a lot when you play in the NFL so I might have to go with we had a huge discussion about this for a good hour I go with Bryan Callen show and it was a good time I got Lincoln so so then he said I said what about Barack Obama and he got quiet there Dan's a comedian really good guy he got quiet and he said well I can't really you know I I'd rather leave that alone I said why I said well I try not to you try not to include any living presidents cuz it caused too much trouble I said what do you mean he said well I went through sort of a thing about how you know Barack Obama's not that tough for president and it'd be easy to kick his ass and you know it was doing it tongue-in-cheek you know you probably kick him here and he's kind of skinny and you could and he gets a call from the Secret Service because he posted it as a blog he posted as a blog I'm from crack calm well he said the reason the only blog that's not up there anymore is that because he got called down to the federal building I believe I think that's what he said it's on my podcast and he had to go line by line with these agents on what he meant by what he was saying and he was like well I said you know I said dick tornado instead of a penis cyclone because it's kind of funnier he was trying to teach them a humor these guys were totally fucking with us he got all nervous he was like apologizing he made they made him take it down and it was a chapter that wasn't money from the book of Lee so that I was like we live in America how I mean now you have to be careful when you've threatened to present you will get cause but guys guys come on come on man I mean and heat I probably can't they probably can't well they said Robin no way to go like yeah they probably knew of course he's joking but there's a thing that there's you set in motion a certain status what happens because they said we will subpoena everybody that made a comment yeah on your on the blog his ass and and and and Dan said well it's a bunch of 14-year olds have fun with that and what the main guy that called him first he goes look I know you're kidding I know you got a sense of humor you gotta go talk these guys it's just the way it is pal [Applause]
