you know what I'll see you later man five four three two one and we're live yes dude what a fucking crazy weekend what the hell watch those three title fights that was like he was really fine cuz we were talking about this and you were like this is probably one of the best cards ever but we have a high likelihood of all decisions yeah yeah boy was I wrong god damn was I wrong I made some good picks but every now and then I just I looked at the matchups I'm like everyone's so close yeah in competition and skill wise like we're gonna get a lot of decisions which I don't mind and then as for watching I'm glad I was wrong as we're watching like holy shit best UFC card ever I don't know what was the most surprising outcome - it's like did you just crack yourself yeah I just hit the antlers alright Jamie a CT he just ran I told you those a bad idea put that thing there all right we're gonna put out like a red light we got an elk antler right over near regime yes didn't like the brim forever and I'm not there right Rachel awareness you used to the space fucked man so that I think may be one of the most impressive things or confusing or unexpected was how fucking good GSP looked The Dude's gone for four years comes back and immediately I see him moving around and popping the jab and I'm like Jesus Christ he looks like GSP he now Holt yeah yeah I see I wasn't I wasn't that and everyone's like oh here's child they hate her no I wasn't that in love with Jesus peace performance you weren't I thought he looked good I thought he looked heavy I didn't think he looked as you know off he put on some pounds he's thick he was thick thick like three musketeers thick I thought he put on some pounds and his cardio wasn't that great and yet he grabbed for days before yeah he definitely was suffering a little bit because of that and also it has to be a big factor four years off just the nerves and all the chest huge factor and a struggle to hold Bisping down Bisping's fucking heart and you know honestly taking him down was one of the worse things could happen he got cut the fuck up it's been done work down there and when I was worried if I went to decision I thought his beings actually winning even though GSP got him down for that portion if the if the hopefully the judges see that Bisbing is doing the damage down oh for sure that should count in their eyes I agree I agree 100% the only time that's ever really counted though in a fight is Kevin Randleman versus bas Rutten remember Kevin Randleman took bas Rutten down but bas Rutten was beating the shit out of him from the bottom and Randleman dude and do anything about a lot of people were super outraged after that decision you know that was a weird one because most of the fight was spent with bas on the bottom and Randleman on top that's old-school life I think I think GSB obviously looked great passed the test I didn't see I always look what's next I didn't think I thought Bisbing was super hesitant because for this reason they trained earlier right they trained in 2008's I guess 2006 so a while ago I guess GSP just kind of mopped the floor with them like kind of discipline so then I think just peace camp and their thinking was alright middleweights really not where we should be at but Bisbing is kind of easy pickings for us we might as well go get the belt from him if we can do this big comeback so I think he thought it was a good matchup and I think because they trained prior that wasn't normal Bisbing Bisbing pushes the pace I think he was so worried about the takedown lifely so I don't think that Bisbing they look great to me either no he looked very super hesitant and stiff and he looked like you father times like yo man tonight tonight I don't think it was a father time thing I think it was in the back of his mind he was very openly admitting that GSP dominated those training sessions they had in 2006 and he was saying look I'm much better than I was back then which I'm sure he is but you can only get so much better it's not so a mental thing yeah I got Dan when he did that and he's impossible to get off so yeah I think he was very reserved but I just I thought again I thought after four years hell yeah George Lee good did George look good enough to beat like a Whitaker or yo Romero probably not not to hate on his but not to hate on what's going on right now because the epic night I just look at the real middleweights yearning Whitaker Yoel Luke Rockhold yeah remember those cardio problems I was like this was a fun one and you're crazy if you think he's gonna fight again 85 that didn't happen I don't think so either I can promise you that's not happening I think he drops right back down once this fight and Woodley neck yeah when I was thinking about him fighting and Woodley's no fucking picnic that's not a good matchup wise that's very tough for GSP you know woodleigh's been dealing with a shoulder injury he hurt his shoulder pretty bad in that fight early in the Thompson fight and so what he does about that is what that that's what that's what's up in the air if he chooses to have surgery I believe he has know if he's talked about it but I think he has a labrum tear so as the question is what he decides to do about that I heard him say about Kobe coming to him we should talk about him he's killing yeah but a good way but he was saying he goes yeah my shoulders messed up but it's good enough where I could whoop Colby's ass knows you're good enough to butch ESB probably not but Whitaker's out too yeah if you if we occurs almost back if they do another intern belt that bad welterweight I'm gonna bust I'm gonna freak out if there's more internal belt I'm gonna freak the fuck out they do they do well if wood let's do surgery and then GSP live in Covington oh my god or GSP burst someone down there GSP or someone would get a lot of press yep they think they got over a million pay-per-view buys Saturday night I hope so yeah I hope so I thought I thought it was gonna do around 700 they might have got a million just from Canada visit Canada was tracking higher than the paper the pay-per-view for Mayweather vs McGregor really yeah Canada come on can it's crazy for GSP burn of them some GSP I mean he won a fleet of the year back in the UFC was like not nearly unpopular it's true he's bleep andhe and pre Conor he won athlete of the year well now I'll see there's the Conor McGregor effect but there's no one you'll see you can go to Canada and sell out the Bell Center you know time trump now you can do that his next fight you can go up there and do this oh my god his next fight now he's the middleweight champion in the world holy shit Jesus Christ you know in his contract and Dana said this but contracts are like pinky swears in the OC they're kind of like I am whatever you know I'm saying I think you know in his contract he has and he said this and it's in his contract yes to defend the middle for the middleweight title but again it I don't think it's gonna happen could you hear if Freddie Roach talked about how 85 is not where he wants to be at when they asked him what's next and also remember it all this adds up it's easy to figure out enough to be fuckin Sherlock Holmes Whittaker was caged side if that fight was next the way you rip your promo is bring Whittaker into the cage they're like nah son you're good you sit there you ain't coming in here we don't need that right now it's definitely open yeah I don't know man Whittaker I'm sure would want that fight hell yeah I want that fight I don't think GSP was ever really considering it no I don't it's just not a possibility I think Julie's next yeah injured here's the real crazy question if Connor defends against Tony and that's a big fight which I heard is a March that's the rumors a lot of things have to happen so little weight which I think he's down to do he was a gorilla when I interviewed him at the weigh-ins and I put my arm on I was like fuck it's too much it was just too much it was like huge yeah it's just he's way bigger like he looked like 200 plus pounds when he got its frame so much bigger than Connor but just the magnitude of that fight they do that a catchweight whoo that's a super fight when we talk about super fights nothing fucking superfine it would have to be at 170 but if they did do it at 170 Connor would have to get through Tony he's gonna have to beat Woodley then you get an end of next year there's a lot left to line up cuz Connors eaten it yeah Tony's what giant hit even if he doesn't it's still super fight right if he loses by devastating knockout it's not a super-fun yeah you know and obviously not gonna see GSP again you know the thing about Woodley is if Woodley wins you're probably going to the hospital unless your name's wonderboy well probably going to sleep yeah and the couches of him well wonder but wonder boy fight at least wants a decision but there was moments in that fight where it looked like Wonder Boy was going out hell yeah I mean Woodley puts people excuse me what he puts people to sleep I mean he hits fucking hard but here's the question like what how much damage has been done to his shoulder and what what needs to be mean it's a labrum tear whatever sort of a tear it is can it be fixed with stem cells can it be fixed with rehab or is it damaged to the point where he's gonna need surgery because if he does he's likely out a year that's what Cain had Cain had labrum surgery turns out for a year it's a rough one - two - right well yeah it's not it's not an easy road back and especially excuse me for someone who has that um wild punching style like Woodley think about how much fucking torque that guy puts in his punches and he might be the heaviest hitter in the history of 170-pound division you watched that fight with Josh Koscheck or watch that fight with Jay here on dude when they I think Johnson was cut into 70 that's exit differ that's different he had no business being down yeah but I hear you especially right now you know he's talking about coming back as a heavyweight I know and which is good cuz that division needs a it does need him but why is he I don't get it yeah I don't get it either okay he said he didn't want to fight anymore like he's done well you know he thought he was dying thought that's the life he wants then when you're there you're like oh this sucks oh wait I feel actually pretty good I think that a heavyweight not cut all that weight I wonder and the division slim but how much weight is really cutting at 205 probably 30 pounds is you think he walks to 35 yeah he's very freaked man so much weight something so much weight he's absolute freak so made a good point it was either you or DC who by the way my MVP up everyone tore it up at my Square Garden DC DC is stealing my heart man as a commentator that was good he's bringing some personality to it he's himself yes he's himself yes like in Brazil yeah a little too excited in the cage but he's great Dillashaw killer shot I can't talk right now so no like I love that when when Rose won and he starts yelling out yes I want that I want that too that's what I want yes everyone doing it take notes be yourself DC's not being fake yeah but he's living in the moment DC is fucking hilarious yeah DC has one of the best personalities ever would hanging around him like outside of commentary outside of the fight people don't know him and it's it's just it's a goddamn shame that people boo him I'd love that they should love him his personality is amazing so when he's himself that himself is great like me and him are always excuse me me and him are always laughing and slapping each other he's awesome Ryan laughing yeah he's the best he grew up in locker room so he's gonna know that chitchat you know I'm saying he knows the vice aisle funny smart he knows a shitload about wrestling to what a what an asset he is whenever there's some sort of a takedown attempt or what someone doing something wrong and he can explain it that's the fun that's the future man and he's good at it and wants to do it yeah he's great he's great but the thug rows one was my favorite he's hilarious he's just being himself but it was either him or you that made the point of you know you really got to give it up to Woodley for what he did to wonder boy when you see what one did a hunter precise the dog with Wonder Boy does to everybody everybody this is the reason why I felt it was unfair to criticize Woodley because if I was in Woodley's corner I would have told him to fight the exact same fight like people have said to me after the comment day like why didn't you say that that fight was boring I go go it wasn't boring it wasn't boring to me while I was happening it might be boring if you knew what happened and you had to watch the four rounds before if you're not like really into tactics or try to figure out what's happening but to me there's just dire consequences to any mistake you make against Woodley and there's dire consequences against wonderful really wonder more I think with Woodley in the wonderboy battle I think they're just bad dance partners but I also think you make one mistake against wonderboy especially you know Woodley being shorter you're in a lot of fucking trouble and he knew that you know to me the fight wasn't great there weren't great that last one wasn't great but there were times when it was good but I think the way Woodley dealt with it and kind of figured it out and you said this on the on the commentary on the broadcast where that might be the only way to beat wonderful yep that's it it's gonna it's not gonna be exciting fights and I can be great and Woodley figured that out now when you go to the Maia fights like I got damn it you know when you go over there then it's another thing but again but the Maia fight though if he did hurt his shoulder early in the fight think about dealing with a guy who's one of the best fucking nightmares ever nightmare ever no and being in a position where you can't use one of your arms right nightmare you almost have to fight the way he fought against mine you don't go to the ground people like oh you're fucking tyron woodley apologist hmm you're tyron woodley lover notice what it is I think it just lined up for him where it's like this is this this is the monster deal and then you get the shoulder he needs a guy like Colby yes I hope he comes in and I say you screech out of his I will go to this Twitter where Colby and it's twisted on Jones see you're fine I told Colby this was saying on my show I was saying you know people say hey man let's not cross the line I want Co but you listen to me right now you find that line you fucking run through it whatever you're doing is working man don't get racist but run through that fucking line well what he's doing it from Brazil on his fucking social media presence has gone through the roof like when people that people think of him has gone through the roof more people were talking about him now than ever before drink number three yeah number three in the world look I'm a title shot well he did beat the shit out of Damien mind he beat the brakes on mine in Brazil war his ass out and it was only a 3 round fight I mean who knows it was a five-round fight he might have got to stop he would stop them there very mom I tell ya this shit out of them yeah and Kobe is he's young he's brash he's fucking tough as shit look at this Jon Jones says to George st. Pierre hey George st. Pierre you've always been one of my biggest inspirations show the world how great you can be tonight praying for you Kobi Covington says shut up loser exclamation point you're the biggest fuck up in the history of sports hashtag you are see 7 to 17 places why is it so hard in the pain a ton Jones he doesn't care man but it's working because I like what Rose says in the Rose I thought was the biggest MVP of the night but I like what Rose says she's like man I'm sick of this fight culture and guys are just going super hard in the paint talking shit and knocking themselves like I'm a good person let's be nice to each other I'm like hell yeah I love that shit Rose and then I open up my Twitter cousin Toby I'm like but then that also make sense I got this angel and you know I'm saying surely like Colby no Rose this is nice you know it all makes sense look it's it's exciting the shit-talking is exciting yeah I like when they make up afterwards that's what I'm happy yeah I'll talk plenty shit they fight and then they make up TJ and Cody really didn't really like I respect you and then Cody's they can't expect them but I everything I said was true fuck that guy well when when TJ got his face right after the stoppage and was like touching his face all screaming at that when you're dealing with a fight of that magnitude and there's that much high emotion and passion there's gonna be a little bit of that yeah but I never said anybody do that before I never saw anybody win by stoppage and then when the guy gets up just fucking out of it TJ's in his face always been ringing at the top as long as with his mouth touching his face like he was kissing him like it's a baby bird and he was like honest tippy-toes like this is a great picture just shredded - an amazing picture but that but again you know with Cody had all that ammunition just the week of like oh I didn't knock you out Jude drops the video and I was like oh fuck I think one of the worst things that happened for Cody is that he got that knock down do you think to do it again are you know what you're saying in practice or in no no no no right in the first round look at that that is insane I mean coach's lip yeah lip-to-lip Cody they're kissing essentially kissing Cody is completely out of it right you just got knocked out cold I wasn't sure if he was out cold but if you watch the stop it she stops moving he got hit it was a good stoppage he came right back god I should stop coughing right I love both those guys man he came right back he got back up like pretty quickly but I think that's conditioning and just realizing that he you know he came to he's a monster look at TJ look how it is how the fuck is he gonna cut ten more pounds to go down to fight Mighty Mouse mmm do they do that catch weight to the belts really matter they're gonna do it at 2:125 general went to it when I talked to TJ he swears he can make he goes all day easily you might be able to whoever - hey Mighty Mouse who else you gonna fight well if he gets a Mike Dolce behind him or George Lockhart or one of those weak cut TJ he has someone he does he's a monster that's why it looks like that right now here's some new guy moved to California for if you get a guy who's a weight cutting expert I bet he could probably do it oh ho do it for sure he wanted to do it originally he was already making the cut when he thought it was gonna happen he's like he goes it's no problem he's very disappointed in that fight and I see his point but I also see mighty Mouse's point Mighty Mouse his point is look what if TJ doesn't make the cut and then I lose the fight look what if he doesn't make the weight and then I lose the fight to him he's like that's a big deal and I don't yeah and I don't set the record yeah I wanted to set the record the record was giant to him he want to set the record in his weight class so he said look I have one requirement let TJ win a fight at 125 let him fight at 125 let him win and then I'll have him come over we're gonna jacked that's after you won that's real - man I mean that's some raw shit that's some raw emotion we're there how much there was someone they're gonna fight three more times there's so much shit talking go on and it was so personal for these yeah boy it looked bad when he got clipped you got clipped at the end of the first round and it looks like wow really bad he has a piston for a right hand unbelievable speed but then he came back real quick like at the beginning of the second round he looked fine he looked amazing he looked fine like didn't look anything is wrong with him he started throwing a lot more kicks and did you see what uh TJ said because they're like oh you're gonna give Cody and me that rematch he goes hell no look at the fire act to walk through to get back here because it doesn't work like that's true he was does not work like that to fight what three guy had to wait over a year fight three monsters yeah in occur yeah by the way he fucking neutralized linacre - that was one of the more in my opinion one of the more fascinating fights because I don't think there's another guy in the division that woulda neutralized Linacre in that way and not gotten hit okay you mean maybe Dominic maybe Dominic but the thing about TJ versus Dominic is TJ's more kick oriented TJ can he's not the Dominic doesn't have kicks but I think TJ has more flexibilities more loose in the outside ki TJ wins my head kick Yeah right he had kicks guys he will he will do all of the above you know he doesn't have in any way a limited arsenal and I don't know what they're gonna do next but you know Dominick Chris Jimmie Rivera is a tough fight for Dom to me I don't know what Jimmy Rivera is a fucking nightmare he's it for people hey he's undefeated he kind of mop the floor with you I favor like he's no joke man's fine under the radar but yeah he is and his head is twice as big as either one of the tank at that weight class and his his low kick that low kick that everyone is doing that below the calf kick or the calf kick goddamn that is a debilitating kid that dude's my Dark Horse no one's really talking on my god he's a guy yeah you know when I was in the martial arts in New York in like that area Tiger Schulman had like a whole chain of karate schools and I'm sure they did competitions and stuff I'm pretty sure but no one ever would have thought they would become like a powerhouse for MMA but they've had quite a few like really talented fighters there well they had that kid with the green hair the fox's name bantamweight gentleman oh I didn't even fucking talking about God you stopped he stopped fighting just dipped out right now they come out they have that kid it's gonna be a lot of they have that this I can't remember this either start a bunch of this but oh yeah we're at one of his other guys had this crazy choke that uh we had to like go over in the gym and try to figure out yes yes garden Oh yep sorry loose no he was one of my favs Oh top dude he's a tiger showman guy pretty sure and then there's been a few other guys too the only one who's gonna get a rematch on the card is Johanna she deserves it after after defendant I'll that many times he get murked in that first round hmm I think she's that that qualifies first immediate rematch well I think that's where the big money is for sure I mean people gonna want to see that that's a big fight mmm cuz when when you want to walked out dude the pop from the audience was immense she's finally become like this star that they've been putting all this promotion to her she's winning fights yeah she was kind of thriving in it a little most a little too much which is one of loss yeah yeah a little bit of the ronda syndrome there a little bit what's that but you know she was definitely doing a lot of press and fucking tremendous amount of pressure but I'll tell you what dude when she was talking to the camera she was talking to Rose and she's like the boogey woman coming for you who you Bluemont coming for you I kept fucking my problem of all time I was like boogey woman what I see her looking at Rose in her eyes like staring at that Sophie and she's talking on Kaza crazy shit I'm going to fuck you up I'm going to hurt you and Rose is saying the Lord's Prayer with some demonic shit I was like why I asked Rose everybody saying she's like I was saying the Lord's Prayer and she'd even look at you anybody look okay I was like all right I'm like wow this is for woody yes I mean it'd be easy to say in retrospect I knew then something special was going to happen hell no I thought Rose expose me see a psychiatrist that's when I saw that way and I'm like we need to get Roosevelt ASAP but I'm like you know what we need some professional help but after the fact knowing the result that Rose won by knockout it makes it even all the more profound now you're gonna see motherfuckers just reciting the prayers no want to talk about I hope the UFC realizes and I think they do that's a fucking star that's real star hell yeah will mean a real story has delusions of 105 years old she's got the look she shaves her head she's a beautiful thing look as so so when she's 12 she's not--she's it yeah and she's like a genuinely good person like when she was talking after the fudge slate she's chomping just be nice to each other here's the thing Joe that's real mning from that the fans gravitate towards that nice person oh you need to the wind you look like her and you weigh 115 pounds your woman you fuck up the boogie woman yeah Cooper you wouldn't maybe if she doesn't become as big as stars any other woman in MMA I would be stunned damn I like that position because she's a good person and she's worked hard Miesha Tate got some star out of it Ronda clearly got the biggest right for sure Ronda got the biggest by far she was the biggest like it was tiring her opponents everything it was her insane domination or sure opponents just weren't on our level yeah until they were right so until she fought Holly they weren't really on our level and she also had this new thing which was the female ass-kicker this thing that didn't exist before so in that way like one of the most unique athletes ever for sure besides my Ally and who's the Coal Miner's Daughter Christy Martin member Chris team our tonneau Tyson fights oh yeah fight on the undercard yeah the Coal Miner's Daughter members I'm sure but they're pioneers what's different yeah yeah not that much like Laila Ali got a few people paying attention you'd better build a box for Desmond only for god sakes fuck that man it's a shoo-in yeah man but being George Lucas's daughter like you're gonna be you know in Star Wars for fucks yeah but it just never it never hit the levels that it hit with Ronda no right but I think that it's possible that Rose could be the biggest star in MMA today I really think so I don't think anyone's ever gonna be a Ronda because that was a the first one it was crazy yeah I agree but Rose could be gigantic I mean I really think she I mean who knows if she could be as big as Ronda but she could be gigantic I really think so yeah I like that she's true to herself dude she does wild shit she's laying arm bars I mean she does wild shit that fucking karate hottie fight which she had kicked her and then choked her out dude she's a little savage she kiss on your back oh you think that that division is kind of stacked though like you wanna want to a lot of people but for Rose there's a lot of tough competition is very tough competition it's tough competition standing up to there's a lot of good strikers in that division best-case scenario though especially for the u.s. en Rose cuz I'm you know Rose my favorite fighter in that division come from Denver but you know that that division for her to defend and build a star like the head in Yoanna that's when you get a star but if that belts circulating its we can't the public doesn't gravitate towards that we don't like that and you know she's likely gonna have to fight Karolina who went five hard rounds with you on a-- and three rounds with her it was a three or five rounds with her which you wanted a decision three right I think it was three it was Jessica and ROG Cheska drives Amar's laughs I was security closeted Dasia would Jessica and Ron's beat the shit out of Claudia day yeah she'd beat the break that shit out of her the manhandling no no no offense bull manhandling she will manhandled but she she strong strong arms she's smart she's smash he hulk smashed she'd straight-up Hulk smash she straight up straight up she says Christ man I've seen ass weapons like that since cyber got ahold of some bitch didn't we watch that one live did we do a fight companion for that did we I don't think we did cuz I'm gonna change cloudy a fan I think she's so hot yeah she's very pretty right yeah and she's taking a break though well you know what man the body only has so many wars in it when I was a lot of people were talking about with the Alanna they're thinking about you wanna like think about your monocle in fact though but before the fact before the fact there was some discussion we were talking about look I didn't think that Rose was gonna do that did I bet on it yeah I did well she's such a big underdog four to one shit shoes plus I think I get it plus 500 I posted it whatever it was $5 on her one for you how much time but that's nice yeah just because Rose she has that x-factor where she just explode for a while for a female fighter yes she's wild when it's hard to train for and you know at the beginning of the fight you know you wanna she had done nothing - you wanna all you don't wanna get in her face she put her fist out touch her fist with her face you know you wanna was really trying to get in her head and the whole time roads going off fatherhood and having some scary shit it was scary shit but when the actual face down came face down when they're standing in front of each other and they were about to fight you want us talking all the crazy shit and she got close to her rose pushed her away just like a bitch get the fuck out that's and that's when he that's when he got there and she did work what the fuck you want to land it upon she liked my hits she like Rose open strong with a leg kick and I was like oh Jesus and then she threw that leapin hook get goon ever Whitman is a bad motherfucker well when you have Trevor Whitman yeah that's what he's a mastermind phenomenal strike be a focus on one fighter he's a master yes just engaging his rows Marwan Nate Marquardt dude come on just piece the flight endeavour just work on his jab just cagey training now with think about think about this fight that he's got with Eddie Alvarez training now for Eddie Alvarez gage he is what is this fucking record it's something insane Nick 20 and or something like that g88 you know I was supposed to him he's gotten insane record he'd been mopping the floor with those see left sea level fighters yeah serious but still is fun still the michael johnson 18 another 18 you know look at that one submission to decisions 15 knockouts but but damn I know Trevor Troy when when gates fight sometimes technique goes out the window he goes oh fuck dude he's which is why people love them he's wild as shit that Michael Johnson fight showed that Michael John's didn't hurt him you know tagged him hard and he came back and smashed up that Eddie Alvarez fight it's a graphite fuck yeah it's a great fight because people forget but just engage he his background is wrestling yeah he was amazing rest of you ever seen Northern Colorado freak Athletic freak vision is awful - he squints is that fastest all-time mic problem fuck let me get that fixed I don't think you can get LASIK and fight the Commission they don't they don't let you do LASIK but you could do the other con PR no no PD almost AI almost a PDK like bullshit different kinds like the other kind somebody uses scalpel yeah the one that they use a scalpel apparently they can do that's the Russian shit that's what I had done I think did you yeah what was wrong division I had to have contacts and glasses I've seen guys fight with those and they lose a contact and they drop it and then they got to keep fighting and now you're like one kid he's tight with soft contacts in your eyeballs that it's crazy yeah I got LASIK after I was playing lacrosse game and I was zoning out and I was in Denver and it's cold and my contact froze and like you're and I was like now like oh fuck and then someone hit me and it shattered in my eye oh Jesus Christ to you the hard contact yeah hard one oh my god what you get hit with a ball or a stick I think some dude just let me up or so my fucking cock Tex fucking shredded and I was like I need to I'm playing you know sports here man I can't have fucking contact I used to always freaked me out about classes like if someone got punched with glasses on the glass went into their eyes I mean well they you stab those thick-ass realistic anti-catholic ones my poor brother used to wear those leaves curve or some shit even those though what if those things break they're so fucking thick like it they're what like the presidents windows are mean you can make him oh you can make it look out of a like a plexiglass is like a thick thick glass so really camber yes super nerdy no chance when he wear that thing well it's funny to me when basketball players getting like a broken nose or something like that and then forever they have this fucking mask off too much right yeah too much too much because what we see they work for the next few weeks - well it's what's craziest like this dude oh come on carbon-fiber - I love it LeBron James have one of those yeah a lot of people have had it but did with LeBron wear because of an injury yeah everywhere just to be a beast no you can't wear that shit dude let me see that give me a close-up on that carbon fiber yeah I love it it does not want to wear one right now the nose is such a terrible design you know you had your nose fixed after the cro cop fight oh god but I just see so many people get there no smashed like the they had a close-up of cowboys Oh Kobe had one too oh yeah almost everyone's had one cuz they all hurt their nose like Zorro that is pretty badass it does look pretty badass but seriously I want one too no bitch-ass shit if you think about all the stuff that fighters go yeah come on cody's was rough I mean uh Cowboys Cowboys is rough Darin tail caught him with that elbow that fucking snapping down elbow I know we did the fight companion for that yeah I know I told you dude Vinnie Sherman would not stop raving about Darren till he would not stop raving before the fight and Sherman knows his shit he was like mate you've never seen anything like it the kid's gonna be a champion most people from Liverpool you don't now fight lined up but I'm surprised he wants to fight Wonder Boy I've watched the shit up watch the shit about mine till verge Colby let these Young Lions kill each other I'm saying like why not yeah but if you're a fan of high level striking you tell me wonder boy versus Dan tail wouldn't be insane I'd watch it all goddamn wonder boy though Mike come take it fucking monster what is he seven no man I just beat Maz of a doll he's huge he's enormous Darrin deals up big no ain't no one trying to fight him big don't we get wants to finally what thinking uh nice Mike Perry Mike Perry - fighting buddy was a huge fight coming up he's fighting pawns in hope yo you got a concentrate on pausing over you definitely gotta concentrate how about your boy Johnny Hendrix was like I figure it out I'm going on to Jason's let me try this out Jake you need the answers son yeah he fought the fuckin eraser dude that guy's scary even he hosts you solder scary up hold up eraser listen to me right now that going snitch is good I don't know what although did all these years we figure it out figure it out I look at his body I thought what the fuck dude he's so Jack he's jacked and shaped goodlet might be the best-looking dude in the UFC yes we could do it on the plane right I don't want to come off as gay with his shirt off in particular you know that's a good picture he's too aggressive there was they were doing the post-fight showdown like I bet he slangs all the ring card girls if he wanted to as he was talking like this dude it's just slinging dick out look at right there dude when he was standing next to just shooters in the way and I was like no Johnny I'm not a middle way this is this is a middleweight this is a big middle man he's so look how much bigger he is in Johnny I mean and shush ready and the fight was basically an assault it was an assault you would never believe that Johnny Hendrix was a former world champion have you saw the way the eraser beat the shit out of him I mean he just beat the shit out of him Johnny fire back I mean he's tough he tried through some leg kicks threw some punches but he was just getting fucking destroyed and just walked down and smashed kick to the body over and over again he was wincing after the first kick I know man second kick to the body he got hit with you see him wincing and here was when he clipped Johnny Hendrix I mean it was no contest unfortunately for Johnny and out of the light if you if you weren't a faint just like them and like oh yeah I got out of the crowd to fight this dimepiece like look at that right oh this guy who likes to drink beers fighting this diet peace brazilian well might be the best-looking Brazilian of all time by the way johnny is just not the same guy he's just not the same guy and you can speculate all day there's no that's why you aren't saying like you like I think sometimes people hate on guys for what they've done lately but for Johnny Hendrix man you've had a great career brother just hard a weight class above I agreed B I agree because he doesn't want to watch his diet I think it's a number of things but you know III just man there's nothing hang your head on you know you're a world champion man yeah so you know a lot of people think you beat GSP like you've had a great fuckin good argument yeah really you could really have a real I mean if you were just objective you didn't have a dog in the fight you could have a real interesting conversation about who won that flusche an argument there sure and I and I think if you're Johnny you know and he's probably taking a lot of abuse online and I wish he would stop but it's all good man you got a good go I hope he doesn't take abuse really what we should do we should be praising heaps on Paulo Costa because that guy's scary he's fucking terrifying that guy's the future he's he's legit as fuck well who knows and I would like to see someone test him I'd like to see him against like a real strong 185 pound wrestler I think he's four no no see and I'll knock out their 300 not gonna last - he murk dude so what we got to see is he's for real and he's the future how's he not mature GQ or some shit I'm telling you man fuck it when I watch I was like fuck well that could be the one thing those fucking Weinstein next to him you fucking do and maybe that could be what doesn't man just Oh jump pussy when you're that good-looking sprite it's gotta be hard it's gonna be hard to say now super hard and as he gets more and more famous you know it's gonna be famous for sure for sure for sure keep smashing people that way looking that way smashing people that way that's trial bull son if he's not famous he should sue the UFC video game for God's a useless fucks it's just Johnny looked two weight classes lighter than him Johnny looked like he was a welterweight and the eraser looked like he was a light heav Johnny's just lost man and like going to Jackson's and I'm not knocking Jackson Jackson when the guys cancel all time still is but when fighters go there because they've seen out how much success they've had it's literally heavens waiting room it's it's the fucking you know it's the Florida a fighting camp sir yeah I get that but if you're going that's probably not the answer well it's also you got to think of the years that he wasn't there and those play a factor in its development it's not like you just get right back to where you should have been like oh here's the answer no you were training wrong for all these years and his performance dwindled pretty substantially except for the one fight with Hector Lombard that's which is really interesting that was like the one fight where he actually looked pretty good yeah he did and he beat Lombard you know that's right still fucking dangerous yeah and I was like Johny Hendricks loose leg he's back and that wasn't that long ago he'll know it's last year but there's another guy who shouldn't be at 185 pounds so we fought a guy who's like him a thick dude who's really a 170 that doesn't have the best diet in the world you know I don't care what anybody says you know that you shouldn't be criticizing him you shouldn't you know you don't walk a mile in his shoes and you know maybe his body doesn't wanna respond at cutting down to 1 7 anymore stop just be honest and I'm a Johnny Hendrix fan look at his body you should not be fighting the best professional fighters in the world unless you're a heavyweight and you have a body like that with all that extra body fat that does you no good it's not aiding your performance in any way shape or form it is 100% a sign of a lack of either planning we didn't plan your diet out in advance where you're too heavy or too body fat coming into camp or poor discipline or poor organization of your diet where you don't understand like what food you shouldn't shouldn't be eating when the guys training for a three-round fucking fight at the top of the heap in the UFC's middleweight division you got to think this guy's got to be doing some goddamn rigorous shit the American public if their watch that's going if this fucking guy can't look good how am I gonna look good and I'm kind of exaggerating he's Johnny didn't look terrible but like I think it was worse because he looked great Costa like maybe we're a statue we don't have to look like a bodybuilder we some of the toughest guys like Evan Dunham he doesn't have a bodybuilders physique but he's not he doesn't have any extra weight on him the extra weight is not doing you any good no wonder boys not wearing uni yeah events you know in bodybuilding in the house but he doesn't have a fucking extra mound on him you know northers Woodley woodleigh's fucking shredded he's got the best body in the division Woodley could wind Olympia he could win mr. at least top five just generally just got into it a hundred he's got phenomenal genetics but anyway he's not you can't be competing at the highest levels of the sport giving up that much of an event like if that was a good agreement that you had like alright we could fight a 185 but you have to be 20% body fat and I could be 10 like what especially this day and age like mixed martial arts at such a high level like I was just going over the welterweights the other day I'm like holy shit there is so much talent like the UFC in the welterweight division such a good hand there's so much young killing talent yeah if you're not taking every advantage of the the techniques and your training you're left in the dust and Johnny is from that old-school kind of training you know I'm saying like he's an older cat man well what he was talking about when I was talking about training in Texas that he couldn't spar hard with people or they wouldn't come back that he had to like take it light on them and then what he really loved about going to Jack's is he was dealing with real high-level fighters all the time so he's getting great training in which I thought was great to hear but it's not great that he spent so much time doing it the other way hell no turn down seventeen you lose your you lose your focus you lose the drive and you just start going through the motions if you're not being challenged all the time and he was obviously being challenged in competition but he have been with a real camp a long time ago oh great what happened with him he had some he was with team take down the green ma'am so he was a team take down he came from Oklahoma State right national champion whatever 70 time all-american just a monster and then the deal was is they're gonna support him financially with you know house food training camp they take care of all that and give you like a salary salary but once you make it we're taking 50% of everything and when you're young up-and-coming hungry fighter like that's a great deal until you become Johny Hendricks and become the world champion like hold up 50% I appreciate what you guys different but god damn man like you robbed me blind here this is crazy hmm so he had to go separate ways here's the question they open a big great steakhouse did date that was a terrible idea I would eat there look did I would eat there just for the story i DM Instagram that should be doing a selfie yeah but I'll hate on if it was a good have you ever yelp review if you never have you that's why we're friends have you ever have your Leslie comment on you - nope nope that's why we're friends have you ever hated on a guy on Instagram I don't think so now I mean either no no no it's wasted time yeah my friends don't do that I don't like you're gonna do there's only so much time in this world you should you choose to use it wisely I was doing the MLS show some guy asked me a question stood I'm just hey man have you read the youtube comment I went stopped there I've never read a youtube comment in my life my man so there's no court he goes really never went not once I'm too busy creating material for you guys I'm not reading comments man alright no doubt he's trying to write trying to tell you something me wrote some she's really mean probably pretty trolling probably maybe he felt that he was funny with it hopefully not you know like we're not hating on a guy like Johnny I love Johnny like I said this there's no reason it is reality right yeah I exist not like look what it's not like we're saying this and he looks like you know like Paulo Costa yes sometimes I think people confuse hate and and being a critical of a performance of reality yeah but but also like when when they you're hating on the the UFC sometimes we talk about pay-per-view numbers or the last papers I'm like listen I have nothing to do with the way they promote the fighters all that stuff if the numbers are low I'd literally have nothing to do with that right I just give my thoughts on what is going on the landscape of the UFC hey pull up that's actually eating pull up a picture of Johnny Hendrix with a beer in his hand with his shirt off he's got a picture where his gut is enormous it seems to be about 20-25 yeah between fights to get up to 25 that you can't do you just can't do that and he could do that because he was the champ you know at the times a while ago a long time ago this day an agent that the games of all things so fucking fast as a welterweight man you better have your shit together you better have your shit together I was Leone division I'm scared for people yeah he mo fighters better be training right now yeah it's it's a serious shark tank and it's a good combination of upcoming new guys and battle yeah there's an awesome just combination of everybody in there there's one but there's a better one where you see him from the side yeah above it right above it with the hat on this one what that's whatever go to the one with the red shirt oh that's incredible I don't give a fuck what wait if there's no cinnamon that way to in a way to minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute is that real that's that's real how can that be real there's no way he ever got that bag is there come on he likes to be bro what yet bicep surgeon has said fuck it what year was this though last week 2014 oh he had bicep surgery three years ago dude that'll that'll take you back a year and yeah right by itself that probably I was armed oh okay let the thing either I know you see it thick cuz like what did he eat Rock thing just into his arm is under stomach you know yeah again I love Johnny we're not hating on Johnny no you just there's just no room for anything other than excellence at 170 now or even 185 now but this but also for Taylor for the sport and where it's evolved that you know you're in the NFL you can't get away with that and then being can't get away with that the yes he's getting there at a high level and you better have all your bases covered you're getting lit the fuck up yes what should these certain weight classes dude how about OSP takes find out 11 days notice I was like yeah I'll do it hey you crazy head kicked and he landed a head kick earlier in the fight same kick and we were talking about it too were like look out for his left kick he's got a brutal left kick and then boom right on the button walk away home yeah I mean it was crazy it was so powerful look at that God Doug just walked away out cold just alcohol he's silently on this a little bit of a rampage at 2:05 - mm-hmm you know he has three von flu cokes yes which is crazy because he's not a jujitsu guy there's always a traitor so yeah five on food chokes ever he's got three of them we got baseball bat against the head so dude and right on the jaw - great win yeah it was a good fight up until then you know Corey it's just the head turn wrong turn Corey's doing well especially with his wrestling yeah but then OSB just so explosive man Jamie just wants to keep throwing showing it today yeah pour it worth growing man poor Corey yeah it's a rough way to go out yeah it's the whole card was insane right that main card for me as far as the surprises three three titles on the line just the best UFC of all time and GSP going like when he clipped him with that left hand going to the ground ground pound then going to the rear naked choke and then plenum ah bleep I gotta be honest I'm surprised Bisbing it retire with you after the fight yeah he's like we're still gonna go I'm like what are you gonna do he's gonna fight somebody else whoo yo Romero don't uh down da eul's just waiting back there Bisping beats Yoel Romero they will light England on fire yeah I mean think about it I mean Michael got choked unconscious he got dropped with a good left hand but he didn't get knocked out he also won around yeah he wasn't second round but what I'm saying is he didn't take the kind of damage where he has to be out for a year you no no hell no he'll uh no he you know he could fight Marsh for sure fucker so if they're gonna do one in London Yoel Romero I think there's a March that be sick Yoel Romero was everywhere with Jorge Moscow doll when there was he really they were running into each other and there was a video of Maz Vidal going at it with Michael business I saw that and everybody gets separated but you know Romero's right there in the mix Michael B's being chewed they have to make that happen [Laughter] I'd say what if your biz being I I love biz being there's easy stuff as they come I don't want to be alone with those two motherfuckers hell no suppose you have to burning a flag or whatever ego what did he do didn't he bring the flag did you burn a Brazilian crypt at number two before I ripped it somebody threw it at him stomped it oh that's right yeah yeah definitely don't do that how badass is fuckin Robert Whittaker that he went five rounds with that dude and won a decision I know and he did it with a fucked-up knee he got his knee jab early on to fight scary no one's trying to fight Whitaker him versus GSP is Yanks not even happening you don't need to be scared that happens Jacare like oh he's so fast he's just B's like I'm good on that bro I'm telling you all former Walter Wade it's not happening son Whitakers a beast man he's so fast and explosive and he's young as fuck I think Roberts only 26 or 27 yeah if you guessed take yes I say 27 26 that's young as five super 20th you name in this prime yet dude this is why East if you got a gun to my head right now get what's next what's next I'd say Whitaker Rockhold that's what you're getting and then you get GSP Woodley I love that Dana White George st. Pierre staying 185 pounds face of Robert Whittaker next holy shit leave my face you don't believe it I don't think you know shit how about that dad would have called Dana White right now believe it when I see it that's all I said I just said he said a lot of shit yeah like that like it's the UFC's best year ever maybe you know some shit we don't know yeah well that's crazy talk but I don't have to be the UFC accountant to just run through some numbers in my old brain brain here that might have some brain trauma go I don't think so do some awesome things that happened some awesome fights for sure there's one awesome fight yeah but I'm saying there's been well if you would just want to look at the business overall yes know it for pay-per-view sales yes but for people like you and I that are just fans that's winning it's been one of the best years ever God really yeah my mighty mouth beating the title and then doing it the way he did slam it up school getting a flying armbar it was cool establishing dominance like that Amanda Nunez Merck and Ronda Rousey with that wish you well know that's last year that's last December believe it was in January this year bro no it was last year am I going crazy I'm pretty sure was last December you might be this year they haven't had Conor Ronda Brock they haven't had their heavyweights it's December 29th bang club very very cool yeah I guess that's not this year so yeah you know I'm saying like it it's been a down year as far as bring some fun matchups if your balls deep into MMA like we are but as far as just like a great year no now there was some some of those pay-per-views I was a goddamn or the fight nights like come on man I think it's just a transitional period and again I start to UFC's fault is with the talent to it just wasn't timing up right but then you get certain cards like this were they hitting out the fucking Park yeah this one was so epic was toady and Dominic cruise this year or last year Cody Dominick Cruz was this year yeah so there's that Kody Dominick Cruz is a big fight yes Koreans what about 55 now it's all stalled out because with habib on the sidelines Tony Ferguson being the in terment interim champ he had to wait forever I mean do we even know if Kobe was gonna fight against fight marbles at December 30th that is definitely how that's happening they said no mortar masseuse or you're fine December 30th yeah Daniel Cormier said he has a real nutritionist now oh do you you ranked number one in the world did you get nutrition seeded on defusing everybody smashing and you almost died from making weight and someone's like man you know what we should do twice almost died twice you keep missing weight bro now you could be the best in the world we should hire a nutritionist it's not a bad idea around you to be before listening he's a devout Muslim so like anytime it's anywhere near Ramadan can't fight it well some guys pulled it out below Mohammed did they do did it by organizing his camp he organized all of his training so all of his training was done after dark is that fast all during the day right you can yes whose sundown yeah I think I don't know even though if you're a lot of during water no I don't think so yeah but you just go crazy once the Sun Goes Down from sunrise to sunset you don't know yeah so I think what he did was just alters training and like at night I guess it could be how bad you want it well it's just such a crazy rule like is if God was around when you really decide like when I guess the idea is that you're by recognizing that you're doing something difficult that you don't want to do you're like in this religious tradition you're honoring him yeah I don't think the gun gives a fuck about your intermountain UFC you might but either way could be beatriz shit together so you know what you fight yes you broke my heart when he pulled out with Tony Ferguson fight that broke my heart just so mad the day of the weigh-ins I was so mad there's no way I know I'm never for the weigh-ins was it the day of a day before very close within a day or two very close what everything is day of it was so frustrating he can't say anything now he's got to just be completely quiet in Jesse Owens yeah and Barlow's does it you know it's it's not that it's a tough fight from just Barbosa as the nasty stand up in the game such a division but yeah it's a winnable fight for Kebede gets a hold of you going for a ride yeah if he gets a hold you he can wrestle fuck you look no announce khabib Tony that's the fight oh but yeah I'm not so you got Tony Conor I think happens in March but when he was holding Michael Johnson down helpless and just beating the shit out of him that what he was helpless like when have you ever seen anybody be able to do that you can do them in ghosts just give up I need this I need this job just stop now I don't want to do this one without it just beating the shit out of him I mean complete total control of them how you speak my shit oh shit what's crazy about it is like there's at that level it's very rare that that can happen at that level where someone is so much better that the other person just completely tied up there you go there are hard to look at that card man the Eagle well they love a mean of Carlos Condit returning against Neil Magny come on kids oh shit magnet get the hair throwing magnet just to the the killers well I probably say to be determined for the main event cuz they're banking on Conor well who knows no I'm gonna Cruz versus Rivera's interesting hell yeah the little versus carlos paz i was very interested vo your next star in the women's division you're going over last you got fucking Roundtree Versace gokon that's the UFC's tweet pissed me off with that lion sakis a fucking monster he's a monster no then after that put stand dot and dot bang was like running this what 14 year old from Redditt running this thing you know I read that whoa fuck man do better and how about Camaro Koosman versus meek whose monthly guy everyone's scared so awesome on one to fight to lose months another one at 170 that's terrifying yes we could be a world champ an IG Rhian nightmare he's a nightmare Christian Okoye fucking dude Emil meek is a beast it looks like he just scary fuck - man it's all very interesting no less if I do spawn they tried offer fights and meek was the only guy addicted I'll fight him let's meet that house nigga straight fucking Viking what's going on this full-on Viking gene say what what that body's challenging her boy the Brazilian time he smashed toki neo he fought who semana para horace and just knocked him unconscious that's right that's how he got into the UFC he's a beast man that's a real good fight but I just don't know you know I don't know if meal meek is gonna be fast enough to keep you smile oh no one wants fighters one no he's a nice line he's the scariest number 12 ranked guy in the world how about loose Mon versus dere until Jesus use Mon Colby Colby tails what I'd like I'd like loose mom versus anybody I would like to see Oh spawn fight for the title I like to see him hurt anybody I really like now yep I think he's the most underrated guy in in maybe in every division that's what I think that might be fair I don't know if I'd want to see him fight for the title right who's his last fight click on that they're just destroying dudes yeah destroying dudes was his last fight sir Jamar is oh yeah Sergio Mars did you Jitsu guy yeah he'd put the smash on him Morais is a badass jiu-jitsu player he's the first guy that tapped Krone when chrome got his black belt he also fucking gave Neil Magny that horrible triangle in Brazil that's right I mean just who do not go together especially that guys Jiu Jitsu when he fought in the finals when Sergio fought in the finals of the Ultimate Fighter it was in Brazil he he goes my opponent has just as much of a chance of getting me pregnant as he does submitting me Jesus Christ it's a great line he's fighting Caesar for her she's a monster yeah yeah yeah nice fight yeah Bryden was a take a jacking off the boys a take a and guys I know Luke Rockhold you know facial for the most part Lucas in DC - yeah Lutz there and uh Kalin was saying um train of thought thing about Kalin Jack and did how many guys he jacked off at aka no oh he saw Nate Nate straining a K now Marquardt is yes oh sure yeah he's doing a lot of his camp there that's interesting I'm often fighting since use that's crazy yeah right think about how many wars archives been in remember his fight with Woodley and Strikeforce we knocked him out with a Mortal Kombat combination a Bab left-right CV find Nate Marquardt Kos tyron woodley they became world champion yeah people forget his multiplying pancreas champion but that was like its first real not that Pincus wasn't real but that's his first huge belt in Strikeforce yeah super talented super young with old elbow home I mean come on man you know what's crazy about that that camp is working this weird like Taekwondo gang they're just doing elbows and we'd make fun of them he'd be in the corner just doing like these weird fucking motions like okay Nate good luck with that that's what he is well dude elbows I mean you gotta think how about Bisbee on the ground on the bottom of those elbows to just be lit his face tore it up cut him up bad he was bleeding badly like he was having a hard time seeing you could see it on his forehead he was caught on his bridges nose it's good yeah boys are like some of the most underutilized weapons you know think of the the surface area you can get a hard striking in two very close quarters with elbows like when someone's very good with it remember when cro cop fought gonzaga oh my god on top of him and just opened him up like like you hit him with an axe my word I am like watching good Muay Thai too watching people that are good at elbows and smash slash elbows elbows are tough you can't really train elbows oh that was the other fight did you see the fight on the fight pass undercard between I watch whip is for us the hobbies brother no I heard for us Robbie's brother just got dealt dude it's bad I didn't see it dude he it was bad and I saw it coming cuz he was giving up the spin I saw him like he's gonna spin and he spun and hit him with a four spinning elbow on the jaws no snapped his head around like like you've never seen was for us like unconscious fully unconscious for five ten minutes fully unconscious him then like a frosted estriol traveling yeah you had a huge main event you had to get ready for my man let's back in this brother it's going to shake that off and it was a really good fight and his brothers a tremendous amount of pressure on the other guy god damn I'm gonna forget his name do you not have the highlight it's gonna be tough with bypass huh it's out what is a home boys name it's uh the headline on that was Roberto I'm just gonna pop the video you see if this is it yeah that's it right here oh oh yeah yeah there he goes stiff oh that's a broken jaw oh yeah for sure ah yeah see it show that again it's Hamas as I said oh so he lands it once behind the air one this one don't show that again from the very beginning keep the volume up go to the very beginning dance be so hard if you're for us it lands here behind the end right there I said how else is thinking about spinning us we did it oh god damn two in a row I think he stunned him with the first one and I think the second one just look at his face dude his jump jobs or deadlocked yeah just got smashed nothing worse that's a perfect example though of like how good elbows are yeah someone gets really good at spinning elbows you ever see Gaston Bolanos fight no you're also not gonna break your elbow right you can smash people in the face sometimes guys have chunks of shit though floating around the elbow yeah like flinters like anderson had some stuff removed from his elbow and Jacare did jacory had some stuff he had so much stuff removed from his elbow that i like fill a cup I keep like a blue line like chips I bet I've actually drained my elbow like a motherfucker just but to put a new there just keep sucking pasta if you watch my Teixeira fight right literally I'm in the back of the stage like draining it cuz kept Franklin out of the fight yeah cuz I was worried that cuz he was arrested I was like if you take sit down let's throw some elbows right and mom like I got this fucking baseball pad here I gotta drain it was it painful or was it just swallowing no it's just swelling it's just it's just stupid like it's like at a big titty on my arm we had at it on my arm do you find the pictures of jock arrays debris that was in his elbow because when I think I showed it to you before when we looked at it we were like what the fuck like that was in his elbow like it's like a cup of it on the operating table yeah like there it is oh my god yeah that's all the years Jitsu huh just grinding on people's face I think it's probably not tapping and then it's probably sparring you know you got to think he's doing a lot of kickboxing sparring let's try another click on that other one is that a concise comparison sometimes go back to his again so we could stare at what was inside it's fucking elbow that's crazy what chunks it looks like looks like tea worn and looks like teeth yeah yeah some of it is probably currently some of it's probably bone a lot of people are saying you know instant so as its fight against Kelvin but Mike Anderson GSP I feel like that ship sailed though well I'll tell you what if Anderson lights up Kelvin Gastelum it's not such a high light knocked out yeah flying knee ko at 85 like he hit best bang remember when he hit best behind that flying knee and then Bisbing came back and won yeah Anderson is that was crazy right like Anderson thought it was over walked with his arms up in the air it's a weird fight and he don't he hit him when Bisbee was calling for his mouthpiece Disney was like 90 my my do boom flying knee to guts are bisman gotta know yep that's on Bisbee how bout he comes back and wins the next round right now toughest shit there's a British something see Anderson if Anderson wins in a big way look at that crack and Michael Bisping crack in Anderson Silva that was crazy too and he knocked Anderson down hell yeah but it was like that's one the greatest length on a middleweight history don't sleep on that's what made the bids being kind of legend there yeah there's a big fight man huge fight that was a big deal you know we leave that boom dude and but also Emerson so much taller than Kelvin kelvins issue about 80 85 his size yeah but I'll tell you what Kelvin has stupid hand speed man and beautiful combinations way he fucked up Vitor like dude who's fucked up Vitor like that standing before yeah I mean controlled far right old been through Wars been beat up but but that looks Weldon snitch Golden Snitch was like Pete oh you're golden much gonna change the future of vitor belfort change the future of everybody yeah but even before the Golden Snitch just to hold getting rid of the testosterone replacement therapy for sure before but think about you know when he went when Calvin again I love Calvin I think he's actually a natural 170 I think he's getting about 70 cuz look when you want to get sky like Weidman who's an upper echelon ID fiber it's just a different level man and when I'm just as fast and technical you just it doesn't work like that and Wyden has a rushing top game phenomena sampling game yeah especially his top game his ground game from the bottom got exposed a little bit in the Rockhold fight but also shows you how good rock holds top game is because Rockhold is a fucking monster when he gets on top again rock holds a black belt rock holds a black belt on the good shit so super legit right but so is Weidman it's a black belt as well I just think his his bottom game is not like this top game is insane yeah he gets on top you look exactly the way he did Kelvin he gets that choked down on you that had knowledge from your fucked but he just doesn't have the ability to get up or to be very good defensively off of his back the way some other guys do no bottoms Kaufman been really really good yet because not your high level such a high low to be effective like be a threat down there yep yeah and Brock hold is also used to sparring with Cain and used to spar with DC all the time he's used to constantly grappling guys way way bigger way heavier way stronger so he's nothing more than strong his top came so strong as a monster when he got David branch down and he's on top of oh my god clamps those legs together like oh he's fucked he's not getting up branches a hen's Oh John Danaher black belt - yeah I hate him like you know kind of silly he smashed him got to the ground just smashed him so like him versus GSP would be crazy lot rock will just be no yeah Luke Rockhold GS pound yeah him versus James - big fucking crazy I say em since it would just be no I'm saying Anderson Silva GSP would be interesting laugh Rockhold vs. Jesus how dare you know crazy crazy crazy if you're a rock gold fan you think rock that is a fight yeah tell me what all the Smashing Hulk smash yeah whatever you a he's just too small for him especially that's cardio issues Rockhold can go to what just fights you know his Strikeforce state fights with jock grey and Tim Kennedy like he can go that boy can move yeah that's a bad idea for GSP I know but it still pay to see it yeah I wanna see I'm interested in seeing GSP against a real top-level middleweight other than Michael Bisping I'd rather see my 70 how'd you do I want to see him at 72 but I'd also like to see I mean I'd like to see if we're right about him carrying that extra weight I'd like to see if we're right I mean if I was in his corner I wouldn't say that if I was no one is say look we're gonna go to 170 and we're gonna spiked iron Willie's punch for us Freddie Roach like my middle weights really not where we should be at yeah I would tell him at 170 if you go down to 170 he fight the title eliminator fight against Colby covington or someone someone who's like an up-and-coming guy once and not fight Woodley right away I don't think Willie's gonna fight right away I think Willie's gonna be out for a while if I had a guess then you do in turn bill I don't I mean I don't know what the real extent of his shoulder is but he's common yeah I mean he's starting to do some kind of outside the ring stuff he has a show on TMZ there's a podcast he's in movies all that sounds great but is it not really I mean not if you're trying to be the best in the world right I don't believe I don't believe in this day and age of mixed martial arts you can do that and still be the best of the best is he able to train at all right now do you know I don't know he looks into eights you know Woodley so he takes care of business right so he's probably beat oh yeah I'm sure but sure if his shoulders fucked up he's probably not doing any real intense grappling or anything where he's got to really swing his arms around your boy deceits fighting oohs demerit that's a crumb for that fight owes Damaris Gary yeah hosting he's just working dude's non-stop he fucks you up he gets you in a clinch England's boss his hands huh he's got giant hands to shake his hands like shaking his table yeah how long do you think that fight ins is on its feet for 30 seconds over under 30 seconds cc-come out a singlet or how's this work you don't say I'm gonna give him his fucking mile-high privileges yeah man he's going to get that under Horne yeah he's going airborne he sees a monster yeah I mean people forget but watch what he did to rumble you know the man handles dudes dkn this tremendous wrestler did DC same thing to you about Kane Kane start a train down Kane wants to get back in it you know but yes is that back surgery and it's pretty significant injuries knee surgery back surgery shoulder surgery so I launched it wrong so he's trying to make sure that everything goes the right way meanwhile Francis and Francis Kano's in Vegas at the fucking UFC lab just kidding alright can come back to that what do you think they're testing them with I've looked kind of shit are they doing to him with the UFC louder yeah if the UFC is smart they'd be like this is our guy like Andy has said this Dana said he might be the future bull I mean what man look he's got a fight Alistair motherfucking Overeem and you can never sleep on Alistair Overeem house there's a way the most decorated striking fighter in the UFC if they if they start standing in front of each other and in Ghana starts moving forward and he doesn't protect that left leg Alistair starts slamming meat into that left leg no you're gone yeah the ouster is way more technical way more technical but the thing about ouster is allister's fucking leg kicks are some of the most underrated aspect of his game so is his grappling though he Bret always forget how good his grab it's just he can't he can't take a shot the way some of these guys how dare they take a picture of uber ring that is no overi now like runs backwards and shit when you feel right it's working but that's the brock lester days yeah that's real yeah that ain't think I use fighting eyes will show a picture of Wolverine up there that it's not him I don't think so that's a photo shoot okay go to his last fight who did Alistar fight JDS right knocked him out no he had one more fight since then at least JDS I think he knocked hunt is it when he marked mark done yes that's what it was he knocked out GDS before he fought for the title that's right yeah so him versus Mark Hunt Wayans is that the Wayne's yeah see that's real yeah he still you know he's still jacked still a great athlete oh yeah but he's not steamrolling people the way you used to steamroll people he flatlined more cunt though dude he did flatlining with that knee but like I remember when he fought Todd Duffee in Japan like that was that was full marine right mmm Overeem was also oh my god Lynn Bryant lesbian fights the best that knee that's insane that is a perfect placement and he's got some of the best needs in the fucking business he's so talented man now that you saw it in the Golden Snitch was like now you get a fight for reals now he's using his technique yeah he's being a lot more smarter how dare you flatline mark hunt you son of a bitch that is a full flatline - I'm a mark hunt fan yeah me too man I think he's done though since they pulled him off that card yeah you know even if he flies out here and does the testing I want him to do well he's got to do it now but they offered it to him before and apparently said no I don't know what the story is though I mean I know he has one story and he he has a story that he thinks involves the lawsuit that he put on the UFC after the Brock Lesnar fight he says that they knew that Brock Lesnar was on steroids and that they made him that's his lawsuit but the only the only defense that is you know Dana said this in his statement he was holed up we had him headline two cards yeah and we paid him one point six seven million dollars since then since then for one flight he owes if the lawsuit was an issue why the fuck would we do all it's also yanking him off the card this is crazy I'm defending Dana here for a fighter but also yanking him off a card for a paper in Australia hurts the UFC's business model yes so yeah they would they're also protecting their ass because it's on record that he says he's having brain issues yes and then they put him in a main event and that's even bigger deal then you're really gonna sue the fucker and he said it's only when he has a couple of drinks that's when he starts slurring his words each bro he didn't say it the right way no if you look at that interview it really wasn't based off that it kind of got a context but you know Mark Hunt doesn't have to own up he did say that say it and he said it in an interview but he thinks they pulled him off the car because of the lawsuit I think it doesn't make sense to do he's like cuz verdun verse I forget the ice fighting it isn't a that's not a big paper t for Australia it's not a big card Mark Hunt is a huge fucking draw on Australia it was designed to have him fight on that card it's for yeah he's fighting Marcin Tabora was a striker yes so ver Doom's gonna most likely take that guy to the ground and and you know your boy Walt Harris finally fought again after getting a fuckin but did you see the fight yeah I did man and you guys were like I don't think he's a bad dude he blatantly meant to kick that doodly face right we're on the same page well once we watched it again we listened to the part where the referee said stop stop and he's right in front of him he's shoulder like this yeah he got caught up in the whole thing and it's a fight and I believe them yeah come on but but look that means you got caught up you decide to kick that guy anyway like you couldn't pull it back in time well whether you're caught up or not it's a cheap shot when I call it back in time no you kick the do in my face while the ref was between you right you wanted to hit him yeah that's a cheap shot yeah it's not a percent no it's just a cheap shot I don't think well there's a bad dude but he did something bad they did something bad you fucked up whatever fucked that's not crucify the cab yeah yeah I was super dirty and at the end of the fight like when that dude got illegally kicked in the ear that was literally nothing yes you know but you have to think about what happened before that mmhmm yeah like what happened he got poked in the eye oh no I get hit in the nuts he thought he got hit in the nuts he moved away and Walt came after him threw a punch the referee said stop and then he threw the head kick and caught him with a head kick pretty clean pretty clean I don't was it enough to stop the fight oh it was like a slap to the face more than it was still I had it's still a heavyweight thrown that what about 17 sighs Chuy where's at your face no boy no he's enormous yeah it was but it was a hard shot and then you know he had some time to recover and then he beat the shit out of him again and then hit him with the illegal shot then they asked him the doctor talked to him and that's what same dick oh god beer oh god baby yeah and God beer said he couldn't go on but yeah that's fair me and kicked in the face like I said I don't think well here's the bad dude but I'm counting the two fights yeah I'm completing that with the Curtis blades fight I didn't see the cursed blade fight okay that's where I fucked up because the cursed blades fight was a cleaner result but also an illegal shot Curtis is beating his shit out of this dude this was Olynyk I was in Olynyk is there dying and you want harrassing god beer I got confused the god beer Walt Harris thing did not look like it was enough to stop the fight no but it was a cheap shot at God because like yeah fuck that I can't go out then he won the fight she's great the correct decision the other fight lanes where I fucked up was blades and oliynyk blades is beating the shit out of Olynyk and then he went to throw a shot that would have been an e illegal shot but he didn't really hit him he just towed his ear he hit his ear with his toe own good baby but the referee saw that there was contact so he said look I have to stop it because it was an illegal shot and it was contact and he brought the doctor in and only Nick was done but he was done from the beating that he took you know that so blades won oh good yeah that was fair but it was like super confusing for Curtis he thought he was getting disqualified went down and and he had beat the shit out of you before that you could really tell that the toe just barely touched it inflicted there like that Curtis blades well he trains with all my guys back in Denver every Wednesday I mean they're saying he's the next big thing if he keeps going if he keeps going he keeps getting better you see him better in every fight yeah his striking has a ways to go but they're like did he actually had none yeah and this just getting better and better and better yeah he got a leg kick quite a bit by that big Russian dude that Russia without the same Russian who knocked Travis out that he strangled Travis yeah the oliynyk yeah motherfucker doesn't just not go away did he strangle Travis yeah what he knocked around like a sideways rear naked choke remember oh that's right he's just a neck crank er he's the guy that won from Ezekiel from while he was mounted at Troy that's the dude mountain and something is equally mom I guess that's his shit yeah I guess done tomorrow people tell you that looks scary gets a hold of people just walk out music it's like relax it's do you hate fans Russian Russian religious music boos phaidor select your walk-up music it's not working have you seen that documentary yet Ikaros we talked about this right talk a little bit you see it no dude you gotta watch it I know we can't keep talking we'll go crazy well the problem you know what the problem I see you you have to watch it you know what the problem is give me an assignment to to make it fair alright the problem is is like I listen to the home boy who came on and talked about it and then we've talked about so much I feel like I'm good yeah but when you see it like if you gave me a breakdown on the first season of narcos and we talked about all the time I'm not gonna I got it spoiler you definitely right but when you see it the visual yeah the way it's done you did an amazing job putting the movie together that's the way it's done it's like shows you where the building was where they hid the urine how they got the urine passed through the wall they had a fucking hole in the wall how they opened up the jars they show the scratches on the jars and it's like dude they robbed the Olympics screens in the Olympics in Russia and they robbed it they had a record number 13 goals and they were just all on steroids here's my question for that so when I see that stuff obviously it's not hampered happening just an Olympics how what's going on right now in big professional sports because think how much money's in the NFL MBA UFC boxing like who's in the know I would love to just be a gold Wow it's you'd have to get the kind of and this is where the UFC should be credited cuz you would have to get the kind of access to the UFC has and they've given to Nowitzki and the UFC and you sada like what they do is unprecedented in sports what they do is unlike any other sport where they just you're treated as if you're in an Olympic program like where they can just show up at your house at any moment your entire career yeah your entire career you have to give your whereabouts every where you are all day wherever you're gonna be exhausted yeah oh my god it's expensive too oh my god like even though what's name she doesn't have to do this no they don't no one's asked them to do this I don't know if this is the best choice but I don't think it is yeah in today's climate and environment I'm not advocating cheating god I don't think you should cheat I think we'll fun now come on come on but John John fight shake free John I don't know about all that you want to know the craziest fucking rumor that I heard Oh John John Stein please the crowd I can't tell you who told me this this is the craziest one the the stuff that he tested positive for and what this doesn't make any sense and people are saying that there's so many months out the stuff that he take tasted positive when he was twins tested here and tested there the stuff that he tested positive takes a long time to get out of your system right yeah that he was tested positive you know where else that's stuff that you find it you find it in creatine when they get creatine sometimes from China it is it's tainted with steroids they use that creatine to cut cocaine so he's doing the cooking there's one of the things that they cut some cocaine with is creatine cuz it looks like cocaine God so he might've got the bad batch if he was partying monohydrate cocaine party Johnny wanna do it Bob it's really good stuff anyway I can't test positive for anyway it's just coke be out of your system ro bro why'd you feel probably swole too little song comes on the radio dancing it's freakin about all your words birthday ten days out before the UFC fight Oh what do we do it's like the world wants him to be a fuck up a birthday of course you knew a couple bumps on your birthday mai-chan John last time you fucked him up three weeks out he did coke come on man bro you barely trained um oh my god that's the case just stop and think about it for a moment if it was that stuff that's best-case scenario Joe oh yeah Cody's not and we can track and we can I can't drag down your deals go your homes let me come in and talk to you about where I get my she's in columbia homes you guys want to go down there you're welcome bitches down there no the taking in the propeller plane-- broom across the border we don't do that oh go do that in a bit ski look how bad you want to catch this guy Jordan well they don't want to they're not in the business of drug enforcement you don't want to catch that guy at all and know the guys not gonna admit he's not gonna give you a bag of narcos for did Jon just write narcos for it for Jon Jon didn't tell me this so yeah somebody told me this as a rumor which sounds crazy but then red band was the one who called the dick pills last time red band said that if he's taking dick pills like if the guy does coke he tested positive for Coke and red band was like if he does dick pills or if he does coke he's probably doing dick pills I was like what and so red BAM brought a bunch of a man he's like do you think there's any anyone knows what's in these things it's true it's like they have steroids and all because I've taken cialis he goes and I've taken this stuff it goes this stuff's way crazy that's really yes he says it's madness they look like a wild animal and listen your dick is harder the rock was the best promo for dick pills ever but some things like but they're gas station dick pills that you're getting from some fucking third-world country if you're a world-class athlete probably shouldn't be doing that shit a bucket they used to have pain in yes hundred percent I mean I know 7,000 yes do I take that shit Brian won't take them anymore and Brian takes everything and he won't take rhino's 7,000 remember when they used to have that life cereal commercial Mike you only he hates everything Brian's the opposite let's see what the Rhino pills do the mileage he's got hold it he did right he did but my skeptical hippo eyes there's because again we're constantly looking for and they're smart people around John so with this stuff the others clomid in there but clomid is a masking agent there's a lot of masking was until mid I thought they found clomid in this show oh the old one yeah he's a new one no the new one was what was it called up some Russian sort of stole the ball yeah toran a ball tramp ain't that a bitch though if you're John you're doing a couple of devil's dandruff and just whatever it's your birthday that's the case but they have found the clomid they did find it in those dick pills I mean it was in there there it is but also makes the wouldn't it like it's a it does surgeon inhibitor 100% but but it's also for something else it's also for if you've been running you know deer in it you take clomid to recurrent things so it's in there like I said you have a lot of smart people around you where when the public cares dick pills like it's not bad come on it's all good baby right you're gonna fight again right so that now right if it's cocaine he should be out we're not looking at for years well you gotta prove that it's cocaine first of all this is pure speculation on my power gotta go get that cocaine was a journalist if I was like working for ESPN resources already had me pulled out of here oh you and I both be fired one for our social media too because why go my sources if the one guy that is in the business whose balls deep usually in this stuff I'll give a fuck I'm wrong night which at the time I said to talk shit man my source is saying my sources mmm three people but your guy that the who knows who it is maybe the cocaine dealer but no should track him if I'm John I'm hiring some private investigator to track some shit down it's too late though my god because he's done I can I tell you my guy is but he does not have a vested interest in anybody being correct he just has what I don't know what no no dude he has what he has is a possibility and he also was saying and even if it's true good luck proven that now you're screwed you're fucked you're fucked you're fucked because all the Commission knows is Tran about where the fuck it is I would like to find out from people who actually know whether or not this is possible creatine and cocaine yeah no no not well that I've heard is true I don't think I looked it up though I think I heard it from other people as Google didn't saw it a bunch of places yeah yeah I use cretin it's gross I see you're doing my masters in bro so see if see if it's proven that creatine test positive for that stuff because that would be very very unique to ran a ball examination and creatine specifically creatine apparently and a lot of the stuff that you get if you're buying vitamins you're getting in bulk and you're getting a mixed places and we had issues the early on batches of alpha brain that they didn't contain all the stuff that it was supposed to and that it was it had some stuff that we didn't even put in there have traces as we change language you want to buy some right now sure we can buy some it's a dollar one to five US dollars per gram what's it coming cholesterol acetate Ross steroid stir Anna ball Malaysia sourced or Anna ball creatine cycle cotton Tim how much is the fare first thing I popped up how much is it five bucks there's so much that they sell online that's bullshit but I bet a lot of this stuff is real steroids I agree what is this bet veteran industry limited I think if you've got some shit that's like sort of legal I bet you could sell it you test positive for it but you could probably sell dude I've taken a lot of fucking sup ones to my day and I never flagged I'm not taking the GNC stuff that's like extenders testosterone nothing ever hmm and if you're John what that fucker you doing see if is that the ones that say that just showing you the supplement itself thanks see if you can find creatine contaminated with Torana ball so you see that what the baseball players get busted people buy it that way yeah but don't write Chinese creatine Taranto ball just right creatine contaminated with Toronto ball because apparently more than one person has tested positive in various sports from creatine specific in baseball shitload yeah creatine works I mean hell yeah gives you a fat face though make you swell up a little tomorrow hydrate doesn't but there's a risk three of them the ma hydrates like holds water yes we retain a shitload of fat face yeah yeah get thick though it's strong form but it says there's 42 supplements that are sold at GNC that can trigger a positive test for aníbal and at this point this was in 2014 you sadha had only found seven of them but were any of them creatine just see heart did did anything come up when you googled creatine contaminated with Travis that was that was very first that's though so one of any of those things are creatine CI totally make sense man I mean if you wanted to sell the creatine that's the bomb yo my creatine make you gain mad weights I'm not buying it yeah for the regular dude just goes to the gym I look good on tinder I just want I just want like small fun trying to slide them DMS yeah trying is that pull-up coast of body yes no creatine does work though I guess legit that shit really if you want to get like big and strong creatine Sun it's something yeah yeah I mean we'll pull your hammy but whatever it won't do what steroids can do but no no you won't be Vittorio barrini Moros John Jones and definitely stronger shake you strong yeah it's legit but it also feed a lot of red meat preteens and red meat mm-hmm so you're good yeah I've got this guy coming on as doctors or fucking all he eats is red meat - Shaun Baker yeah he's on the corner white shit no he's fifties jacked busy does fuckin set to deadlift it box jumps this tank really yeah I just know that he's doing drugs at all I look at muscle suit there's a bunch of videos and pictures of them and shit I'm very curious to see like I've never heard of anybody just even just advocating eating only me I've always heard the opps I heard if you just read me like your cholesterol your blood pressure it's hard to break breakdown in your body like it's not the way to go I heard less red means the way to go mmm that's not totally right because most of what you get me to get high cholesterol there's a giant there's a lot of debate on offense I like high cholesterol but uh but dietary cholesterol is apparently not a big factor really genetics for a big factor sedentary lifestyles a big factor what about just digestion all that red meat yeah it'd be hard I would wonder I would wonder but I wonder if like maybe it's not that hot maybe it's the illusion I think this is there was a study that was done on red meat that was talking about what percentage of people got red meat or that ate a lot of red meat were likely to get cancer and the criticism of that study that rare that was really interesting said this study is not differentiating between what kind of meat you're eating it's not talking about eating steak it's talking about just ready so what are you eating with that red meat if you're eating red meat five times a week and you have a higher likelihood of cancer it's entirely possible that you're talking about cheeseburgers it's entirely possible you're talking about fast food and bullshit and sandwiches and stuff with a lot of simple refined carbohydrates a lot of trans fats who knows what the fuck sugar not saying oh did you eat grass fed beef or bison five days a week or did you eat bullshit five days a week did you eat a fucking sausage McGriddle you know who knows what the hell is nothing right you know like what are you eating with it isn't bread are you eating it with pasta like with you how often are you eating refined carbohydrates like all these other factors could also be contributing to your heart attack and may they might be the difference but it's like one of those things gets put out there and then it just stuck with me like fuck I can't eat too much red meat man digest well that's the I was like Oh Calgon I think balance is probably good for everything you know I think it's probably good to eat a lot of fiber he just seems but you shit a lot that seems good like when I need a giant salad I take massive dumps and it comes out like a waterslide whoa yeah or if I wonder heroin homeboy at state maybe you can just eat bread meat like a goddamn caveman and be great well he's doing it he gets all his vitamins from that too which is insane he's taking supplements well sure I would like to ask him I can't wait to talk to him I don't know if it's the right move I don't but here's the thing it's like the right move for you is not the right move for him it's not the right room for that dude out there everybody's got a different there everybody's body's different when it comes to that and some people just react really well to like all fish like you were doing that for a while now let's go on pescetarian how about two weeks just cool well yeah well yeah it's like all right you know I get bored a fucking fish hmm I like to mix things I like to challenge myself with diets but then sometimes sometimes it's like I don't feel great I'm not doing anymore I don't feel great doing that I gave it to be honest I gave it over four weeks best Aryan I was like I don't feel great I'm sluggish in the morning I feel like I don't have a lot of energy from my workouts I'm not doing any more do I have red meat in I feel better that's arms meet back in the system yeah did you never even eat an elk yet no next time you just come out like fuckin I'll

like he's like he's on vacation somewhere playing golf it's like this edible kicked in I'm gonna go back and change my name I bet he thought about it for a long fucking while I was like you see his hand holding up the phone that's hilarious and he zoom in dude see his hand holding up his phone talking to his phone I think sometimes you just smash life in every fat every blame that you just become a little crazy hashtag take that hashtag take that hear that take that take that take that yeah hmm seems like an odd choice but hey why not fuck it he did it twice again I was in agility I was I was in a gym in Hollywood he came in want to work out midday you want everyone to leave oh that's adorable yeah good luck get me out of it however ID let me stay for whatever reason I don't know maybe because I look like it's in front of a fight but he came in there with a truckload of bitches did he know I was working out with all these girls I was nervous doing Kevin Spacey shit to me or something I don't know I was nervous really I was a little nervous hell yeah yeah is his tea whole team around they did shut down the gym bite you they kicked everybody out a lot of people have to bounce that bitch so they told people hey I know you paid for your dues and you're a member here but that doesn't matter because this guy means more to us than you basically hi private gym private jail was a private area gym they're like y'all we need to get out of P Diddy's here private gym I said I don't wear bitch I'm kind of private gym is in I was probably gym for a high level athletes and celebrities yet I don't give the Jews shit on him for that's gross I know I just can't believe they're kicked like why can't work out people he didn't want people I don't know maybe super weak on the bench or some shitty about twenty fives on the praises just tweet some bullshit work Jazzercise the only one to see it all he does is that straight nonsense all day that shit is phenomenal for your guard yeah yeah yeah dude I used to jack off their videos when I was a kid she was bad as fuck yeah but she had the spring that you push with your post that shit was no jiggler the thighmasters yes was it real does it really work my master you should have to show your thighs let's see what ya do she was back then yeah there it is yeah she was pretty hot too long legs she was one of the classic stories in Hollywood of negotiations gone sideways how so he was one of the big stars of Three's Company and was some sort of a negotiation that didn't go well and they removed her from the show they want I don't know if she wound up quitting or she wrote out the contract but at one point I'm company yeah one point in time the the thing had gotten so bad that she was only appearing on the show on the phone she'd be like on the phone calling in when I talk about hell yeah yeah it was weird and then they replaced her they replaced her with the new girl damn she tried pulling a ball and moved in Hollywood was like what yeah I don't remember this the full details I want to say that it was like a manager decided they were gonna play hardball with the network because it was a big hit some Roger worked a shit of Holy Writ is the crazy story of how Suzanne Somers was fired for asking for equal pay on Three's Company at the peak of her fame in 1980 so I guess John Ritter was probably raking in all the cheese with gee can you imagine if they made Three's Company in today's society I did the way he gets cream I did an episode of news radio with John Ritter was he also super nice guy like weirdly nice and people always say that about him yeah people say genuine nice guy dude how about your boy on your show house of cards Kevin Spacey whoa they say he's super screwed screwed well you hear what they were saying about the actual set you just be grabbing guys dicks and ass at and cornering them and God dog just the ultimate dick diver it just relax well here's a little insight into that his brother did an interview where his brother was talking about I think his dad raping his brother really heavy-duty shit and his brother is dressed like Rod Stewart in the 1970s with crazy hair and some yellow leather jacket with rings on and shit and or something like just crazy - unless - shit like what is going on you realize oh these two probably come from an extremely sexually abusive household and he was talking about how he thinks that and I don't know if this was pre or post allegation cuz I literally only watched like two minutes of it I read a little bit of it and I watch two minutes of it and then my little fucking chipmunk brain was like next thing please see ya and but he was talking about how he thinks that Kevin Spacey became an actor because he hated his life and hated like what he experienced growing up it would be someone else who wanted to be someone else but I didn't see good at it he was amazing actor but I don't think his brother was I don't I don't know if they even addressed his sexual abuse allegation damn because I didn't really get into it that's some heavy dude scary shit that it went on for so long this Harvey Weinstein shit is scary too you know what I found you want to see something crazy here I'll send it to you see something crazy I found some shit from 1947 hold on one second dude how ugly are all these sexual predators - they're hideous like you're gonna see my boy coast again accused of sexual yeah that guy solves me - yeah yeah it's um it they are hideous but it seems like this was what they did in Hollywood and this is their it's the culture right like these guys are products of the environment because there's a line right now Jamie see if would you be able to put this up their email yeah text message sure ok here I'm gonna send it to you cuz this is this is crazy this is from this woman in 1947 and she was talking about this very thing Kevin Spacey you think what is this on his brother says the price of betrayal and deviancy how an abusive childhood at the hands of a vile Nazi father turned Kevin Spacey into a quote monster whose life was a lot Wow damn Kevin Spacey was born Kevin Fowler grew up in a Nazi support with a Nazi supporting father older brother Randy recalls being sexually abused by father Thomas aged 14 while mother Kathleen turned a blind eye listen I'd love to see what he did it's horrible he's a monster but God man you feel bad for you you feel bad Jamie look at that text that I sent you there's this was uh again this is from 1947 and it was Maureen or O'Hara and she charged Hollywood producers and directors with calling her a cold potato without sex appeal because she refuses to let that make love to her says the mirror New York correspondent she says in quotes I'm so upset with it that I am ready to quit Hollywood Maureen says it's got it's got so bad I hate to come to work in the morning I'm a helpless victim of Hollywood's whispering campaign because I don't let the producer the director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they they have spread word around town that I something not a woman am I am NOT a woman then I'm a cold piece a marble statuary hmm Wow Jesus Christ so that's that that just shows you how long it's been going on that this is probably what they always did these find there's so many more monsters like it these guys are the product of the machine yeah I mean if you're an intern and you grow up seeing that and then you become some sort of a studio head and then you see you see that everywhere around you and then you're doing it yeah it's literally the product to invite it's like it that's the nature of the business which is horrible to say and now it's finally out there yeah the Kevin Spacey thing is crazy series it's all like a lot of 14 year olds that he was grabbing that fuck man and then what you see Harvey fucking Harvey Weinstein just looks like pure shit he tried like doing in a disguise that like a sports bar some shit you see there's no I didn t a did sir you were six five 300 pounds out of shape your face is everywhere he tried to go into a sports bar with his sky yeah there's like a picture of him at a bar and people are like you shitting me what are you doing he really thought I was gonna sneak in yeah that that's like the mountain from Game of Thrones sitting at a bar right no well no everyone knows what the fuck you look like look at this wigs Phoenix restaurant hardly see that you sure that's him yeah that's him in that picture yeah but that picture looks terrible that's a horrible picture about trying to tell he's in the Phoenix area where's complete on one week outpatient rehab program Jesus Christ so if you can't put a hat on and awake and think we won't notice who dark shit and right above it it's a giant Johnny Depp to sell homes to pay debt I'd still love that guy he just goes off yeah he's as much money as that guy made he's still spending it could lose homes to repay five million dollar loan Wow to sell one home son but that's not good that means he doesn't have five million dollars to pay a loan and he has like 14 houses he owns better hey Disney better strike up another part to keep imagining if you went on I just a hurricane a ride of cocaine for like 17 years and all sudden you woke up 18 ounces are you shitting me wonder why suing is business managers like you knew I was oncoming houses when I was on coke poor bastard hey man how many years after retiring from boxing it's Boyd Mayweather broke hmm I mean the counter fight alarms me five five five five five does all the company like forty six no no that ship soon you don't think so Oh comeback fight at 46 no it's just too sad is he goes too big the markets not there anymore I think he tries to talk Conor McGregor into a rematch I'm not kidding do you see counter statements about that no what'd he say he said I'd beat him in a rematch adorable I know take that damn it yeah come on well he would have to do something extremely different in his training know this it's just not if he's never beating me Mayweather in a box he's not look like he was punching him hard right it looked like he clipped him with that one hard uppercut but it looks like he was pacing himself and in saving his energy it's just that it's just not the way to go I get what he's doing but it's just not the way to go yeah but if you're making a hundred million dollars it's a hundred million dollars if he could sucker people into doing it again for a hundred million dollars well what do you think the what do you think the USC is gonna have to do Connor back because Connor you know Connor had his movie premiere which I guess destroyed the box offices and Ireland I know how many premieres they have out there but it's the biggest most successful Irish move of all time buts so crazy yeah which is crazy they asked him what do you have to do he goes oh we're not I don't have bosses anymore we have to be partners which is a legit point yeah it's a legit point he's a different business entity but I think part of the point is gonna be that he can't talk about it it's probably I agree I think the deal is gonna happen and then you just might not find a normal contract cuz he's like yeah we get a bitch we're gonna give some money there's also the issue if you are negotiating that you go public with this negotiation like that you don't want to talk about that no I mean I guess he does for his brand because it makes them look like a superpower they've got to pay corner now I can't just fucking keep on the same deal if they had before doctor do you trust Connor not to say anything well for Connor part of his thing is disclosing it it's part of his his swagger is how much money it's what makes him Connor McGregor he's beating the game which is why the game yeah there's got to be parody now yeah it's good it can't be the older deal yeah can't be the old deal so you think they give him a apart I think if I was the UFC I would do what it takes to be in the Conor McGregor business now I don't know what that means cuz I don't know shit about business it means you're giving up percentage here cuz I think you gotta give up a percentage if you want a percentage okay look at 94% like this movie fucking writer fucking amazing it's fucking amazing 94% it's out Friday all the movie theaters here I don't know about all but yeah I think's a lot of problem find those fucking six percent piece of shite just some through the streets of Dublin just six percent of Nate Diaz fans yeah what is that about with it's six percent fuck haters super haters right pure haters yeah particulars so you're not getting an eight fight then if Tony and uh kind of fight say it again you're probably not getting the Nate fight anytime soon if no because Irish team says to that toe the next fight because management says that Dana says that so what do you do if your name I think they don't want to do an aid fight who does oh you think Connor does it huh I think I think they think nate is a big fucking guy he's long he's a rough fight they rather than Tony furred I think they're both rough fight does bolt neither one of them my one walk in the park but after coming off of that real hard fight with Nate maybe he thinks Tony's easier to hit no oh well he hit me a lot too though yeah he did hit Nate a lot but and it's got 55 but plus which is gonna get more what's he can get more hype Nate I agree I agree but anyways he read are you crazy Tony's a star Eddie gotta relax yeah but you know Eddie trains them yeah totally understand what's inside honestly want to see each fight equally I really do I don't have a favorite I would love to see Nate and Connor go at it again I would love to see Connor go out of with Tony I literally do not have a favorite I love both of those fights what happens if you only get you get one fight out of confidence I'm only fighting once Tony I'm gonna let Joe Rogan's be the guy who decides yet Tony Nader GSP Oney Tony because we haven't seen him fight Tony before we've seen him fight Nate twice GSP is such a long shot it's a different weight class it's 170 I mean that's all that means GSP had talked about going to 55 at one point in time do you remember that yeah yeah that would that would take a long fucking time but from from the people who I know who are super close with George what they want is Woodley and then a super fight was with Conor that's their game plan why they want would they seventy champ not gonna vacate 8585 don't make sense dangerous fight hell yeah but they're all dangerous all dangerous all those everybody one 785 that's just unrealistic they ain't happenin 70 makes more sense but look at what Dana said don't call him a liar I'll call him right now just say he's a liar here I hate said robert whittaker here he hates me anyways so you can't get any worse so I don't give a fuck but I think he has to say that there's a lot of things right you know he's a blister I know he's your friend B's also motor he's the best pronin in the game right so he has to say certain stuff so this was not a Wild West maybe George really wants a fight Robert Whittaker it's entirely possible George really likes it at 185 who knows I don't know not happened yeah I don't know I don't know it's not like take it it's not like I'll take it it's not like Dana's word is bond here where you know he hasn't said outlandish shit before the hypo thing let me ask you this what do you rather say you rather see him vs. GSP vs. Robert Whittaker or GS vs. Woodley um that's a great question I got my answer yeah Whittaker right it's so fucking exciting he's working knock his ass out knock anybody and he's aggressive and he's very technical his striking is fucking wicked he's wicked what would I rather see yeah I'd rather see Whitaker GSP oh if I'm on GSP steam he's fighting Woodley really we're creating a fun fight for him I don't think either fights a fun fight for anybody neither it's fun but at 85 there's a lot of his stamina there's a lot it's just not fun for him well it's interesting because Robert Whittaker the 185-pound interim champ used to be a 170 pound fighter as well and it was stopped by wonder boy yeah that's true but he was draining himself to make 170 and Ritter again we're talking about a 26-year old guy who when he changed weight classes was probably only 23 yeah right was about three years ago yeah his last loss right yep yeah he just couldn't make the weight training himself and it's hard to date when you're when you're older mm-hmm and he's pretty fucking stout at UH at 185 pounds meaning he's not it's not small 185 he's the fastest 80 fighter in the world were you shocked by Mousasi the Mousasi fight I think that showed you like how good the Bellator guys are yes and no I I do I think Belle tours at a level certain guys are level but I think Mousasi if here's the interview and he was actually pretty funny in it but he was like I had one fuckin I meant I literally had one eye he closed my eye up so I'll just going off instincts and show Manko is very tough very tough so I've won I he stuff that's what you get yeah he caught him with one big clang er but he was pulling the Brandon Vera where he was like before even gathering was like I'm gonna be champ at middleweight lightweight heavyweight and like whoa I think everyone's gonna go thug rose now I just wanna be myself you can't do that kick your ass and she's like our father one having helped some scary shit really got room for one right she did it though I know man very happy me too that left hook was the bouncy one of the most intriguing fights on a car to me I got to be on tonight you again I've known Rosen we have a history in Denver and we did the same coaches and I love rose not bet on her just because you're such a big underdog I and I predicted I thought she was even getting she's gonna be a lot of trouble cuz yawns just so goddamn technical yeah but I think you Lana didn't respect her didn't she kind of overlooked her that that championship you know those those obligations you have as a champion I don't think people realize what comes with that you know a lot of people go everybody knows Dana said this or is Ron like you wants to be a champ do you have to do championship shit which you got to sell the fight you're the reason why the pay-per-view is selling there's a lot that comes with that so and it's it's George retired because it he's like dude I can't relax man yeah we don't get to see it very often - you know we don't get to see it we see little Clips here and there but we don't know what their schedules like all the phone calls they have to make all the interviews they have Conor talked about the day long remember the heat backed out that when they wanted to do that fight he's like not fucking me I'm not doing all that media that's right my guys are killing me they were gonna pull him from the car yeah he was like cool I don't give a fuck I need to Train like you guys are having me do all this media circus stuff I gotta focus on the fight man right and he and they put him through more injuries and then anyone ever course cuz and that motherfuckers never met a camera he doesn't like and think that he was like no no I'm going crazy yeah remember when him and although they did that World Tour yeah that was ridiculous man that was over easy how about the fin then the Floyd Mayweather tour that what that schedule was nuts and I was just the commentator on that bitch I was exhausted yeah how crazy was that that tour where they would stand in front of her but even talk shit I told the shooter after two cities it'd be tough for the best comics in the world couple of new material six nights in a row little loan these two fighters yeah like the first two cities you saw they have their shit together it was fun then after that third ones like what are we doing what do you think would they selling tickets it out of there give it away for free I think they were giving them away but it was I've never seen some shit like that am i right I mean different ones did you go to live I went to all of them except for London how many with her I went to let's see I went to Los Angeles New York in Toronto and then they did London someone no no and the biggest what Toronto I've never seen anything like it really never Wow people hanging off the rafters to get a few simple he's nuts scary shit no one like him it's weird you know there's a lot of great fighters right now but there's no one that has the same enigmatic persona this fucking quality that makes everybody want to be around them no one on the planet there's no one even a close second there's never been a close second has there now not as far as like popularity he's like the biggest by far bat sports athlete ever because who else could go from one sport to the next the way he did no it was just perfect time in perfect style but the talent right now 55 and 70 I again I was looking at 70 I'm like oh my god the UFC is operating at such a high level talent wise it's nuts in certain divisions other divisions it's Jesus Christ we need some life do you think you could ever talk George in to fight and Conor hundred percent I'm telling you joking it 170 well I'm telling you when I tell you my guys are super close to George their plan is Woodley Conor now a lot has to happen and these guys are you know me brother I'm yeah amen Woodley cars George comes back and beats tyron woodley first of all that would cement him as the goat he's that going already let's be honest who you're coming back at 36 in winning a middleweight title moving up for finishing him finishing pound claim him asleep but it's still like that's accomplishment goat versus like technique goes technique goat is Mighty Mouse who's planning last fighting nobody he always go through the nobody like that look at George's resume and you're talking about none you sada days it's true when it was the wild fucking west well that's the creatine lat that's least of our worries that's a creatine in the bag I gotta wrap this up tell everybody where you gonna be this week let's see Thursday I'm in Charlotte Friday Saturday's Amy's in Nashville yes Sunday night Sunday night Columbus Charlotte Nashville
