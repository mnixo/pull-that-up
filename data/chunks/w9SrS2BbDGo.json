I know that I know I know I'm just saying it's fucking I mean they fuck up all the time yeah yeah brutal but it's always live on who do it always goes to iTunes in the unedited form we just have to reboot it so it's backup now okay so where were you natural disasters natural disasters so I think what we're you know it's it's basically we can see where we're going right at the moment there's more and more natural disasters coming faster and faster some of that may be because of the fact that we're going through a whole solar system wide transition as scientists like Demetria from Russia talks about and this guy dieter bros some of it may be because the level of human consciousness is more meshed with the natural state of the planet than we actually can comprehend quite yet which is what most of the indigenous people believe and I've been visiting like we've been doing retreats down to Colombia to work with the Kogi Indians and they walk like 25 hours down from the mountains to hang out with us and that's basically the message that they've been giving us from from their from their you know older understanding of the nature of reality you know it's somehow the level of human spiritual development and how much we are in a reciprocal relationship to our local world you know has an effect on what type of catastrophe is do or don't occur that's their perspective yeah to him so when the earth is sick it's because we're sick and we're all sick along with it so as tsunamis and hurricanes and earthquakes and ultimately shifts to the polar ice caps and shit like that and super volcanoes and Yellowstone that are ready to blow and kill half the shit on the continent that that is all in correspondence with the sickness of this species of us that's that's the indigenous perspective damn that's a scary thought but listen man if we look at the ideas of quantum physics that even observing something with certain intentions can actually change the outcome of particles you know when they do those tests those slot tests and they show that observing and experiments actually observing experience actually has an effect on the result of the experiment or you could say there's no such thing as just being an impartial observer you're always participating in that's a better way of looking at it it really does make sense that it operates on macro micro and ultimately you know this one gigantic level right which is what like Western alchemists talked about when they said as above so below how the fucking crazy is it the idea that human behavior can actually inspire storms you know you don't want to say that because you don't want to say that like the most fucked up places the places get the storms but I actually do jokes about it they're cruel jokes that I would never do now but I just do jokes about how tornadoes were attracted to the smell of white trash and if they just circle when you have too much macaroni and cheese and and and and 40-ounce beard wonder location but it's a terrible idea it's a terrible joke it's really cruel to you know think that you're cooler than these fucking poor people that live in some place where the sky becomes an angry monster but it is kind of weird that they only land in fucked up places you don't want to think that you know I ever want to blame people for that but wow you know I mean obviously we know that's not true because there's Geographic centers in this country where there's certainly attracted to you know but the idea that more of them come because people are more fucked up and they're accelerating because our society is deteriorating that's a terrifying thought that we're responsible for that well or even you know on a 1% level even that that we're responsible for just having any influence on it not that we created but that we even have any barrier as I discussed in like the 2012 book like the Hopi for instance who live in Arizona you know tribes like that may have actually chosen to live in very difficult environments where survival was really like on a knife edge because it forced them to be able to do things like rain dances so they didn't permit or do you think that it was these is that it or is it that is the result of them living in this difficult environment they develop more character well it's quite possible cuz they had a you know large choice earlier on of where they were gonna leave and it's possible they actually chose to leave and live in very difficult environments because it forced them to develop their initiative in psychic capacities the only reason one question that is because back then resources were so scarce and you were on foot essentially so if you were foot how much fucking ground can you cover and how much do you know about other lands you know how much do you know about if you move five hours south it doesn't get that cold you don't fucking know actually I totally disagree with would you really well on both levels first of all I think that they did no I mean for instance we now understand that there was like a sign language even native people who didn't speak the same you know language could actually communicate very highly developed sign language I was all across the continent and second of all what they've discovered is that a lot of native cultures were actually more like cultures of abundance and cultures of scarcity then actually the amount of work that they had to do today there you know compared to what we have to do you know an average day it was a lot less but that doesn't match up with your idea of them moving to a very difficult environment to stay alive because well I'm talking about the Hopi in particular let's say like you know they were like the Tibetan Buddhists of the native people I chose the most difficult spot what did they state this anywhere is it's just a conclusion or a feeling you have no that's a theory it's a theory I mean you know maybe it's ludicrous but but um it was a sense I had my visited them for the book and I read a lot about the man through logical accounts and so on but the whole thing is like and they would put themselves through these extraordinary you know you know two kind of efforts you know like they were the Hopi snake clan they would go all around the area we collect all of the most poisonous snakes they could possibly find then the men would sit you know just naked wearing loincloths in a circle with their knees touching they would open up all of the snakes in the middle of the circle and the men would have to sit entirely still until all the snakes had crawled past them wow that's pretty fucking wild right they'd if they definitely had their shit together when it came to rites of passage you know I remember that movie that a man called horse do you remember that no I didn't it was it was a forgot the guy's name that he played the father in Gladiator Peter O'Toole I believe it's Peter O'Toole I might be incorrect anyway amazing fucking movie but one of the scariest parts of it is one of these rites of passage that he has in order to become one with their tribe use an American or be an Englishman I forget what the fuck was but they hung him by his nipples you know they used to do shit to test your oh the Sun dances they put they Lance you through the the pectoral muscles hang you really is that necessary apparently yes yeah it's the Indian equivalent of teeth straightening I guess or Botox ingestion or injection there's no it's way worse than that or way better than that rather it's um I think you know just having something like having a Bar Mitzvah having some sort of a celebration it doesn't even have to be you know you're hung from a tree by your tits it just has to be something where like okay I pass through the door well the symbology with that that's actually what you're saying for me is like a big distinguish for those cultures initiation was actually about going through some process through which you would master non-ordinary states of consciousness even on wit wood cultures like the native cultures I mean initiation was not just a celebration you actually had to overcome you know a life death crisis you had a a warrior for them to I mean there were you're in a constant state of you know defending your tribes and you know you were you had to be able to overcome very very terrifying situations even in hunting you know they had to make a man out of you yeah but I think that a lot of it was really more about learning to have a disciplined approach to not ordinary states of cut states of consciousness you know to control states of consciousness I mean what do you mean by non ordinary to mean like peyote enhanced yeah I mean obviously peyote mushrooms and these are all native you know ayahuasca and so on but then also things like fasting you know and being you know not eating for five nights what you're just sitting in a mountaintop or something or what's the benefit of that it's about you in exactly the same kind of state as the psychoactive substances fasting for five days yours those will bring on visionary visionary experiences you know there they were Bay and force you to you know discipline your mind be able to withstand you know in Gresham's from like the astral realms and so on what do you say to people that say that doing something along the lines of fasting where it's actually possibly dangerous to your body and that's what's causing you to have these experiences it's really kind of a silly thing to do in this day and age where you could choose other paths the same sort of results without damaging your body and shutting things down I don't know enough about nutrition to tell you whether or not it's healthy but I've read a lot of people that start talking about fasting for days and days based they say it puts train your kids it's not good for you I mean I don't know no it wouldn't say that I swear you did not eat it probably isn't I don't know I don't know I actually know a lot of people who love it and find it to be very helpful and actually one of them you know in terms of extending the human lifespan they found that you know reducing your caloric intake is the most direct way to do that does that make sense is just your body's you know doing it less rpms you know a race engine it's gonna that's gonna last as long there's a good episode of Penn & Teller bullshit look at the cleansing episode where they go through like the diets like the lemon detox diets and shit like that where you don't eat you all have to go through the colonics and the whole thing like that that the whole thing is it's a crock assure Penn & Teller's bullshit make some excellent points but they also make some silly ones because they want to find the conclusion that everything is bullshit that's what they're doing I don't think I've ever saying they dismiss yoga i watch them do go he's talking about it's just stretching and stretching it was like wow you're crazy you've never done a yoga class if you do you do yoga for two hours and tell me that's just stretching right yoga makes you hot yoga makes you I've gotten this high from yoga as I have from a couple hits of pot no doubt about it no doubt like real strong pot I've gotten to like body tingling moments like especially if you take like a real good class like hot yoga where you go real deep into poses and you really hold them anybody that dismisses that as just stretching you're either not giving me the full information that you have access to or you did a really sloppy job of investigating it you know you can't just say these fucking Indian masters that have been doing this shit for thousands of years are just stretching and that's why they have these very specific poses that they believe activate very specific regions and hemispheres of the chakras of the body you can't just dismiss that that's kind of interesting and cool about what's happening right now in having this or so you know complex I mean yeah I mean you know I mean I was looking at a book by this guy Dean Radin who studies a psychic phenomena as a scientist that institude noetic sciences and we in treated for film read a book called the self-aware universe and he analyzes a whole you know centuries worth of data and psychic experience experience statistically he even looks at reports from the US Army and the government which support the existence of psychic phenomena of non-local communication mind to mind which means that consciousness is not simply brain based that exists in a different way now but I've also read recently this book by Richard Wiseman called paranormality who believes there's no psychic phenomena you know busts every evidence for it you know and in his own way is quite convincing you know so for me it's a it's just makes it a very interesting time you know where you can approach anything and analytically rip it apart and find the weak spots but but maybe what what's missing from Penn & Teller and Richard Wiseman's understanding is the sense that intention is somehow a fundamental aspect of the universe you know so if your intention is to you know take something apart desecrate it ignore it you know and so on you can do all of that for sure you know but but but within there you kind of missed a settled key that actually makes a life worth having in a way well intention is aware and you can be aware of in a very tangible form in the art of stand-up comedy it's you cannot be thinking about something different say something else and have the people react to it they won't it won't work it's a weird thing you could have the joke worded correctly you could say it with the right intonation you get but if your mind isn't into it they can smell it it's the weirdest fucking thing in the world the connection that you have with an audience it could be an audience of 200 or it can be an audience of a thousand if you've reached that full connection it is like a giant mass hypnosis there is a some sort of a relationship that you have with these people and if somehow another something hits you you remember something or something bothers you or you think about an argument that you got in with your girlfriend or a bill you forgot to pay or any distraction that makes you feel in a negative way even if you're saying the words the same thing the audience will feel it they will feel it and they will back off you you can feel it you can feel sometimes it's legit man it's real you can't tell me it's not well I've always said that you know I do my best to write stand-up I sit down I do my best to put in the time to be there to make the writing happen and I do in the time when I perform enough so that I get on stage that I'm really comfortable and I relax but ultimately at the end of the day I'm not exactly sure how that shit is even coming out I don't know where it's coming from I don't know what's happening and when I'm on stage when I'm completely locked in I am as much a passenger as I am the person who steers it and as long as that works as long as I'm in that groove and the audience is in that groove the whole thing will go seamlessly but one little hiccup one little bad thought one little error one little stress point and everybody hops off the ride and waits and looks at you and goes you're gonna get this thing going again and yeah okay get back in okay we're okay you know what you're doing now yeah I know what I'm doing now they can tell and that's a psychic connection that's a legit tangible psychic connection that you when you're on stage you feel it from the crowd you feel like waves are positive and negative you literally feel the energy you can say that right you felt you have really good sense on stage and you've had jokes that bombed and you've had people angry at you you felt that right don't you feel it like a wave it affects you just like anything like it getting hit by a snowball you know yeah like if you got a bad joke on state if you got that's the worst have you had a bad joke on stage but and it would hit before you were like having a great day after that you're having the worst day ever yes I got hit in the face with this Nova your life is the exact same life literally none of the hard details have changed and yeah you feel fucking loser you know because these people have let you know you have not given us what we want yeah is this weird sort of an exchange that's going on hypnosis and trance or things that are operating like much of the time you know have you ever watched a massive doses show yeah I did watch my college ones here oh wow thanks Ari they used to have them all the time in Boston at the there's a place called the comedy connection every week they had this guy Frank Santos who would do a hypnotist comedy show that seemed like bullshit until you saw it a few times and when you saw it a few times you would realize oh my god these people are really fucking under it's so weird and not everybody he would know he would go after the people that weren't need to look at him go okay you got off the stage and he pulled the people off the stage but the people that were up there for whatever reason he found their their their hack code he got into there you know I tend to look at most of our you know politicians and you know news anchors is kind of Illuminati sorcerers who use a trance to keep people in a lowered state of consciousness loaded state of suggestibility Illuminati I hate black wizards he got a rap he got robbed by a black wizard the guy dressed up like a wizard put a gun in his chest sort of guy had a fake beard on it so he called him black wizard and it sucks man there's this guy at my Starbucks and I feel so bad for him because he totally reminds me of him the guy that robbed me and every time I fucking walk in there I'm just like damn I'm fucking totally just buying this guy more than like I normally would I somebody like back though I'm like waiting in line and I was that guy doing like a dog that used to bite you yeah exactly and he I've caught eyes with him like three times that feels so fucking bad about that I might have to switch Starbucks because of it just switch Starbucks yeah I just did it just you know why do you man yeah but then he's like he's kicking me out of the Starbucks you know what if it's him - you know the idea that you somehow another manifested that is where things get really spooky you know the people that believe that you manifest every single action in your life and that you have some sort of really I would think that really you it's more like the I'm like the Vedanta perspective of the basically there's like it's singular consciousness you know we're kind of like you know we're part of the projection okay what is the way if that is the case how can I avoid some horrible bullshit in my life I just have to do the right thing and be super nice and always going a positive direction and like I'm starting to think if you can't avoid it just ignore it oh it's what's the bullshit that you can't ignore oh well just some like like life and death people for whatever for whatever reason right now in all my life for whatever reason right now at the last year to two years in my life have been the most psychotic and crazy but yet I've also been possibly the most success please pause please the most successful cause please he's been dating porn stars okay what the fuck man alright I'm saying I also wanna say I'm dog fucking die I've also got mugged by a gun I've also fucking had a million other things that lately that has been happening that in my whole life never has my life has been boring as rugged you know and now I'm having like horrible things happen to me at the same time as I'm having like the best time in my life well you know but maybe that maybe you there's something wrong in the formula of how you're interacting with the grid maybe there's something wrong what if you had to get forget it forget forget your life put it away right you're not even you if you had a lot of people that's other governments there's money not hopefully not one of my friends I've got out please hold please if you were not you okay forget about the emotional attachments you have you all day all your issues how would you fix you what would you you say you know the one thing that we would like to correct about Brian would be X what would it be what's the number one thing yeah if you if you could instead of working at something if you just correct something about your behavior the way you think about things or the way you look at the world or anything what would it be do not throw come on walls okay what if you just stop do I really don't I really I really don't like I never think you don't believe that any of my myself I don't have to feel like I have any flaws I don't overthink in my personal this is what I'm trying to get to this what I'm trying to get to I don't know if it's either/or I don't know if you look there's babies that are killed in drive-bys and when I hear about that I go well that doesn't how the fuck does that work what's going on there you know the baby have some negative thoughts then I think about it and I think about all the positive things that have happened in my life and and all the positive things that I know have manifested themselves through a certain type of thinking a certain ethic a certain way of looking at the world and I wonder if it is either or or if it's a combination of things you know I'm saying Daniel I tuned up for second choice we ever have is to like look at the bright side or the crappy side so why not just always look at the bright side yeah but you're looking at the end of civilization I was looking at you and your voodoo doll you're sort of I'm actually the Balinese stuff is just I've always been fascinated by Eastern art I think it's beautiful and I think it's amazing how cheap it is you could get like this amazing thing because it's haunted that's why because there's little kids that made it has all four year old kids made it look it's artwork man I loved it I have one of those things I'm not really into like you know I've I've bought paintings before and I don't kind of get a lot of what people are really into so there's so I was at a guy's house once and he had a picture on the wall and I go oh you can't make that and this guy goes oh no that's a better but that's like $30,000 and I went what the fuck are you talking about it looked like some painting on some ripped pieces of cardboard that were randomly stuck in a beautiful frame and I really thought that it was something that a kid did so I don't get that shit there needs to be a but here one that's just that kind of shit like gold buddhas but more of a corporate place that's just super cheap like that could be like dollars I want to buy a dragon mass but I want feathers I want to be cheap you know because like that kind of shit's popular everyone likes that kind of shit why don't they make it like a Walmart of that shit I also think that they should make cat food and dog food into one food they could probably easily do that I don't think they can I think they have different dietary needs they can all eat chicken right okay so put that on the list if you want to go stray cat all eat basil all right put chicken basil this guy's bright I brought a serious man in here he's a fucking New York Times best seller crazy you're talking nonsense about cat and dog food you lazy cunt I don't go out and buy the cat food buy the dog food stop fucking up the shit that's eating dog feeding my dog seat in the CAF you want it make you got a problem that you got attached ex-girlfriends you fuck this guy he gets a new relationship he's like oh my god we should get a kid and they go out and get a fucking dog and then the girls dump him and he's got a goddamn zoo it it's like watching lower Fanny I'm like Daddy Warbucks sorry man this is this is a serious cock ass but also it's also a comedy podcast the good news is we've had an excellent conversation I guarantee you a lot of people will buy your shit hey Joe I was at the comedy story and there's that there's that post that goes thing that has no fucking ghosts anywhere guy no I know but I'm so tired of do you do you believe in ghosts of course oh my god Joe I was I was sitting in the green room behind the main room we were all smoking hot doesn't know that ghosts are real I think I've collected so many incredible stories about ghosts really what do they do I mean a friend of mine I mean her friend's brother had had committed suicide and she was sleeping in the house where he had died and she had a dream that they were having sex and she woke up from the dream and the her covers were up and there was kind of like spirit figure over her and as soon as she began to open her eyes it dissipated there's no way that could have been a dream inside a dream yeah of course it could have been anything of course you know it's only I mean you know because there's no you know how are you gonna verify this type of thing what I've collected a whole number you know of anecdotes told to me by people and observing their you know their their state their their their their their their efforts to kind of understand it to fathom it my own experiences also I've had some more you know it's I think that there's no doubt that you know probably you know psychic energy collects in physical environments and when people are no longer there if they have a stake in that environment and they've not finished with their business in the world they they hang out you know or some piece of that the energy of regret and resentment or something some sort of a bad energy is enough to keep a residue I mean when my father died I mean he had a loft was full of his paintings and sculptures you know the last and he had a big freight elevator I was working with two guys bringing his stuff out as we're bringing out the last shipment of his sculptures down in the freight elevator suddenly the light bulb being just totally popped you know and again we were in darkness and you know we were all looking at I mean nobody touched it you know somehow that psychic energy that was that was constellated you know between us and and him you know cause this thing to happen or the light bulb I was Joe I was in the grave right right now like the phone call that you know I have to make today good to me you know there are certain things when you feel the synchronicity it's like it's like a click you know and you know it's like it's like you have an intuitive you know acceptance that you're being shown a little bit of like the fabric of space/time making a little bit of a ripple or something I was in the greenroom seriously with like eight people notices of the Comedy Store like the car if you didn't know for just FYI was syros nightclub and it was Bugsy Siegel's coming out in Hollywood and a lot of people allegedly were murdered there and every single person who has been there for more than you know X amount of years has some sort of a ghost story every one of the waitresses has something managers have something you know how much of it is psychosomatic how much of his suggestion how much other comics and and and I was sitting there with like eight other people where just smoking weed hanging out talking and suddenly the door sounded like somebody shot a gun through like it didn't feel like sound like somebody just shook it or kicked it it seemed way more powerful than that to the fact that I think everybody in the room kind of got down was like what the fuck was that and we all kind of got down like on the couches in the background as if we all thought for sure that was a gunshot right well they just let me stop right there yeah old-ass build you know it's important this is a building for the 1920s it's a fucking fault line right those building shift and every now and then they shift and they literally cracked and it'll make a noise I've been in the car when it makes noise okay it's I'm not saying that it wasn't a ghost no explanation is that I thought it was another comic and he's just like the secret like oh yeah we take this plunger and then we just hit it as hard as we can't make it what comedy secret I'm sorry my grandparents lived in a supposedly haunted house and I stayed there with them in in Newark New Jersey and it was on North ninth Street and there was a guy who actually died in the house and it's he was a guy who is renting a room there and he died and they they always thought that this house was haunted they Oh cause it kind of the house is always making noises but it's a fucking house that was built of like 1909 you know it's an old fucking house and when you're dealing the place like New Jersey that's moist all the time and it rains all the time and then it gets hot in the summer and cold in the winter wood is like you know it's an organic piece of you know construction it constricts it expands depending on the moisture in the air depending on being cold or hot and the car the old houses like that they make a lot of fucking noise it the creek there was people are just fucking places not a good or it's an old house man but I'm not completely averse the idea of ghosts but a lot of people that talk about ghosts are full shit well I just think if there is ghosts there would be an easy way to prove and we've talked about it before you just go to somebody that's like wife's got died in a rape and you go to his grave and just or her grave and just start humping her grave or something all that food you know if there was such things as ghosts ghosts would come out be like dude what the fuck you know maybe they wouldn't want to indulge you in your nonsense maybe you would hit the wrong oh come on if maybe look maybe it's not something that can easily be tuned in maybe it's like the Northern Lights like the idea of you know you can't capture the Northern Lights and put it in the fucking beam and blast it on Manhattan the Northern Lights or you know it's ethereal it's some sort of a thing that you know it moves and pulsates in the sky you know maybe that's what like a ghost is like a very minor version of that like it doesn't have a rhyme or reason for when it exists or doesn't exist but it it's just we don't understand those laws yet you know it's not the state's nature it's just that our understanding of natural law is limited by our by our mental conception by the type of science that we've constructed and so on are you convinced I mean what would you like when you look at like the evidence of ghosts and what not look at ghost shows if you look at go shows wait wait what evidence do we have any solid evidence ever that there is a ghost or just speculation almost entirely speculation there's no scientific evidence well that doesn't mean that they're not real because if you think about what a ghost is if a ghost is something that's not in this dimension it sort of Flitz in and out of it and how do you measure that I mean science is the you know everybody says well science says there are no ghosts or there's no scientific evidence of ghosts well science was not really designed to measure shit like ghosts science is designed to measure like how much does lead weigh you know what happens when a star goes supernova observable things when you get something like a ghost if a ghost was real and it's an incredibly rare phenomenon that depended on some really exotic conditions how the fuck you gonna measure I'm giving the offer if there's any ghost listening they can fucking rate me tonight and I could just rape my ass all day long with those dicks and if it happens I'll let you know I got news for you if they're gonna come here from another there's like decent and interesting evidence around a reincarnation really there's a book what's his name Ian Stephens was a professor at University of Virginia order like 25 hundred page book called where biology and reincarnation intersect and he found all around the world there were children who had spontaneous recall of past lives and often very specific like in India they would be like well you know I was I lived in this town I'm my wife had this name I had two kids so in a number of cases he found these kids and he went back to the towns that they talked about and and they found this family and established that there had been this this connection and and the sense of familiarity no no genetic no genetic line no genetic line and sometimes the kids would even have like a pronounced birthmark like a birthmark on the neck or something and it would turn out that the previous you know incarnation perhaps had died of a wound to the neck and a fight or something like that is it possible that the connection is an abstract one that you know that they haven't met it yet but that yet there's not a balanced value to learn experiences that are transferred through genetics like instincts and that perhaps some instincts that we have are really like things go wrong you learn from them that's why you're afraid of cats I mean kids are afraid of moms or seven-year-old kids suddenly out of nowhere saying you know I I have a wife and a grow I have two kids I need to see them again this is but this is my point isn't it possible I mean isn't it possible that somehow or another that there is a memory that through whatever a mutation or whatever extreme condition or weird circumstance as far as like physical biology becomes a more potent one and that this as it is transferred through through generations awakens this memory awakens this this this experience that someone who shared these genetic so so many generations ago actually did have then all sudden for whatever I don't think there's any idea that that you know genetic material could could hold memory like that well what about memes what do i blurt about the idea that even racism can be transferred genetically I mean that's a really kind of a widely considered idea almost unprovable but I mean sitting by a stream scientists I think like a lot of those those those ideas about all these things being heritage by the genetics being this kind of master molecule or actually being kind of challenged right now by the emerging biology of epigenetics which is recognizing that you know awareness actually begins at the boundary of the cell where our chemical signals are exchanged there's a kind of cognitive process that happens even at the permeable boundary of the cell as some signals are allowed in and some are ignored or rejected and that what's allowed in actually then influences how the genetic material expresses itself and reproduces itself but again it actually it's not so much the genetic material is the master molecule it's more as if the whole cell is a unit of cognition awareness this is very much thinking of people like Varella but is this a theory or they have done okay but they haven't done it but everything was accounting I mean this is you know you look at the biologist Bruce Lipton he's a book called biology beyond belief really looking at how you know consciousness and awareness begin even at our cellular level and how that in itself influences and in Flex how the genetic material expresses itself that the genes are not master molecules the whole idea of it it's so fascinating the idea of you know I mean what what instincts I mean where where do instincts come from I mean is it all from one initial source you know stay away from fire you get scared when you see snakes I mean these are all learned impressions in in our material the material that makes human beings or certain things that you show people and children when they're really young have certain fears and you know notions of the boogeyman and the you know the monster that lives in the woods and the things in the dark and a lot of these are imprinted from being killed by Jaguars from some you know proto hominid that lived five thousand year or five million years ago and it killed by Jaguars and those those instincts are still tingling in the in the background noise of our minds possible that could also be explained you ever gonna say like Rupert Sheldrake's ideas or like more energetic feel yeah when their parents exactly home so maybe there was this species encounter that was like a near-death encounter for Humanity and it left this orphanage attic field of fear and terror around the snake or around the Jaguar or something like that yeah well we are certainly moving I mean if I had to guess into some sort of a state where that becomes more and more aware don't you agree what becomes one more aware the state that of this interconnectedness this Morpho genetic field this idea that you know that we are living in sort of a complex meshwork of biological life and natural natural laws and physics and space and radiation and all of it together combined but and it's sort of enough people are realizing it now like way more than ever before I mean when I was a kid there was none of this talk there was nothing along these lines yeah it's extraordinary and maybe that is pointing towards the kind next phase of you know evolution as a species I mean do you think it's technology that's gonna do that well I think we have to look at technology itself as an aspect of the evolution of consciousness you know that actually like we're tool using and tool making species we make a new tool and then we look at the tool or the instrument we've made and it reflects us back at ourselves and then it gives us new metaphors for understanding ourselves then it allows us to make another more you know advanced tool then that creates a whole new set of metaphors so now we've gotten to the point in our tool creation and tool using where this feedback loop is happening faster and faster so we're having we're but it's still you know a tool is a projection of our consciousness of our thought into the material realm which then gives us information about ourselves which then leads us to create another tool which also advances and involves our consciousness in that process do you ever get to the point where you you you get upset that you have a connection with these these items these technological items like phones or do not regret it ever or do you just accept it and enjoy it like like well I think it's very fascinating it's also as we've been part of what we were doing is reality sandwiches bringing people down to work with indigenous shamans and elders so recently went down another columbia and worked with these Kogi guys from the mountains in Colombia and when we hung out with them we were in a place without any electricity for eight days so no phone no computer and after like a day and a half I was like what did I want all that stuff for again like this is so much nicer you know suddenly you can see the stars you know you're at night you're like light a fire then the fire goes out you go to sleep you wake up at dawn I mean you know I think that actually we may find that we've gone way too far on this technological path that we thought that we you know we've had a kind of in a sense the religious belief of modern society is linear technological progress leading to some kind of singularity or transformation that we may actually back up from that and be like well wait a second where is this stuff leading to I mean actually I have more plastics in my tissues you know my eyes are going bad from looking at these tiny screens you know why is life constantly mediated by glowing rectangular screens anyway that actually we might want to you know retract from this technological path and and develop in a different direction which doesn't mean rejecting technology it's more about mastering our projections rather than rather than feeling that we always have to get a meshed in them and then and then move in that direction is it sort of like riding a bike too fast and going downhill and you go oh fuck it's good to ride this bike but I've gotten kind of away from my own biological control of this situation well that's certainly what's happened to us as a species I mean you know in every level we've been seduced by our technological production projections in a sense we've lost our grounding on the planet whatever you ever consider the idea that wins some sort of a weird symbiotic relationship or it's our job as the host to create this environment where are the parasite which is technology this new life-form that we've created to exist and then ultimately discard us because it is the next stage of not organic life but of consciousness and that consciousness the next stage of consciousness will be artificial consciousness created by this this consciousness that was created by biological life and that we are only here to usher in the next stage and that next stage is an electronic form a stage that doesn't have emotions or nonsense or any of this shit it's not the way I look at it we don't well we don't we don't know we have no and we have no reason at this point to really believe that you know and artificial intelligence can become conscious in the way we are I mean machines may have you know a form I mean everything we have a form of sentience but but but you know we may still have a very important you know role if we're in our proper state you know in the cosmic unfolding but should we I mean if we are a step along the way what who's to say that that step eventually continues along a biological train maybe it really is truly our destiny to create some sort of an artificial life that's not burdened down by our a monkey DNA and all the instincts that we needed to evolve to this point with the curiosity that would allow us to make something as crazy as artificial intelligence and computers maybe we're just the carriers maybe were the carriers of the disease that eventually takes off and I guess part of what I would suggest to you is that you know part of our opportunity right now is to become co-creative with the evolutionary process and that in a way means that we have to step into a much more responsible and mature role where we actually become participants and and in a way we still kind of enjoy the spectacle of our own alienation and our own potential destruction so we kind of enjoy kind of like elaborating these sort of futuristic mythologies of how our technology is going to overwhelm us or devour us I mean that might be the case but all we really know at this point is that we have will we have intelligence we have consciousness and we're not using it very well so the first thing I would think that we would want to try to do is use it very very effectively to see what type of better situation we can rapidly create you know rather than fobbing off our responsibilities onto oh there's gonna be this technological thing or it's too late we fucked the planet or there's some new-age psychic children coming along all that stuff to me is just bullshit as dodges that basically is other ways that we're avoiding taking full responsibility for the planetary situation that we as a species have created which is for me is really the only way we're gonna possibly create a better world in the time that we have before things go to hell I do agree that as a person who's a big proponent of teen people you know I definitely advocate the idea of us figuring out what the fuck we are doing and making it better for all of us and our relationship with the planet but to me that doesn't seem like you're following that off but considering the possibility that we are merely here as many other parasites and hosts are and in this world and you look at like grasshoppers where there's they're infected by aquatic worms and the aquatic worms trick the grasshopper into jumping into water and the grasshopper drowns but the worm can be born I personally think that we actually are infected but by a parasitical agency and I would say that agency is something like the Dominator Empire complex the the sense that we have of separation from nature the sense that we have the right to you know annihilate ecosystems dominate ecosystems control other people the whole the whole trip of Empire the slavery and there's still tons of slavery around the world domination of women that that's that's the parasite that's eating us alive right now and that's where you know if we can go through our inner initiative process we can we can begin to you know find the antidote or the cure to that but it's not about you know from my perspective like giving it up to technology you know as an amazing thing it's more like reclaiming our human capacity and for me that that's really where the knowledge of the indigenous people is not you know folktale it's not silly it's not worthless it's actually something that that you know those of us who care about you know seeking to you know move into an evolutionary you know framework you know it's it they have they have tools and gifts for us and that's why part of what I've been trying to do over the last couple lot of my work but but now in a different way is build bridges to through the indigenous people and their knowledge systems you know so I'm working now with the Kogi in Colombia and also the Sequoia from Ecuador what I meant by that was not that it has to be it almost like when I when I when I look at the relationship that we have with with technology and I look at the relationship that different parasites and different hosts have it's as as a consideration you have to think about the fact that our society is completely obsessed with pushing innovation we're completely obsessed and I often look at the dominator culture what you describe and I say well you know you're right I mean that is a huge fucking problem maybe war in the domination of other countries and battling for resources but what do you say to people that say that there's no way you can have a society that that reaches this particular height this fast without that as a byproduct and that in fact the reason why people push so hard to innovate and to create new things and conquer new new new new boundaries both scientifically and socially is that it's all almost a byproduct of this desire to innovate and create and produce this next thing and that this is all a part of us creating some artificial things some intelligent things I think we have to we have to we have to break the trance of Technology which is not to say that we reject technology but we have to break that trance that's now you know this is this linear technological progress is necessarily you know bringing us to something super amazing and and for me that the shift in the future is more to a kind of psycho technical phase of development but by that I mean that you know if you do you know if you've had the DMT and the ayahuasca experiences the yoga experiences and so on you recognize they're at these vast dimensions you know within the psyche that are basically unknown continents and and in a sense that for me is where the action is gonna lie for us in the future you know as well as potentially exploring other planets other solar systems and all this stuff but but at the moment we really more need to get control of our thought projections and the only way to do that is to undergo an initiative process that involves you know kind of getting into our unconscious patterns initiatory process mm-hmm I don't know what do you mean yeah well I mean like you know hanging you know fasting or hanging by your pecks for six days or taking ayahuasca you know for a couple weeks until you know you're you're you're so nauseous that you can't believe it but still vision the insights keep coming up and they begin to heal you of your you know pathetic humanists well you save the setting humanist but then you are you are you completely averse to the idea that we are just here to develop something else which I mean we obviously are just a step along the way and we'll be unrecognizable a few million years I think that what we're here to develop is you know integrity consciousness and willpower and once we develop that then we can think about what else we may develop at the moment we don't have that we just think we do do you feel happy do you feel happy that you were and I believe you are one of the people that's sort of an agent of this sort of I believe right now currently we're in a very unusual age of enlightenment and I think that the the the level of enlightenment that we've achieved culturally over the last year certainly not everybody not last year last decade certainly not over everybody but generally has been more than anything that I could ever remember in my lifetime and people like you that are pushing these ideas and people like you that are trying to challenge the way people view things and the standard standard predetermined patterns of behavior we seem to have come to accept you're a part of moving this thing along these kind of discussions are part of moving this thing along where people in college or people who are getting their first jobs people are starting their own first businesses or stopping and they're they're reconsidering the direction that they move forward and what their motives are and whether or not they're just caught up in momentum yeah man I feel extremely humble and lucky do you feel obligated yes I feel tremendous obligation and responsibility to do what I can to help out you know so what is there a way to stop this what is the number one problem that we have if we have a urine for destruction and we're constantly moving in number one we problem that we have is that consciousness and subjectivity are mass produced by a system that is basically keeping us in a state of you know passivity and ignorance is that system a natural system is that system there because like everything else like the way alpha wolves treat beta wolves that that system is almost set up in place so that there is an antagonist sure it's it I see it as an evolutionary process and just as like you know the the embryo has to push against the shell and finally break through you know or doesn't you know we were inspired by antagonists you you do Ali needed Frazier absolutely you know I mean and and and you know we definitely have a you know a powerful you know military-industrial corporate empire complex that has sunk its roots into our subconscious processes and in our psychology and it was going to require requires a lot of discipline effort to recognize how it is how it is operating through us on so many different levels and then begin to turn it around from within that's the facts bitches that's about it that's all you're gonna absorb this awesome conversation thank you very much for coming over here but everything that I thought it would be plus more if anybody needs to get a hold of you or check out your stuff what should they do and what to do what did you hand me here okay okay I'll give you a quick rundown okay Valverde ed is our social network Valle Verdun we have the evolvers social movement we have about 50 groups around the world now mostly in the US who beat up every month we do consciousness-raising we create a theme that could be the future of psychedelics it could be extraterrestrials it could be sustainability or permaculture we use those as both gathering points for people raise consciousness and learn but then also Nexus points for communities to build how long have you been doing involve er that's about a it's been about three years you emailed me about this a long time ago was first time but I'm so overwhelmed by so it's like a Facebook kind of it's a way for you know it's a way for a kind of global community that's trying to understand this new paradigm and move into it to reach out to each other and then self-organized has anybody gank my name my screen name can I get my screen beautiful and then we have a web magazine reality sandwich reality Sam we're doing com.com we're doing live webinars we just did one on shamanism practices with Alberto Gallardo so that's Evolver intensives calm and now we're doing a line of books that include this book here hos uruguay Lass's book manifesto for the newest fear which is about this idea of a transition from the biosphere to the newest fear books and everything like that for sure books so Evolver editions calm and there's probably some other stuff when unifier earth calm is this idea for this December 21st 2012 global event and people can actually sign up there's a resource map what is that again this idea to use a circle what is the name of the site unifier earth calm unified unified earth calm and also if you're into books breaking over the head was how I was introduced to Daniel it's a great book and I read half of Quetzalcoatl I am a fucking a DD retard though and I put it down I'll pick it up again now that we've had such an awesome conversation Daniel Pinchbeck on Twitter please follow him on Twitter along with following read
