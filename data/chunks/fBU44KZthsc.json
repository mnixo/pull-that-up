hello freak bitches I always think any mama sagen esque sensor this so imagine we are the only civilization in the galaxy what a tremendous responsibility there is on us imagine what that knowledge should do to our political processes the way that we think about ourselves the way that we get on together imagine how ridiculous it is to divide our little world up into countries and another little war every now and again and point nuclear missiles at each other if in fact there's nowhere else in the Milky Way galaxy where anybody thinks anybody can look at the styles and think about and have these conversations what a ridiculous way to behave so I think the cosmology is gives a perspective which is not that doesn't necessarily need to be humbling it is humbling that's perhaps a good thing but it doesn't it you don't need to be depressed about it it could be quite elating you say well with what we are according to the evidence and the data at the moment is almost indescribable especial our our our tiny 'no sir potential uniqueness our insignificance in a cosmic scale actually makes us special because we're the only place and so these these ideas are worth pursuing i think because they make you think about these issues it doesn't it also point to our ego that we think that our biological process is any more important than the exploding Suns that are required to create carbon life in the first place or or any of the processes of the universe dance that i think is that you're right in a in a signal in a completely logical sense we're no more important or less important than the stars themselves you're right with very natural objects but I would counter by saying that people look for meaning in the universe like to look for meaning it's this one thing that we've done since we began to look at the Stars the universe means something to me doesn't it it does meaning exists because it means something to us so we know that it would be ridiculous to say the universe is meaningless it means something in mind well we have families we have loved ones I said so the fact that that meaning might be emergent it might appear from the laws of nature and it is almost certainly transient unless we build these self-replicating machines we weren't we're not going to last forever as a civilization probably so that to me that doesn't in any way water down the significance of it so I think again cosmology can be can be a powerful aid to philosophical thoughts in this sense because we have to accept that there's meaning in the universe because it means something to us I don't see why it has to be eternal I don't see why their meaning doesn't imply purpose I don't think any purpose to the universe I don't see any point to our existence but the fact that we exist at all is worth celebrating you don't need to add anything else in fact you almost deep it's familiar devalue it why would you this is remarkable we emerged single-celled organisms probably before that we emerged some chemical reactions in in hydrothermal vents probably down in the deep primordial oceans of ancient earth and over 3.8 billion years we've come to the point where we can sit and think about the Stars and have conversations like this is that not enough why does it have to be a point there isn't a point I don't need to point to that but it's worth celebrating because you don't think about it yeah it's out of sight out of mind you don't have to look at it it's when you look at it you know it's like if you have to take a shit you know that's one thing I can't wait to take a shit and you get on that toilet comes up but if you had a stuff that shit back if you had a reach in there with rubber gloves on and just pack your own ass repack it that might be one of the worst things you could ever do like taking a shit right it's amazing when you hold it in for just a little bit not a long time no lecture extra 20 minutes and you get on that toilet just feel those logs just fucking barreling down the river boom-boom-boom-boom I went to I took a dump at the mall the other day I've been trying to eat healthier eating more greens and stuff so it came out like it's very earthy right it wasn't anything horrible it just smelled and I flushed and then the guy came in to clean the restroom and started choking and he just hear him like trying to clean up and then he just go at the end he just goes he was in there about two minutes he goes it's highlight of my life like you scored on he scored on fucking shit in a bathroom that guy's got to go in there right after you post well there's nothing worse than when you have to shit really bad and the only option is a port-a-potty and you're at a concert and there's 20 people behind you and there's a long-ass line and you go and then you plop down and you're shitting on other people's shit that is on top of other people's shit which is on other people's shit which is all in Smurf juice and you just drop it logs on top of pre-existing logs and just gagging more meanwhile the bands playing your favorite here did you I saw this online they had a thing about the porta-potties like the whole point of them is you're supposed to close the lid and then that will take the scent out up through this like funnel like this tube and release the scent up there but the reason porta potti smells so bad is because everyone just leaves the lid up no one wants to touch it oh yeah bullshit it stinks it's a fucking confined space you're shitting in a phone booth it's not going anywhere that smells everywhere think as a society we could try it give it a shot you know I always say movies movies are like kids you know people say do you have a favorite fuck yeah but I'm not gonna tell you you know like that's it's the same thing with kids like every parent I don't care give a shit what they say I love them all equally no you don't cuz some kids are just assholes if you can't possibly you know and some of them are screw-ups in life and you have children no I doubt yeah you can kind of love them all equally because I think when kids go out to the mall yeah it's kind of it's so there's a part of it that's your fault that's the thing that you feel guilty you're saying Nields compensates for for the like for the Lord raises the love because you feel that they need more love because you screwed them up you're responsible for their being that dog that killed one of my other dogs I know I love the dog that she killed but I loved her just as much and it was very sad I mean obviously I should have loved the dog that got killed more because she wasn't a cunt she wasn't an asshole that was you know out there killing the other dogs but this this dog was a sweetie and I picked her up at the pound and she lived at the pass she was in one of those no-kill shelters for like eight months and when I was young man I had a real problem in that it's hard to talk about I guess where I felt like I felt I always had this this need to help strays and I think I had this need to help strays because I felt like a stray and when I would see a dog in a pound or a clicker I bought a cat from a fucking pet store because it hissed at me you know except for always poor fucking cat like scared of me I'm not you ever scared me I loved you and I felt that way about this dog this poor dog used to call her squeaky cuz when I picked her up she couldn't even talk she couldn't bark cuz she had barked so much so often in this pound that her voice was gone so when she was barking in the pound she'd be like it was like this squeaky noise and I was like what the fuck is wrong with her voice and I realized oh my god she's barking all day and she doesn't have a voice anymore and then when I took her home and took care of her she eventually got her voice back and she barked like a normal dog but that dog fucking loved people man she loved people she was so happy to be out of that shit but she didn't like other dogs cuz if other dogs came near her she felt like it was a competition for love like if you came near another dog that other dog was gonna get that love so she would get upset at that dog for stealing love from her and she would try to attack it so I loved her equally even though she was an idiot you know she but it wasn't her fault that she was an idiot you know it would I would I realized from then on I would never get a dog that's not a puppy that you got a raise them from the time they're puppies because then you don't have any there are any phobias or weirdness and you get a chance to to raise them around people and raise them around other dogs and socialize them and it's an important aspect of humans just like it's an important aspect of any other animal that's in our culture so you know I you can love your fucking shitty kids just as much as you love your good kids because it's partly your fault that their shitty
