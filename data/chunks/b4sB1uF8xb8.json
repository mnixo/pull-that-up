the girag and experience when I lived in New York I had a friend who one of his friends knew the guy's a fucking cockeyed connection but it was there was they were all in music business like rock and roll guys like one of them was in this band and he knew a dude who somehow or another knew someone who bought Jackie Gleason's old home and Jackie Gleason this is the story Jackie Gleason is obviously third-hand could be total horsham that's it the story was and it's a fun story the Jackie Gleason was drinking with Nixon and him and Nixon were buddies and that you know they're talking football and throwing back some fucking jack and cokes and Nixon's like you want to see a fucking UFO so they get an Air Force One and they flied some military base where they've got a crashed flying saucer and Jackie Gleason from then on becomes a crazy UFO believer and Jackie Gleason has this backyard in upstate New York and he has a fake UFO designed and built in his driveway to replicate the thing that he saw he hires a bunch of people to try to recreate something he puts it together in his head sort of like a crime sketch like he would try to enact it I wasn't one life story that's the funny we know that I was do you believe it I don't know I would like to find my wife did fuck up my computer it's not working luckily I got back up yeah your BMX pillar sins yeah you're drunk why don't you get this Laurie McClure why don't you get that chemical that you could just put on your computer I we good idea um all right buddy but I don't know if Jackie Gleason really did once you google it find out did Jackie Gleason really order every really any one of our phones was Jackie Gleason into UFOs it'll say well Joe Rogan once said i spread my own fucking like that story relation I like that story I'll make up a story not even realize I made it up put it out there and then I'll find it on Wikipedia and i'll use it as a reference to prove when i tell the story again trip to the alien more are they wow so this is a real rumor to the moon alice there was a time you can play strays scroll that down stop go back collaborate listen stop right there you're fucking drunk of shit dude there was another size jacking extremely serious armchair UFO researcher and prided himself on a huge collection of UFO related books which numbered into the thousands you see I call bullshit you know why I doubt there's thousands of books written as UFOs backup what more could you say like oh you know and then he saw like to as soon as a new title came out even in Europe of the UK Jackie had a copy hmm well I don't know if it's true um but that was the story that this guy told me about that story it's a dope story like this friend well if that's true the Jackie Lee Shin really was some sort of a crazy UFO fanatic and that that's the motor anymore imagine if it's fucking true oh it's all true what a beautiful thing it would be if they really did have like a hangar 18 you know what I want when we're old and we're sitting on the cove drinking our drink looking at the water just meaning you gray old silver bags and someone's gonna go you know what fucking Jackie Gleason went to area 51 and saw that shit I wonder oh it's gonna happen yeah I wonder I wonder it will happen I wonder if they really do have something I mean that would be I would wish one person who was lit legitimately intelligent who was dying which spill the beans I wish every dude that spills the beans like man you fucking weirdo it's just I'm not my by watch ivan with my one thing is how impossible would it be to keep a secret today it would be too impossible you know one person would say so I don't agree with that because as they look they kept a secret when they were taking the Manhattan Project but that was a different year what one thing I will say one thing I will say is maybe those movies and and and TV shows and leaks and everyone because we're all like oh yeah area 51 of course to the aliens like maybe that's you know maybe that's part of it well look we know that secrets can be kept secrets totally can be kept because we didn't find out about the Gulf of Tonkin until like way way late like there were some people involved in the gulf of tonkin incident when did it become yes from nails people look 30 years 40 years secrets can be kept yeah but nowadays it's it's pretty tipsy Chris could be kept up wouldn't the most important secret be we found aliens that would be like one of the biggest secrets you would ever want to keep like the last thing you want is these motherfuckers just freaking out because there's aliens I like the movies though it's just a given like yeah well we just got the spaceships from the area 51 yeah done how many movies are that though a lot most movies when they try to depict what it would be like if we were attacked it's fucking terrible I like the fact that we started off with saving democracy and well you got drunk along the way and so chip into alien X our standard areas whats wrong bitch huh when are you looking for him come on you and Dean Cain fucking get up he's got that show on spike I'll do it as a girl ever squirted on you before are you reading my brain are you part of the MSA is this is this what's hot now it's immoral ng walk the NSA has given you all my information happen recently all right I love you guys wow I
