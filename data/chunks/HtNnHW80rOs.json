the Joe Rogan experience will is the man behind anatomy of the fighter if you ever seen any of those videos like particularly the most famous one was when Conor McGregor threw that dolly at the bus with khabib nurmagomedov was on it and it became a huge part of the promotion which I thought was weird that it was this shameful act right that he did that I mean really awful cut a bunch of innocent people that were on the bus but they used it over and over and over again that was your foot yes a lot of people didn't even know including me no one did you know I was telling a friend other day what's funny no one has ever heard this but when it happened I show khabib at the back of the bus because he was had a smile on his face and I showed him and everybody else on the bus that I actually caught kind of doing it because they didn't really know it was Connor right so I remember could be looked at the footage I was holding the camera and he was like brother you could get paid from this it's like brother this is worth $100,000 he looked at his manager ollie a shout-out to huffy and he was like get just get him give him some money he deserves this and then I gave it to the UFC to use for embed it and I thought it was that was just sit and they promoted the fight with it I was like damn I should have just leaned my head to the right and got hit by the dolly so I not have to be doing it you know GoFundMe isn't shit this is the thing that drives me crazy save you believe something right and then if you go online and you read something else and that something else is contrary to what you believe and you start believing in that something else somehow another that's bad this is one of the great arguments against censorship is like you have to figure out what the fuck makes sense the only way to figure out what makes sense is to read all kinds of things to engage with all kinds of content the idea that we're supposed to protect people because we know what's right we know it's correct well who are you let me let me talk to you if you think you know what's correct you're the arbiter of free speech or the arbiter of logical discourse and in common sense in this world let me ask you things let me talk to you let me get to the heart of how you feel how do you feel about trans kids transitioning they're six how do you feel about all sorts of crazy weird things that have just been propped up as logical and make sense how do you how do you feel about war how do you feel about abortion how do you feel about ghosts how are you who are you and you just you just get to choose whether or not someone lien or information that comes to them leans left or right I think it's preposterous I I just think it's incredibly dangerous because you have to have an unbelievably complex and nuanced perspective in order to be able to dictate what makes or does not make sense and you you have to have a lot of information at your disposal you have to have a lot if you're talking about something like Venezuela let's look at that for example look at what you know and then look what you see in what you would call progressive left-wing media that to your knowledge is incorrect and it's basically propaganda points that's being redistributed in this way that is palatable now imagine if the people decide that you abbi Martin are somehow another part of some right-wing conspiracy now and they they're gonna censor your voice and censor Europe because it doesn't fit in to this narrative that they're but because you need so much information to be like to really understand what's happening in this one part of South America the word right exactly it's so complex well they treat us like children and they think that we're not smart enough to actually discern what is information that we need and I mean I want the Russian perspective I want the Venezuelan perspective I want the Chinese perspective because I feel like we're smart enough to really determine our own reality based on all the available information well this is where we're fucked is that we don't have a reliable independent source that's not filled with hyperbole and emotion and and and dunking on people and screaming and insulting and I want someone who can break things down logically and clearly with no ideological Bend they are you're not leaning left you're not leaning right what where is that and why doesn't that exist I think it's because it's not necessarily human and and you know people have opinions and they have biases and either that couch those biases and like these think tanks and pretend like they're these unbiased journalists or they just kind of wear it on their sleeve like I do with Empire files and media routes which is my you know my news organization that I do with my brother Robbie but I mean we try to lay it out but we also don't hide where we're coming I almost appreciate that more than then a lot of these journalists so-called journalists who are really kind of stenographers who pretend like they are unbiased and they're like I'm just giving it to you straight and and at the end of the day they're they're really not they're trying to tow a line and they're trying to push a certain perspective but it's just not obvious yeah that guy in San Diego I was telling you about that a man threw sandals at me this weekend at my show yeah what happened is I called him sandal Steve so this is the most there's two embarrassing parts of this story for this man the show the sunday show was fucking phenomenal and San Diego was so fucking dope we

you write that you shouldn't jerk off yeah never well there's a calculation you have a jerk-off algorithm yeah there's a jerk-off algorithm it's created by the Tao the Taoists sexology and I think it's your age times to know your age divided by two times when I draw I forget what it is it's in my book I can't remember it but I got it from the towel right which is why I don't have it memorized time point eight times point two things age times point two and then they tell you how many days right so at my age I'm 38 now my age it's about seven and a half days between ejaculation to mean to maintain Who I am really yeah and damn yes so a man's strength is his balls frankness right every time you deplete yourself you're not the same man anymore you lose your superpowers now when you lose
