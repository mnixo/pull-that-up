the Joe Rogan experience now one thing that exists now that really didn't exist when Obama was running for president is the impact of social media it's just tenfold what it used to be but with that also comes this reality that we're living in right now where there's only a few companies that are controlling the discourse in this country yeah I mean you really have essentially a Facebook Google YouTube Twitter and Facebook owns Instagram that's right and there's you know a couple other small ones but that's the bulk of our discourse yeah what concern do you have about these private companies controlling the vast majority of communication between people and social media yeah it's extremely dangerous it's extremely dangerous when you think about it and there's a few things there's gosh with Facebook and Google for that matter you know they they can set their algorithms Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and set his algorithm to control what information is coming across our newsfeed in Facebook what are the stories that we're seeing Instagram same thing with Google they can control when you punch in something what are the first stories that you're gonna see on the first page that pops up when you think about that kind of power of influence that it has on the American people literally being held within the hands of a couple of people unchecked and without oversight or transparency it's incredibly dangerous let's talk about free speech there's just been news recently about Facebook banning certain individuals from having Facebook accounts because of their speech they disagree with the speech that they're they're using are the things that they're talking about ideas that they're pushing forward unchecked First Amendment rights going completely out the window and the argument is they don't apply because it's a private company right yes but they're trying to get the best of both worlds the fact that that you know they're claiming to say hey this is a free space for open communication for everyone right well the same time going and saying actually you know what Joe I don't like what you're saying about this so we're gonna ban you and whoever your friends are from from this conversation I think that's that's a big problem it undermines it undermines our First Amendment rights and you look at privacy the privacy concerns of all the information that they're collecting and facebook from us all the information that they're collecting from us with Google and how they're monetizing that and selling or sharing that information with other people with really without our our knowledge or agreement are you you're a fully sober guy yeah did you suddenly a not sober guy yeah I was a yeah we a mess I mentally I felt like a mess I mean I wasn't I never killed anybody or anything but I was a I'm an alcoholic yeah I shit in the girl's shoe and yeah girl shoe what would she do to you nothing just invited me to stay at her house I don't remember doing it I was in a black but yeah I was all fucked up and then I woke up and I had to piss so bad I just woke up in a the bed and I was like I got a pen I was like let me I don't know where I am I actually had a flight I had a cross I was going to the Seattle Comedy Competition do you ever do that no it was like it took a month long competition Watts and yeah and they call it Seattle but it's like actually all over Washington State it's like a you drive like three hours and night it's pretty crazy really yeah but I had to like be there the next day for a month I'd like a 10:00 a.m. flight and I woke up at like nine twenty in the morning and this girl's bed and I was like I gotta get the hell out of here but first I gotta piss is if I piss in this woman's bed it's gonna be it's gonna be horrible so I ran to the bathroom and found the bathroom pissed for like a half hour you know those and I'm trying to like put my shit to get my I'm all fucked up and then I came out into like her living room and her table had been like smashed like a Chris Farley fucking table book and you're that feeling when you're fucked up we would look at something and you're like that was definitely me I can just feel like I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for that and then I was like I gotta go find my clothes so I went back into her room and on the way there I saw like kind of like footprints of poo and then I came in and she had a high-top Nike sneaker that just had like a yeah and there was some little pieces around and then there was like a big puddle of urine Tilly I didn't just because you never just shit so I like pissed and shit but I got it in her sneaker like purpose well I think I mean I was in a blackout so but I think what happened was I thought it was a toilet because that's not like my sense of humor I'm not like I've never been like I take a shit places so I think I just saw a cylinder well if it's dark it looks it's black and it's a hole how big is her fucking shoes yeah real big feet it was it was a big woman no so I shit in there and then what did went out did you lose contact with her after this no sevens I was like I gotta get out of here cuz I gotta go catch this flight so I took my sock and put it on like a like a puppet like a hand puppet a sock puppet and just kind of pick it up that way and then turn the sock inside out right which like almost like a shit in a sock and threw that away and I tried to wipe up as much of the she asleep no no they're gone oh my god I thought it's like 9:30 in the morning I thought I just went so crazy they all fled their own home so then I get in the cab to go to the airport missing my flight and I text the girl and I was like I am so so I want to kill myself like I can never do you tell her that I should know well I figured she knew so she wrote back it's okay it was it was crazy crazy night it was fun or whatever and I was like man this girl must fucking party like she's just like okay with me shitting this woman's wild historically there's been bears I mean he's got they've got like 40 or 50 bears in this little confined space I mean there's nothing there's no more no greater abomination of nature than I can imagine than a solitary largely solitary animal sort that confined to a bunch of them of the speed and then historically they have ripped each other apart and I actually know them into marine lens history deeper than I can you get to hear the full spectrum of some of the things that happen and bear in mind in its port to note it was a different time different times different things happen and that's just that was the that was that was the norm it's it's you know starkly contrasting time to when Marineland started so but the stories are like really it's jaw-dropping it's really jaw-dropping stuff but yes it's on one hand when you have children and you bring a child to the zoo on one hand it's really fascinating to watch this little person look at all these different animals and and and freak out and and and see how amazing it is but that's the only pro is introducing human beings like little human beings in particular to these animals everything else is a con except for the animals that are like really endangered and they protect them and help breed them and then sometimes they were responsible for some reintroduction efforts but other than that it's an animal prison weird I don't take the position or ID all I don't know not this person that's trying to represent an ideology necessarily I'm not against all zoos but I have to say that there's nothing more sad than seeing elephants cats bears in cats man the cats when they're pacing back and forth I mean just get them out of there who who sir whose purpose are you serving is that good for you I mean seeing an animal that's got Zucco sasai mean it's it's it's it's a mental case and we don't know what the fuck's going on in their head so we have no idea that most people just watch and think this is just maybe normal or something right a lot of people we're not see because the veil is only now sort of coming off and people are started now getting the truth on the matters you start to see things for what they are like if Tom Cruise decided to come out if Tom Cruise is gay and he decided to come out like that'll be a real problem you know what I was thinking somebody bought this theater you know would be a hilarious movie idea gay couple caught Tom Cruise and John Travolta John Travolta gets kidnapped and gay Tom Cruise has to save his gay husband John Travolta and but other than that it's a real action movie it's just gay I like it would that be fucking cool like you like just a straight gay if anyone out there's a screenwriter that have at it cuz I'm never gonna write it with that fly would people enjoy life like if it like John wick style I think it would I really think it would if it was if the guy just kick it's not like gay guys are like a feet and if any I know plenty of like rough gay guys it'll whoop your ass bro bears bro they gotta pick up their own growl that's how fucking bad these guys are yeah I do really it would be fucking so cool like he was gonna yeah cuz that's how I feel with someone like drunk um but I'm like I don't care okay I know it's never come up we we've been good friends for a decade just never came up yeah like it he didn't seem that interested in women but I also don't think he's not entities just maybe live there's definitely a spectrum right and people are just yeah and that's fine too yeah yeah I'm also not Matt like if I were on the spectrum I think I would absolutely do it yeah I'm just not on the spectrum like I but in terms of opportunity there's a lot of nights a year Joe oh yeah there's 365 nights a year oh yeah you could you're not gonna do the pussy yeah same nights put it up dammit I had the best joke about that he goes he goes I he goes this is how little I give a fuck he goes I wish I was gay just so I could come out yeah I wish I wish I had a secret like that yeah that's a little I give a fuck it's like it's joke about I'm gaining weight for a movie I don't know what the movie is yet but yeah but yeah gay action we would fantastic I'd like it I don't do I within a year or two people would be definitely ready for it you want to hear the scariest AI story I know it's old right it's like I'm doing the lights front and along but it's from like a few early day and gather round children this is like early days of DARPA okay and this is when we were really seriously afraid that the Russians were gonna send you know a hundred thermonuclear warheads at Washington and take out the whole country okay so DARPA sets up this station at the top of the world to monitor the Soviet launch so that you know because it only takes 24 minutes for a ICBM to get from the launch pad in Russia to hit New York or Washington hmm okay so we set up the station up there and to monitor this so we would have some kind of a jump on this okay like we'd learn at about eight minutes my god the you know was a radar station that station called the bhima's site or j site it's connected to the no rad station in Cheyenne Mountain you know the one from the movies right okay and it's like the first week of business and the guys that are sitting there in the station looking for the alert are sitting there and they've been trained like the alerts never go off and all of a sudden the alerts go from one two three four number five is endgame okay so the information that the technicians are getting is now 1,000 Soviet thermonuclear missiles are on their way to Washington DC with 99.9 percent certainty actual story okay the guy panics but he trusts he says wait a minute you know cuz he's supposed to now give the launch code let's try and get the generals on the phone I can't get the Pentagon general in charge of no vrat they get a Canadian guy named general Sleeman and Sleeman you know my god we should be launched should we launch it's Lehman's like wait a minute human thought he remembered that the night before he thought he saw Khrushchev on TV at the UN you know that him he's famously banging issue and he says where's Khrushchev right now they check he's in New York City why would the Soviets send a thousand nuclear weapons are away while their own leader is in New York they said I don't know sir but the radar returns are reporting this and they're so someone had the idea at that B mu site to go outside and lo and behold what was there a big full moon the system was reading the moon moving and misinterpreted it as a thousand nuclear thermonuclear icbm because cranly didn't launch so we came that close to the end of the world I mean and it's an astonishing story documents are now Declassified but is this an actual indication of why that element of human intervention why trust why other information like oh I think I saw Khrushchev on the TV last night is so important because the machine said with 99.9% certainty this is happening Yuma we must launch in retaliation true story [Applause]
