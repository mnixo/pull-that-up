and we're live hello Justin Ren hello what's going on buddy got a book in front of you I do I just got a couple of notes look how organized you are with your tabs yeah I've never had tabs of my wife yeah this is actually from James clear have you heard of him atomic habits New York Times bestselling author I didn't play am I talking about him at all but uh but the the notebook is yeah oh so you bought one of his notebooks yeah it goes along with his New York Times best-selling book called clear where you put down your daily habits and then you just kind of can check them off as you're doing what's your deal what's your daily habits I'll have a morning routine where I wake up and where I'm at I have a peloton so I jump on that for like thirty minutes right in the morning right when I get out of bed right when you have that well right when I get our bed I do 15 minutes of breathing just breathing yeah but I do like five minutes I do that to my cell and in bed there you go yeah drifting awake awake for if it what kind of money what kind of breathing you're doing so just kind of focused where I breathe in six to eight seconds and kind of count the in-breath then kill the hold and then count the exhale so he's a meditation hmm and he'd do that for 15 minutes everything when it's three short ones back to back to back there through headspace and actually just got a new phone I don't have the new heads faced downloaded but I have three five-minute breathing techniques that are really three to five minutes each so sometimes it's only like nine minutes and what do you get out of that for me I think I'm just kind of setting the tone for the day mmm and just kind of clearing my mind instead of first thing I used to be bad about this first thing waking up I'd grab my phone everybody does that and then it would be emails text messages notifications yeah and then you're starting your day reactive instead of proactive like what you're saying Justin around like thinking that wake up do that I get on the peloton right after that I try to drink a liter of water now you got me on this layered superfood it's a girl like Jane get going with his coffee particularly his turmeric yes this is this is my first time that's always out so good for you yeah first what tumeric is amazing for you fight off inflammation and this with coffee as well so I mean I taste so good have you had the hydrate not the coffee but the hydrate is that another one of his products I have not tried that oh my gosh it's so I should write it for you um we I'm in California and we had this very setup but a buddy of mine walked across America for fight for the Forgotten he heard us on the show you know him I didn't know him before the show so he said I'm gonna walk across the entire country for the pygmies right Wow yeah and which was wild he had already done something you the bull year before for the Paradise fires he's a professional drummer mm-hmm actually you got to meet him right yep he's one of the cowboy had the Stetson he's the second guy that I know that walked across America this year Mike Posner is the other one we were talking about coming on Mike Mike and I have been going back and forth he got bit by a fucking rattlesnake Jeremy has some wild stories he actually just started this adventure coffee brand his is his drum companies called beats from the core like mains from the drum corps and then he had beats for a cause and so last year he did it for the Paradise fires this year he did it for fight for The Forgotten I can't believe how many people I know that have coffee company's immortal coffee Lera Hamilton Coffee tape Fletcher and Keith Jardine caveman coffee black coffee all those guys I love the black rifle coffee guys there's their stuff is they shit shit will shops through black rifle yeah is he just got a you know we just had our team loaded up actually the documentary team that I know kind of threw you because they do a lot of your net yes special they do all my special yeah as they've done everything since they're the best they've done everything since 2009 everything that I've done mmm positive image my boy Anthony Giordano who is director of the UFC he's the best yeah he's awesome I've gotten to meet him a time or two and then Brady I've gotten to spend a lot of time with vice president and he's come to Uganda with me he's conscious Colorado and the effluent Addison hey how are you physically cuz you were to were saying that you had some crazy parasite yes I have a lot of stuff that's still being tested James so that's actually well first reason I came a little bit in my last week for Thea went up to reading my first time up to Northern California hmm is beautiful gorgeous gorgeous the river right there so green yes absolutely I didn't even know that yeah and all the fly-fishing yeah yeah I've never gotten hanging a fly-fishing but I love it looks like it's so uh yeah it's not hard you could get it in a couple minutes you're smart yeah I mean you're an athlete you'd figure it out quick well Jeremy literally walked from the Brooklyn Bridge all the way to reading the sundial bridge is 3100 miles does he know about flights uh I think he's only 35 hours his story's actually really unique you'd like it he grew up with well he was put in like special education classes because he had Tourette's really really bad dreams so we had these tics the where he'd slap his foot what cause was that I have no idea but he had these tics and the stutter well through this walking through drumming he thinks he started to rewire the neural pathways in his brain because he's a walk no the walk and the drumming so he just did the walk I just did it and but he finished the walk and he said whenever he was playing stadiums drumming right like that's the that's the pinnacle of being a professional drummer playing stadiums with tens of thousands of people so he's back there drumming and it's before his first time he's ever come out and drummed that way well he's drumming and instead of him being in the moment thinking about wow I'm at the pinnacle of my sport or enough sport but of my art mm-hmm he's literally thinking about how he wishes there'd be a day that he could grab the microphone and just state one clear sentence where there wasn't a stutter mm-hmm so he's literally back there he's arrived or at least what a lot of people say is his arrival first stadium tour and then all of a sudden he's thinking about just having a clear sentence in a conversation with people there was something that I just read really recently about a new treatment for Tourette's mm-hmm Jeremy would tell you that it was drumming that really helped him because make sense he went from reading to up to Seattle he was in the grunge scene and then I think his name is Steve Smith or Shawn Smith maybe Steve Smith that started the Seattle drum school of music a really prestigious school they would send kids off to like Berklee School of Music and then they would graduate from Berkeley they'd come back and they'd hire them as their instructors well Steve Smith saw Jeremy and said hey I want you to be an instructor at my school and Jeremy kind of laughed I can't read music I didn't graduate high school how would I ever be a drum teacher at the Seattle drum school in music he's like well knowing her I'll coach you for two years and then you'll be a drum teacher lo and behold two years later he's literally a drum teacher there for ten full years a person has that much commitment to somebody that I want to coach you for two years before I give you a job yeah wild right that came as mentor that's pretty sir love and I'm so he was able to start having fluid conversations then he did the Paradise fires fundraiser then he walked all the way across America I fell off a 40-foot cliff got surrounded by coyotes out there he was in Oklahoma and he came through our offices and then he ended up in the middle of nowhere Oklahoma in the Panhandle and these cops came by and said hey who are you because he set up his tent in ninety percent of people that do this walk they fell within the first 400 miles yeah there's a long way to walk oh yeah we still got 3,000 people that do complete it kind of like Mike right they have an assistance vehicle the whole way where they're sleeping they're they're being fed or they're they have some comforts and he did not he just backpack this are you saying Mike's a pussy about Mike I just said what Mike is vehicle getting assistance vehicle I think you're right I guess he needed it when he got bit mm-hmm and so Jeremy didn't he fell off that cliff he was he had a mountain lion that uh I guess purred or whatever sniff that it's a distant oh all right when he came out he had footprints all around it so he documented everything pretty why on about coyotes huh yes rounded by coyotes oh and a prison break happened oh geez while he was out he looks like a prisoner hey if there's a prison break this fucking guy well we told her well don't worry about it you know if you hear sirens it's probably the tornadoes because the bad weather coming oh great Oh so a tornado siren II thought you went off but is actually the prison break first time they had those in like 20 years but was the night he was right outside there isn't so he's got some stories man and then for me I came out here I completed the walk with him I did the last like day with him so 20 miles mm-hmm I was sore for a week after just walking up and down these hills really I'm not a week 3 or 4 days a year and really good shape I'm gonna good shape but stop all this guy about this guy I want to hear about your parasites oh yeah so what's going on well you're still more testing but they did find something called schistosomiasis in me so shish toe is from the tropical rainforests of Africa I think that's the only place that exists but it comes from these snails and so because that probably bathed not because I probably I have bathe in the rivers their been in the rivers going across you get a mouth no they can get into your skin I was real itchy for a couple weeks there and what that was was some of the like parasites I guess would you call it there they're like egg sacs or something that got on me yeah got inside of my stomach my liver oh geez could be potentially even in my brain in your reign potentially so they don't know yet well they what's today today's Wednesday right one day I did my final exams and I did three full days with his doctor dr. Daniel Eamon he would be phenomenal for the show by the way he's incredible to to TED Talks millions of em stop you you're such a great promoter or your friends yeah sure divert and you want to talk about them I want to talk about you okay let's talk about me what's going on with my brain saw him because I getting jerked around by all these different doctors it's this it's this it's right that's this right and I've had numerous endoscopy to go look in my stomach because why am i throwing up and one says it is an ulcer another comes out and says your stomach's perfect inside it's a little red but like there's no ulcer whatsoever and so I have cysts oh I've had an intestinal bacteria that's really bad called Shigella I've had malaria three times I've had dengue fever so dengue was in me for at least a month the CDC found it at me he's had this parasite and you know for a long time now how many months illy six since April and have you been able to train at all during this time ups and downs so I was at the police and fire training center of Oklahoma City they're just helping them there's some really great guys there and I was helping them and the fire chief ended up putting me in the cold shower for like 20 minutes because I got so what he said I got like ghostly white and I started dry heaving and I was just shaky although this is all from your parasites yeah Jesus and so it's up and down I'll start I'll start getting in shape I'll start losing weight I'll start I'll start feeling good and then I just crash I've had shingles five times Joe what the five times and what is not this stuff well I'm starting to do hyperbarics hyperbaric oxygen therapy got a prescription for that and that's been helping more than anything right now yeah I'm trying to have that morning routine protect my sleep eat right my wife helps me meal prep I have juices all through the day at the superfood coffee I'm doing all this stuff I can't I was on 28 pills a day for four or five weeks in a row just for this parasite yeah well whole parasite cleanse because and they have another site that they haven't found or did they haven't like that's not because I'm going so remote Joan in the forest they think I could have picked up something crazy so they just did Lyme Lyme's disease test on me this was on Monday so Lyme disease they did a cheek swab from like genetics they did hair so they cut off like six different spots of hair glowing LOX yeah so they cut that my wife was a mom were teasing me cuz I was like crying about it I was like don't don't cut it here don't cut it here so they took six spots of hair samples from me blood urine stool samples they did two different kinds of brain scans on me so they literally injected something that was very minor ly radioactive in me yes that it could light up all the different spots in my brain activity so where there's too much blood flow or there's not enough and literally so one of the things I found on the scan which already knew but they can test not just stuff for like CTE or mild traumatic brain injury and TBI before autopsy now with these brain scans they can also test for like PTSD and so there's this there's this diamond in the middle of your brain and you're only supposed have a little bit of activity they're just very very small but if you have this what they call the Ring of Fire this diamond of red and white being lit up on the brain scans that literally shows that you have PTSD so I had to co2 Meyer in here do you know who yes yeah Dakota that was an incredible podcast meant to text you out he's he's an amazing guy and people haven't heard that one go back and watch it it's one of my favorites that you've had Dakota's a legitimate hero but one of the things that he was saying was that they injected him and this do you member what the blockers called that block his cage ears it said whatever the blocker was usually he described it and said it completely stopped his PTSD yes cured all of his anxiety the way he began refined it Jamie just so he could reference it I remember that aside to my wife she's in psychology right know she's gonna be a counselor and I sent that to her because they're talking about PTSD and the teacher said oh yeah that's been around for a while too and that's what dakotas yeah I think the minute coil I think they made a clip that Jerry clipped cause did yes yes yeah cuz GB lager King Leon yes yeah that he said it just instantly alleviated all of his problems yeah which is insane I mean like wouldn't you love that the miracle cure they give you a shot boom your problems go away absolutely didn't you say it last for a year I think that's six months to a year depending on it kind of you have to have other traumatic I'm thinking of doing it even though are anything wrong yeah I just want to feel great well this is what's crazy oh and Dakota said that but this doctor Dana a man who's got like he's at 10-time New York Times bestselling author and he's got a book about PTSD and basically he was saying but yeah that shot really really does work and people have been doing it for years and with veterans it's one of the quickest do they think that you have some PTSD yeah they so he was saying this to watch Dakota said you just you that up where or trigger that in my memory where the most common PTSD is car wrecks I think that's what to go to said right yes this car wrecks cause the most PTSD same spots and your brain that diamond to fire and there's something you can't avoid right you have to go back and be in public transportation or get in your own car do you have them from car accident no not from car accidents what do you think you have it from from some tough stuff in the rain forest whether it's Uganda or Congo we've had to flee from a village whenever a rebel group came into the village next to us and they killed six or eight people and we're all fleeing across the river and these like little pygmy dugout canoes which aren't big enough really for me and we're trying to flee across the river before the sun's even up and there's like crocodiles and hippos in the water and then and then a couple other really terrible things I mean I've helped kids that have died and buried them and yeah dug their graves and that's happened numerous times we've had machine guns pointed at us I won't get into that story too much but we talked about that one of those stories before yeah and someone someone I loved was a bunch of people that loved her with me and so that was really tough because we were unarmed and we're being threatened and so that was tough um and then and then some like childhood stuff I think different kinds of abuses that stuff like that there's some public shaming and different things like that i think i think one bullying moment that I even kind of forgot about til going through this with dr. Ayman was I was in the locker room and this little guy named Raiden that I've been hanging out with a lot he was just beat up in the bathroom I saw that video the video that was online is a horrible video of these kids beating him up but then I saw him with you yeah yeah so that's been fun what are you doing with them just man it's it's great working up the spirits yeah you just wanted to to to rally around him surrounded with love and side working to ashen we're in the same town no shit yeah in the same town Oklahoma State oh so actually Jamie is it okay to play one of those videos that I saved it's called Raiden videos and it's the first one but just sort of people that haven't seen it a you and Dakota talked about this an you and Laird about the diffusion of responsibility so it's yes and people can just stand around and watch right well that's what happens right and in the in the urinal actually not this video but the next one this one's a fun supportive one and then this one right here is just him at the urinal going to the bathroom kids you know I don't want to watch this just real quick after that there's um so that's him at the urinal there's eight to ten kids in the bathroom they actually think up to twelve four or five or just filming it and he's got special needs he was born with autism deaf in his right ear so he's got a hearing aid he's diabetic he's got diabetes and his family and he's been relentlessly bullied since he was nine years old this is him that there's so the bathroom was on Thursday this is on Friday after school three kids jumping them hitting them from all sides for no reason for no reason he's a big teddy bear and he just his mom said since her picking him up at school and kindergarten first grade second grade kids would just walk up and hit him in the stomach or punch him in the arm okay what's yeah we don't have to keep playing it so but it's really cool that you reached out to him yeah well they they I guess knew about fight for the Forgotten and we're in the same town and so a dad reached out to Jim Stewart you've met Jim he's our director and Jim hit me up right away and said hey is this a kid that we could we could rally around though you could you know we want to do all this we have a curriculum for a bully prevention and I think character development is bully prevention so yeah good character you're not gonna bully well that's one of the things that I've always said about martial arts yeah believe it or not like learning how to fight is one of the best ways to keep people from being assholes absolutely which is so counterintuitive but it really is because a lot of people being bullies it comes from a lack of confidence right and confident people are generally pretty kind yeah confident accomplished people and you know yourself so you don't have these need this need to improve positions you don't have that insecurity yes right and the other beautiful thing about Jim's particularly jujitsu I think is that everybody kind of boosts everybody up it's a real family sort of camaraderie feeling a real that those environments every gym I've ever been to every jujitsu gym is good they have this family environment to it and it just makes you feel like you belong somewhere and you get used to being kind to people nice to people even even if someone catches you with a technique they'll show you yeah they'll show you this is you know you left your arm here when you were transitioning and if you do that it gets stuck and this is why I can catch it yeah humble hearts yeah so with with jiu-jitsu or with martial arts if you hurt your training partner you lose right the person that's helping you get better yes and so as you help them get better they make you better and it's just give and take we're actually the more you give the more you get in return because you're making them a better training partner a better person and I think martial arts takes it to another level I've done numerous sports my parents I grew up with um being the professional or official photographers of like the Dallas Cowboys and the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Mavericks and so I grew up around professional athletes but what's so different I think about martial artists and why people love MMA one because a sport so pure and it's like a chess match and it's an incredible sport but the athletes they truly are more approachable and I think that they're more giving and compassionate and more community minded and driven you know that other athletes aren't but just a martial artist are so more yes because they've had it drilled into them from having mentors and other black belts yeah they're on this lifelong journey of even service to others that's part of the black belt journey and self-respect and discipline and one of the things that bothers me about all this trash talking lately the trash talking trended Emma made that was really I mean when people saw how much money Conor McGregor was able to make he came this promotion tool just and Chael Sonnen was a part of it to just guys just relentlessly talk shit about him I'm so torn because in one on one hand is very entertaining yeah and I do enjoy it right but on the other hand I'm like man that is the wrong message to send it kind of removes some of the beauty of what competition is yeah like what the beauty of competition is to people respecting each other but being aware that they're you know they're going to have to go to battle and you know they're equally skilled equally trained and we're gonna find out who's who's got the more effective strategy or implementation and here we go now it's like you can't sell a fight without some shit talking right it's like it's changed from this martial arts thing sort of this promotion of this thuggish behavior which again hypocritically I enjoy right I do enjoy it you know when people talk shit I clap my hands and get a kick out of it yeah but I'm a dummy one thing pretty cool about jiu-jitsu what you're saying one Raffaele wanted me to text me coming in here that you wanted me to tell you what's up so tell me I said hi congratulations yeah I'll tour world champion yeah musashi talking a lot of shit about him being on steroids yeah must not like the squeeze man he is the mo he's the most disciplined obsessed and yeah just dedicated person about that's how you become a champion I mean the way that he eats the way these trained sleep schedules everything around him being the world champion and everyone else has to kind of these and that goal that dream accusations of steroids with no proof whatsoever seems unfortunate yeah you know I mean in this all this Nate Diaz shit that happened there's a there's here's the issue for people to understand what happened with Nate Diaz Nate Diaz tested positive for a trace element of something called SAR SAR M it's a it's a type of it's it's basically a performance dancing stuff substance but it's it existed in in a miniscule trace amount in vegan vitamin supplement and the reason these things are being found is that the tests that they can run now the asada testing the equipment is so powerful it's so much more powerful than it's ever been before that the problem is they're they're working with tools that are almost too good so instead of catching people cheating they're catching people that just have come in contact with something that's illegal it might have been like this the tiniest amount that was in a bin that they also used to mix these vitamins they didn't clean it properly you know miniscule parts per million there's a little tiny amount but these you sada machines will pick that shit up so then it looks like someone like Nate Diaz who everybody there's some people that are beyond reproach Nate Diaz no he's never been on never Angie's not cheap that's enhanced his performance yeah well maybe we does but I don't even think he eats meat I mean I think he's very clean with his diet I think it just seats I know he's eaten fish in the past there's a Vice video of him out eating with Bourdain and they're eating fish yeah I don't know if he still eats fish but he's very clean with his diet and very clean with his supplements and what he eats right will you talk about jiu-jitsu and Raphael and just have martial arts how it teaches you that character development you're gonna like this I got you a couple of gifts my man I don't know if you ever seen someone come in with a suitcase I have studio you have yes but before you give me these gifts I don't want to lose track of what I was asked sure about your health okay so what what are they doing and what can they do about what what you have so when you said you might have some crazy shit mean you know you might have a parasite they don't even know yet yes so there might be in that's why they diagnosed or in blood urine blood stool hair and cheek swab sample so it's possible that you have something that like very few human beings have ever had because they have a deep end right eeep jungle yeah how long does it take you to get to where you go well it depends on where where we go the best place okay a plane from Oklahoma City to normally Chicago or Dulles or JFK or Atlanta and then we go to Amsterdam or London or is it Qatar Qatar I think it's guitar guitar okay I think and then we'll fly either from there to Nairobi Kenya or Kigali Rwanda and then from there you connect to Kampala Uganda and then from there you get a private like missions or humanitarian plane that's just you and the pilot and so you take that plane from there to you from Uganda to Congo and then you land you do customs and then you get back in the plane and you go and you land on a runway that normally they have just cleared with machetes so many times you flying you're flying from Oklahoma so let's just say Oklahoma City to JFK yep JFK to London to flings so2 to London London to Kenya Kenya Kenya to Uganda or Uganda the kyv and then you get in the plane again to go out to the ring so six planes six flights at least five planes how many days it's normally two or three days geez and then 30 hours or something of travel and then after that you get in a car and it could be six hours so where you land used to be in the rain forest but you drive six hours now to get to the rain forest how come because it's deforestation so bad the deforestation in the last 25 years they've cut down about the size of Texas it's a pretty wild we've we've we've helped to replant 4,000 trees but that's not even scratching the surface Dillon us who's DeForest in everybody it's a lot of Chinese UK and outsiders that come in and exploit the rain force there's a lot of mahogany in the area mmm is it evany do the goober dry senses to do this no they just do it just there's send someone in and cut down the trees so no one goes to do it no one stops them and so they just claim the resources they don't have on the border they might have to pay some sort of bribe or tax they call them that that or taxes they call them that yeah dat that's you gon and when you say taxes and then from there that drive at six hours sometimes it's taken 25 hours one time and another time it took 47 Oh same Drive 47 yeah why'd it take 47 oh I think we helped get 40 something cars out of the way that we're stuck in the mud so it's really silty there you don't call Congo roads roads I've never been on tarmac and Congo actually that's why I have been in on cement in Goma but outside of Goma there are no concrete roads anywhere tarmac roads so I've seen an 18-wheeler or lorry 3/4 of the way sunk - where's up to their window the driver's side window up to silt and how they get it out I don't know that one that one was just kind of in the graveyard that one was like done no one's getting that thing out really yeah I mean you're going around mountains and you look down to the side and you'll see were 812 vehicles that have flipped off oh yes damn it there's some vice videos of the craziest roads in the world a lot of them are in Congo some say Rwanda because they're so many Hills it's the land of a Thousand Hills mm-hmm and so there's so many sharp turns then they take those turns at 40 50 60 miles so they'll literally just fly off the mountain and so you catch this parasite you've gone through all these ten I mean this has been I mean we've been talking about on the podcast for several months now so for me hearing that you're still dealing with it is really disturbing well yeah what can they do about this what I gonna do I think getting off that cleanse I mean I was on 28 pills for four weeks maybe five weeks mm-hmm and some of it were like antibiotics but I have to stay away from certain antibiotics here's the thing a couple of things that I know I have PTSD because of my brain scans and then they see in my brain toxicity and so the toxicity and my brain which kind of form these little divots but not really divots it's not really changing the biology or makeup of my brain but it's just activity of my brain isn't fully developed right there where or it's it's being toxins are there that are either from meth Lachlan or from cipro have you heard of cipro what is messy what's the first one bethlo Quinton what is that stuff that's a malaria drug oh geez no malaria drug take for any reason really that used to be the drug of choice for a military now tens of thousands of our military veterans if you look up mefloquine toxicity military times they've done two articles one was just a month or two ago but the first one showed that tens of thousands of our military veterans have wrongly been diagnosed with PTSD and it's been because of this methyl O'Quinn so they never saw war on the meth liquin toxicity of the brain it's like this poison for your brain and if you've taken it for like six months you can have it it starts giving you bad nightmares you can have different kinds of mood swings and different stuff health joint aches fatigue all sorts of different things but basically what methyl Equinox ISTE of the brain does well tens of thousands have been wrongly diagnosed with it when they take it for once a once a week so you take the pill once a week and that was why it was our drug of choice instead of it being every day or two times a day right you just take it once a week well when I had malaria the three times I was allergic to the normal malaria medication quinine and art to fan and some other drugs like doxycycline and Malarone I wasn't responding to those well I was vomiting I was uh I was allergic to him so methyl ik when my body digested the best I just took it the best so three times I had malaria they gave me two in the morning to midday and two at night and so I'm taking six and a day for five to seven days and these other guys that were getting Matthew Quinn toxicity were taking it once a week for six months so I had 32:42 in a week's time I had six months in a week's time and I did that three different times why are they giving you so much it was what my body was responding to against malaria the first time I lost 33 pounds in five days and so I was vomiting red and green blood and bile I lost most of my hearing my peripheral vision started disappearing I had some called Blackwater fever where my urine was literally as dark as that that black clock take pictures of it and I didn't I should probably should have yeah it freaked me out five days I didn't urinate and then when I finally did if he google Blackwater fever one in four or one in two people that get it they die you didn't urinate for how many five days five days I couldn't be oh my god they were trying to get IVs in me my veins were collapsing oh Jesus so that was that was pretty brutal oh yeah man so I'm getting my health better there because I do want to fight again if it happened how can you if you have this yes enough in your brain well I'm journaling my road to recovery but if they don't know what this parasite is how are they treating it like what are they how are they gonna get hopefully I don't find anything because I just got off those rounds of so they're testing me for Lyme disease they're testing me for all these kind of parasites amoebas bacterias you can get Lyme disease in the Congo well I've I've been camping out here and I've gotten like bit by five or ten oh wow so but yeah there there's these wicked kind of ticks my record is pulling five roaches out of my beard and whatnot right so there's tons of bugs there do you know does they have does Oklahoma have that Rocky Mountain I think so tick no nothing nor the one that gives you a low allergy have you had that one I've been bit by that one I don't think you haven't meat allergy though oh yeah that's a crazy one what is it called alpha gal alpha galactose it's a something that it's the reaction that this tick bite gives you it makes you allergic to this specific element in red meat Wow yeah you can only fish and like if you try to eat meat you'll get really sick Oh crazy that is crazy okay but they're they're trying to figure it out why and this is gonna be crazy why I'm 32 and I've had shingles five times what my first time I got malaria I don't know if you can see the white and my beard over here mm-hmm but I got white in my beard the first time I had malaria the second time I had malaria I had white come out my beard down here Saudi bondage is freaking out yeah so then now I've got shingles five times and then this is gonna sound crazy but I know I have to have a this might be too much information but I know I have to have a bowel movement whenever my nose starts running mm-hmm so literally whenever I have to go my own style and running and running and running how is that united I don't know if that's what they're looking into mmm like that that's it use your second brain and so it's it I don't know suggestion or stomach is your second brain they said oh that's got a German gut trust your gut yeah it's got literally more neurons in your stomach than in your brain really that's what the doctor was saying I know that's a case with your heart as well right there's a bunch of neurons in your heart that they're realizing now like that whole idea of trusting your heart trusting your gut like these these thought processes that people had might have actually been based on some intuitive understanding of how the body actually works that's really weird it is weird really weird strange everything everything's connected right and it's connected that's not weird really okay and it makes sense over tighten it doctors in Oklahoma are like we have no explanation for that and then the doctors out here were like oh that's because this is connected to this and they did all my blood work even though they did more blood labs before I ever came out here like a week or two ago they still poked me five more times to get more blood work because well three times they were drawing blood two times they were putting that stuff in me so they could do the brain so you're getting better doctors on here yeah more informed yeah more informed and then man have you heard of hyperbarics yes no um Uriah Faber used it quite a bit after his fight with Jose Aldo yeah when Aldo fucked his leg up yeah it is like swole up real bad I'm telling you this is one of the biggest game changers I love the float go and float tanks I've done it at least 50 times at float OKC and Oklahoma my wife and I that's our date night once a week we go and we do that and I float fight week at least twice a week I really believe in floating hyperbarics is unlike anything I've ever done and felt immediate long-lasting benefits from Rick how so was not I get better sleep than I've ever gotten that was instant almost I mean I noticed it the first night the second night I've done over 20 treatments now of hyperbarics you get in the tank you put on an oxygen mask and then they fill the tank up with oxygen and you lay there for an hour and a half to two hours some people only takes an hour but I'm bigger and they're taking it to a lower depth and then my ears kind of mess up on me a little bit on flights they kind of gets clogged up or whatever because of the hyperbaric chamber no it's just they've always done that on planes and so it's like you're in a plane when you're in the hyperbarics and what it does is it pressurizes the oxygen down into your cells so it's literally going into your mitochondria that's what the new studies are showing now oxygen gets in there and it promotes healing and in your brain it literally brings blood flow into every part of the brain that needs it so it's one of the best things after a concussion so I was with Raiden and what's I'm one of those guys that sometimes thinks everything happens for a reason you know or there's there's not a lot of quinces I just started hyperbarics two or three days before I met Raiden then I'm doing it and they're saying it's one of the best things for concussions Raiden gets a concussion from one of those fights or maybe there's one of the ones that wasn't on the fight but they diagnosed him I was with the doctors and his mom and his dad whenever the doctor says I think he really has a concussion did some testing on him wrote a prescription and said hey I really think he needs to do hyperbarics that's one of the best things for concussions now I was like I just started and so literally that day the doctor hands him a prescription for hyperbarics and then I take him in there and get hyperbarics and this is probably the story I wanted to share with you about hyperbarics the most there's this kid named Caleb Freeman and he just made NBC Nightly News I think Fox News and ABC he's making the news everywhere because of his comeback story the kid probably should have never been able to eat again on his own especially never be able to walk his parents were told that he would be left in a vegetative state and if you have that Caleb Freeman video because of one he got in a vicious car accident 16 years old he had just heard driving he was the number one cross-country runner at his school but also in his district and then he got in this brutal car accident here's the video of him trying to learn to put up the finger number one again there's a he's trying to do a one that's his dad kind of coaching him but he was the number one cross-country runner now he's trying to get him to do a thumbs up and this is off and I've yep traumatic brain injury driving down the road hit hit uh what's a hydroplane he got in a brutal wreck and they thought he would be left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life so you can see right here his muscles are so atrophied because he had been in like I think he was in a coma or he was in intensive care for so long and so his dad's trying to get him to do a thumbs up you know he's trying his hardest to do that you can go to the second video and they're telling them you should really try hyperbarics they try everything you can and so the whole community has rallied around them in Oklahoma he's from Newcastle where one of our board members are from and they're trying to help him learn to walk again assist it I don't know what they have him break his arm yeah he broke his arm he fall down a song because in the other picture soon what you didn't know actually don't know post accident yeah this is post accident so maybe this was before that other video so video you're trying to show them but trying to show you both of these because this is how far gone II was and then after 40 hyperbaric treatments they said get him in there it'll flood his brain with oxygen right when it has the oxygen it'll reproduce the blood flow and they'll bring actual healing into his brain and so that third video is right here he's literally he was the number one cross-country runner at his school so now he's trying to learn how to do a cross-country again he wasn't ever supposed to walk again on his own he came in there to the hyperbarics assisted like you saw where people are assisting him on both sides he does 40 treatments of hyperbarics and then all sudden he walks up and down the football field 14 times unassisted nothing changed just 40 hyperbaric treatments so I felt like you got to keep doing this yeah yeah that next video is actually him that's okay oh that's us that hyperbarics with Raiden that's the young man that got the concussion on the right in this video right here I don't know if there's volume but uh this is actually a pretty special video this is after 80 treatments he's literally finishing his cross-country run again and he was never supposed to walk and that's after like 3 or 5 miles Wow and so and how's his ability to communicate it's not coming back he's actually texted me this morning he text me that picture of us and Raiden and his dad actually forgot he goes he is weird where do we take that picture again and or I don't have it saved and Caleb goes it's in your phone dad just look and so he's he's able to recollect a lot of different stuff that's a man this is all something that your experience again as well for your yeah treatment for the parasites yep and I I've I've literally never gotten better sleep I feel more positive when I come out of it and then I feel like I can focus better because one of the things that they saw my brain scans where I have PTSD and then I have real severe EDD and they can see that on the how my brain functions I guess there's like eight different types of do don't be brain me and why I think you need to do it only one know what's been dr. Raymond's awesome man and so then I have that and then so going into the oxygen they can see from scan one to scan to how my brain is actually functioning better and the spots with a DD have kind of cooled off a little bit the spots of PTSD have literally kind of gone down a little bit and so that was Caleb's story there's also this girl named Eden Carlson in Eden Carlson there's like a minute clip on the New York Post and they did it on YouTube this girl drowned for two hours she was facing float down in a pool or facedown in a pool her mom pulled her out of maybe 15 minutes she drowned for two hours she didn't breathe she didn't have a heartbeat and then at the hospital they miraculously got her back her story's all over if you just google even was dead for two hours two hours Eden Carlson II D en Carlson she's the first one to have brain damage reversal scientifically proven they've done all the MRIs and PET scans on the hyperbaric from hyperbarics so the first things I'm going to do form Wickham's I mean I think this is worth trying to pull up one of those videos it's New York Post Eden okay you can't pose the police that but literally there's Eden Carlson video on YouTube and it's wild to see how she's recovered and how they've told her she would never be able to eat again never be able to go to school never be able do that now she's basically a normal girl you look at her there yeah so cute right there little smile that's amazing her mom is like a huge advocate for it now and now let but with you what do they have to do like they have to find out whether on the parasites are stealing your system identify the parasites because it could be an unknown parasite right well they know it's just oh and if I've had she stolen me for as long as they think they don't think it started in April they think maybe that was another not on Sep but took it to another level when I went there and got sick and it was brutal I mean I was hugging basically the not the toilet but the the latrine um while I was in Uganda in April and May now I was just so sick this hyperbaric is helping you but you you're still not able to train right now like you're not you're not like you don't have a fight schedule ain't I don't have a fight scheduled but I would like to fight first quarter next year if I can is that literally possible I mean if you're not six months from now I have another follow-up appointment here in March and we're gonna have a lot more data to show like from my blood work to my and the bacteria in my stomach mm-hmm to those brain scans are gonna be the big thing that show how my brain is started heal how my body started to feel right and show my health just increasing and so that's the goal I'm on this mission to get get healthy so I can fight again but also just so that can function better yeah and have like not these big swings so the hyperbaric chamber is helping you yeah big but yet you're still feeling some serious significance just started the hyperbaric sub month ago okay so I'm 20 treatments in I need to get 40 done as soon as possible and then they think I'll probably do another round of 40 and then yeah I mean seeing how how Caleb's doing I mean Caleb told Caleb showed me this this is wild I come in and I'm about to get in the chamber with him and he shows me his hand shaking and he's showing me I don't know what that's called but it's whenever is that what Parkinson's and different stuff like you have those kind of shanks and your hand sure or Alzheimer's or whatever that is so Caleb's got that and he gets in the chamber 90 minutes later we get out he shows me his hand it's completely steel and he can put contacts back in his eyes whoa but before there's no way at all that he can get contacts in his eyes afterwards his body's calmed down enough his brain has enough oxygen and blood flow in it that he can put his contacts back in them that's insane yeah so Radin his parents say that he was always up and down in the middle of the night and that they'd have to try to put him back to sleep and now he just wants you to sleep he's asleep until they wake him up they think it's helping with his autism his diabetes his ac-1 levels or whatever those are called those have started to come down and what the doctors have told us is like there's nothing better the doctors take an oath that say to do no harm like that's first and foremost is to do no harm and they're like if someone has a concussion or if someone has autism or if someone has this bacteria or a parasite that might be in the brain why not flood the body on a cellular level oh you're gonna love this part that can increase your your stem cells by eight times in your body so it's one of the best treatments for whenever you have the stem cells injected in you mm-hmm so I had the MSC's the mesenchymal stem cells for my hip put in my shoulder mm-hmm they said one of the best things I could have done for it would have been to get in a hyperbaric chamber because that would promote the stem cell growth and life of the stem cells because their cells and you're pushing oxygen into the cells you know an increasing blood flow into it and you're extending their life and helping them reproduce yeah so it's one of the best things out there Joe I wouldn't be talking about it like this without Raphael is getting into it Joe Namath Joe Namath has his own clinic now for hyperbaric yes he's doing that to reverse his brain trauma football right I read about that right and it's the first time there's ever been documented cases of brain trauma reversal where if you can heal your brain you can basically heal your life or have a healthy brain you have a healthy life do we need a hyperbaric chamber in here yeah you buy portable units absolutely I use something called a Sechrist which I think you would really like it's the hard chamber it's glass you have one in your house no but the Sechrist one or there's Joe Namath doing it I think Michael Phelps does it you know getting in the water look at that Wow literally it's wild at how how much stuff it actually so what's the prognosis like with you with the doctors the the looked for parasites they're doing all this blood scan do they think that they're gonna be able to straighten you out they think so yeah I think they think with doing a holistic approach where medication can come in at a later date I had this doctor that's all you have PTSD here's these pills hmm oh you have depression here's these pills you know okay now now you're starting to have anxiety for the first time in your life you've never had it before here's some more pills oh you think you have a TD here's some more pills they put me on three or four different pills at the same time smelling like a zombie you know like a zombie I felt weird I felt like I started having like electricity running through my veins or something like like my muscle started twitching my eyelid was constantly spasming so the doctors that have looked at this all the different various ailments that you have like and they don't want you to do pills so what what do they want you to do and what do they think is going to be able to happen they think you'll be able to fight again hum so dr. Ayman he's a guy that says man our brains are the literally you can live they can do lung transplants right and heart transplants and kidney transplants like you can't do a brain transplant right and so he's saying that anyone that's in a brain damaging occupation and he said whether that's fighting football or even being a firefighter because that is a brain damaging occupation you're breathing in burning couches which are putting off all these harmful chemicals and so he said you want to protect it and promote your brain health as much as you possibly can right so he's a brilliant guy and he's going to be on weekly calls with me guiding me keeping me accountable on how am i protecting my sleep how am i what am i getting to eat you know also supplementation what's that one that you were on here with Davidson Claire talking about nmn it's like that rolls resveratrol yes that's not drugs in Occident yeah well that plus some of the other things that you guys were talking about like they're all in his supplements where he tells you go get these supplements from here and here and make sure that you're optimizing your brain health so it seems like there's a bunch of different things going on yeah with the PTSD is PTSD has to do with things you've seen and your childhood but then you've got the drug them the methylene toxicity of the brain or cipro toxicity have you heard of cipro what it does to you know what is in row cipro is probably the number one antibiotic for intestinal bacteria so if you get an intestinal bacteria they give you this and some problems with that it kicks the bug out and whatever it is you know it's like the number one thing for humanitarians to take with you overseas but but a huge huge but huge side effect now is cartilage ligaments and muscle tears oh I have heard of that I have heard of people taking extreme antibiotics for staph infections yep so cipro is for staffs and then afterwards so you're not taking it because you got it wrestling you take cipro you clear up and you go back into wrestling now sending you tear your Achilles tendon yeah and how long as long as it weakened your ligaments it's at least for six months they say but it could be from a year or longer lot and so I took cipro while I was in Congo for my gut health and for in Uganda white or my left labrum I came back I got another round of sickness I took cipro I come back I tear my right labrum come back at tear my meniscus and so they're like you probably definitely have probably cipro and methyl in Texas so did you get operations on your labrum or your meniscus so you got your labrum surgically repaired both of them no just the left one but I need the right moment fuck yeah and then I got my meniscus trimmed up geez oh man it's been it's been wild you've been through the wringer yeah it's been wild but it's all been worth it like like this stuff that happened with Dustin Poirier and khabib and then Dana matching it I mean that that blue as well explain what you mean because people don't understand what you're saying yeah do it Dustin donating money for fight for the Forgotten and Dana matching that money into you as well yeah that's was nuts so for that fight which was basically the modern-day Rocky story the undefeated Russian they're building an arena for him yeah arguably never lost around potentially and or at least a fight and Dustin goes there the underdog and he started the good fight foundation his own foundation with his wife Jolie and their awesome I was actually on my first ever bow fishing trip and I get a call or a text Instagram message from Jolie saying that Dustin her want to help us raise funds for this fight so I get back to him then they call me and I literally have a bow fishing like thing in my hand was my first time going I didn't get anything but uh anyways they they say they want to help us raise funds I'm like this is awesome they put up a fundraiser for twenty five thousand dollars to help us drill a well for an orphanage so this orphanage for the pygmies there it's a school but they've all lost their parents a lot of them because of HIV and their water source was taken out by a flood a torrential flood that happened there so in the 80s they had built this kind of sort of well it's more what's called a springbok it was like a mountain fed spring well the mud got all in it busted up the pipes from the 80s there was no way to recover that thing so they needed a new one and so Dustin decided to set a goal to help us raise funds for twenty five thousand to be able to put a big water tower with a big solar system that put piped water into the classrooms into their living quarters into the kitchen or the cafeteria and so through the fight we had it funded and then after that the phone just kept coming in Dustin and khabib exchanged shirts and then khabib said he was gonna auction off his shirt and give a hundred percent of it to Dustin so that brought in a hundred thousand dollars Wow Dana said he would match it Dana matched it and so we're gonna be able to drill seven wells now not just one with water tower but seven wells we're serving the other six right now we're getting close to finishing the first one so has this the parasites and this disease is this in any way weakened your desire to go back there no not weaken my desire to go back there just just influenced or encouraged me to uh to be a little smarter when I'm there what would you do differently just not go in the water mm-hmm I could stay in nicer places like the doc team stayed in a hotel last time and you didn't I actually did and that was the first time I had ever done that normally I sleep in the twig and leaf huts I sleep on the dirt and if I'm rained on I'm rained on and and I don't use a mosquito net and things like that just I wanted to live like they lived and not have any of the real comfort comfort sand luxuries and then then wonder why why they don't have that or this or another button yeah now I'm gonna take my own food I'm not going to eat the food there that can be contaminated I'm gonna make sure everything I eat and you know I have clean hands before I eat it and I normally do that but just double-checking everything Purell eat the food I bring sleep in a hotel and just go on day trips there and that'll probably be smarter anyways because if we bring someone with us normally it's just me going but last time we brought Chris cyborg and she she helped with the kid she helped drill two wells there so I was awesome we're up to sixteen wells now in Uganda Wow 61 total and we're about to get 30 acres of land with the money that came in from Dustin and kabhi but she concerned at all about catching anything washers yeah she got a little sick but I think it was just from this chicken though he had and that was like chicken soup I don't think they they may be cooked the chicken long enough and so she got a little sick from that but no I think I think going back is going to be okay and then doing strategic smaller trips what really messed up Chris was so in Uganda the pygmies lived in the simile key national forest which was bordering Congo well they were kicked out of the Cong or the the rainforest by the Ugandan wildlife Authority to protect the forest you know they are the protectors of the forest why do you kick them out of the forest they're not poachers they only take what they need and they're they're hunter-gatherers but they yeah anyways so they they got rid of them in the forest put them behind a slum in this little town and so they put them on one acre of land over 300 people over 300 people living on one acre of land that's actually their land that they can call theirs so we're walking around and they did that six years before we get there and the chief told us that there's now 35 families only a hundred and fifty-one people and that um they're scared that if it goes another six years that they're all going to be gone that their people group won't exist anymore and so that was chief or King Zito that told us that and so we're walking around in Chris Chris kinda gets tripped up a little bit on this mound she looks down and she looks down and sees all these mounds around her and she said what are these mountains and the chief said that's so-and-so and this is so and so and like says a name and says a name it was like we live on our grit on top of our graveyard we don't have anywhere to bury our dead Jesus Christ and so uh over three hundred people on one acre of land now there's only a hundred fifty one people that's buried in the ground right there because the slums threw out their sewage and it goes right through their land oh my god so we've got them back five acres of land right now but they're practicing how to farm on that and then we're about to get 13 more acres of land and then they'll be able to live on the five acres and have these little plots of land for households for a thousand two thousand dollars each we can build them a home and then they can start farming at thirty acres and we'll want to expand that to 50 or 100 to where they can have sustenance farming to feed themselves and then they'll be able to feed the community and sell that and then be able to send their kids to school with school uniforms and buying school fees or paying school fees and stuff like that Wow yeah this makes you realize how easy we have it that's what makes you realize how easy we have oh man absolutely and so that's why whenever you ask me like does this make you not want to go back I'm like me and look at the challenges that they have each and every day have you got everything that you catch over there dengue fever malaria yeah what it was how do you say anything dosto just oh and this is a parasitic diseases like a I think it's in the Fluke family or it's a worm yeah yeah and then hopefully I don't have anything else besides that but this toxicity stuff cipro or methyl and that could be messaged your diet as well yeah yeah my wife move up now I mostly I eat meat but I mostly vegetables like more of that like the small portion is meat it'll be chicken or fish or something lean mm-hmm a lot of nuts and a lot of thick leafy green vegetables and if you found that that's how that's helped me well that's helped me a lot you're juicing about yep yeah juice well with uh with a Vitamix oh so you get all the fiber in there as well yeah the fiber Wow that's been really good and then and then I've been keeping myself busy if I can't go there we're really starting to expand our mission and vision here stateside mm-hmm to bully prevention because Joe it's nuts right now the second leading cause of death so butch is Raiden's grandfather and he is an old bull rider and Raiden lives with with Butch and Claudia's grandparents right now and they found him within his forearm he wrote I want to kill myself and Sharpie and he's 12 he's 12 which said the first time Raiden wanted to kill himself that he knew of when it was whenever Raiden was 9 years old so he's 9 years old and already suicidal and Butch said that that just makes his heart want to fall out of his chest you know I'm his grandfather how does my 12 year old grandson not have enough to live for and the leading 2nd leading cause of death among kids from 10 to 14 is suicide if you're between the ages of 10 to 14 that's the second reason and bullying is a cause yes not most of its from bullying because bullying is linked to the increase and depression addiction isolation do they think that the people who do it is it because they were bullied at one point time were abused physically so they do think that an easy way to remember that is hurt people hurt people right hurt people hurt people whether that's an addict or muli but here's a statistic from the CDC it's funny the CDC found out that I had didn't get fever and then also the CDC did the study on bullying and the number three at risk of suicide is the bully the person that acts out by being a bully mmm number two surprisingly is the victim there the second highest risk so then you think who's who's number one well number one is actually the one that does both they are bullied and then they act out by being a bully and so they're getting it on both ends no positive feelings at all negativity this is huge what can you do for bully awareness right like how can you how can you prevent it or how can we mitigate it yeah I think it's by promoting a culture of cultivating a culture of kindness and I know that can sound a little wimpy no I don't think so at all yeah but if you look at Rafael Lovato jr. he was bullied because he didn't look like everybody else George st. Pierre so a lot of fighters are bullied most most fighters I find bullied you know not being the bully right and so I think to cultivate a culture of kindness there's actually the school in Oklahoma it's pretty awesome they're called Edmond Santa Fe they selected us between a 44 applicants so we were up against like Boys and Girls Club and make-a-wish she's phenomenal organizations Special Olympics and some really really great charities and nonprofits out there last year the school selected a foster home and they raised in a week this high school raised two hundred and thirty four thousand dollars a high school in their philanthropy week because they wanted to help these kids get a new like main center among the foster homes so this year they selected us because they want to get our bully prevention program into public and private school so what is the prevention program like well yeah so it's mostly character development with bully prevention inside of it so it's a 12-week program and it's 12 weekly lessons so we have it online it's digital it's on our website fight for the Forgotten org and if you click hero's and waiting you'll find it that's our curriculum what's called as heroes in waiting and what that is is there's a digital curriculum where I teach the teacher and struck the instructor how to instruct the lesson that week but then there's a video for the parents and for the students that's the weekly hero challenge and so they get a weekly lesson or Matt chat discussion and then they get a weekly challenge which the challenge will be something like recognized when you're being a bystander or my favorite is probably go out your mission this week is that your hero challenge is to go out and complete a secret random act of kindness so the rules are you have to be safe you have to be smart but you have to be completely anonymous and you have to go out and make someone feel great and so journal or report back to us you know what did you do how'd that make them feel how that make you feel how can you build onto this for next week and you go out and you complete these missions because I think first you have to educate the kids that they are part of the solution and part of the problem they just to pick where they where they're gonna be because in bullying if you stand by and you watch if you laugh giggle like in that video there's 12 12 kids in the bathroom four or five are filming it you filming it is encouraging it you standing by and not doing anything you're actually not an innocent bystander you're a silent supporter because you're standing there and you're not doing anything they're actually trying to pass laws about kids and schools filming other kids getting beat up and making them somehow a part of it an accomplice yeah some way shape or form because you are you're at least an encourage er yeah and then if you stand by and watch you are an accomplice you're not doing anything it you didn't choose it it shows you what happened in those kids in the video that we're doing those things to raid in therapy so they're minors so I can't really talk about what's happened but the school has taken appropriate or at least in their eyes appropriate and swift action the parents are thankful to the school and the school district for them taking this serious I know that the the family has felt this has been going on since he was 9 at least and now he's 12 so three years and they say the only reason now something's being done is because it was filmed because it's on video and it went viral but there's been some fun stuff we pull up some was raid in pictures it's another one recently with Dylan Danis Dylan yes God jiu-jitsu lessons UK for juju solutions for this young boy I was also beat up in the bathroom and there's a film of that as well you know I'm talking about yeah in Dylan posted this video too and he got over ten million views yeah which was awesome in Raphael no is actually going to scholarship Rayden and his brother Brock with jiu-jitsu lessons oh that's amazing so they're gonna start doing martial arts training after Raiden's done with his hyperbarics and his Russian has settled down he's gonna come into the mats and be part of the kids program the little warriors for for Raphael school which is the best youth program in the state that's awesome yeah that's awesome is there a way to pull up some of those pictures of of Radin and this is kind of cool I'm gonna give you this because uh Raphael really likes this and it's some tenth planet guys there's Raiden after after a actually a press conference all the news wanted to like post pictures of them or they wanted to get exclusives and so as parents are being chased all around town people are literally posting their home address online daxing them but daxing the bullies mainly saying here's the twelve-year-old girls address and go go find her you can go through a couple more of those pictures there's some pretty cool ones where he's eaten check fly yeah he likes chick-fil-a a lot as deaths is a chicken eaten full but there's at a football game that Edmund Santa Fe they've surrounded him with a lot of love and then it's been cool like Emily my wife has said oh here here's if we can have volume on this this is pretty cool making you a video I am introducing Raiden to what how this he asked me what hummus is so we got him some some carrots and hummus the chips are for me that you packed us and all right my man try carrots and hummus [Music] I actually really good really good yeah so what's the book yeah so this right here is the jujitsu planner and what it does is you have actually a like a training autopsy and you you take notes what you're lessened of what you're learning the techniques you're learning and this is out of tenth planet or at least the guys that created this bin is a tenth planet Austen guy a guy named Zack more that's there too so he's available online so anyone yeah I'm one of these it's available online whether they get Instagram its jitsu planner where's the website I think it's Jitsu plan or calm or jujitsu plan org and so and they give 10% to fight for the Forgotten now it's pretty cool so that's yeah 10% of the proceeds go to us but try to opt in so game it's got a training schedule shows you when you're training so you to mark down so you're essentially you're held accountable for your lessons yeah what is this an injury report pay attention to your body interesting you have supplements you can put down there like showing you like what's hurt what's going on and then you have a competition tracker so you can record your opponents how it went and you can also add a tournament like start scouting out your competition and then they're gonna have it to where they they make new additions and things like that and so as it grows and as it scales every planner they have for now on 10% is gonna go to fight for the forgot this is very interesting man training autopsy yeah I like it yeah you dig it session notes what was drilled strengths weaknesses role notes and then for next class I like this this is listen man writing things down you know anything you can do where you're focusing on something and trying to prove if you can write it down it's better it was this inspired by the the kind of book that you have would you exactly a book was called again this one's called clear it's just a habit tracker and then you have like a journal in it too and I really like that and I like how I also have another one called the full focus planner in that anyway you can plan out your day your week mm-hmm and you break it down and I can train track my food my training all my important meetings and for me writing it down physically is better than having it digitally yeah I just remember it better me too if I know if I haven't written it down I'll probably forget it I keep notes like comedy notes I keep them on my phone but then when I go to do a show I always write it out always it's really smart they say the writing things so there's something about physically putting a pen to paper then like really commits it to memory than anything else yeah so that's why I have those two actually three of another one called the five-minute planner I think three journals around with Rios I do the habit tracker the full focus planner for my daily and weekly schedule the habit tracker that I can also just take other notes and then the five-minute planner or five-minute journal you start off with what three things what would make today great three things and then three things actually start with three things you're grateful for so you write that down then three things that would make today amazing than a daily affirmation and then at the end of the day what three great things did happen today and then the very last one is how could you make today better and so kind of this reflection of I could have done this better today known so that way you're kind of keeping yourself accountable and that and I also have something else for you my man I can't come bearing gifts yeah that's what the fuck is that dude this is called a Bushwhacker I think something they used in the Congo no no we'll get there what in the fuck bro so that is like I said be careful cuz that thing is really sharp the weight behind it I don't want you to cut yourself okay that's like a giant wood handle like you could double fist this sucker yeah Mike Jones knife and tool you actually have one of his knife yeah I do and he made this because he is now giving 5% of all of his knife sales to fight for the Forgotten and he was turned on to us through the show this one's another one that he made my friend Mike Hoggard came yeah that's that's what he said wow it's got a built-in little sharpener yep actually that's that's a knife or a fire starter it is yeah oh it's a fire stick and it's a hallucinatory there you use that tie over the top oh it's also a bungee okay now a knife itself super sharp its Damascus steel oh it's pretty and then that's his bow hunter style knife mmm the wood is koa wood from Hawaii so he thought you'd like that and then he always has his little signature smile yeah I follow him on the Instagram yeah he's a great guy yeah the other knife that Mike had made for me is a bow hunter as well this is a beautiful man thank you thanks Mike - that's pretty man and there's one more there from Mike Jones himself so he did a thing called knife for the Forgotten and he sold a hundred percent of his knifes for a fight for the Forgotten and so that one's a chef's knife I thought you'd really like the wooden handle is actually black wood from Africa so it's probably from Tanzania but it's a chef's knife and he's got that smiley face in there but it took him like 15 yeah I knew how much you appreciate like craftsman work so that took him 15 to 18 hours to make that that's pretty it's a small handle - it's interesting wow that's beautiful thanks man yeah man oh you like it I'm done oh I'm not worthy well and then that was just to set up this one was this knife is what it was actually all about but Mike said ah let me let me throw in a knife or two because he literally gives 5% of all his knifes it's just one of the ones that was made by the pygmies that was made by King Zito himself it was just some scrap metal it's not the sharpest knife and he said it wasn't the best for me to give to you but I thought it was the most unique that's his that's his actual kind of signature design that he puts in there it's so light yeah it's crazy what is this wood so it's a wood that's out of the simile key national forest and they've been collecting it for generations people can feel this how light this is light feels like styrofoam it's quite easy so they have these different kind of like almost quirk yeah feeling knives or handles please tell him I said thank you I will that's right oh very nice of him Lindsey i.t oh wow that's so pretty so yeah that's cool man I was able to got you one of those that right um and then uh Dustin Poirier one as well that's dope beautiful yeah so what's the plans now like you're you're going you're trying to get your health back together and when are you planning on going back to the Congo again so I'm definitely going to Uganda sometime soon hopefully well if I could fight first quarter of next year I how is that possible I don't know but I'm being optimistic I'm not gonna rush it but it's been over to you shoulder surgery yeah that takes six months anyway yeah so how you gonna do that that's first quarter yeah forever cuz we're almost in November so November in two days it's true so December January okay now we're into the first quarter of the next yeah they said structurally I could fight with this structurally I hate that word please no man come on man I uh I need to go slow yeah also you don't you don't fight for a while please lie for a while yeah you kind of get everything you gotta get hell order man and that's what I've been telling people and people are there's people are really excited for me to fight but then also I know I can hold it as people just need fans yeah oh yeah well the holy they'll hear this and they love you and they're like Justin please don't not right now yeah get yourself a hundred percent back right so I guess what we're doing is actually there's two really exciting things for now you said so what no um we're doing two things back-to-back or actually simultaneously for a fight for the Forgotten we have an end of the year fundraising competition and so last year we did it and we had a we invited about a hundred martial arts academies to raise funds on our behalf and in eight weeks we raised 135 thousand dollars that's amazing it was incredible that's amazing now we're calling this our second annual fundraising competition last year the Academy that won the top fundraiser his name was James right out of martial arts and more in North Carolina their Academy had just been hit by a hurricane and so since it was hit by a hurricane the mats were ruined and the the equipment all their pads and mitts and bags were all molded so they had to get rid of everything well they wrote they won the fundraising turn tournament and they got a better than new gym it was over at $20,000 gym renovation that century martial arts did and also zebra athletics that's cool so literally they got a better than new Academy that's very cool that's very cool and it was because they were fundraising on our behalf this year we've got a top ten instead of the top one fundraiser gets a gets a prize now the top ten get a martial arts draft pick so martial arts superstars world champions whether it's former current UFC or Bellator champions Hall of Famers martial arts coaches of the year that will fly out to their Academy to do a seminar or a training day or a fan experience for fundraising on our behalf that's fucking awesome so we have well that's so cool of zebra and so cool of century yeah centuries been around forever yeah they made the kicking genes yes I have those that lace up in the front like a pair still make those yeah I used to wear the Taekwondo version of the tournament so used to wear the ones that laced up in the front I like those you know because they made like kickboxing pants make member when these two have kickboxing used to be above the waist like pka karate style since we used to dance to make those pads for karate tournaments and I still think they have the best bag they have the sweet spot is the Muay Thai bank I have I bought like four different kinds of Muay Thai packs for this gym here and the centry one that I have at home is the best one yeah I have a 150-pound with the big muy Thai bag it's the best one it's a sweet spot between not too soft not too hard just which is perfect well they're the only ones that actually make those here super foot yeah I was just with him kicking genes how is he doing he's doing good he was aged from that but I believe he has yeah he's because he was the first commentator for the UFC really yeah is that Chuck down the bottom there's charters Chuck yeah yes in the summer too I got to meet him a couple times I still love meeting him I still get a fucking boyish thrill just the fact that he knows who I am I can't believe it behind your legs oh yeah but Chuck and build super foot walls I mean those guys were the real innovators back in the early days of kickboxing in America you know when those guys yeah if you go back and watch some of those tournaments that those those guys fought in yeah Chuck Norris was a legitimate world champion yeah and I never really knew Dallas Fort Worth had such a big martial arts oh yeah huge martial arts background uh Chuck there and then you know Bill Wallace's story he had a fucked-up knee and so he couldn't kick with both legs you'd only kick with one leg you know yeah so he developed this insane left like super foot yeah so he and a hook kick like a hook kick is a kick that it's very rare that someone develops out to the point where you know you can knock people out with it it's just a weird kick and you don't really see it very often in MMA it's just real I mean I think Shawn Jordan drop yeah Jerry Lewis that's right the hook kick and like these crazy cuz Shawn is a tank of a man I mean he's he's a small heavier short short 510 but he's at least 260 I was a big fella he's in the range of 260 so to see him live those tree trunk like I know were for LSU yes and the guy could do fucking backflips these are crazy athlete but to see him throw hit a hook kick you like what yeah absolutely you know but it's such a rare technique Conor throws it he throws it occasionally he does but bill super foot Wallace he figured out how to fuck people up with just one leg and it was really hard to deal with like that style of attack that he developed in his early days I got to see him fight live ones way way way back in the day well yeah there it is here it is well that's crazy crazy that he hit me dropped him with a hook kick to the heels a picture of it where's Shawn these days he was fighting for the PFL was him but I think I don't know if he's in this tournament or not I know he was in the last tournament man so him and Josh big Josh fought I think Colton yep decision and so yeah I guess for now though we're doing that tournament that competition in last year at the last 4 or 5 kind of top gyms or schools competed for it all the way until midnight of New Year's Eve in central time because that's when the cutoff was and the winner was gonna get their gym renovated so there's four or five at the end and we raised like 30 grand on the last day because everyone wanted the gym renovation so this year we've got a top three prize pack that's like that the first one gets like a $25,000 gym renovation from zebra and century they get featured in black belt magazine get featured in Marshall it may success I think Bruce Buffer is gonna announce him as the winner they're gonna get a trophy in a medal they're gonna championship belt for the champion and then they get the first round draft pick of guys like Rashad Evans just engag Cris cyborg Rose namajunas Pat Barry Rafi Lovato jr. Sean G Laboral these people are gonna fly out Frank Mir are gonna fly out and do a seminar at their their academy or propose anything whoever it is yeah so whoever is one through 10 you want to get number one or number two because you get the top draft pick what's the top draft pick who's the top one well whoever raises the most first they get the they claim the first draft pick and then they get to choose between that list of like 20 martial arts superstars that's what is Dustin Poirier coming out to your to your gym or is it Chris cyborg or is it just engaged or not Evans so when you secure the first place you get the first-round draft pick and then all the way down to 10 and then on the individual side they're gonna get the yeah it's on our website so it's fight for the free on.org slash heroes and we're even missing a few of the people that are man Richie Bowie there you go Richie man yeah I thought he would like that jujitsu planner but he's going to be in it with Ali Malay we're missing patrons ant and Austin Vander furred that's awesome Oh even even John hackle Minh oh really when his name is go out and train someone and put on a bully-proof seminar yeah he's got a great Instagram page yeah he does he's in every podcast such a fucking character man I just drove down the what do you call it the PHC post a civic ozawa oh yeah at PCH yeah and stopped into the pit and saw him and yeah slower seeing san luis obispo yeah that's awesome that's a cool little town and that is yeah he loves it out there yeah his wife sweet and they have a great Academy there yeah he's he's old-school hardcore training methods he does like wheel barrels filled with shit you gotta carry up a hill and stuff all that kind of stuff yeah I walked into the boot camp area and it's where his wife runs the women's boot camp you say no no you don't to be in here this is like this is the torture room or something like that's not a dungeon you don't about the pit itself is the outdoor gym and outdoor octagon I have set up being pretty badass as wild upstairs he has a podcast studio does he yeah he's doing a podcast yeah Jesus Christ everybody's doing a podcast who's not I'm not yet you know no weird why should that's what my buddy Jacob wells wants to do is start a podcast me why not if you fight for the Forgotten podcast a great idea I mean it's another way to raise awareness cool yeah Jacob is actually buddies with he's a he's a hilarious guy he's friends with Theo von Wow he wrote a few jokes for Theo and Theo said that they're too dark he couldn't he couldn't share them but him and Theo when Theo came to OKC Jacob and us hung out and anyways Jacob has started this GoFundMe for radom because he knows their family in radan has like eight thousand dollars in medical bills is going to need counseling so three to five thousand dollars of like a counseling budget and then they want to do something practical for the family and I've gone to 20 hyperbaric treatments with rain and now we've had family dinners at my house at their house at our offices his grandma can cook she can cook some meatloaf and she had me over there and they live in this mobile home park outside Oklahoma City and the boys so the dad he had worked in automotive industry and then at a dealership and then he came and kind of took over the family restaurant well it started to struggle the family restaurant did in anyways his dad now has two jobs is trying to make ends meet his mom can't really work because she has to take him to appointments whether it's counseling or for his hearing aid or for his diabetes or for his autism she's taken with all these different appointments and so they had to take in Scotland's mom because of health issues so the parents now have one of the grandparents living there so they're in the bedrooms they had to send raid and and his brother brought to live with the other grandparents down the street so still the same mobile home park but they put them in like the three-bedroom kind of nicer one with more space and so Jacobs like what would really help this family and bless them in a way cuz his dad doesn't want to hand out he's not asking for extra stuff or he didn't come up with this idea but Jacobs like what if we could reunite the family so get his hyperbaric treatment covered get his counseling covered but then what if we could even raise funds for a either a single-wide three-bedroom two-bath or maybe it's a double-wide that just reunites the family that gets Brock and Raiden back in the home with his parents and so Jacob brought that idea up we shared with his parents they started ballin just saying that that's their greatest need is just to have the boys back in the home hmm and so there's this car dealership in Oklahoma City called hudiburg and they're really community minded they give to fight for the Forgotten and they give to a lot of organizations and so they have a campaign called hudiburg helps and so hudiburg helps as sponsoring this I think they've already raised like eight thousand nine thousand dollars it's called stand with Raiden on go on me so it's GoFundMe hashtag stand with Raiden and I think it's already at eight nine ten thousand dollars of like the fifty thousand dollar goal so that's something that we're focused on now my wife was like hey why are you do fight for The Forgotten couldn't send funds to one kid individually that's showing biased and we have to have like an a a pool of people to choose from applicants and it has to be unbiased for us to fund something so I can rally around him I can be his friend but we can't pay for his medical treatment or pay for his counseling mmm but GoFundMe can and so Jacob started this it was his idea and he just wanted to rally around Radin my wife asked me why are you doing all this even though the funds can't be raised for fight for the Forgotten it's like well you know I don't know I just I really connect with Raiden and she goes I know why you're doing this you're just trying to be the guy that you needed whenever you were his age and that that really uh I don't know that one kind of hit home because when I was 12 or 13 years old it was suicidal being bullied it would have been cool to have someone rally around me a few years later at coaches that rallied around me that made me believe in myself but it's been awesome and seeing Raphael come alongside Raiden and his family scholarship um the Steelers the Pittsburgh Steelers the LA chargers that Baker Mayfield all these people posting videos and support forum Mick Foley as their favorite wrestler WWE mankind or anyways he made a video for Raiden and his mom and dad literally cried because that was their favorite wrestler and he knows exactly what they're going through because they're his son makes Mick Foley son has autism and so to see that support go out to raid and like that just blew him away that's very cool of you man I don't know what is in store for you in the next life but I sent some sort of sainthood I don't know about yeah I just thought your whole life is dedicated to helping people it's very humbling man it really is I mean everything you do is helping other people your your goals and your desires even for you fighting with people maybe they don't know some people don't know you got back into fighting so that you could raise awareness for fight for the Forgotten and you know became a world-class heavyweight you really became a better version of yourself than you were when you're fighting in the UFC yeah you know and then I think also through Rafael Lovato yeah training with him your jujitsu skills came out big time yeah big time yeah and I think this is what I've learned through Raphael and through a guy out here named ed my lat that's become a friend these guys say it's usually it's either Raphael or ad that says it's usually the person with the most reasons that usually wins or the person with the most reasons usually wins unless you're fighting Anderson Silva is prime that's true that's true you must have had a lot of reason so good man it doesn't matter what you believe they're gonna fuck you up yes you know but but but knowing your why and phony it was for you it's like how to be I love that that quote you have in our programs called heroes and waiting right well you say be the hero of your own movie will be your own hero of your own movie and after you become that hero be a hero for someone else and let them know they can be the hero of their own movie yeah and so our premise is what is a hero it's not someone with supernatural strength or superhuman power it's actually someone with a humble heart that just sees a need and takes action they don't need Instagram likes they don't need the exposure what they do it because it's the right thing to do you know and so how can we just see a need and take action make a difference be the change we want to see in the world where do you see yourself in like 10 15 years do you do you see yourself pursuing this exact same thing you know past the point where you're fighting anymore do you see yourself just continuing with fight for the Forgotten you think that's probably going to be your future the fight for the Forgotten is well so we became an official 501 C 3 charity last August mm-hmm so it was more of a passion project before that now we're official 501 C 3 it was of August we've had since time more than 3000 donors from all 50 states it's very cool with squarespace's doing excuse me square and the cash app is doing without a doubt that's amazing 58 different countries have donated Wow 50 different countries joke I mean that's the quarter of all you're raising awareness well that value sharing the the platform with me so that I can get the word out there I mean I won't fight for the forgotten to outlive me this isn't just you know ashen project of of justin-brand I want it to be how many people are involved in it now and from the organization's on the organizational side we have five voting board members we have seven and we might take that up to nine and we should tell people that we're gonna be doing a charity event yeah in Los Angeles we're just trying to get a venue we were trying to move it now to the first quarter of 2020 but we're gonna do a charity show at one of the big theaters in LA yeah that's gonna be incredible yeah that's gonna be so fun we get together all my funny friends yeah I had some fun oh I know a lot of people when you go I just got to record with Mike Tyson yesterday and he told me tell you what's up I'm gonna do a show to it I'm so I couldn't do it during this month it's so bright oh oh yeah don't do it this month I'm not funny that Mike Tyson has become this crazy weed activist yeah yeah and and his resort that he was telling you said it's amazing land with weed what they're gonna do they're doing concerts there and shit I could stay there yeah well so what he's gonna do and hopefully this isn't I'm not committing him to it but they kind of said we're gonna do this for this fundraising tournament that we're doing right now the competition they're gonna give away and we'll have to update people later but for fifteen twenty twenty-five thousand dollars someone donating they're gonna get like an exclusive VIP experience at Tyson ranch well you hang with Mike Tyson and you get to get high with a picture and tour the studio and hotbox and I think you get to sit in on an episode or so yeah Wow something like that and it's gonna be a higher ticket item so that way they're like it's not just some crazy person that's very cool but they're doing that I was thinking there might be a way we can talk about this more afterwards but we maybe give a fan experience to someone at the comedy show we could give like you VIP front-row tickets or something like that if someone donates to help kick-start our fundraising competition because what we're doing right now last year raised 135 hundred thirty-seven thousand this year was shooting for 200 to 250 thousand mm-hmm and then we wanted every year to have become kind of the premier fundraising event of the martial arts world the combat sports world where everyone knows about this charity event and you can win once-in-a-lifetime experiences with martial arts superstars or personalities right things like that to where we could build it into a sustainable this is going to bring in seven figures a year a million dollars a year and then that way we know our budget how many wells we can drill how much land we can get how many forums we can start how many kids here we can help with the martial arts curriculum it takes us close to 500 dollars to get into the martial arts academies with the bully prevention curriculum now as this expands this fight for The Forgotten expands and you do more and more work in the Congo do you anticipate moving to other parts of the world yeah so we already in Uganda right we started that last year but we really kick-started at April with this big kind of celebration on new land five acres because of Dustin's donation we're gonna take that up to 30 more acres so 35 acres and Uganda we want to get that to a hundred we want to get it to even more than that there's a potential that with fight for The Forgotten we could potentially start up a social enterprise or what are those called be corpse or something like that where is a social entrepreneurship gig where we start up maybe a coffee farm maybe a honey farm in these mountainous regions um and the pygmies can have a sustainable job they love coffee and honey those are two things that they love coffee and coffee and honey that's funny there's this but John G as a pygmy man grandfather an elder in mah Baku loo village but John G he's actually in the in the book a picture with my wife leaning over and she's squatting down and she's still as tall as he is and she's in a full squat and she hidden so he's a really little guy but this one time I saw him his grandkids had just raided a honey hive or bee hive and they just had honey all over their hands their arms their faces - getting stung no they get stung you get stung like crazy yeah they start a fire at the bottom and then they throw a vine around it and then they just walk up it with your feet and you're holding onto the vines oh Jesus and it's crazy you take an ax up there and then you just start hacking into the tree with Africanized calling you Oh which are killer beasts which isn't pets so there's killer bees or gangster they're quick they're grown like I'm stealing honey from killer oh my god and no one else everyone else is freaked out by it how many things do they get hundreds hundreds but it's worth it to them so they start that fire underneath and the smoke goes up so that helps keep them off then if two people climb up it the sole person's job on the back is to have these Leafs from a twig and they just are hitting the bees off of the guy raiding the hive do you remember when everybody was worried that Africanized killer bees were gonna come over here and kill us all yes that was like a big fear like 20 years ago how the killer bees they've been spotted in New Mexico whoa they came up from but then they been treated right and and without him see bees right I think this yeah we don't have to worry about those are bees when they went on the Amazon and came up here those would be dangerous yeah so these guys they do this they and honey think they catch it in a bag or something like how do they they put it in a basket a basket the basket handle Oh India's some guys doing pretty much the same exact thing those are the killer bees yeah those are different piece but the same strategy seems strategy have you you could reach in and grab bees this guy's an asshole what are you doing man have you guys seen that there's a certain type of honey that has some sort of psychedelic effect and it's a very popular honey I want to say Nepal somewhere is it Nepal yeah and these guys they climb up to get this shit it's like on the side of cliffs like see you have anything else and yeah see these guys use these ropes to climb up to get that rope looks sketchy as fuck that looks like some homemade shit right there and so they this honey hunting work is very mean it's the craziest thing I've seen people do but these guys this honey 200 feet in the air man this is a different kind of honey for some reason this honey makes you trip balls of course it's a vice documentary yeah the Nepalese honey that makes people hallucinate so they add something into it no no no no no it has to do with whatever these plants these guys are the pollens are yeah so they're making a psychedelic honey just naturally yes natural so you can put it in your tea and meet Jesus that seems dangerous um so and maybe maybe it's like a mild micro dosing type oh that's true I don't know so yeah so like that that's what they just grab it and eat in honeycombs to the other Center yeah so these kids I think there's a video on my youtube Jaime's you can find out of these kids climbing these trees I think it's just Justin ran fight for the Forgotten is the YouTube channel and there's this kid that I put a GoPro on his head because he was just climbing trees like crazy onto the canopy of the rainforest he's like nine years old oh my god mine's 200 feet in the air and he looks down at us it's a 12-minute video or something we could fast-forward to any kind of safety harness right no he's literally just doing a shimmying up it he doesn't even have a bomb he's doing it with his arms in his thighs he's nine he's just my daughter scaling it just scaling and he looks down on us I can barely see him in the tree still he's like over 200 feet tall and and what's he getting up there will he practice for to difference he had his bow and arrow up there so he could shoot nest and shoot birds out of nest in the trees from 200 feet up tuna feet up but he's shooting to other trees oh my god and then they that's how they collect honey look at them this is a little guy this is him going from a little tree to getting over to a huge tree next to it but that's him but bow fee and I lived there for 3 months I think in this village and he's seriously just scaling the tree yeah it's a 12-minute video what it's wild if we can't have sound it's just him breathing hi guys Oh sweatin and he just keeps going until he gets and once he gets to the big part of the tree I should go back oops up back a little bit more because he starts just zooming down he gets to the top and looks down at us and whenever you see us I think this is where it is maybe when whenever he looks down look at that oh hi oh boy and that's not even when he was at the very top and he's just using his hands and feet yeah he literally has no rope no vine don't you think you should be under him to catch him yeah but no from 200 feet up break your arms yeah that's like squish me there's a there's one other video oh yeah this right here look at this sharpshooters of these little mice they put mice in the middle of the village and they shoot down with bows and arrows yep um that seems mean he got reduce eat them yeah yeah the UNAM so that's their target practice so they show grass grass I've that's a rat by the way a mouse yeah they'd shoot these rats and then they eat them yep and actually not this one you eaten right I have four so like not good it's finished Ricky I've had I've had Python I've had a cobra you a cobra I've had monkey I think I'm lucky on there that's dark is there is there a video of the kid with the machete what's it like eating monkey does that freak you out eat one your ancestor this was right before the Ebola breakup oh I didn't know about it and then also an Ebola and they're like it's from eating monkeys oh Jesus I think I'll tell me acute a bola we always eat monkeys none of us have ever had Ebola what kind of what method of cooking is it like a smoked monkey I just smoked it yeah wrap it a banana leaf yeah it's a very like stringy hard muscular animal yeah my friend Steve Rinella had some I think in Guyana he uh he ate a monkey see this look at this kid here he's with a machete the machetes as long as that kid is tall was he doing chopping down this tree I just tried it on the tree for firewood mmm but that kid looks like he's five years old if that he's younger than that I think how old well he might be five maybe four four or five and they're letting him use a machete to chop down a fucking tree do because this kid climb the trees with that the kid believe came I saw climb that tree he was doing that with bows and arrows oh my god with bows and arrows here so hard look here that's just hanging out by him tell us the kid is right next to him how many of these guys that live in these villages are injured uh I mean they get injured from time to time yeah but they're super smart with the blades I mean they grow up with mean throats like getting cut I mean just injured injured there's no medical man they roll their ankles through the forest they when they're climbing stuff need ligaments yeah what do they wind up doing they just heal heal a lot like by giving it rest what's kind of cool about the forest life or the village life is they literally they are up early right when the sun's coming up they're they're up they're down when the Sun Goes Down and so they're in tune with nature yeah 2016 rhythms Akkadian rhythms was looking for yeah and then midday during the heat of the day right 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. they're normally just chillin napping in their Hut to where they're out of the Sun and so they're up working before that they rest and if they need to go back out before the sun's down they go back out a second time hunting gathering come back in prepare it what's that primary look what what are they trying to hunt well uh so for us antelope forest hog or wild hog out there lots of different kinds of birds parrots different things like that only using bows and arrows hmm home in bows now's right homemade yeah definitely in the dangerous ones I'm gonna have to bring you a bow and arrow I haven't had done that I have one that is that I really love I'll see if I can get to get you on but they will give you two arrows one has a metal blade and one's just a sharpened tip and then they ask you which one would you use on an antelope and you choose which one you you choose and then you ask which one would you use on a bird and then you choose which one would you think between a blade and the sharpened wood which one would you use on the antelope you'd use a blade okay and then on a bird which one would you sharp and stick yeah that's what makes sense to our mind right yeah it's actually the opposite how come they use the metal on the bird because that's going to kill the bird right they use the wooden tip because they they dip that in poison Oh Jean and so that's what they take the bigger animals out with as I say so they just have to hit it oh yeah anywhere in its body and it's in there now does that poison infect them no Nate it looks out it's out of this there's these two things it's these berries and these not roots but it's a like a root fruit like a potato it's this poisonous black potato that like they mash up and if you if you mess with that stuff the potato gets smashed or something in that oil or that whatever casaba neck asaba because casabas is the Sambas root but also it gets strychnine yeah you have to boil it forever they have to do all this shit too cassava and then then the wayside yes and this is a potato they know they use the strychnine from cassava to poison things as well Wow and they have like a bucket in Rinella show Steve Bernal show the meat-eater which is on it is on Netflix and know the mediator is his website meat eater is a Netflix show but he went to Guyana and he's done a couple trips to different I think Bolivia as well and when he goes to the jungle like this they have this incredibly intricate process for cooking and making this cassava edible and these buckets they have of this sort of processed stuff as they're doing it is fucking hugely toxic yeah and it's just laying around yeah and my kids are playing near it and the the kids have to be so careful yeah the parents have to be so careful with the poison yeah because once they dip those tips of those arrows they don't come back with them they dispose of them really out in the force just too dangerous too dangerous to have around the kids the time yeah cuz toddlers are walking around with bows and arrows already there they have a bow and arrow before they're able to walk so they're just the sharpened wooden tips without the poison dip down and so it's it's awesome and their way of life is so incredible and so that's what we're trying to help the kings of Uganda right now so our trip even Brady who you know Brady was messed up so all of us were um they're just sick over there saying what do you mean I messed up culture shock oh and not just culture shock but what is it whenever you it's not just PTSD like just jolt it with with devastation of like in shock and shock yeah in fact we we could play that one video now it's a documentary trailer that cash app helped fund I mean friends of Joe Rogan and this trailer video is just from our last trip to Uganda it's got sound but I'll speak over it but it kind of sums it all up this little boy named Paolo you'll see in his eyes what I when you see this boy's eyes you'll know just some of the devastation that he's gone through and seen you can see like the eyes are the windows to our soul you can see the heart heartbreak in this kid I think it's called the bots wha trailer video or something like that Jamie but it's um it's got an opening where it's just like things to cash app but then it shows how long is their studio it's about a minute and a half okay well we'll play this then we got to wrap this thing yeah okay got one more thing to give you so that is in the simile key National Forest that's King Zito and the red but they were driven from their ancestral home and they're struggling to survive and this is on that one acre of land that they live on that's some mushrooms but they live in eight structures on this one acre of land and forced to live in this unknown village and literally don't have any food or clean water that's where they live in those shelters that's what they've been given when they were kicked out of the forest but there's no way that's the sewage running through their village and just being abused yeah beyond imagination because they think they're cure for HIV that woman was raped because these men thought they would be cured that's a little Palo there you can see in his eyes and thought they'd be cured by having sex with her yep we're by collecting their blood and Sao Paulo was held down and is that's the new land five acres of land that we were able to get them so this is a celebration just kind of transitioning into dancing with the drums and the leaves but now they have hope that they're gonna survive and here's that the school where they're getting new water and they're in class for the first time they were told that they couldn't go to school that they wouldn't be that they couldn't learn and now actually the top five students at the school over the last six years are all bathua pygmy children that's the new well that they're drinking from one of them so this just celebration they're learning some MMA and we're there to help come alongside them and say hey how can we with our vision to defeat hate with love our mission to knock out bullying worldwide how can we do this in a practical sustainable way and so yeah Joe like that little boy Paulo that you saw has scars on him from people holding him down and slicing him open collecting his blood because they think he's the cure for HIV or the women they're being sexually assaulted some terrible stuff but what we want to do to kind of sum up this documentary when we get there is is have newly informed them back in school them farming for themselves them selling it at the markets and then yeah and then also stateside here so kind of
