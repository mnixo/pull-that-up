we give zero fucks here at the Joe Rogan experience the grass eaters there's supposed to be grass eaters you ever have grass fed beef do you buy grass fed beef no I buy it exclusively now it tastes better where do you get it Whole Foods a lot of organic grocery store now that I probably do routes no you gotta ask for it now yeah cuz a lot of like even when I was that I was at Whole Foods and I I was asking for it and the butcher was actually trying to steer me towards grass-fed meat and he was like it's actually tastier or try to steer me towards corn-fed meat he's like it's actually tastier is more marbling I don't like dude I know what I like I'd like to get that please ya don't like you what are you saying like you're telling me to eat something that's less healthy like you're saying it's tastier I don't even agree I don't agree it's tastier it's a matter of choice and second of all that's been demonstrated the shit is not that good for you like when you're eating corn-fed beef you're eating a sick animal the reason why they're so fat and marbling they're fuckin ready to die like it's like a fucking it's like Rob Ford it's like a v8 the mayor of Toronto I can't be a corn-fed cow fuck is that guy still alive smoking crack and eatin pussy he's there Charlie Sheen man if he came to America he would be the king of Florida fuck yeah if he just went to if he just moved to America long enough where they trusted him and decided to run for mayor of Florida he would be the king of Florida if I think he got a reality show already and then he was such a fuckup they cancelled it after like one episode canceled that's the reality show I want to watch the reality show is just the Internet you don't want an organized bullshit Beverly Hills housewives version of that guy you want him doing impromptu live press conferences where he talks about a woman accusing him of eating her pussy and says I have plenty to eat at home did you see that I wonder why do you see that yeah wonder what his wife this is dead about that almost an insult saying that she probably said ask him again I think we got some leftovers here at the house it doesn't sound like you she has a huge pussy he said she has plenty to eat at home know that he's not eating enough of it you know I think that uh cuz I'm happily married and this is Toronto this isn't some podunk town this is the biggest fuckin City and I know right oh yeah by far yeah it's an enormous city yeah massive metropolitan city has Apollo of international and one of my favorite places to perform on earth love it love Toronto he's a thousand pounds of listen to all this what's going on yesterday why is it by the documents that was released there we go unfortunately it's unfortunate I have to take legal action I don't appreciate people calling Atlanta a prostitute never had a prostitute here I'm very happily married at home this is very disturbing against right unfortunately I have to take legal action against Isaac Krantz and the Georgia star plus and Mark tui I have to take legal action against the waiter that said I was doing lines my wife when they're calling a friend of mine a prostitute Atlanta is not a prostitute she's a friend and it makes me sick how people are saying this so unfortunately I have no other choice I'm the last one to take legal action I can't I can't put up with it anymore so I've named the names litigation will be starting shortly I've had enough that's why I warned you guys yesterday be careful what you wrote okay so that's all I have to say for now and the next thing I want to call Merritt Ana it's in Hamilton and tell them that we're gonna have to spank them of the tiger-cats on the last thing was Olivia gone back then it says that I want to eat her pussy they letting on I've never said that in my life to her I would never do that I'm happy married I've got more than enough to eat at home unscripted nails everywhere and the best part about that video is after he leaves one of the reporters goes I fucking love that guy morning reporter says it it's like finally something's happening and he's naming names I mean the first thing you learn as a politician is keep it vague keep it general this guy's going like and Billy the waiter down there he said most likely you're doing lines especially there's a video you smoking crack right he admits to that yes he admits to the video of him smoking crack he's beautiful he is a beautiful man meanwhile by the way by the way he does good these has gone through the roof with him as the mayor so bad man he's also a guy who came up through going to the projects helping out the working poor and you know being an inspiration I think he coaches a football team and the reason why he's enough his favorability rating is not that fucking low considering and it's because the poor people remember where this guy came from and he they know what he's done for them they'll overlook who gives a shit nobody really should give a shit the crack yeah the rest of it who cares it's kind of funny that it's cracked too it's like he went for the most ghetto of ghetto drugs and he did it with a bunch of black people and they got videos of them I mean does he not know what a fucking cell phone is when they're holding a cell phone in front of him yeah Mike Tyson shit's the best part where he said he wants to fight Mike Tyson he's like how kill Mike Tyson he said that oh you haven't seen that no no I've seen that oh my god I I've seen one where he challenged some guy to an MMA fight maybe that's it he talent everyone watch like five seconds of it I was like it's kind of crazy he's a mayor right a mayor I mean we had Marion Barry but that guy was like not like this he didn't have the dimensions that this guy had well he also does not have the ability to own it Marion Barry lied about it all like we were Marion Barry was on opening and Anthony and I got to ask him some questions and I was I said yes in person as close as you are to me and I was like what about the crack thing when they caught you smoking crack like I knew he only had like five minutes and I was like I'm gonna ask that's like right away like you can't like beat around the bush he's in and out he's doing a bunch of different reviews I go what was that about what was going on there goes they they do not know whether or not what I had was crack okay what they have is a video Meese well but what was it was it cracked like wouldn't wouldn't answer it you wouldn't say listen man right I got a little crazy I fucked up a smoke a little crack that's what now the waiter should never said lines that's an outright lie it's an insult my friend is not a prostitute as soon as you have to say your friend is not a prostitute man by name oh yeah I'm going to kill that fucking guy I'm telling you first-degree murder Mike Tyson oh my god how can I even like everyone in the room he keeps on saying brother like okay now because this video I'm on the side of the people trying to get him out of office because of that video I officially think he's out of control I didn't think he was out of control before I thought he was just being a silly man somebody from Toronto Dino says actually he knows this drug dealer that's friends with him and that's he not calling to the podcast have talked to drug dealers and I think this isn't like known in Canada that like this is just ridiculous the problem is a fat guy that dumb is dangerous like thinking he can actually beat up Mike Tyson and it only needs is 15 minutes and I'll have them down rip his eyes out like oh okay alright you're too stupid yeah you're right delusional that's why you're so confident now I understand yeah cuz that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard think most politicians the move they're like the decisions they make in their lives the fucking balls that just cheating while in office when you think that everything's being examined this cameras on the all-time and you're gonna fucking cheat and I think he's always done a lot i think they've always done it i think guys like like the the clinton types or the JFK types that you know have this like lust for it i think it's always been what they got away with it's always been a part of it someone's always swept it under the rug and so they they've always kept going and like they liked it so much they don't want to stop they like the power of it but no one's ever been like no that's an idea well the guy down in san diego gave us a pretty good run he was a groper right he was a lurch ur a liberal i were dozens of ledge lectures he was a ledge yeah that guy was he's been sued by a gang of them too yeah yeah there's what that guy's going what's so sad about him is he didn't even get any pussy i think he was just grabbing asses amateur c grade was seeing that guy that he would beat up Tyson it's like do you have an idea how fun that would fight what that fight would be for Tyson Tyson would literally right now you could wake him up and tell him he has to fight this guy he could be taking a nap and he would get in there and he would be laughing the whole time like laughing like I'll come on big guy you gotta kill me you gonna put my eyes out we're gonna hold me down what's gonna happen here you're gonna rip my throat out well to me I'm up from my position I thought of Ludacris but I'm willing to engage you in this contest if she so want if you thought youth have the do chasing him around party hard that's a great shirt weer can I buy that please tell me it's for sale it is Andrew wks Rob Ford parties and uwk suck the guy's a millionaire before Christmas I'm buying one I'm gonna buy one right now a party hard with blood pouring out of his no fucking love it it's not an Android official party store if you want to make some money promote the fight Tyson versus him no he got to give him coke first and then you gotta have like ten dudes outside the ring at all corners with the fucking defibrillators just ready to go cuz you know that guy's gonna have a heart attack like you see him pacing like how does a fat guy that old do coke like that's fucking dangerous Cole's that dude how old's Rob Ford I think he's four he looks older than fifty four fifty being on a coke jag and pacing like that and saying shit like I'm a bad mother felt like I remember being in that space okay let me stop you you were 19 right big fuck right 44 44 44 Jesus Christ he looks like shit yeah deep in his 50s so what happens to Rob Ford over the next year well if Canada is different yeah most likely right but Canada is different when it comes to their ability to get people out of office you can't just pull something out of office for conduct if they don't violate any of the state laws if they don't like get in trouble steal money there's like a lot of things you have to have done to get them out of office so right now they're just sort of taking away his power they're just slowly but surely making him a puppet mayor they're removing his power so that gets weird because then you sort of like crippling your own sort of economy and your your crippling your own government like I don't know most people would quit but this guy's not gonna quit he'll never quit he's suing them he's gonna sue them to keep his job but they should show that video and then have an expert come in you know like a Teddy Atlas and explain what would happen yeah if Mike Tyson and him got into an actual ring together does this make sense or would you categorize a person that's 44 years old that looks like they're 60 that's clearly coked out of their mind looks like they ate a beach ball D would you categorize that as delusional to the utmost bringing dr. drew you'd have to just bring in a few fight experts just bring in the Teddy Atlas and Jim Lampley and have them describe and then have mike tyson and then tell those seriously he said have him laugh and
