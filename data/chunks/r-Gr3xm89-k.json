boom and we're live dude you survived what's up buddy alright you survived the joy Diaz experience you know I got it I got a um I got a text from Tom Tom Segura Tom right yeah I said cuz he asked me we were backstage about to go onstage at the main room and he's like I want to do my podcast blah blah blah and I'm like awesome and then we were texting just about my schedule with him and then he's and then I'm like okay I'm going to go see Joey Diaz that uh and he's like dude fuckin gummy bears watch out and I'm like what are you talking about I didn't like I didn't understand what he was talking about like I didn't I honestly didn't like I was like whatever I don't know you're talking about and then once I got there you know I smoke weed sometimes you know I don't smoke all the time but I like to smoke weed sometimes but but as far as the edibles I'm like Dean Gelber is like giving me some like pot stuff but like cookies and shit but then like he was eating his gummy bears and they're in a bag and I was like going fuck okay and he gave me just like he gave me just like an ear or some shit and that was it and then I was just like talking them and then like literally I I couldn't talk anymore I couldn't talk like part of it I made a half a one when it's got some dad to leave he's got some that are like 500 milligrams which is just insane so you probably had half of that which is like 250 which is fucking insane that's an insane amount of weed but is he an OG yeah I had but I had done mushrooms once before when I was younger and it felt like that yeah well that's to the risk of repeating myself over and over again which I do all the time but when you eat marijuana its processed by your liver and it produces something called eleven hydroxy metabolite it's a totally different psychoactive substance that's four to five times more psychoactive than THC so that's why it hits you like that and that's why people think they got dosed because when you smoke pot the 11 coactive but when you eat it it's processed by your liver it's something called a one-pass and that's how it produces that yeah and i can't believe he let me drive home like seriously I mean I could like cuz when I was driving home I was like dude I gotta go like I stopped that guy I can't answer your questions and I said let's I have to go and I left and I drove out and he like he let me drive like you gotta understand Joey Diaz found his mother dead on the kitchen floor when he was on acid when he was 13 he would let you fly a fucking plane on those things he doesn't give a shit he's just like you'll forget about cocksucker anyways so when did it hit you like you did a podcast like how Helicon for like 15 minutes into it and I couldn't speak I had to stop like I couldn't speak did you ever release the podcast I don't know I think he did the audio but not the video oh I told him not to do the video I couldn't answer any questions yeah wouldn't that be funny yeah I guess I don't know I would like to see myself that fucked up where I can't even talk mmm yeah those uh those edibles are fucking terrifying they're going terrible I'm like they're like you know skittles or some shit he's a different type of human well there's a lot of those people now because edibles and marijuana has been legal for so long there's so many medical patients in California that you get these people that have insane tolerances and they're just doing dabs and eating cookies and just like Jesus just like they go down you know the whole marijuana movement and that whole thing is so much different different than when when I was growing up you know when I grew up we still like you know smoke it we go to the beach and we'd put a towel over us we'd hide it now like like last night I was at the the Funny or Die party and it was was the tenth anniversary and I just walking around just smells like weed everywhere yeah it's just very normal now like you know that like I don't know that's just the way well I think it's good because it's like drinking is normal you know you walk by the bar the Comedy Store you see a bunch of people have a couple is nothing wrong with that yeah but thanks for having me my pleasure yeah so how did you this this impression you're doing of this white house character what's his name again Steven Miller yeah that's first of all everyone's doing Sean Spicer they weren't until I got fired or all they did was it's scary Moochie yeah well Sean's but listen McCarthy was doing Sean Spicer he killed it yeah no it's funny Trump thought that it made him look weak that a woman was doing an impression would she go and do an impression Trump now because of that yeah yeah yeah no I mean I don't know I mean I think that you know I did a special what was it like I think it was like 2012 for Showtime called politics where I went to DC and I did stand-up in DC and I interviewed all Paul I love politicians like that's all I watched when I come home at night all I watches CNN MSN just because that's it because I'm in shock and I can't believe it no I just go back and forth that there's so many fucked up things that are going on in the world the whole North Korea thing is insane it's Gary it's fucking insane well what's scary is they drop us and shit like fire and fury that the world has never known like Jesus dude like this isn't a movie this is real life yeah but I mean this North Korean guys fucking nuts he is fucking he's fucking nuts it's like it's like dude stop shooting fucking missiles in the fucking this isn't like a playpen thing he just keeps shooting missiles in the ocean all the time like it's like he's like a kid or some shit any kid it's just I don't know it's just uh well I think Guam is only like 2,000 miles away from North Korea or something like real close so they're talking about him possibly bombing Guam and as what they're saying now and yeah I know I've been watching but that was a death sentence I mean if if we decided to attack North Korea it would be a death sentence to them and that also I heard cuz I know I know Dennis Rodman you know I know Dennis Rodman do you do you went over there I know I don't want to get too too into it but I know that he goes over there a lot yeah it's with kim jong they just fucking get drunk and i don't know they go on jet skis or some shit really he like he like he likes dennis rodman so he brings him out but from what I heard is that Kim jong-un really loves Donald Trump like you know what I mean like his there Merrick he loves America but he's like kind of acting like he doesn't love America like he loves the American Way yeah so doing is is I think I really think that if Donald Trump went over there to meet with the guy I think that would appease him and just show him the fuck out I think what's my opinion maybe you should be like a liaison yeah see there you go but he gets he gets uh you know he goes over there and hangs out with him because the Kim jong-un kid loves love's love's American yeah he loves America and that's it's just kind of like a weird you know there's there's no what's the word there's no no animation communication they're not communicating right you know yeah well there's language barrier obviously but isn't he young isn't Kim jong-un like in his 30s how old is he yeah he's pretty young it's I mean imagine running a military dictatorship in 30s and he's already murdered a gang of people he already and the thing that's so crazy about the whole thing is that like you think of Isis and you think of that whole you know how those people like they don't care the dot and they don't care if they're gonna die and I think that he's trained his people all the scene you see always on CNN you know there's marching soldiers you know I think those guys are ready to die well if you lived in a shithole like North Korea where every day you're under the oppressive of a military dictatorship maybe you'd be ready to die to be like it's either escape to South Korea or die yeah I I think what should happen is I think Trump should hire Dennis Rodman and like put like a tracking device on them and their jet skiing out and fucking in the ocean drinking and shit and the SEAL Team six comes in and fucking takes kim jeong-hoon and flies into america and then gives all the North Korean internet and like sets them free no movie dude don't you get with Stephen Baldwin I just think that there's probably a way to show everything yeah there probably is a way to chill everything out this is not the way like launching test missiles and saying fire and fury and all that shit not it's not not chill anything out but you know I don't understand what the conflict is about in the first place I'm not exactly sure what everybody's angry I think because they think that we're gonna bomb them and why are we gonna bomb them like that because I think that we did years ago right they should know this yeah well North Korea know Hiroshima was talking about the Asian say I don't know the details the world that's cool super site complete the two of them yeah no it's um I mean we did horrible things during the Korean War to the North Koreans I mean that's literally the cause of all of this all the anger and all the you know but that's when North Korea and South Korea were split in North Korea went communists and you know it's it's all a byproduct of that you know there's it's you could read about in actually there's a really good book called dear reader from Michael malice he's a guy who was on my podcast and the history that part of the world is really fucked up but it's interesting because you have North Korea and then below you have South Korea South Korea you have a thriving economy amazing Electronics Samsung they make all kinds of great shit over there is buys probably yeah classic surgery glad I could yeah and then North Korea is just right next door to them terrible dictatorship it's fucked up man well no president has been able to deal with it so no yeah and probably won't be able to I mean how do you resolve that one of the things that my mouse was telling me that makes it so fucked up is that everybody has to rat on everybody else like say if you and I were working together we would have to go somewhere and tell someone what each one of us did wrong like maybe you didn't cry hard enough when somebody died or maybe you weren't excited enough with something good happen you can cheer loud enough and they'll they'll rat you out for that and then you know you have to be accountable and then so every they have like a culture of rats everybody's ratting everybody out it sounds fun we don't realize how lucky we are you know to live in America dude it's one of the reasons why people complain so much about stuff we're so soft any slight little thing that's wrong have you ever been to prison before no never well I went to Alcatraz but just as is it yeah never been arrested I always think like spending time in prison would make you appreciate just the simple things cuz you always see you know you always see like you know people that are incarcerated they get out and they like seeing the sunlight and they're like oh my god this is fucking awesome and part of me is like I think everyone should maybe good go to prison for like a month just to like kind of get that get there normal freedoms taken away from them you know I'm actually doing a benefit I was gonna ask you if you want to do I don't know if you're in town at the Comedy Store for the Innocence Project are you familiar with them yeah I am yeah so I'm doing it I'm doing it on audio so these people incarcerated yeah yeah yeah so if you want to do it everyone's doing it already it's August 27th and it's for you know Barry Scheck and that whole team of people that that exonerate you know people that go to prison for for crimes they didn't commit you know that whole yeah yeah well I'm flying in from DC oh that's on Sunday yeah yeah yeah I could do that that'd be great yeah I'll do it yeah that'd be great I got a great lineup I got um everyone's on it already but I was gonna ask you I'm sure you'd be into that yeah I'm in DC the night before okay I'm flying in sorry yeah so I want to raise money for them yeah because I want to give I want to give money back to these guys because when they got into jail they don't have anything yeah and they're not given anything right giving like a dollar you know II mean I know and then they have to somehow another figure out how to sue to get some compensation for the fact they were wrongly imprisoned we had like to be in prison for 20 years knowing he had nothing to do with that and there's people that are in prison for like killing their mom and stuff like that imagine someone kills your it's not you and then you get arrested and go to jail for it yeah no it's terrible but the fruit person and that the bar is pretty cool you gonna eat here okay did you see blood sugar so low you like I can't I can't wait 15 minutes no but did you see the fruit man at the corner you know I did not there's a fruit like a little Mexican fruit guys chop the frit don't tell I see sorry yeah pull that guy across the border bring him back yeah so um how did you what was the the thought process behind doing an impression of this dude it's become viral mmm million hits now right yeah yeah it's like at a million seven Wow I'm not yeah and it's uh it's caught on its it's just I don't know you've been doing this even doing this a long time you did the make up for you how they do a funny guy yeah you know the business Statue of Liberty facts yeah you just do these things and certain things catch on certain things don't get John and and this thing caught on so I don't know I was pretty stoked is that him back in the day that's him now he doesn't look like that now though he's way more bald than that no yeah he's home but ya know it was cool it was uh I I've done stuff with them before I actually did an Anthony Weiner sketch to I don't know if he saw that one no I did yeah it's pretty cool I did I play Anthony Weiner I did that about four or five six months ago and then this thing came up they just hit me up and then you know I do stuff for Funny or Die sometimes and and this thing caught on and it went everywhere and I was on CNN and in in you know every you know even political political sites picked it up the hill and all these different places picked it up so I I don't know I just did it and they yeah shit and like you don't know what the fuck right so so weird thing is funny I saw the weird thing to Weiner I think wieners a comic he's hilarious I think he's a comic he just does he doesn't know it I mean he's still committed to being the I mean he tried to be the mayor and he can't if it was late latest scandal he would have come close 100 percent yeah and did you see his his documentary yes amazing yeah it's amazing yeah yeah so you see I'm lasting okay see didn't give me any eating give me edible I'm not gonna give had at this point in the Joe Diaz I was like dude I gotta go he kept asking me questions I couldn't answer anything no one's gonna notice yeah imagine everybody that I know dude that's you every time to secure it did it to you I did you read bad doesn't everyone but I've heard everyone kind of can't handle it most people well the numbers that Joey puts up know the very few humans can handle it but don't you think like it was up back to Anthony Weiner I think that guy should have been a comic like he's got this idea about what's good and what's bad but he's also a pervert and I'm like the guys are comic yeah he's a great speaker he's hilarious he's hilarious yeah obviously loves pussy obviously I mean he's a fucking character I mean I just think that he's trapped in that suppressed world of being a politician where he obviously doesn't fit those standards there's no standards of behavior that they demand of you that are all bullshit anyway but yeah he's too fucked up he's too crazy I think the more fucked up things that people find out about the politicians the the more popular they become some of them I mean right yeah I mean in a way clean about it if he could come clean about all of it and tell like the but still ball in the day of Trump things are way different right because Trump got elected a month after that grab him by the pussy thinking everybody thought that was gonna sink is both like that's it he still wins so I think the world is different but I don't think Weiner has the Constitution that Trump has Trump say what you want about them but the motherfucker has teflon foreskin things you saying bounce right off and give a shit he's like yeah insane yeah yeah I know him from back in the day yeah yeah I mean you have to understand I've been doing this how long you've been doing it 30 years 29 yes I've been doing it 30 years when did you come to the store where 94 94 yeah so you were there is that when he came at the store yeah 94 94 became paid regular Wow yeah so I was um I was doing spring break for MTV when was it it was like 89 90 91 92 and it was you know obviously the biggest thing in the world because it was live and there's hundreds of them yeah I did bring break in 2004 an MTV okay right when it was sort of like right yeah and and we did it and it was Hawaiian tropics or the biggest thing in the world all the girls and Fabio was there and Jon Lovitz was there Vince Neil was there Kennison was there Rodney Dangerfield was there and Donald Trump was there and because Donald Trump used to go to the Hawaiian Hawaiian Tropic parties that Ron rice used to throw after you know the spring break things and Donald Trump was I knew him back then so and then I saw him probably about a couple times at the Playboy Mansion the last time I saw him at the Playboy Mansion I think was about four years ago and he was just there just hanging just hanging like Bill Maher you know what I mean just fucking hang it was it was actually in the afternoon and I think it was like a Sunday Funday thing or it was like some like Easter egg night day or some shit and he was just buzzing around and in a suit and just talking to girls and one and um yeah him and OJ you know o oj oj we'll be out too I know is no bazaar so what what is Donald Trump like when you're hanging around with him he just likes vagina you mean like he just like us you know like you know he's look at those babes or you know was always like right I mean that's why anyone go to the Playboy Mansion cuz they like vagina right and we were lucky to get into the Playboy Mansion we were very fortunate you know need to get in there and but it was but so you know and I was actually talking to Kelly and Conway about right before Trump got elected on email and I was supposed to have dinner with her and of her friends but I had to go do some shows in West Palm at The Improv so I had to cancel out you gonna talk to Kelly about who cares just to be there of course I'm weird I've been a hilarious I want to have you know you mean for sure but she was cool we were on I have her email either information it's that Wow yeah you should get her on your show would you put her on your show oh yeah I would definitely talk to her yeah does it feel weird though to be connected to them now yeah once yeah once she got once they got in and I started to see all that stuff that was going on I kind of like backed off and I was like mmm you don't I mean yeah I didn't want to really be you know yeah but I wanted be the vagina coordinator for him hmm that was more than either like hooks it up yeah they can Abidjan it can't be public about they can't talk about it so if you talk about you gonna fuck it up for him oh that's true right now you fucked it up for him okay just a bit folks yeah we're just polishing but how great would that be the idea is is that he's got the trump plane right you know the chump plane it's sitting there he it was not it where's it sitting somewhere hmm right where is that plane it's got to be sitting in like Ana tarmac somewhere so I want him to let me borrow it so I can pick up vagina from in the Midwest the girl Midwest is the move well you had the people that voted for him happy for him yeah the honey flower states bring some you know one tooth wonders bring him bring him to the cuz dude he hasn't gotten anything think about it but he's been like cut off strange hundred percent do you think so I didn't say there's like a basement that they have in the White House there is no way he's getting vagina but so none of them do you think none of the president's like with modern presidents like I guess like Bush on right Bush Obama no Trump there's no way they can right I don't think so you know who is it Linda Tripp sofa lady right that Monica Lewinsky girl out that poor girl I feel more bad for her than anybody like she went she doing some article about her words she said the shame sticks to you liked are like you managing poor girl which is 20 years old at this point I guess she's got it right you know any me no but so what does Trump like that was even a good guy to talk to like what is he like obviously he had I didn't want to run for president back yeah I think you'd been wanting to I'm if you look at clips now you see a lot of clips where he was where they interview him and now about like he find clips in the 90s where they always say was it the guy from I forgot that one show on MSN but Tim something I don't know he died but he said well if you were present that oh yeah Meet the Press yeah yeah yeah yeah actually I was watching that today while he was talking about North Korea it was an old clip where he's talking about North Korea for 1999 I never really engaged in like heavy conversation with him was always kind of just you know we smiled at each other just that you know so I never like went out to dinner with him or anything right yeah I was supposed to do Celebrity Apprentice they asked me to do Celebrity Apprentice when they had the second interation of fear factor when fear factor came back and like what is it 2011 or 12 or whatever it was and I just like I don't want to do it I just wanted I don't want to be in New York for three months and I want to work on this show it just seems kind of gross and now that I think about it Mike's probably good move because like what if I did it and I got an argument with with him like what if he hated me and now I have this fucking feud like Rosie does because Rosie O'Donnell it seems like it consumes her hmm like her fucking Twitter feed was it still oh my god she's always asking about Trump being a piece of shit and a loser and he tweets about her that's hilarious they're grown people yeah small right there look at that Oh Donald looking bad honey Wow take time to take care of you it's only Wednesday golf sweetie golf that's hilarious oh my god how can she say anything about anybody looking bad that's what's even more dumb she's crazy I don't know it's just like feuds like that they're not healthy they consume you not good not good not good at all so you're gonna continue doing this dude what's his name again Stephen Miller um I guess if he keeps messing up and they want me to do it yeah you could do a whole bunch of things with him write him explaining things to different people I think it's more if he messes up yeah you know I mean I think it's more if he goes on that you know I just want him to get back on that press stage because once he's on there then they start you know they're mean and that's when he and that's when he becomes you know as weird as is when George Bush was president you know I was doing some shows in DC and me and Dean Gilbert we went to we went to the White House and we actually went into that room the press room and it's absolutely like fucking small that's pretty little have you been in it no but I've seen it on TV when they show up from the back of the room yeah but it's it's almost like this big it's it's pretty small I was like whoa you know what I mean it's right it was left to be grand yeah yeah but the White House said have you been to the White House before like what just the tourists walk there oh no it's fucking weird I'm sure it's so weird you know what's weird is how close it is to the street I always buy it I drove by but but that was back when people had like muskets you know like they really couldn't when they built that stupid fucking thing they didn't give their selves enough space you know somebody just pulled up with a high-powered rifle it's right there it's just weird that people like you watch house of cards it's a great show but it's so it's weird because they're engaging in all sorts of illicit activity and there's windows everywhere it's probably unrealistic but but how many people have lived in that fucking house that's what's even weirder you know 45 different presidents all living in this one spot I know it's crazy I didn't have to be saying that shit to each other I mean Bill Clinton or Trump's got to be saying there it is saying like this is the place that Bill Clinton got blown this is the area look how close it is look on the left side and the right side look how close it is the street like I guarantee you I could hit that with a with an arrow you're going to DC right yeah and you've dinner August 20 like DC I like working there yeah because they feel like they need to blow some steam off like they're kind of wild the kind of fun you know hey as far as your stand-up and stuff like you know obviously you know we're peers you know and I see you and watch you and stuff like that at what point did did your stuff like just really start to blow up do you know I mean like really go from clubs cuz you're working clubs like I'm working clubs and then all sudden you know you're working like bigger places like at what point was it about five years ago four years ago well I did I did theaters in some places but it's probably mine it's all started changing in 2009 that's right I did a Comedy Central special Spike TV first then TV then conversation yeah I started doing bigger places then I started selling out theaters of like 2,000 seats in some some markets but you know take me like a few months and then then there was the next Comedy Central special that was another big bump then I was selling out places like the Belko and Denver which is like 5,000 but takes it would take a little longer to sell out but now with the Netflix special changed everything well Netflix is just a completely different thing Wow so many people have Netflix man I know and if you special you know you really put together something good they could say oh you know this guy he actually is a real comic you really actually it's funny you know and then they want to come see you and then it's your responsibility to not fuck them make sure you do a good job and keep writing new shit yeah keep producing them shit right but what does it feel like to be out of the clubs I still do clubs that I know where you're and you're playing bigger things yeah what does that feel like to you said oh it's great I mean it's fun and everything it's a different kind of show though it's like there's more pausing yes it's this more theatrical year it's a bigger stage moving around more there's good really good to it but I don't wouldn't say it's better it's just different it's better financially yeah but so it's just different but it must make you feel good yeah yeah yeah that's awesome because I played I played big places and I've also played Klaus but now I'm mostly playing I play clubs yeah yeah so you know play all the same clubs yeah I like playing clubs though yeah yeah you're connected to the people it's intimate you know yeah how often he turn I don't know I kind of go in spurts you know I'm working a lot I mean I don't work a lot at the store during the week because I'm like so exhausted from editing and I edit and edit all day long what do you edit E I'm editing well I finished the show on crackle that was took a long time in that show yeah that's on now that's on crackle and I was editing that and that you know I spent a lot of time on those videos and then from there I did the documentary polish sure stands alone which was on Showtime and now it's on Amazon that's just the straight doc that came out a couple years ago I had such a good time filming that that I kept shooting and the whole thing is about me moving my mom out of the house you know and then the big you know house because when I did the original doc it was just kind of like kind of skimming the concept of that and then I go fuck I got to start doing that it's like I cut into it's a six part series almost like my version of making the murder but I don't kill anyone obviously right you know but it's a six part kind of series based off the original doc so we've been putting that together and that's fucking dope dude you might not know so I think we should say eikando your mom's probably one of the most important if not the most important characters ever in the history of stand-up comic like her running and owning the Comedy Store in the glory days of Kennison and Pryor and now today even you know like she she set the stage you know I mean out of all the people that helped me and like we're important to me in my career your mom was pretty uniquely significant you know she yeah she she created you know my dad and mom started the place in 72 you know I was four and then there's no crazy huh and then they got divorced she won the Comedy Store in the divorce he says he gave it to her you know there's still like a friction there with that concept I wasn't you know I don't remember I was a fucking four years old and then my mom became who she really was you know you're a comic I'm a comic that's who we are she became a creative kind of force and she came into the limelight at a time where everyone needed someone like that yeah you don't mean like yeah instead of just like a club owner you know she was creative you know that's why I think part of the reason why she's sick now is because she's not she was never like a real business business person you know she was a woman so it was really hard so but she was so good at fucking like Roseanne wears suspenders you know you know Gary Shanley put his sweater on you don't even mean just different things that she would help develop yeah that to me is what the store is missing now gender soon I think there's no message there's no Mitzi shore there to really garnish these comment I love Adam to death he's fucking doing an awesome job yes yeah but it's not Mitzi shore right and that to me is something that I think we have to do I think it's our responsibility you know to kind of give back to the younger guys and maybe spend a little more time there on a Monday night or something and really kind of help these kids out and give them some direction because there is no direction there's no mincing sure there so that's who she that's who she was that's who she is and and that to me is what her best quality quality was when she first met my dad it was in the 50s and my dad was a touring comic and my dad did a show and or a summer in a place called Elkhart Lake Wisconsin and he was doing all summers like that's what he did in the 50s you'd play there the whole and it was a camp and my mom worked for the boss of the camp and my mom used to type my dad's jokes in the back yeah she would type the jokes in the back and all this is good that's not good you know she would write it down Wow and then she would say this stunk this was good that was good that's not good and that she just developed might help develop my dad's act they started dating they had sex and then my dad took off and then he was in Toledo Ohio and then got a call from my mom saying I'm pregnant with Scott and Scott's you know just turned 64 65 years old so so back then you have a kid whether you want to or you don't you know what I mean the bortion thing didn't really exist I mean it did I'm sure but he didn't never wanted a kid and he never wanted to get married and he never wanted all of his kids he didn't want us he just wanted to do what I was doing what I do which was just bang Vijayan to go on the road have a good time you know which is which was my mo and I first started you know anything right and that got taken from him so in his day do you ever talk to him about what it was like to tour back then cuz it wasn't really comedy clubs back then right no it was more like strip clubs love's bars bowling alleys you know places that I play now to be a real trip to go from that to being a part of the original comedy club I mean other than like the ice house right now is the oldest comedy club in the country but because that's cuz it started like that 1960 but the this store was it 72 72 yeah that's incredible yeah really stop and think about that how long ago that was before that there wasn't really well the interest was actually New York at the improv in New York yeah there was catch a rising star in New York is that it was sort of around that time yeah it was a new thing yep so like your mom and your dad my dad the way it the way it happened was Frank's Ennis who owns the building who owned the building said to my dad and his friend Rudy DeLuca said hey Sammy you want to start a comedy room because he owned the building where si roses and then hold that here that whole building there without the room right there in the original room actually which was which was it which was what it was originally and my dad said okay and then Rudy my dad's my dad's writing partner Rudy DeLuca said well what do we call it you know let's do it and then my dad was like let's call it the Sammy Shore room right and then Rudi's like that's fucking stupid you know any we're not gonna do that and then they asked my mom and my mom's the one that said let's call it the Comedy Store so she's the one who came up with the name so they started the Comedy Store my dad was like the alcoholic emcee you know he was partying he was a fucking alcoholic dude big-time like he loved J&B was his favorite drink and he would go on stage and he'd bring up Redd Foxx Pat McCormack you know you know leant Murray Langston you know all these other guys yeah and my mom would work the covered booth you know where Tommy used to work in that little area right there and she's to give out like like little peppermints and stuff you know to the guests that would come in and then my dad would go on the road and open for Elvis and open for Engelbert Humperdinck and Sammy Davis and Sinatra and all these people and my mom's always started to take over the club while he was gone like her heart you know what I mean she her she put her heart into the club and that's kind of where it started and they were never happy to begin with they were never happy so it was time for the divorce and then my dad just gave her the club gave her the house and took off so he just wanted to be back on the road yeah but he's to his days fucking pissed about it because he never got a piece of the Comedy Store Wow he never got a piece of the komiser and I think that's terrible because he's the one that fucking started it right it wasn't for him there would be no comments or if he never had sex with my mom in Elkhart Lake Wisconsin there would never be no Comedy Store period deep period oh so that's why my dad needs to get more on in my opinion needs to get more credit he's that he doesn't you never gets any credits always like yeah you know I never met him I never met your dad fucking man it's the man I believe you it's fucking awesome 90 years old did when you were when you were like growing up did Kennison really babysit you did that ever really happen because that was always like tight with the babysitter's where Kennison never babysat me the babysitter's were like Louis Bromfield Jack Purdue Mike binder Argus Hamilton Mitchell Walters Mike binder from yeah Mike binder was fucking awesome dude he was awesome he's a statement of Little League really yeah at the Beverly Hills Park yeah and uh but Mike binder Mike binders fucking he was like the him and Alber ski really the youngest guys that came on the scene but Mike binder he used to take me to skate parks and all that shit because my mom was busy at the club so that shows gave me the comedian's as far as Kennison I was a short-order cook at the Comedy Store in Westwood I used to cook for everyone there's 200 people there because I was a good cook because my parents divorced and I took care of the whole I make Naya there's like a menu in my mom's office Pauly's menu nachos hamburgers everything I would cook really good and that's where I first met Sam was 14 was he was like the dorm in there you were working there as a cook at 40 yeah because I wanted to save up for a saltwater fish tank cuz my mom wouldn't buy me a saltwater fish tank why I wanted to get a hundred gallon saltwater fish to see when I came around in 94 I don't think the West would Club was around no one did it was I think 84 oh wow yeah that place was wild it was like the bastard club it was like where everyone you know like you know I mean Arsenio Paul Rodriguez Andrew Dice Clay they would like go there and there was like off the beat yeah and they worked out there and then like the Howie Mandel's would be in the main room at the store and all that stuff yeah yeah Howie Mandel even back down isn't that crazy he was fucking awesome was huge yeah huge it's weird you know seeing him on all these game shows and stuff like that he went up a comedy store the other night and I heard someone say he does comedy and I was like wow that's so weird like people they don't even think about it you see him on television as a host of a game show you kind of forget that he was this huge standard before ever you did it yeah huge before he did that glass yeah the glove over his head and blow it up with his nose he bow he'd play that little kid Bob about it was great he did that he actually did a cartoon memory Bobby's world right yeah I know it's a weird it's a weird like I was at the Funny or Die thing last night I was with Will Ferrell not to drop names when I'm a huge fan I am and and he owns the site and we were talking and and he just gave it up to me he's like dude you started it all you know and see because I used to watch you on MTV and Encino man data this generation doesn't know what I did most of the kids the 25 and younger they don't know that I started MTV they don't know all the films they don't know they think Sandler they think all the other guys yeah they don't know that I was the first I was you know at the time cuz MTV was so big yeah you were the first celebrity you and like Denis Leary like Denis Leary became a big celebrity off of MTV too and then movies but I was starring in a lot of movies yeah and I was doing albums albums all that some when I was in my 20s and I was having an awesome time that had to be weird was awesome but it's um but growing up point in the store like from the time you were as old as you could remember being a part of the comedy store and then also being 20 and being famous yeah on MTV it was when MTV was John billboard yeah SiC it was I was a kid and look I had I had sold out all the shows at the Roxy you know I had an album and I was doing all of it at once was it weird it was so much fun it was so much fun that's why now when I look back on my films I get kind of sad why because that time in my life was my happiest time was it make you sad um cuz it was really amazing and now life is still good but it's not like it was so what did what changed well I think for a lot of people in their 20s at least my opinion when you're in your 20s if you fuck up it doesn't really matter and it's in life is like one big like whatever and that's kind of what I miss now like when you get older like things are like your mom's sick or this or you know there's all these right lettings life things you know or like yeah I'm gonna be 50 next year you know what I mean just like things like when you're younger dude I used to have like me and my friends we used to go to the beach and smoke pot you know we used to go to the Roxy we used to go to the rainbow it was like you still do that cuz I don't feel like it weather-wise that make you sad that you don't feel like doing those things what do you feel like doing going to the Korean bathhouse and watching the news and chilling and drinking juice yeah that's what I do so why is that sad that's what's confusing I wouldn't say it's sad I know I stock up no not the movies that watching the movies make me sad because I miss starring in films so what happened like why did that dry up I think it's several reasons you know number one I was so big and I think the bigger you are and the fast you make it the harder you fall I think that's just like normal because it was like you can only you know I mean that was one thing and also I think the whole weasel thing was like it was cool for a while and then like after a while it's not cool just let a lot of things and I also think I didn't listen to my age and some managers they told me not to do in the army now remember I did it that was a good movie no I know but here's the story behind it what happened was as I had a three-album deal at Disney I hadn't seen a man's son-in-law these big hits for me did really well and then it came time to do my third movie and it was in the army now and my managers and agents were like we don't know you know you have to cut all your hair off and all that shit and the scripts kind of like okay and new line approached us with this other film called totally London which is me being an au pair in London which I thought was actually a really funny idea and Jeffrey Katzenberg who used to run Disney wouldn't let me do that movie at new line you know being an au pair in London so he bought the script and shelved it so I did in the army now in the army now didn't do as good as the other films and then after that Disney didn't sign me a nut to do more movies and then after that I did jury duty and jury duty didn't do so good you know what I mean right so financially so it was when the movie started to draw maybe poor choices yeah not listening to my agents and managers and stuff at the time but I didn't come at it like fuck you I came at it like I want to work I loved acting I loved going to the set that's another thing it's like I did an Adam Sandler film I don't know the last one he did the Sandy Wexler and you know you go up on the set you know an Adam starring this film and I'm not you know I mean and I used to star in films and it's it's so it's a weird feeling for me I'm like I'm happy to be on the set and I love Adam he's an old dear friend and I'm super happy for him but I was starring in films right the only mean and everywhere I go people say why aren't you starring in films like what what's up and yeah I can't answer it you nee mean poor choices the weasel shit dried up you know the movies didn't perform as well I didn't listen to my agents I wasn't like doing drugs it wasn't like I got all fucked up I just just one movie didn't do so good then the next movie didn't do so good and then they eventually just stopped coming yes you think about yeah biodome didn't do as good as jury duty even though now like it's a big hit it's a cult call it for me but at the time you know what I mean and you know yeah and then I got a sitcom on Fox and that didn't go so things were like and then I was also turning 30 and I was my 30th birthday was very emotional for me I cried a lot my 30th birthday because I was going from like a boy to a man and I didn't know how to do it you don't need me I was just like I didn't know like I didn't know how to I didn't know how to deal my 40th birthday was awesome it was great you know was happy you know what I mean yeah my 50th birthday I'll probably cry again every 20 years exactly but um so I missed starring in films you know I miss it I miss it I love acting that's what my first love I think you know I'll I mean you were on fucking TV you like acting really yeah I mean it's okay you were great on that show yeah well I'd love that show I loved working with those people but I've done some other acting I was like it's okay it's not my thing like stand-up comedy to me is more fun than hosting you love hosting I don't I mean I like doing the UFC like working for the UFC and doing stand-up comedy and doing commentary for the UFC those things are fun doing this is fun but acting to me was like long hours waiting around and then also a lot of actors are cool but there's like 10% they're just fake they're just weird sociopaths they just take care of themselves they're complete narcissist yeah they don't have I just can't I can't connect with them you know so there was a lot of that because I think you're a good actor and I think that if he may be developed a show or a film you know for you you know I think would be awesome that sounds like torture really yeah you're saying that I'm like ooh yeah stuck on a set yeah you know enjoy you just don't enjoy acting yeah one of the things that was appealing about Fear Factor was no actors it was like oh I don't have to act but I could still be on TV and make some money okay let's do it you know and I felt like it was gonna get cancelled I was like this is just be some horrible disaster and then I'll go have some jokes about it I'm like I'll definitely get like at least ten minutes of material out of this fucking show and a huge hit yeah one up here doing a hundred and fifty four episodes or something you get it's something you don't get the same residuals that you would get for a sitcom though but is it called what's it called when there's over 100 episodes syndication syndication syndication you got separation money what's the syndication money's not what everybody thinks it is syndication my like news radio went in syndication so I got syndication money from that but it's not like Jerry Seinfeld syndication money see he owns a piece of the show then you get the real money but you get me you can't complain it's a lot of money my friend on Peter Lang cough he owns Hawaii five-o quote which is on CBS the original one no this one it's unknown but he's went over he went over 100 episodes that's the big payday he's fucking he's got like a fucking seven million dollar house in Malibu and having a big old party oh my god I would imagine as soon as it goes over a hundred you just go yes oh my god yeah yeah well you know Kevin James a buddy of mine he can't Queens went over 100 when it goes over a hundred you long as you don't fuck up you're pretty much set well you don't go crazy you don't start doing math and yotz yeah yeah so maybe stuff like this will bring you back to films you know I miss it you know what I mean that's it you know that's I that I was happy that the Steven Miller thing you know worked out for me you know I want to know what would be the strategy to get back to it I guess like to kick ass at a comedy special would be a good way to do it to put together like a really good comedy special it's not look cool you thought about doing that yeah you know what I mean they have Robbie at Netflix has to hit me up you know he's like the guy yeah yeah so I mean you know who you're still doing a lot of stand-up yeah I still do a lot of stand-up or it's talking about editing earlier so another thing that I'm editing I'm editing that documentary series which I'm happy about but I'm also editing a documentary of my life and I've been doing that for three years really it's fucking sick you know 60s 70s 80s 90s and I've got over 50 interviews I got like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Oh rothenburg and Doug Herzog and Chris Rock Marc Maron I mean everyone Saget everyone has done it from ex-girlfriends to you know comics from the 70s Lenny Schultz did it crazy letting crazy Lenny so I saw Lenny Schultz in Montreal like 1992 like way back in the day I saw him at The Comedy Works the Montreal Comedy Festival yeah he's he was Alaric yeah he was great he was the original Gallagher in a lot of ways he was one of the original guys still around yeah I lives in Florida what does he do these days I think he's just retired this doesn't this yeah he used to work the main room he was as a comic growing up he was that's Billy braver oh my god as a comic or that he is the one right above Billy click on the one arrow right yeah that's Lenny yeah so he's you know his joke right which one where he used to do the he's to do the Lenny Schultz diet know do you know about that know where he would take all his clothes off and he would do this in the main room he would take he would take all his clothes off and he would strip down to a speedo right to a speedo and he would say a lot there's a lot of diets out there and people don't eat the food they're supposed to eat or did it uh he was on the Lenny show stuff that I put the food on my body of the places that I want to lose weight right so he'd have these fucking pigs and these ducks behind him and he played the music and he'd have all this food over there and he have spaghetti anyway none no none yo da da da da da and it was just like turning this fucking crazy thing any poor fucking he had poor cottage cheese in his balls and he have like great fruits he goes if you want to lose some weight in your elbow the motherfucking grapefruits and you throw the grapefruits you people have like you're hearing yes they're not getting it you have to you have to see how manic and like psycho he was on stage he got into it you know I mean I mean I would hate to be that type of comic especially traveling you know that good carrot top is stoked because he's just stuck in Vegas yeah I mean imagine I had to bring a case of stuff around you know where I was just talking to someone he brought that recently those guys don't exist anymore like he used to be a genre used to be prop comics but like character there is yeah he was he was my favorite growing up as a kid well he was huge in Long Island all the guys from Long Island loved him yeah they loved him yeah he was like when I first moved there I was like who's Lenny Schultz no like you never seen crazy Lenny like he would hold up a bear you know that only the fucking Smokey the Bear mmm and he only you can prevent forest fires fuck you it didn't make any sense yeah but you would laugh your ass off you'd be like why am i laughing at this I'm not sure but he was so funny there's a lot there's a lot of comics out there that have it that never made it that are really funny to ever I'm sure you heard Ally Joe Prater yeah sure oh no one knows who he is right yeah the best to me he had the best strongest 45 minutes I've ever seen Wow but he never changed it oh yeah I mean that happened with a lot of those guys that never you know really got mainstream exposure like like I remember I want to see Kinnison after his HBO special and he hadn't quite figured out that you had to have new material hmm because the HBO special had come out and people were yelling out bits like while he was doing the bits you know and it's like it was that transitionary period because when the guys would do HBO specials there was nothing like that before then where someone who did an hour on television usually would do a Tonight Show you feel like seven minutes and then you would go perform people actually probably wanted to hear those seven minutes again you know who is the most to me the most prolific comic that always changed it up was George Carlin sure every year yeah new hour every year yeah every year he I think at 14 right 14 HBO specials yeah I mean that's fucking insane you know who else did it Richard Jeni Richard Jeni worked at Eastside comedy club in Long Island and he did a different show Friday 8:00 o'clock show a different show Friday 10:00 o'clock show different show Saturday 8:00 o'clock show and a different show Saturday 10:00 o'clock show all the comics were sitting around scratching their head I remember I was backstage I was an opener back then you know I was just starting out when I was backstage with all these guys who were like local headliners and they were just like fuck were terrible it was just confronted by how good he was yeah he was a fucking gee I thought still to this day think that he's one of the most underrated comedians are saying yeah yeah ever yeah did you ever the thing that I noticed so because we had the same manager Michael rothenburg was was my manager and Jenni's manager at the time the one thing that I noticed about him though if he I don't know if you experienced this with him is that his stand-up in the clubs was fucking insane for some reason when he was on TV doing it it didn't translate as much for some reason I think the you know how sometimes the camera just doesn't doesn't favor you yeah doesn't pick up you as funny as you are yeah that was kind of my experience with him because he was you know he killed himself and and I don't know if that was part of the reason because he was frustrated you know I mean a lot of people I guess they kill themselves if you know things don't work out for them right yeah I mean like in their career I guess I don't know well he he always wanted to be Jim Carrey mm-hmm that was his thing you know he wanted to be Jim Carrey he wanted to be the comic that transition from doing standing up to these doing these gigantic movies and he had a show for a while and the platypus me yeah and he did actually did the mask with Jim Carrey he's in that movie was great yeah but just didn't get a lot of roles didn't get a lot of parts but I still maintain that a steaming pile of me if you're listening to this and you're thinking like let me go watch something you can get it on iTunes a steaming pile of me is one of my all-time favorite stand-up specials it's fucking great Wow it's it's a lot of its relevant today because it's 2007 but he does his thing about the difference between people on the left and people on the right and people in the middle and fucking brilliant it's brilliant I gotta hear that and he was like a guy that I saw when I was starting out where I really realized watching him how important it is to really go in depth on a subject because he didn't just scratch the surface like when I was an open mic reading you see about open my curse is they'll they'll touch a subject and then they move on to a next subject but they basically just scratched the surface of it Jenny would dig a trench he would go deep and he would like get everything there was to get out of that bin and then he would move on to another subject and by the time he did you were fucking howling and laughter and holding your sides and yeah he was it was amazing yeah he was he was he was so good he was yeah he and I agree with you though when you see him in the clubs you really got to see what he's really all about yeah that's really the problem with like specials right it's like trying to figure out how to translate what you do when it's a Friday night in the o.r how do you get someone to experience that magic of like a perfect club set in you know a special I think it's people's faces I think it's comedians faces some just pop off of screen and some don't that's my opinion there's a little bit of that because Richard had a weird face and he did it he had plastic surgery and yeah shit go on yeah yeah I like clubs too was in terms of like filming because I feel that connection because when you do your stuff you're here in the audience's back there it's a little disconnected if you're in a big theatre yeah there's good things about a big theater it's like you hear a huge roar you get to see the place and everybody's like wow Paulie sure must be gigantic look at all these fucking people in the audience but when you're at home you're on a couch you're in front of the TV it's very intimate so you don't feel connected to this big giant place that's why my Comedy Central special from 2014 Rocky Mountain High I did in Denver at The Comedy Works and the reason why I did it there I was like this is an intimate room I want to have an intimate show and if I'm here like this is the place to do it it's like yeah it's nice right let me ask you something at what point as a stand-up did you feel that you got really funny like you like you felt like oh shit like I feel like I'm really funny like you know let's say at the beginning like no it was more than 10 years in probably 10 years in I felt like I was content there would I feel like I'm better now than I've ever been before but it's just work he's just constantly working at it like I feel like stand-up is one of the unique things that require what you it requires like rigorous attention and detail and you have to be paying and you have to be enthusiastic and you have to be disciplined like and it's almost contrary to what a lot of us are like a lot of us aren't disciplined people which is why we're funny in the first place because we're silly and we're impulsive and we laugh about things joke around about things and think about things in a fucked-up way that's outside the box of normal thinking you know so I think that's a lot of times that sort of mindset is contrary to the mindset that's required to be disciplined to write but but but as a kid as a kid growing up tell me about yours not funny yeah that's what I was gonna say so do you have brothers and sisters have sister and how old is she compared to you see you're younger and then your parents you grew up in the house all together yeah like oh not to know we're divorced my mom got divorced when I was like five okay so that was like me right that's did you have a lot did she have a lot of boyfriends no no she hooked up with my stepdad and they've been together ever since my mom had a lot of boyfriends yeah that's different yeah yeah but but anyways you would walk in a room Joe Joe Rogan would walk in a room and and you'd say something would they laugh nobody thought it was funny but oh so no it's not funny person say you weren't funny right you know how I got in the comments making people laugh when we were doing martial arts because we were like going to fight in tournaments so we all be nervous mm-hm and it was like I would be the one that made everybody laugh like when we'd be on a bus to go to a tournament to fight it's for real you talk about this not really I mean maybe I've brought it up yeah that's funny funny but it's funny you just the scene of you on a bus when you're punching kids fucking shootin the shit well one of them to this day I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to my friend Steve Graham and my other friend ed shorter they're the guys who talked me into it if it wasn't for them and Steve Graham is still a dear friend to this day so you were on the bus you're going to your wrestling tournaments in Boston it was a kickboxing or Taekwondo back then but yeah yeah but you grew up right in Boston agrippa Newton Newton Upper Falls that's like a suburb of Boston is that like by Springfield Mass no Newton is like it's right off of Route 9 so it's like Natick neat like then in that area it's pretty close to Boston you know it's like not a far drive at all and I would drive into town to to train my Taekwondo school was in Boston whoa and we would travel around the country we'd fly to places and compete you know it was like a giant part of my life like karate chop shit like fucking like wannabes yeah thing yeah so we were always nervous cuz you know guys get knocked out guys get kicked in the face it's terrible are you starting with 15 that's when I started this is in high school yeah yeah yeah so you're driving to the thing yeah so by the time I was 21 like I was like very successful at it I was a four-time state champion and I was competing constantly I won the US Open and one bunch of these like big tournaments like the Bay State game did you ever go against black guys yeah with this guy I know that's what I'm saying fuck right did you buy you know black I farted knocked out that was a huge alleviation of my worries Hey I assume right yeah I have to I won the UFC stuff and I watched you out there and I'm like when you first were doing it there was no black guys you know I mean I'm just the guy watching at home like where's the fucking black guys but they would kill everyone and now I'll send there's black guys in there like oh shit you know know me well what's interesting in boxing that was always the case right but now he's seeing Russians a Gennady golovkin you know and like these years I mean it's really just a matter of the economic situation because in the early days of the 1900s it was a lot of Jews because like Slap see maxi Rosenbaum there's a bunch of Jewish fighters because you know they were Jewish immigrants and they faced a lot of hostility and poverty and this was a way out and then it became Italians like Rocky Marciano rocky Graziano there's a lot of Italian boxers and then it became like Puerto Ricans and blacks and it's mostly it's a lot of it is disenfranchised people that are looking for some sort of an escape it's also financial things well it's think you know it's like Kevin Durant you know way I mean sure playing coop and like you know right yeah I mean that's their way out it's their ticket out of poverty you know so you see with Russians now a lot you know so you're on the bus you're with your friends you're joking around you know what depressions people like do impressions of our friends having sex no that's a different things said then said then one day they said you go to connect should go to comedy connection in Boston my friend Steve said you know you're funny like you're really funny and you know I was like look I make you laugh cuz you're my friend I'm like other people gonna think I'm an asshole especially in Boston which is like a really conservative place and my sense of humor was very fucked up because I would these people or fighters you know so there was all these black belts who were competing on a national level traveling all around the country like they were very intense people so you could say fucked up things to them to make them laugh like they there's there's their borders there their boundaries were very different than the average person because they were experiencing such like I assumed cops would be a lot like that too and maybe even soldiers cops I talked to like a lot of cops that I would train with too they had the most fucked up sense of humor hilarious they would be seeing gunshot wounds I'm and you know and there was you know a lot of jokes they would tell like now as the guy was dead you know they would like be over the guy's body making jokes when no one was around and you know people would think it's disrespectful but a lot of it is like the human brain is not supposed to experience that kind of stress of look at a cop or soldier experiences and gallows humor as it were you know that's what a lot of them would turn to there's some sort of a relief so what I did is I went to an open mic night and I watched and won this is actually a Richard Jeni quote it's a great quote he's right he said one of the great things about terrible comedians is they inspire other people to try it mmm because you watch I'm gonna go well this guy's fuckin terrible leaves least if I suck I won't suck that bad so my ideas stand-up is I would go to some place and I would see like Robin Williams and Richard Pryor and all these people that works just like gods there's no way I'm gonna be able to go up there and do that and but when I went to an open mic night I realize like oh no these people was just like being a white belt in martial arts like they're starting from the beginning and so that's why and this was that which club which is in Boston in the 80s right 88 yeah 27th 1988 that's funny I started in my first one was September 25th 1985 that was my first time man you crazy just didn't think back time just keeps moving on Paulie it's not cool it's definitely weird yeah yeah it never ends it's not going to keeps going we have a family now yeah how many kids three Wow I know nuts how come you'd have no desire none whatsoever um yes yes yes but you got to find the right gal or guy right today in this day and age I saw an article the other day it said transgender man gave birth to baby and then and then Ben Shapiro retweeted woman gave birth right yeah just I'm feeling it more now that I'm getting older because the bottom line is you know I don't want a mom you know Larry King Michael Douglas Letterman these guys have their kids were in their late 60s yeah well yeah you know what I mean so do it yeah if you get in like right now tweet their photos at Joe Rogan any changes it's time start right I should get Whitney Cummings pregnant what do you think about that - just talk to her and see if that's something she'd be interested in I would imagine she would not be and she wouldn't right yeah I didn't want my semen you have to talk to her to be clear I wouldn't want to decide for her or it could be Eliza I think she's getting married yeah why would you want to get married no I was good yeah I don't know man it's like there's pros and cons you know like Ari's one of my best friends and Ari travels the world and he experiences a life that's very I mean he did you know what I just did where he took three months off actually four months and just vanished didn't talk to anybody didn't bring a laptop yeah he did this Chappelle thing more than that yeah he went to Vietnam and Cambodia and Cambodia Thailand yeah he went all over the place but he did it by himself like with no one and just met people experience things and no one knew who he was no I mean a few people recognized him and they took pictures with him and put him on Facebook and that's how we found out he was still alive yeah it was weird but he just decided like hey I'm just wanna just have an adventure that's something obviously is a question when you have children you can't do that so there's there's there's pros and that I wouldn't want to that's not me I wouldn't want to disappear for four months no kids or kids it's just like I don't have that desire but for him you know the desire to do an adventure to just go someplace for a couple of weeks is cool but when you have kids especially if you have little girls that wait for you and they you know you talk to him on the phone you can't wait to see you it's it's a different world you know how do you know I'm almost 50 I'll feed 50 tomorrow like Oh Mike Hammer 'the day joe thank you that's amazing thank you very much fuckin yeah are you doing a big 50th really no no think birthday parties are bullshit but physically look at me i went to a friend of Mines birthday party whose 50th birthday party was so annoying they played a video we had a watch a video and it was like 20 minutes and I was like Jesus Christ when is it over and then when it was over his fucking family members and his friends got up and told stories with a microphone and they held everybody captive with their shitty stories it was death it was death I couldn't wait to get out of there you know it was funny as that you know do you ever like sometimes like dream about things like when you think things and you like you have dreams yeah I knew I was coming in here today and I had a dream about you yeah and it was interesting I I had a dream that we you know we were doing our thing and it was cool and I said congratulations on your new show your shows been on the air and it was like it was called the Rogen's and it was you in a camper with your your wife and your kids going across America it was like a family like almost like you know almost like the Griswolds right the Rogen's like every hot like her but I know that that's something you would never do but it was funny it was hilarious it was like on the Travel Channel and it was like you guys fishing and eating and just how hilarious would it would be kind of hilarious but it's kind of gross too because like whenever I see people that have their kids on the reality show you're not even letting that kid choose right you don't even give that kid a choice to be famous like honey boo boo or people you're you're just putting your kid on TV before your kid even understands the consequences of it I mean at least when you got on television you were in your 20s well you kind of were an adult you kind of got it I mean it was young and I'm sure I was weird to grow up in the spotlight like that but at least you were a grown-up yeah you know when you see people that have their babies on TV and children on TV like what the fuck are you doing do you not know as a person who's on TV yeah this could be like detrimental devastating just if they read the comments cuz if they went to you know Instagram or YouTube and read the comments like Jesus Christ you know yeah well look at child actors you know what I did did recently is a comic-con you know what that is yeah sure but you know that like you sign things mm-hmm it's hilarious we did it yeah actually I sat down one of those booths yeah it was like I never done it I'm a friend of mine my friend of mine in San Antonio hooked me up with this agent and he just you know they give you you know they they pay you obviously and you fly in and and there's basically Comic Cons as you know it's all like you know people are dressed a Superman and Batman and you know these but then there's the section with celebrities so there's a lot of like people from Breaking Bad there was a lot of people from walking dead but then there was like Rob Schneider was in a booth you know I mean Val Kilmer was in a booth Wow and he's got like throat cancer Val Kilmer his throat can I do it's fucking yeah it's not cool and then you got like Dolph Lundgren there I had no Val Kilmer throat cancer that's oh yeah he's not old no he's like 45 or something yeah fuck man yeah so it was just it was a weird kind of experience it was like awesome and it was also not awesome dude Val Kilmer is the shit in Tombstone was it's a spotted with a breathing aid oh wow yeah it's terrible fuck man yeah it's a fucking it's terrible well he's had some crazy ups and downs with his weight to the point where you got to go like look at those pictures of him on the far right look at those pictures Wow like that was in the massive alcoholic days I mean there's nothing that does that to you like that other than massive eating and alcoholism that's so sad it's weird man people just abuse the shit out of their body like that what about size 4 or cancer what happened to him he was you know look let's look at him where's he at he was he's a friend of mine and I don't know he's he has he was rugged yeah some serious drug shoes yeah he was like he's a great actor right fuck yeah fuckin amazing yeah I know movies he's a savage yeah oh and I saw Michael Matz in there too oh yeah yeah I know it was like a bummer well you have a good sense of humor about yeah the demise of your film query yeah I've seen you joke around about it on stage about like you know trying to get TMZ like hey attention to me man yeah you have to yes yeah I think you have to yeah and the fact is I still have all my money yeah so I didn't like right you didn't go crazy no no I still in my house I don't live in it I live in Silver Lake I have a apartment out there which I enjoy like Silver Lake but um what I like to live in my big mansion up in the hill I don't rent it out yeah lease it out that's smart yeah we do it yeah and I'm one person right so yeah that was like what in Silver Lake I like it I've never understood Silver Lake it's um it's no one bugs you there there's no tour buses there's no billboards there's no Starbucks there's none of that stuff it's different than the valley right it's like all like really cool restaurants really cool bars like really nice people are very quiet you know you sit you can write it's very creative it rides at the East Village in New York that's the vibe yeah so if you ever go out to the east so it's like close field I know bill burr lives in Los Feliz and like that whole area it's pretty cool and the thing that I really like about it is the the architecture there is still old Hollywood yeah you know I love the old buildings like the building that I live in is like in the 1920s guys got that history and I love that you know I love that kind of that history like I don't like sunset now you know I drive by sunset I kind of like you know what I mean like the store and what the Roxy in the rainbow are the only places left I know right there's nowhere when they like when they chop down the House of Blues it's weird the cool thing is the view now the view from the store is sick yeah but what they're probably gonna do is build something bigger though they're gonna build a boutique hotel they're gonna build a high-rise what do you think about the store in the future of the store you're I mean you're not about it it's never been doing better than it is now it's amazing how packed it is I mean it's sold out every night it's constant you know what do you think about the building itself in what way keeping it or not keeping it it's a deal thing what else would you do well I mean I wouldn't do it but I'm just saying if someone came in and offered a whole bunch of money to knock it down and build a hotel dude I mean what would you think well we suck for comedy for sure but the laugh factor is probably not doing so hot you probably take that motherfucker over take the laugh act yes but move down the street but the rooms not that great of a room no but you might do something else well the thing is the comic stores perfect that's part of the problem I mean it literally is perfect yeah you have three different like Wednesday night I did the hat trick I started out in the belly room I'd go Tuesday night I started on the belly room I did a set in the main room and I did a send though are you know there's not a place in the country where you could do that we can perform in front of 90 people 400 people and then 150 people hmm I mean and every show was sold out - not a fucking Tuesday night man yeah Tuesday night three sold-out shows in Hollywood you know and for for me to work out my material like it's so invaluable hmm you know I like to do the ice house I get to the ice house last night - like 35 minutes and I did it with Andrew Santino and Tom Segura and Tom Papa and Frank Castillo and you know it's just these killer lineups and you get awesome shows that people get to have a great time you get to work out and fuck around and like these these clubs around here are so critical they're so important someone came along and bought the comic store I mean it would be the end of a giant era it would be devastating hmm what do you think about it I think what my mom thinks is leave it alone yeah I wouldn't I would not get down well who would be responsible who who is in charge now well I'm not in charge right so is it Peter Peter yeah yeah yeah well the good thing is that the comic starts making now in a lot of money it's doing really well you know hopefully thanks to guys like you around for sure my pleasure I hope it keeps keeps coming and I hope it I mean look it's the most iconic comedy club in the history than yours I agree you know it's my heart you know they mean it's where I've been my whole life I walk into that place every day and I feel like I'm walking inside my mom you know name mean yeah you know what I mean like I really feel like oh and I'm there I feel her know you oh yeah yeah and it's like you know the bar and the in the back um the back room that bar I took it from the Doheny house oh that's right yeah yeah cuz that bar was was uh it was in my mom's house and that's the bar that Kennison and Pryor and everyone got fucked up on yeah we sold the house and we I was cleaning it out you know that's one of the things in the doc series is I might keep this bar yeah cuz it's great and then I had Juan Carlos pick it up and we brought it over to you know to Eric in the back back room and we saved it for you guys that's amazing I did that you know so the comics can have that feeling yeah you know of like because that bar the Doheny house was is as iconic as the Comedy Store yeah you know because that's the house that was like the comedy mansion well you know crest Hill oh no the Doheny house what'd your mom say I never went to that but I almost bought crust Hill okay you know when crest Hill is for sale perfect for you now we have a the vibe it was just I live I'm meant to living right there yeah it was like this is just too derelict like I've always been a guy who likes to live away from stuff and then like come in and then get some quiet and peace well like this might be too much to be like right above the comedy store and I might be like I might burn out you know I mean yeah I'm saying but like that room it's interesting because that that back bar is a new place but it doesn't feel like a new it feels like probably because of that bar and also blows it's in the store right but it's also the old video room right that's where my mom yeah it was like the comedy that's where she kept all our old videos so it feels like you know that that bar is amazing that vibe yes the coolest place you go back there and Ron waddles there throwing his hair around that doesn't work for me bro you own a mean that's not cool bro Italy is hilarious hey what's going on in it's a great crew there now I mean there's so many funny comments yeah it's really an amazing time yeah it's also like a lot of people like you know for me because I've seen the decades of it there's still nothing like the Kennison in the prior days you know like I watch everyone in the back and I'm like they're killing but for some reason it just doesn't feel like I felt when I was reasons why because back then didn't do it and never been anything like that you know I mean you think about prior before Pryor came around who the fuck was like Pryor no one you know and can the send Kinnison was a completely unique kind of talent there'd never been anybody like him before and so now you've seen so much since then they'll never be that uniquely innocent time were people like Jesus yeah but but you know to respond to the the prior thing when he would because I saw him for years developed this show there at the store when he would walk onstage and they would say ladies and gentlemen Richard Pryor it was like fucking Jesus it was like yeah people like literally like would stand up be like no way fuck oh it was like that typisch like Elvis yeah like that type of shit so I so I saw that and and there was something so obviously well he was just so funny dude you only mean like even if his material wasn't funny that night he was just funny there's a genius yeah a real comedy genius and ya know probably one of the most influential stand-up comedians ever him and Kinison Kevin Kinnison I mean I think obviously Pryor was before my Kennison learned a lot from Pryor yeah but Kinnison was very groundbreaking in a lot of wait didn't never been anybody like him well yeah and it's also before Sam gotten that you know too much of the drugs I think that he had that five-year run which was fucking yeah I know I was on that run too with and I was like opening for him for a while the road and then like he started getting you know what I mean he started going off the deep end yeah nobody can sustain that especially I mean did you ever read his brothers book Sam I didn't read no I did it's a great book yeah and in and his brother sort of talks about how Sam just kind of started stopped writing because he was partying all the time and his material suffered and you could really feel the difference and nobody could live that rock'n'roll crazy drug life and and still be an awesome creative force like creativity demands your attention yeah his I got so many stories and insane but the his Rodney Dangerfield young comedian specials were like fucking yeah I like that the second one was just as good as the first one you know you know who's fucking genius dude I got to get out of here unfortunately I notice in today to go on but I wanted everybody to know about it and so tell people where they could see this on Funny or Die yeah just go to Funny or Die check out the Steven Miller clip also crack all my show on crackle and I'll be coming out with some documentary stuff and Pauly Shore stands alone is on Amazon right
