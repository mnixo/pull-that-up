we're gonna go live five four three two Tom papa is obviously some sort of a nicotine junkie he's using it a knife made out of a nail to scratch open the box where he can get a visa guys like Ben Franklin used this knife to open up wine ones that's from the pygmies oh really yeah they made it for me look at their little handle my good friend Justin Wren who's been on the podcast a few times ray he's this amazing guy that does he makes wells for the pygmies he's he was a former UFC fighter now he fights for Bellator he's went in there heavyweight division this big teddy bear of a guy like the fucking nicest guy every one of me oh yeah and he goes to the Congo and and builds wells and we've we've helped him out we got some people that donate Bitcoin which by the way is worth more money now so what I'm gonna do is take whatever it's worth now and just give it to the Congo people I gotta wait this week we're gonna weigh JPMorgan guy screwed it up he fucked up understand the Bitcoin and just make it go up and down fast very beautiful they look luscious how many people this is what this is what you offer somebody right before you screw them Joe our cigar stop and think about this yeah when you are buying a cigar like let's think about the kind of people that you think of smoking cigars I think I'm like a jay-z type character on a yacht right yes looking out over the ho beautiful ocean going I did it fucking did it I mean there's no denying I'm here yeah yes he's got a fat gold rope around his neck champagne or maybe a nice martini or so yeah sitting there just going what the fuck yeah get any better this is it I did yeah he wins so hard and that's that's the beauty of the cigar is you could be in your little crappy yard smoking cigar you feel like that but here's my thought when we associate the cigar with that guy think about who makes a cigar you're talking about people who live in tiny villages that get paid almost nothing that are rolling these things together god bless them how much are they getting paid I mean I know there's some there's some places in Miami where you can actually go and you can actually watch them make cigars they'll roll up cigars it's pretty badass impressive but like who is who is profiting from this like yeah the big whoever owns the big giant tobacco company right but they need those people that roll those yeah you do but you know the little guys were all in the things he he's you know just making a little living doing his little thing he can't build the whole tobacco companies corporate TomTom yeah what he's essentially like he's a little worker you mean the worse would be and you need the queen bee right but isn't that person a lot like what we were talking about with stand up mm-hmm like the the comedian is the one who actually makes the product right yeah this is the comedy clubs were getting all the money right and you were in in poverty and the comedy club was balling out of control yeah wouldn't you feel like like this is bullshit yes and no because in New York as you remember there was a big riot big everyone was like these clubs are paying this 20 bucks a spot they've been paying us that forever screw them they make money ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and I had a hard time with it because I felt like what they're giving us in a place to go and do stand-up every night and have an audience there right the value I was getting for my act was so much more valuable than the $20 I was getting paid I think my hair about the time I wanted them to give me a place where I could go work on my act and then take that to some other city or some other bigger gig and that's where I would make my mind so you know what I mean it was it wasn't purely like screw the man the man's giving me a comedy club and has run this place for 30 years so I can roll in on a Wednesday and have 200 people there well there's certainly I think a different feel that you have for places that are like your say if you were an Icehouse comedian and you essentially have like a partnership at the ice house like I feel like I have a bit of a partnership at the ice house yes we're gonna do you sell it out yeah and I love that place when I love Bob the guy who owns great you know I don't mean a partnership like I have an ownership in it but I feel like there's it I have a bit of an obligation I think we all do to perform at the great clubs just like to just keep them floating and yeah keep everybody happy and into because you can and it's good for you and it's good for me and it's good for everybody you heard of a partnership maybe maybe that's not a bit the best word but there's some sort of inexorable relationship you cannot separate them for sure like there's some cities you know like hilarities in Cleveland right I love that Club much love the only using place Knicks the greatest guy great food - they're all soaked family it literally is great people I have no interest of going to Cleveland and playing a theater because if I if everybody comes up and jumps on Nick right then I'd rather draw spend a couple days mm-hmm Oh makes the same money pretty much I like that is a relationship like you've had a relationship throughout the years for me to jump and then seems weird it does right but there's some other places that you don't feel like that I mean you know also your thing with the ice house it's like you say you're playing the ice house now and fight tonight it's sold out not before tonight and these got a really good business going there you know I've also I've been able to get guys like you in there on stage and Berger comes in a lot now yeah it's like you get people to realize like this is an amazing place to practice yeah and the people are so cool it's like the best there's a difference in like the feel of the audience like LA it's like wow we're at the college tour right believe it we're a nice house it's like wow we're out to see a show it's like it is there's a different feel totally different yeah you feel like you're almost a little on the road yeah you know what's like that - Oxnard Oxnard do you ever done that place know the new levity no no being amazing Club and now we're outside of LA and you're on the road uh comedy magic same same time you know any place where when you wake up in the morning you're like oh I got but you know those gigs mad they're so fucking important cuz you have those shitty gigs to impress you appreciate the nice ones oh absolutely every gig is good yeah even the worst ones but back to your cigar thing you know there are these little workers that are probably making $2.00 a day that's the point rolling the stuff I mean I'm just guessing I don't really know maybe with dead off and maybe these people are like highly compensated skilled labor well it's probably layers of it there's probably a guy who's really good at it you know who runs everybody's benefits 30 years old and he's motherfucker to just wash right you know dudes who could just roll joints ya never meet those guys so impressive like a cigarette it made slide it out their mouth I have no skill I am a fucking ape fingered retard when it comes to rolling a joint I used to be good at it but I watched some people like Tony inch cliff we're gonna roll a fucking fat joint really yeah Jamie Muro rolls goddamn good joint I used to be good at it you know what the problem with me man I got one of those roller things does a little a little roll machine roll with the fingers the best ones are with the fingers there's one you I have that you could go like that you put the rolling paper in you put the the weed in and then you know you lick the paper and then you just go like that bump bump and it does it all really all by itself yeah it rolls it up so advanced yeah it's evident it's so good I'm like I'm not rolling I'm an asshole when you're smoking by yourself or with sticks shit when you sit by yourself do you roll or do you just take like I'm already rolled by by I'm already rolled from now a speed weed for all your delivery services that's very much when you buy them already rolled like you don't have to think about it I don't want to think about shit yeah but some people have the rich what the ritual of that I used to love the deep dude on an album I used to and they had albums replaced the album for rolling weed on and then it went to CD cover you would do whatever city could be cover and now people use those actual weed themed trays that seems kind of corny to me yeah like you should steal some shit from a cafeteria have I go Pirates of the Caribbean like ornate little tray you you should have man you should get one of them aluminum ones from prison because you're in a prison of your own mind man like standard-issue aluminum yeah prison trade believe yeah those are fake mashed potatoes you're in a prison of your own mind man you got a free your mind do you have a cutter I do not oh yeah I could chew it off when I think about the cigar though I don't think of Jay Z so much as like it's a wonderful life like the banker and it's wonderful and we had a box with the cap cutter in it and some other bullshit did I bring that in I can bite it off when I started out of school like worked in advertising for a little while and I used to go to this nursing home we did it was small advertising and we would go to a nursing home and we would do all the ad campaign for this guy who owned like five nursing homes he was a really rich guy and he looked a little like a frog he was like an older guy came up in the war and he used to you know first he started with trucks now he owns nursing homes and he was like an old school guy big glasses right and he always had a cigar all day long he'd walk around with a cigar in his mouth just chomping on it not lit he would just chompa chompa chompa and it would be like kind of scuzzy at the end but then eventually no cutter at the end he'd been chewing it so long we just spit it out and then light it up hmm yeah it might be the other I can fight it off don't work that's in the kitchen already yeah we'll just bite it off just go old-school yeah yeah old-school Bugsy shingle type we do feel like a big shot with a cigar why is that I don't know why do you feel like a big shot I don't know I feel gross spitting it out till I know here's a tissue can weed in there son yeah but Jaime can we find out whether or not cigar rollers are abused and underpaid mm-hmm scar industry's gonna be pissed at us now I'm sure you are it's a weird thing right it's like a cigar is like a a thing it's affluent right but it's also like a like a guy thing or yes chick who can hang things oh she smoked cigars oh come on you know she a girl with like an open blouse like wearing glasses like smoking cigar bands Rolex hat on yeah fucking Dodgers hat on yes you know screaming facts about the Broncos yeah but those cheerleader type socks go all the way up to her knees that girl's fun to hang with one night but you don't wanna you don't want that girl for the long haul well she's a sprinter yeah yeah an ultramarathon runner so is just slow and steady and they just keep that pace and they will not quit yeah arms in tight just go in little steps with no underwear on and sweat socks with your shirt on and she's smoking a cigar like yeah all right you're not coming to Thanksgiving I don't think this is gonna be fun for a little while it's like a roller coaster would you want to ride a roller coaster eight hours a day for the rest you you nauseous all the time yeah I mean that's that's the function that crazy people have in your life therefore you ball but you don't want to be around them constant no a hell of a lot of bonding no you pack up the car and go visit once in a while and that that's it yeah pretty crazy people are exhausting now totally exhausting I want this crazy girl once and it went on longer than it should and she was intensely fun I mean crazy just you know insane everything about it was fun and insane and I stayed in too long and by the end of it I was like he just got it you gotta go I was almost in tears like this because it wasn't just the like the crazy fun drought it was like they directed at you at a certain point and they want him to put the crazy on you and analyze and fight some people definitely want to fight I can't living with fight I'm not either some people think that you're supposed that's how a relationship supposed to be I get if you're not fighting the year somehow or another you don't care about each other because if you care you get upset so I'm very weird sort of dynamic demand woman relationship dynamic of things that people think you shouldn't shouldn't expect right the way people behave or don't behave the way they talk to you or don't talk to you like yeah it's very hard you know it's weird as if it's all the same if any friendship is the same yeah don't let don't let people be mean to you don't let them fucking beat you down you'll shit at you but some people like if you grow up in a home that fights all the time yeah you get used to that and then you it's not a big deal like she would this girl she would fight screaming yeah Lynette and like as soon as was it was done she'd be fine just like some coffee and just like said that and I'd be shaking like oh my god why did she say like I am NOT good with that kind of tension that at all yeah I used to date this girl would get really mad really mad and want to fight and then once once there was some sort of resolution should immediately turn docile it was very odd docile she'd be aggressive to like start some sort of altercation but you could calm the altercation down shut it down yeah but you had to almost shut it down by just saying oh you're not gonna do this I'm not gonna talk like this like this is like a child yeah and I was young so I needed to learn like how to talk to people right like or how to manage situations like sometimes like something's happening between two people like you're you're upset about something and instead of thinking about how you're conveying your thought to them all you think of is what you want to happen you know right I want you to shut the fuck up you want someone to shut the fuck up the problem is when you say that yeah you're not really thinking about communicating with them like through their eyes like that wants anyone to say shut the fuck up but we say it because we want people to shut the fuck up and you can't deal with yeah I'm not yeah that is everybody you don't want you don't care what their needs are you just stop well it's well it's also like when people want people to do things so they want people there's there's that the the mindset of you wanting a result you want someone to behave a certain way instead of thinking about them as like your equal I can just another human being and instead of thinking like I have to get what I want like what is it that you want and could what what happened here like why are we well that is a TAS I find like impasse getting older that thing I'm more aware of your it's that big part of not thinking about you all the time you're always think especially when you're young and you're like coming up and you're doing it's just me me me me because you're just trying to survive you're trying to figure you don't even know what you want when you shut that part down and think about the person across from you yeah it opens up the whole world but it's a difficult thing to learn when it's absolutely when you're young contradictory to success like you think but not like it's like yeah I think it's like if you don't think about yourself no one will you know there's that kind of thought process right just get really good at shit yeah that's way here's the ironic thing one of the best ways to get really good at shit yeah is shutting that voice down yeah shut down especially with boys of the voice that voice like me me me alright this and all that and I want you know people to listen to me right shut that thing down yeah the more you can shut that thing down and the more whatever you do you concentrate on it it going to work and nobody does it were perfect now does it pro well it's not only that you'd they don't do it perfect it's that you have to constantly reteach yourself that you have to constantly bring yourself back that's you bring yourself back it's a it's a it's a trick it's an ongoing exercise it really is and that's why it's like I was watching this interview with Nate Diaz UFC fighter mmm-hmm he's hilarious and Nate was talking about watching himself on the Ultimate Fighter from 10 years ago and he's like please shut that shit yeah he goes anybody watch a video of yourself from 10 years you'd be like shut that shit up here and I was thinking he's so right yeah that's an obvious thing like nobody likes to see themselves yeah I'm a long time ago because we're all a work in progress but when you were in that moment when that video was taken of you you thought you had it going on you thought you were doing right yeah sure I mean right now we think we're in the moment like we're doing fine but you if you were to look back at this there'd be something wrong I'm upset that the cigar has two bands I feel like I took the first band off immediately I am really two bands how about you take the money from one of these bands pay those dudes roll this motherf R such a socialist Internet call me as I get old are you shifting are you shifting yeah yeah yeah you know I got shift towards lately more than anything is like kindness to our fellow humans that is the exact word I have been using all month act out of kindness yeah politicians people grocers my family just be kind just be kind yeah and I think the more we recognize that the more we see evidence of that evinced an idea even in like groups or you know chunks of people that share our mindset on other things and we don't want to call it we don't want to call them out on it right like say if you're a Republican and there's like some Republican candidate or something that's running for president but they're really shady in one way yeah corrupt or what and you know you don't want to talk about it because it's a part of your party yeah right that's insane you can't yeah you well you know tribalism inside our own civilization is fucking bananas I feel like that's like the most disturbing thing of the all the discourse now is that people are so entrenched in these teams yeah you're a sucker if you rule that in on any of these teams no team is partly you've got a flow do you think that's because people are scared and so they feel like they feel more comfort and being a part of like some rigid team like so I see if you're right that's what I see in like a lot of these white supremacists yes see fear yes guys are walking in there hold these flags and there these torches and they're yelling things yeah I see fear yeah I really do yeah that's a big part of what it is yeah they're coming for me they're coming for us they're they're pushing us out we're supposed to all be the same thing we look different Jesus Christ that's it I mean and all the other differences that we have like left and right and ideologies and just how can you be all in yeah on any political yeah organize a like how can you how it's my faith it's just like what's that I'm all in on weed well Eric team weed you can go for it ah blue team cigar you okay I really don't understand it like you really have and what's really upsetting about it is it goes completely against what we're talking about him listening to the other person like really listening to them yeah there's a guy on my block older guy he's retired he's got his little dog he walks his little dog every day and he always hey you know we've only been there a couple of years good morning tom good morning Bob and he just walks with his dogs just like this nice he's the guy from these in my movie of my life he's the extra the walks the guy right my wife saw that he had a Trump poster in his garage and my wife was all in on Hillary she was like I don't think I can I don't think I can I couldn't talk to him I was like yes you can that doesn't mean any so what so that's what he went for him did it so what he's Bob the guy with the dog yeah he's a loving person who really is excited to see us and our children and our dog in the morning stop using that thing this one isolated thing yeah as two as a marker for whether or not this person can enter your life in any way the only way you should is if that person is trying to force that on you and make you believe what they believe right and if you don't support Trump then they hate you and then then it becomes it's virtually interchangeable with religion yeah right like if your next-door neighbor's a Jew and the guy on the other side of you is a Baptist and you're an atheist there's no reason why you can't all be great friends yeah great friends yeah hang out it's like hey what's up you guys want to come over we're gonna do some hotdogs or whatever I fix at a kosher who gives a shit who gives a shit and isn't it more effective if you are really politically minded and really want your your you really love Hillary and you love what she stood for and you want that isn't it more effective to invite this guy into your life and let him see that he has a lot more in common with this liberal family at the end of the block then putting up walls and keeping him out I think that people were given a real disservice by being forced to choose only on one side or the other one of them Donald Trump and the other one is Hillary Clinton this this like hustle system that they put together of a two-party system yeah is the reason why it's so difficult cuz a party has to choose a candidate you have to vote on in the primaries so you have to be registered not that many people are I don't think about the actual numbers of people that vote in the primaries it's a fraction of the people that vote in the general election right and that's a fraction of the population yeah and so if you forced to choose between like this really lackluster candidate and people say oh she hadn't all this experience didn't regardless of what you think about Hillary with supported her or not you you'd have to look at it objectively and say well she's a deeply flawed candidate it means she had a lot of issues he had a lot of credibility issues she didn't support gay marriage until 2013 that was one of my big red flag yeah because I'm like how why do you care right why do you care like if you really care if you really think really believe that gay people shouldn't have the same rights in terms of like bonding in a relationship than a straight person well that's a crazy person's idea like what do you give a shit right that doesn't make any sense yeah what is it why is it there's no no proof that marriage is putting this gigantic burden on our on us financially yeah and why do you Wendy and what do you hear about how these people live why why is it just leave them be so behind that was a great one to me and then like when you hear the difference between what Comey said about the investigation and when the results were versus what she said like there's a video where it plays it back to back where she says that yeah everything was fine and everything was no big deal and he's like it's a fucking huge deal and they like she would say that you know this would there was no evidence of this and he said there was evidence of this in multiple occasions it's like you look at the two of them back-to-back you know what the fuck man yeah and people got mad at me for making a big deal out of that like there's a lot of people that say hey man you know you're partially responsible people like you for pointing out all this Hillary Clinton shit like right no no we're talking about reality not not responsible for reality sucking well incident but the idea is the opposite is don't talk about it at all right and pretend it doesn't exist and that's and that's the problem with with all these people being pit against each other they can't see the other side and have a little bit of flow I feel like it also has become this it's almost like news is entertainment now when we watch a you know 24 hour news programs and stuff it's like rooting for the Bears or rooting for the Steelers you know what I mean like it's become this passionate you know sport yeah entertaining sport it's kind of uh it's it's kind of upsetting I mean it's very upsetting like guys that Sean Hannity guy yeah how is that guy any more different Donald like a local football broadcaster who's really excited about the Patriots just ask to see oh my god is gonna be great they're not gonna be stopped up and they say what they want about Brady didn't to plate those balls it's completely ya know he's like a fucking raw raw Republican care today right just like almost like a football guy hundreds always yeah and you're not gonna convince him to like the New York Giants he's a Patriots guy this is the way it goes but I really feel like you got to go through life and rather than thinking about and I want to be too preachy but not to be you shouldn't be going by my party you should be going by the acts of these people yes so everybody everybody's like you so you can hate that that Pruitt is going after public lands and rolling back all this EPA stuff and then you see Trump make a deal yesterday with Pelosi and Schumer saying we're gonna try and make sure that these daca kids are allowed to stay right it through everybody like wait wait what it but but I still have to hate him but Nancy Pelosi's in its office making a deal with him well that's how you should act it should be he should be allowed to do something kind he should be allowed to you should be allowed to call him out when he does something shitty yeah it shouldn't be just this blanket I love the guy no matter what well you know someone said and I forget who it was I forget who the person wasn't had this idea but the idea was that one of the good things about Trump would be that he is concerned with public opinion and so if he floats an idea out there and it's not popular or it's really damaging public opinion of him he'll take a second look at huh which is a very non politician like thing to do you know what people point to terrible things that he's done in the past almost as like evidence that he can't evolve you know what evidence that he's a sociopath right we're fucking doomed if that's the case we're doomed if human beings and human beings in general right and we're doomed I mean if you can't learn at 70 is it is it over like there's a difference oh yeah when you're 20 you could figure things out yeah 30 you know I'm better than I was when I was 20 right no you know right it's 70 no then it's not yeah there's no more like a super extreme scenario like yeah and the president of the free world terrifying I mean he's the leader of the free world yeah at 70 at 70 and with a bunch of people that hate him and then talking about like shipping immigrant kids back oh yeah there's people that were born here when they were 2 no yeah they're brought here rather when they were 2 yeah they were born another country they don't know the other country at all and they'll send them back to it it's crazy scary it's very scary it's scary because it's not there's no empathy to that like these people no terror it's one thing if someone is some sort of a dangerous criminal well if that's the case they should be in fucking jail that's what jails for right right why would you just set them free in Mexico this sounds crazy and you know we have this girl in our life who was born here she was part of that and has since gotten her citizenship so she was safe but just recently so as soon as they came in and started saying we might send them back like taro taro was like hiding in our house like can I just sleep here she was so nervous just to sleep in her little apartment somewhere because she thought they were gonna come and get her dude a friend of mine is a contractor and he went to Home Depot and I was in he's in Home Depot he gets out of his car and he's I see II guys I mean this guy is distinguished looking you know handsome man yeah in his 50s right now and speaks perfect English uh-huh they they flash their fucking badges you know he makes them shows the first they just said you have till he goes didn't listen just came up to him in the parking lot this listen dumbass he's like he's former military he's like I told him because I was in the military like you guys can't do this there's not something you do you don't just come up to someone and ask where were you born is that what they that's how they let it I'm worried born show me your ID oh my god and he was like what the fuck are you guys doing he goes I'm gonna show you my military ID okay hey go now here's my ID okay now what the fuck are you guys doing you can't do this yes it's totally illegal it's that's insane just grabbing people out of their cars for no reason I'm gonna back your life looking brown bro you looking put the brown over there bro see that's not kind let them Brown bro where you born that's insane ask him where he was born that's crazy served in our military exactly walking control first of all was born in America what he was absolutely yeah but he has to prove that has to prove it around and but just ask him where where did your parents have you it's the one thing you cannot control don't you think that right exactly we were right we might not be anything with immigration my parents my parents parents were born here exactly Native Americans yeah the only ones who were legitimately here long enough to claim it right they came across the fucking Bering Land Bridge right from Asia spots nobody you fucking assholes yeah we're just taking a brown guy right out of his Subaru I'm sure if you took those guys of those officials they have to have the same story we all came from somewhere else I know it's insane so crazy this guy's not doing a crime like you're just assuming that he's some sort of an illegal immigrant yeah because he's at Home Depot himself he's fucking contract you can't be an American we just throw our shit out he says affixes TV all right that's not is that racial profiling or is that racist like it's more racist I think it's more racist cuz look racist really means that you are using power to put people down for their race and we say racist is just saying something shitty about somebody it's not really it's it's when you really have power over people and use that yeah and that's what that is oh yeah hundred percent and it's it's like a target and here's the thing man maybe he's right thirty percent of the time that he does this maybe that cop does that all the time and catches these guys that are there that are illegal immigrants and they're just there to try to hustle and work on people's houses like that's why we have laws it's like exactly two things wasted resource unless they're criminals right unless they're criminals while there are people who were fuck right fucked at birth at birth at birth it was the way they came right yes they're stuck in some poor country and they figure out a way to get across the border illegally can you imagine can you imagine how desperate people must be in these other countries that you would you as a father you would tell your kids go with this man and hopefully get over to that other country for a better life could you imagine how desperate you would have to be to tell your children go that is a desperate desperate situation and it just is a roll of the dice that you were born 50 miles that way like my friend Justin who makes these wells for people in the Congo the well just having fresh water yeah changes their life the one thing that we absolutely take for granted yeah they give it away free at restaurants that we give away to everybody for free yeah the thing that changes their life in the Congo a fresh clean glass of water that I'm using nothing nothing to everything you clean your so whether we had Japanese toilets I do oh it's the best best I moved into a house I didn't we didn't know what it was and we're just looking around we walk into the bathroom and the lid open no it's easy and the seat is warm it's heaven it is it's almost sexual I think is that warm waters shoot in your asshole and here's the thing it's like an there's only an on/off button enough creep how many people are just sitting there with rod or shooting out of their asshole stroking their shaft it must be it must be like the number one tool for masturbation and everybody around the world does it but Americans it's not it right the bidet is not a main thing in America but we prefer to do is chop down trees and make a fine paper that that we smear shit over and then walk about your day with fecal matter all over the fucking room radically cut down on the amount of thinking matter available if we just had Jets of water the rest the world right just fly it out but the rest of how they do that but de thing which is awkward it's like is the most under gunawan the little pipe thing it's right where your asshole goes and there's nowhere to sit it seems much nastier the first time you walk into a hotel and saw that as a kid you're like what I don't care if I'm cleaner I'm not doing that I was in a hotel in New York City I forgot the hotel but they had some crazy setup where there was not just a bad day but they had to fucking hoses one on either side of the bowl in that hard metal so you got a bidet over here yeah and you got a bath with these two fucking carwash hoses they're right next to the toilet how clean do you have to be but it's like I mean he just shoot water everywhere waiting what are you doing with those two what do you do it in there he's like one the right hand and one the left hand and yeah why I don't like cleaning my asshole with my right hand and do it and I've got to go left grab this and strangle myself as I clean my butt I'm not I I keep my phone and I look this up when that happened I remember that yeah the answer I don't know if it's even better than the bidet it's to clean the shit off inside the toilet that many don't know one of them is that's why it's so hard double ho clean the whole second ones for but that's what one of them is for really that's a shitty way to do it pardon my pun these these people are eating the wrong food yeah thank you guys would you ever have you ever thought about going to other countries and doing volunteer work what is that just came out yesterday or there for years how much shit 140 town fat Birds ton 140 ton oh my god fat berg has been discovered under the streets of London what does that mean it's oil fat tampons wet wipes diapers oh it's a and it's stuck in this it's like concrete now they said it's not gonna spike oh my get 400 the size of two football pitches is that mainly a soccer yeah it looks like the Globes that bigger or shorter than American football it's a little longer of course it is and wider was found in London sewers Jesus Christ and is it blocking something fucking shit no oh my god oh god pipes under there holy shit oh yeah yeah this is like the ultimate clogged drain this is so mance what it is right yeah no plungers getting that out did I ever show you the picture of the tree that was growing in my toilet pipe no tree no dude I was having a problem my toilet wouldn't flush correctly uh-huh so I had a fella come over to take care of it and he said dude he goes look at that that that's an actual picture of the thing that was in my bathroom is it that is a tree that's roots got into a small crack in the water pipe the centers they grow and they they continue to grow where the pipe is crack it and once they crack it something goes inside and then it grows where the water seeping up the pipe so the pipe was clogged with like a tree it looked like an animal it's disgusting so for years you were just you thought it was going that right out of pipe it shows you what I'm eating trees all the vitamins that come out my piss like this is always a bright orange it's like so many vitamins it's the happiest root I ever saw went hog-wild it's like almost proof that what I'm doing it's like a little Shopify it's like feed me Joe I think I was yeah Wow I don't think I was eating wild game back then either wonder what it would look like now it was happier in the in your toilet that it was out nature what if you change your diet it turned different colors maybe with like a high beet concentrate diet that's so big it looks like it has a personality telling the rest of the trees get in here bro I'm so happy do you know sign of nutrients there's water and shit I love it wait a minute in a pipe yeah you live in a stew of water and shit and they keep dropping shit on you everyday and you absorb it no way you live there yeah bro there's no dirt it's just water and they let you live it no he has no idea I'm there bro I'm telling you dirt sucks fuck dirt what you need to do is grow a shit pike fuck shit pipe for a tree is like being jay-z with cigar for a regular person oh yeah so happy he found the shit play he's out there hustling he made his way up the shit pipe you hear about Harry yeah bro he worked out that fucking pipe for years man you gotta admit the dude put his time in alright there's a lot of weeds out there that are complaining about but these fuckers they grow real fast and then they just stay the same size they're not hustlers I don't have the long game like Harry I don't know Harry seems happy but could he be the I would miss the Sun personally I'd miss the sunshine you say that okay but Harry's mostly a rout all right could be out there in the dirt and occasionally peak up a little good pouring those sad roots that have the the story of the rest of the root system like they they're up above yeah and the rest the roots like what's going on up there shut the fuck up just the fuckin comin I'm making a break for it dere's gonna eat the little saplings shut the fuck up I miss Harry yeah Harry was Osler Harry is the jay-z of tree roots do did you hear Harry got busted what yeah this plumber came in you get too big you fucking salad keys every day and that's when they come for you it's it's behind the music all over again it is that is terrible it is behind the music goddammit you're right how are you got to Bing I would um he's goddamn bad company song when you see what's goin on and around the world in these horrible places you know my my daughter's have friends and the Sun in the summer their parents take them to Haiti or someplace and they work for a week or two helping build these places and it's not I was like this is just like a white you know I'm feeling good about myself kind of a thing you know what I mean and then I go back home and the fuckin wonderful people man that kind of but they really do need the help like they really honestly benefit from from people coming down and helping them and bringing supplies and stuff new but you have any desire to do that like Yuri pygmy guy yeah I'd have to really think that one through man I think my best method of helping is just talking shit here about it yeah you're good at it yeah I mean get donating money yeah I don't know but getting lean and go sleeping on a I don't know if that's the most effective thing for me yeah maybe that's just a cop-out on my part I don't know I feel like I should do it once you know what I think the real issue with all these different places is mm-hmm they don't like there's only so much access to growth in certain places you know like we think of life as being growth oriented like especially in this country yeah in this country we think of life not as like do you have enough to eat do you have friends around you that you care about are you having a good time we don't think about it that way right we think about it as are you constantly moving for are you out of the clubs now oh good good good urge guys I bought a new house yeah Marina del Rey yeah you're always moving yeah you're always moving you're moving up yeah always going for whereas that is just how we mark success mm-hmm whereas in a lot of cultures that's not even a part of life there is no like moving up like you can get a job and you can work and you're part of this community yeah do whatever you do whether you're a fisherman or whether you're a carpenter or whatever you do yeah but that's it you just live that life and so that's their idea of what life is no our idea of life is you know get a nice car get a nice house get a big TV but what if there's something past that right like what if some new thing comes along that makes this idea completely fucking ridiculous no no you may get enough credit so you can plug into the matrix right and like and then we start thinking like that like with this idea that the only way your life could ever be good if you get a nice new laptop right or get a you know or you live in a nice community ya know that seems a little weird because really it's just life yeah no I know I mean the bigger yeah and then you get you accumulate more the problem with it is that you accumulate more things yes and then you you're still in that vulnerable feeling now I got to pay for this and move forward and get like you say get more like midnight then you're with your friend on his private jet you're like well I don't have that I guess I have to keep working yeah you know what yeah and then this guy has a yacht oh my god he's got a yacht he's got a 59 foot yet this any big big 100 hundred twenty foot what's a good size yacht the Conor put this up to their day this yacht pulled up a little when he was like hanging out wherever he is but that's a yacht I started thinking about the problems you would have if you had this yacht like you got to have a security team because someone's I'll show you how big it is oh my god Dallas dark it's got opening from the side for over-seasoned boat tomorrow a whole boat can go inside the yacht problems you'd have if you had this yacht who's even crazier I don't know much look where is this it's like a space yakitori is maybe something like that visa they say it they say a visa what is that that's silly tell me put a th on that bed now there's a yachts incredible man it's crazy yeah but what's enough I guess is the good thing Jesus crate see what 360 million dollar yacht well fuckin a man that's when you're ballin see what we don't see is that sitting back with a cigar Gong we got to bring back record sales we look at the books concerts just can't do it it's just not enough money chocolate I need 390 million to give a slightly larger yeah with a diamond-encrusted anchor and a crew that will lower it and wipe it off where I poke the water off when we pull it out of the water a crew of hot white chicks with big asses that's the only buddy who works there you know they don't hire any like third-world help it's all hot white chicks do you think it's a sickness that we have to keep racing or do you feel like it's healthy I feel like it keeps you making stuff and keeps you you know creating and doing things um it can it can be either alright rain it could be a good thing because people who aren't ambitious and don't get things done a lot of times you know we all know like lazy guys and their you know sometimes their family can suffer yeah they don't make ends meet and it's not because of the lack of opportunity right because they fuck up and they're lazy and they don't just deal with it and get together but at a certain point in time we definitely know people that are caught up in it to the point where that's all they're concerned with yeah other concern with is moving up and the numbers and the ladder and yeah that's not good either no that's not so either one it's like you've defined this family comfortable balanced as a human being yeah and don't get swept away by your pursuit right your pursuit is just something that you're engaging in but yeah this is why I like I like to look at this is a fucking very hippie way to look at things but I honestly like to look at all my pursuits like everything I do or I try to do as something that hopefully makes me a better person mmm is contradictory as they they are in some ways like jiu-jitsu a lot of people would think would be contradictory to making you a better person oh you just how they're strangling people it seems kind of mean Joe Rowe that's not really what you're doing we're doing is you're testing yourself from these extreme situations with other like-minded people and you develop a lot first of all you develop a keen understanding of your actual vulnerability right you know because I've been choked out by people that I outweigh by like 30 pounds 40 pounds really yeah for sure me yeah happens all the time and I'm decent right yeah and I get my ass kicked yeah people way smaller than me well it's humbling and people bigger than me that are better than me they just run right through me like I don't exist and I've been doing it a long time so imagine yeah like the average person that has this delusional perspective of who they are right you have to fate and you also got to get used to getting tapped out and getting used to getting tapped out like it's humbling and it doesn't feel good and then you have to be able to just accept it yes a learning thing like don't get your ego attached to this the reason why you got tapped out is your arm is supposed to be here and you reached here and you got caught don't do that anymore now you know ya should thank that person for for taking advantage of whatever possibilities you leave yeah because when you leave these openings now you need to know those openings are there because you didn't know it was there before next time you won't do this with your arm right you keep your arm right here like you're supposed to right and you might still get tapped out but it'll be harder is it amazing like I mean anytime you talk about whether it makes you a good person any kind of a thing like that like what you're talking about is kind of some where to yoga it's kind of similar to talking about like going and helping the pygmy it's all about the common denominator with all of it is getting your ego out of it getting your ego out of the way and it's a being active is looking at like really taking some objective time yeah a lot of people just keep going right they don't ever stop and assess and yeah themselves how could I've done that better how could I handle this better yeah it's there's a there's a real it's like if you can get rid of that the the the ego and the self and all this and realize you're a part of something larger like even in jiu-jitsu like the way you're describing it it's that you're interacting with other human beings it's not like you just isolated walking around thinking I'm great it's only when you get there with other people yeah that you're kind of learning and get having that back and forth and I think um I honestly think yoga's real similar in that way to yoga is like very humbling mmm you do it together with a group of people and everyone's struggling oh and there's this brutal and you're you're on the mat next to two tiny girls who are just doing things that you can't do never and you're just like that's it's humbling yeah it's um like yeah humbling there's a lady that works out at my yoga class sometimes she's like you know maybe she might be 60 she's definitely in her late 50s yeah and she's jacked dude she's Jack yeah he does handstands and shit yeah it's like it's so inspirational amazing I'm watching this lady take a yoga class I mean she does CrossFit and she's just fucking completely shredded I mean six-pack shoulders just obviously fantastic genetics but also right never stop working out right her whole life always moving yeah always doing it Jesus like and it to be like next to this lady was also of course ultra flexible yeah in a class yeah watch or do all this she's like holy shit your arms are shaking like a little baby giraffe thank you and for her it's humbling no that's my point is that like it's fucking hard yeah when you do hard shit and I don't think enough of us do yeah hard shit puts things in perspective your mind wants to gravitate towards softness in the couch and easy road and naps and yeah ah fuck that let's yeah your mind gravitates towards that easy Oh a hundred percent yeah just like ah someone's gave me someone's head you know why people wallow in shit because it's warm and comfortable their great great great it is great it is it's like oh it's just like this come but you know there's that thing like we're talking about you know being living in these communities and other countries and just you're a fisherman you do your little thing is that wallowing and shit and just staying small or is there beauty and a great life living in something small like that there's beauty in a great life in doing things that make you happy right there's a lot of people that believe that subsistence living like those folks that like live off the land like in villages and they catch fish and they have like a whole set up yeah and they're not without food right have food but the life essentially is about procuring food it's not about getting a job at a factory somewhere right right and then a factory will come along and then all sudden the factory says hey we'll pay you $2 a day like holy should have never seen $2 in my life okay you start working for this Factory and now you're eating terrible food you're not hanging hang out in the village yakking all day yeah and you're making whatever fucking brand of sneakers that they sell in America they can make them down there and pay a guy $2.00 a day right or whatever the rate is yeah yeah I'm obviously exaggerating yeah but I don't think I'm exaggerating by much not like two bucks an hour maybe so are you good sixteen dollars a day whoa you fucking really taking care of you guys right yeah we're good man ship ship down there to have it taken care of and that these people without us would be broke what okay maybe they would or maybe they live in a rich eco environment right maybe I'm rich maybe they live in like a nice simple yeah musical healthy world yeah yeah maybe they live in you ever seen that fucking word or herzog documentary happy people no it's called happy people a something in the taiga life in the taiga that's about the taiga river in Siberia and these people that live up there and they have almost no money everything whatever money that they do have like if they trap furs and stuff like that yeah traded in for like equipment and some money to get supplies right and then you live off the land everything is living off the land right and they're like the fucking happiest people in the world really it's it's weird man it's a super weird documentary and it really makes you confront like what is life about yeah and then also the these two questions right like are they happy because we evolved that way and that those motions of going out and catching fish and hunting and growing your own vegetables and having a tight-knit small community mm-hmm is the benefit in that is that it hits all the old notes that we've had since we evolved you know from the time we were lower primates to living in these small clusters of monkey people yeah living in villages to working together and living off the land and then that has been going on for so long yeah your DNA knows it yeah this most recent trend of moving towards some sort of a technological world is so uncomfortable for us and this working in cubicles with fluorescent lighting is so new ya know it's it's it's unhealthy my sister runs this little nonprofit in New Jersey called City green and she takes these cities like Passaic and Paterson these places that we're booming and now they've kind of fallen off and she creates these city gardens in all these different places and brings young students in to sit and work with the earth and grow vegetables the change in these kids who are just on their phones and just in this tough city world and there's no money and it's like this desperate you don't know there's no sense of place there's no sense of what you're supposed to do they sit in garden and actually smell the dirt and harvest vegetables and cook that food it changes their life because just what you're saying it's what we're supposed to do it's our nature as beasts really saying it's what we're supposed to do as much as I'm saying it's what we did do for so long that we know it and the grooves have already been cut almost like what we're doing now it's like you ever try to take a screwdriver and a screwdriver doesn't quite fit the screw but you can kind of make it work yeah and when you kind of make your work if kind of you screw a little bit this is every time I get a screwdriver that's a human being in a city right slot right in right now I think a human being that's living in like the taiga you're talking about grooves that have been polished and cut and yeah the exact fit for the environment boom so all their human reward systems for survival are they're not based on some sort of technological innovation that will move us towards a world of artificial intelligence and fucking the internet going through your brain it's pumping through the sky and Wi-Fi all over the go no it's not that right there grooves are carved differently than ours right so arc but all right so don't you think your groove like when you go out into the woods don't you feel terrified shouldn't be there what am i doing it but when you come but when you come home and you survived you feel your soul something's happened to your soul yeah I appreciate civilization see it's not either/or is my point it's not like well yeah you gotta live in the woods that's the only way man one with nature okay well you also should go to a nice restaurant in a city comedy show I mean the very thing that we enjoy a host watching and performing stand-up comedy is all done with electric lights sure microphone in a completely unnatural environment that's air-conditioned yeah but you're dealing with human beings you doing with heart beats and sweat and sure breath but you need all this technology and this is a totally new thing right but it's the most important thing to us right this is a new endeavor for humans yeah but don't you feel like if you're totally disconnected from nature and you just live in that city I know people that don't leave Manhattan they're not healthy people yeah that's not good no there's they're like shaky and weird next to the battery all the time I'm telling you one walk one hike yeah it would fix their head or you can't see the here's the thing I think you can be completely healthy being some fucking business person that's out there kicking ass and taking names I don't think it's impossible no is it possible I think every for me to say that someone can't do it and be like as fulfilled and happy as these people in the Werner Herzog documentary huh is ridiculous like what do I know the people are so different they vary so much and I know people that are fucking miserable when you take them in the woods all this especially people who don't exercise oh yeah have you ever seen about a guy that doesn't exercise at all trying to make it up a big steep hill it is hilarious yeah it's hilarious the feet start her ankles pop like they're basically like sticks surrounded by bags of jell-o and then they have to move their body up a hill fuck we had we live on a hill and they were paving it the other day and my office looks out over the over the street you know and I watch people walk their dogs or run you know there's like that's why I texted you about Hills we talked about later and I so they're paving the streets so everyone had to park down at the bottom of the street so everyone had to walk to their cars and I never saw these people they were coming out like it's just like stick people yeah walking and then having to go back up the hill miserable right they don't walk they never walk and they're like trying to like get up the thing like a like a broken-down robot yeah it's I mean some people were injured for sure but some people they just stopped using it it started deteriorating yeah and you know you tribute that to getting older yeah this is absolutely a factor but it's more of a factor when you're doing exercise and it sound like some goddamn infomercial I know I do but I'm being honest like everybody I'm not talking about do the shit that you know that you do or anybody that's left fucking CrossFit and like that lady in my yoga class looks like a Greek statue no you don't have to go completely nuts but you got to move you got to do something to your body you got to do just go walk man walk up hills if you can if you live in a place that has hills yeah it's fucking giant for you and you know Bert Kreischer don't think you're really running when you're running on a treadmill motherfucker I was running yesterday I was thinking about that because I just listened to it seven-minute miles my bitch you weren't going anywhere you're in the same room and that is a crazy thing to say yeah I'm getting off and writing jokes yeah I want to hear this mild talk this is crazy and get outside with the Sun in your face and the wind blowing on you fucking elliptical told me the other day I went five miles I'm like how did I go five miles this isn't even a method of transportation if if I got off at least when you're on a treadmill you're mimicking running yeah exactly you're kind of running - yeah but with the thing know you are but you're it's like sixty percent maybe seventy seventy percent running yeah what running is right better than nothing yeah what is that yeah you're pulling I'm pulling to help me going miles by pulling I didn't understand what you were saying about when you texted me that you do the hills for an hour what does that mean though I mean in hours that's how long the run takes it takes it you're outside for an hour yeah but you go time I start this is my I tried gone further and shorter and I'll still go shorter if I'm short on time cuz the end part of my run that I've been doing pretty regularly yeah is the last part is a mile and seven tenths of that is straight up okay and it's fucking rough yeah I can if I could get up it the way with a really slow steady pace yeah but I'm Way too meathead for that so I do mad Sprint's until I can't do it anymore and then I paused and I try to get that pause down to a minute okay pause down to a minute where my heartbeat gets to below 140 beats a second Ryan and I charge I have spots where I know that I can reach right and I try to go you know 20 yards past that spot I got to go 20 yards but the ultimate goal is to I don't I'll never really make it yeah the ultimate goal is to be able to sprint all the way up the hill got to sprint oh I have this killer Hill not the one I was just talking about but going up the other way it's a killer hill paved but its killer and I was thinking I should do because I'll go run three miles but I'm you know it's a little hilly but mmm but I was thinking like if I were to just spend the the workout going up and down that hill it's amazing yeah but it like I don't know what would be what would constitute too much comparable or more than the three miles that I'm running it'll be way harder it'll be harder but would do it three times or I would say do it once and see how you feel and maybe don't even do it that hard yeah you know that I'm a fucking terrible listener to my own advice because I always do too much and then get real sore and then I realized I gotta back this off and build up to it that was a big thing with me with the running I'm not like I tried to go way hard on it real quick and I also had to go way hard on with those five finger shoes I mean he's gotta be super careful with those things yeah there's great benefit in those things but you like they've lost a class-action lawsuit and I should clear this up a lot of people that been texting me about this or messaging me or commenting on my Instagram post about those things I learned first of all I don't I'm not paid by these people they don't support me in any way there's no they never spent a dime advertising or penny advertising this podcast this is Vibram Vibram FiveFingers shoes right I learned about them from Mark Sisson I learned about him before monkey feet well mark yeah those five finger tell yes but Mark Sisson who is just like he's a very well respected endurance athlete he was coach and now he does he brought this book the plot the primal blueprint about like healthy diets and he goes back and forth from Quito Toro to like a real low sugar low carb very fat adapted done really very smart and very very well educated what's his name again Mark Sisson says and he was talking about these things but that's the only things he wears most times he's barefoot and he's essentially yeah he's essentially saying that like your feet in shoes it's like your feet being in a cast and all those muscles in your feet sort of atrophy yeah and then when you put on those five finger shoes those muscles have to work in a way they really don't have to work when you're in a shoe yeah much harder for them right so the same exercise that you would do like a same run is way harder because your feet are getting a way harder workout right but you have to be careful because if you go too hard a lot of people get plantar fasciitis I think that's not something which is uh like really bad the pain pain in the bottom of their foot and the the fascist all fucked up yeah it's it's tearing and the bottom of your foot is in severe agony I know several people of God and you know really got it no really from wearing those five finger toe shoes on a treadmill Neal Murray and he's light he's not even pushing mass he is but Neal is a bit of an obsessive person yeah but in a good way and I think that maybe he got obsessed with running and maybe ran a little too hardware issues you got to be super careful with those shoes build up slow but once you do build up you can you could run in those things and like my feet feel so different then they felt like five months ago really yeah they're way different they're way stronger way stronger but do you need strong feet well here's where it's good when what you doing with these feet just walking around it's easier you know yeah my ankles are stronger my feet cuz I'm running all this weird fucked-up terrain let me ask you this Jesus when you get up at night to go to the bathroom where you wake up in the morning like I get up and you know my ankles are like waking up kind of a thing do you still have that don't have any of them you don't have any of that did you before you we ran in these shoes no not really I've never really in much angle pain if I hang temporary just like creaky no like beer can ankle no for whatever reason I never had that I did so much of my youth kicking things yeah my ankles pretty strong right cuz there's so much because when you're throwing kicks like you think about especially like a side kick or a front kick there's so much pressure on the ankle yeah you're using them yeah not so much with round kicks and round kicks kind of pull it apart you you hit with a shin but when you're hitting with the actual foot itself there's a lot of stress on the ankle and I think my ankles develop really strong because that right so when I run I feel a big difference in the workout when I run up a straight Hill yeah versus I run up like a trail rocks and shit where I have to jump from one step stone to another and I'm navigating your way with me come do it with me one time I'll do it yeah don't do what the five finger shoes doing regular shoes and I still alternate when I need a really hard workout I alternate like and then I put these on this is what I like the best these Salomon trail shoes oh yeah yeah you know why because this this tread here is the shit oh yeah shreds you're not gonna slide out oh not at all yes like a like a what dirt bike tire or something it just grips in the in the dirt it's like the best traction how far how far like like a flat run do you go I don't ever flap you don't ever fly I mean I'm always going up in these maps yeah because it's exciting it's so much more fun when you're an attractive go back to nature by the way yeah you get excited when you're out there I see a person occasionally walking their dog hanging out yeah walking the trails and shit now that's great but it's mostly just me running these hard-ass hills there's nothing more fun when you're like sprinting when I was a kid we've walked to school through the woods yeah oh man it was just when you would take off and you jump in from rock to rock you know especially when you know the trail and you know where you're you've got to jump and slide and you're playing yeah yeah that's exactly it you're playing when I run to you I do that I ran for real you get high before you run yep that's and then I'd be then I'd start thinking I'm having a heart attack really go for them yeah man first of all there's been proof that a lot of endurance athletes find great benefit in marijuana what even smoking vaping it in particular some of them edibles yeah they feel like it dilates your lungs uh-huh make sure lungs take in more oxygen really it also makes you more in tune with your body a lot of weightlifter smoke weed before they lift weights really a lot of weight lifters more and more now than ever before I get messages from people all the time that say dude I you know I thought it was a loser like people say I was a loser for smoking pot before I worked out but some of my best workouts ever I'm not talking about get so blitz where you like you look at the curl like how do I know how to move my arm like this I feel weird get just a little high we're a team just to heal your muscles like yoga to like Terence Mckenna actually believed that yoga was a guide to how to use hash he felt like hashish and and marijuana you know hashish is made from marijuana yeah that's yeah hashish is awesome yeah and people base hash sounds like you're doing heroin like to the toy done kated uninitiated it's just super strong THC right yeah but the the the feeling that they would get from it is from yoga doing it that way is what inspired those moves and he believes that you started with people that were smoking Hana he believes that that's where it originated from like when you're high and you start stretching it feels really good and these people are notorious users of cannabis and hashish and a lot of they smoke like he was think saying the dirty secret among sad news is that really what they're concentrated on is how many chillings can you smoke and still be there and like they like take pride what's in them Chellam is like a hit of hash oh that's a call the Chilam yeah what is the exact definition of Chellam because they only people I've ever heard his hash people talk about it and I don't kill him chill them yeah because I'm not a only smoked hash a couple of times and I like a prolific hash user but in other eighths countries there's like some serious yeah it's weird because like people get busted and they get treated when they get busted with hash like they're smuggling meth or something yeah it sounds more intense it sounds like a different thing it's not a dangerous thing this is the point no we but it gets classified in those ways like people think of hash as like something from wasn't that what they got arrested for in the Midnight Express that's right that's right it's what yeah yeah right exactly Turkish prison for weed yeah here's this dude well I'm gonna chill him oh boy yeah so that let's see that guy legalize that guy high as fuck these guys are so high they're painting themselves up like superheroes he's all dreadlock these his face looks like a ghost so these are Saad dudes that are smoking chill ohms crazy oh do you see the hash there in his pipe so Saad is just get barbecued barbecued high and they do yoga Wow and I noticed it what is yeah when I just before I was like doing yoga regularly uh-huh but I had to do this show and I was particularly nervous because someone I really didn't like was in the audience and really didn't like yeah I really didn't like was in the audience and some people that were there to see me we're in the audience so Friday night yeah it was weird yeah right so what I did was I smoked weed and I I got like really stretchy and I start stretching out and in my stretching in like this like severe stretchings guess I'm super fucking hippie but I felt a severe sense of forgiveness for this person that I don't like and I still don't like him to this day yeah I'd avoid him at all cost yes no it's not a healthy human but I felt a severe sense of forgiveness and acceptance mm-hmm and almost like like pity yeah no that's not that's real that's not a and love to this likes weird love thing I feel bad for the guy I'm almost I kind of want him in my life said I want manage it right no I mean but there's yoga does when you go into yoga you could be stressed and balled up and you can have like a work thing rattling in your head that's just and you could be pissed at somebody when you come out it doesn't matter and there's a thing that seems counterintuitive like why would stretching make your mind feel better like what is going and there's so this all this rationalization right is it endorphins that are being released is it the is it just the fact that your body needed exercise but that's that's this sort of weird sort of need to dissect things and yeah you're out the one cause yeah they're one reason right a minimalist approach or minimalizing you know yeah you want to yeah you want to understand it you want to get your head around it it's all those things my physical thing it's probably the endorphins it's the physical release of the muscles which relaxes your body which relaxes your mind because everything's connected right and it's also the act of stretching this intense act of stretching and holding positions it does something for the overall way that your mind interacts with your body completely the tiny body affects the way your mind more time becomes different in a class like that that goes by super fucking slow my 90-minute class my yoga teacher said she said at the end of class she said it's yoga's like aspirin you may not exactly know why it works but you know it works and it's that's yoga you I don't know what exactly just happened during this hour but I feel much more at peace when I walk out of there than I did coming in yeah hundred percent more that's a good way to look at it yeah it just works so if they talk crazy shouldn't yoga though no this is massaging your descending colon no no it's not you got only used seven percent of your brain no that's not yeah no my it took me a long time to find the yoga teacher that wasn't taking me down the the in the weird spots and talking all that stuff she's just so let's just do this here's the pose correct your arm correct that yeah she doesn't get hippie-dippie one ohm and you're in it's just awesome enough as it is and it's not all of them that do this you know the place I go to the trigger runs and she never does that she doesn't say crazy shit but she's inspirational and there's a lot of people in there that are inspirational yeah and all all the weird styles like just one dude the teachers in my class College freaky tattoos because it's weird style oh yeah you know other guys like a boxing fan and it teaches a killer yoga class it's a know your thing man there's mutations of it and you know people start to make it into the sport and do this stuff that people get a little fired up with that right yeah you know what I don't like is the the dude that takes his shirt off the big sweaty older dude that takes his shirt off I mean it's 90% women I just feel like sit in the back calm down don't

mean I'm sure you probably think of the material you find me disgusting I find me disgusting exactly yeah yeah supposed to be about the act of the movements I know when can you do the movements most

places in Ohio I'm from oh really all right lore that a good pie place that makes a good pot pie a pot pie you don't you don't see a lot of pot pies I mean yeah you know that kind there's a place in Burbank that does it leaky outer crust the cubes a chicken with that you sort of yellow broth with the carrots and a celery in there and like it's like Thanksgiving in a cup peas good I'm spacing on the name but there's a place in Burbank it does it five pot pies to die for I mean hot pie is a damn delicious meal it really is it makes you so warm inside oh it's like the ultimate comfort food it really is it might be right but you that in a really good meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy Oh Mike this stuff to fuck with that too that's nice that's a slightly different dough both of those more butter in that dough it's dough extra when you make the dough for a pot pie you're using like a whole stick of butter it's just talking about that's why it's so goddamn good so good it's so good I wish they could make cows like engineer cow if they they get this expert thing you know just please make some cows that don't have a head just make some cow in the top of its neck is a computer so we don't have to think about cruelty yeah there's no consciousness whatsoever and just make me a nice butter and this grass-fed would be so much nicer when up its neck and just pop grass down there yeah grind the grass up and then push it in with like a fireplace bellows a neck hole you get the butter out the other end so no suffering how about it don't even have it's shaped like a cow if you're tripping on that yeah yeah how about a ball of meat that gives you butter it's coming I bet you it's coming but just giant bag of tits that's all you need is like the utter the computers take care of all the other stuff yeah right just just a hole just a warehouse filled with tits on a rack yeah just like they engineer a frame of bones that's shaped like a basket and in that basket is like an inner crust it's like a potpie yeah to me which is the the crust of the potpie and then the inside is all tip have you so delightful just no guilt out of that fucker it's phenomenal and it just it just exists on a substrate of ground-up grass you say you have ground-up grass all around the meat outer shell sort of like the aluminum on a potpie you know you have that aluminum foil around the edge yeah it'd be delightful somebody gives you a pop pie without the aluminum foil around the eyes they can go fuck themselves monster good lord where did you grow up I can't even dig my fork underneath it and scoop out the dry underside with the gravy on that little treat at the end was the base the base crest the bases on moist crotch it's the moist is crust right the best and then you have a little bit of the top crust to the crunchy outside the could the ring let's get out of here with that giant pod a with the three hoses when are we going to Musso and Frank's yeah we're gonna keep talking about we do keep doing that we should do that before set at the store one night yeah let's do that ask the move like gentlemen yeah should we wear suits yes 100% okay kind of a lighter please yeah I have a suit no you do yeah I get a suit for a school function for my kid oh really what do you mean what kind of question one I always have one that I wear for the UFC right yeah but the UFC one stays at the UFC so that I don't have to do anything I just go there that's smart I like a nice suit he just looked good do you wear a pocket you always look good now when I hosted this TV show I did yes I was a pocket square media yeah they made me they forced that useless piece of cloth right there these are funny and I don't know when you need a tourniquet it was a little pocket square and Madonna came in to do the show and the whole building was like electric it was like Madonna's coming and it really was like energy like you could feel energy in the building does Madonna was walking in did you call her Madonna so I came in yeah and I was like I gotta go meet her before the show or I'm gonna be too freaked out so I just walked into the dressing room and I'm like hi Madonna I'm tom she's like nice to see you she walks up she goes this has got to go and she took the pocket square is Guy Ritchie her ex-husband is a proponent of the pocket square Guy Ritchie was on my podcast I'm talking about the importance of the suit and square that's hilarious cuz she immediately I just met her two seconds she whipped it out of my and tossed it there yeah she was it so look you're a young Tom papa yeah we can face son of a bitch yeah look at that mister I'll steal your girl barber shop different do I look from that shot I'm gonna be honest to what we actually went to Joey gained a couple pounds you're making delicious bread I am did a Ricky Gervais slap hard at everything uh-huh this is move move a jolly fellow especially when Jerry said it yeah that's good move yeah always something about English people right with Guy Ritchie was describing with his English accent the suit I was all in like yeah dammit I did where I stopped those at the pocket square I'm like you just fucker I'm not wearing a tie that was the other thing he was talking about ties I'm like dude no tie kills somebody with a tie grab hold of somebody lose tie you can kill them you your broad you've got broad shoulders it's like you skinny guys skinny English dudes with a tie it's a different thing well the tie problem with me is some people have choked me too many times I see you have you feel like it's like that Hedberg joke I've been choked hundreds of times literally yeah the average person has been choked at the average person's treat if they get choked once or twice no life yeah the fuck happened and the journey from white belt to black belt I was choked for sure hundreds of times oh my god no idea how many really think about it you asked me how many times I have to tap out cuz someone was choking me I'd be like shit hundreds hundreds of time for sure it has to be especially in the early days damn I got choked all the time really all the time that's not pleasant get choked five six times by one guy Oh God before I move to the next guy that works I'm choking myself so now grabs you if you had to do jujitsu the tie that's all anybody would go for everybody jujitsu and instead of wearing a belt everybody has to wear a tie or you can take the belt and wrap it around the dude's neck say if you started with a black belt tied around your neck right nobody would go for anything other than the belt yeah we'd have to do is get a hand under that belt grab it and twist and you're out cold all I have to do is secure secure some part of your body weight and keep you from moving like it maybe like a side mount or a crucifix position where I have trapping arm I trap the other arm with my neck and I'm gonna choke this shit out of you this is your daughter's school function but I think she should yeah you me grab someone's belt and knock them if no no if someone had a belt around their neck like around you guys right I'm saying jiu-jitsu guys were rolling around the ultimate goal would be to get the belt around the guys neck mm-hmm look if you could do that right that would be the number one thing to do right and if you already had it like knotted around your neck or if that was how you started it with you not around your waist right keep people to kill each other immediately grab that rope around your neck with it that'd be the ultimate goal for your foot locks fuck your foot lock like you've done all the work for me yeah I'm grab that rope around your neck and put you to sleep this is crazy because all you have to do is twist it like I had to choke my dog out once that way really so I was attacking a cat and I got my hand inside his collar and I put him to sleep really yeah you just grab I grab his collar and I twisted it down and cranked it I did you just say oh my dog put him right back knocked him out instantly really instantly yeah just like it does a person oh it was this thing he didn't know what was going on yeah so I got it in there grabbed ahold of where the buckle is I just cranked I stepped over him and cranked on it he just went limp wow he's doing the cat took off gonna try that dude it works that should do it two dogs I mean but that's a person - it's yeah the idea is the arteries around your neck that feed your brain you shut those off like a garden hose right Bink like you fold the garden hose and then the water stops flowing that's what happens to your brain right then you go out that's why it's not nearly as dangerous as a knockout right people's it just flow yeah people get confused about that like they think that a concussion and being choked out is the same thing still giving your brain damage bro it's not it's not any brain damage it happens to people in class they go right back to rolling they don't have no ill effects at all really you just go back to it you wake up you're like what happened well you don't even realize it like what happened oh shit I get choked out and everybody starts laughing right because that happens in jiu-jitsu class people as long as you're fine people will start laughing because it happens to everybody really yeah for sure if you don't tap yeah you go to sleep everybody does this sounds fun it is fun honestly yeah till a girl does it to you when's the last time you were choked out by a girl or guy anybody Jean Jacques Machado tapped me like a few months back oh yeah but he always can yeah I don't think was a joke there was an armoire when you roll with someone who's really good you're gonna get caught yeah it's no no way around it right so when a girl doesn't tell Duncan was taking some classes a chick kept choking them out work on this just don't get into it you know but for people who don't get into it I get it just get into something else that's hard yeah just get into something that's hard to do would you get high into jujitsu oh yeah oh really super moving to that oh yeah super popular makes you better really a hundred percent why think is you're more conscious of tuned ability more focused on what you're doing it it provides a type of focus and it you don't it doesn't seem less here's the thing the type of consciousness that you have when you are rolling with person a person in jujitsu what someone's trying to get you and you're trying to defend yourself that type of feeling that you get it's very different than any feeling that you get in most of life other than an actual conflict with a person which is pretty rare luckily we have a nice society right yeah if you live in a nice neighborhood right but that feeling for whatever reason lends itself very well to getting high because when you get high you get into this sort of like not me state like an ego dropped off state no that's one of the reasons why people get so vulnerable they feel vulnerable because they feel it's like they don't they don't have that ego anymore it's a very ego diminishing substance it's like a almost like a medicine for diminishing the ego and honestly the effects are different on different people sure but that on top of the focus aspect of it makes it really attractive to people who do jiu-jitsu because you can let go of the bullshit you're not all tense right and then you could focus on what you're actually trying to do it doesn't get in the way you see things better he thinks you feel things better you're more cognizant of how your body works right and some people say that that's a cop-out and that really you should just get more comfortable with your body period and they're probably right is there it's probably something to that too but is there any elements like when you get higher you just like it's all cool it doesn't matter because you need you need an edge to go fight you know arrange it to do any fighting because you're not hitting each other right and I mean so it's a more of a I mean a boxing match is obviously a fight right but it's not in the new definition and the new definition it a fight is a mixed martial arts fight where you're and even then there's rules that are applied right right so like there's no eye-gouging there's no ball kicks there's no hitting to the back of the head right you can't elbow some of the back of the head which is in a way healthier for the athletes involved but in another way more delusional because it removes a very dangerous that like Eddie Bravo is always talking about that that when guys you should take guys backs in the early days what they would do instantly he's elbow to the back of the head didn't matter if you defend the choke or not someone starts smashing the back your head you're fucked we're a terrible position to be in yeah that that is removed from MMA so because that's removed from MMA you almost have to look at an MMA fight which is absolutely a fight in a way kind of a match a mixed martial arts mat the rules are so rigid right much more loose than boxing but still rigid right so you got a jujitsu match for sure not really a fight yeah get leg kicked you can't get elbowed in the face you're not gonna get need into a coma right it's a totally different experience in a fight it's almost disrespectful some ways to call it jujitsu match a fight right people like to refer to it as fight yeah wrong with that yeah if you don't know and just looking at it from the outside boxing match is more like a fight right right because you're hitting each other in this grave danger yeah I'm really trying to kill each other right I mean you're smashing each other right not trying to kill but yeah you are using your your explosive force on a person trying to take them out and it's a very dangerous encounter with severe consequences for your brain right yeah that's a fight yeah but it's a fight with very limited rules yeah because like a Muay Thai fighter a really good monty fighter would kill most really good boxers if the boxer didn't know what was going on right because a really good multi fighter it's gonna be very hard to hit him to get that close to him and he's gonna start kicking your legs immediately what's more time it's Thai boxing okay because they have more weapons their legs they kick the legs a lot yeah and they'll push you away with their front kick there's like so much stuff that you're not gonna be able to do right box are way better with his hands but more Thai fighters usually pretty good with their hands already especially good enough to land a shitload of kicks on you and keep you from getting in range and if you did get in range they clinch you and they need you in the body and they lb you in the head it's a way more complete striking system than regular box right do you feel like there's too many rules like do you feel like it should be just opened up in MMA like you make it real yes and no because I like I like specialists like I love that Conor Floyd Mayweather fight yes it was a real specialist you got to see like a really elite high-level striker from MMA become almost helpless yeah against a world champion probably the best ever boxer right good to see ya this is what happens when a specialist fights someone who's really good at something yeah like me if I wanted to roll against someone who's like a real high level jiu-jitsu blackbelt I would get I would get killed right but if you got a really good jiu-jitsu blackbelt from the UFC and they would kill me but a really good Jiu Jitsu black fro from the UFC might get killed by a really good jujitsu world champion uh-huh there's all these levels and levels and the only way you achieve those levels that's true specialist hmm like a true specialist is it it said such a different level like if you watch you know Sanchez you've heard of Sancho and the Highland he's probably one of the greatest ever combat sports athletes ever and he's fights every couple weeks with him on Instagram he's 36 years old he's he fights people way smaller than him all the time and although he knocks a lot of people out right most of his fights are won by him just doing shit to the opponent that they just can't deal with he just kicks the shit out of him he hit someone they're not looking right they don't know what he's doing he's so clever and fast right I mean he's just a wizard a technical wizard inside the ring and when you watch him you realize like oh well there's levels even to this thing right this guy's such a specialist yeah anybody outside of that like Floyd Mayweather wanted to fight Sancho right let's and I kick him it would be one of the most lopsided fights you've ever seen it would be horrific to watch watching a world-class boxer just getting exposed what legs kicked out from under him kicked in the face legs kicked under him though in the face elbowed in the head well don't you think McGregor if he was allowed to do his thing sure right for sure yeah meanwhile sanch I could probably do that to McGregor right these levels and levels what when McGregor and encountered with Floyd Mayweather he would encounter in Thai boxing right with like a fantastic one of the greatest ever and a guy like Sancho so it's like the rules actually make it more interesting because you have to be coming right so the only way you find out who they're really best jiu-jitsu guys is yeah you have to have them only compete in jiu-jitsu right because with strikings all this other stuff involved you hurt people with punches and knees but when you want to look at a complete system yeah fleet system mixed martial arts is as close as it comes without the elbows to the head kicks when the down to the head on down fighter and stomps and the knees to the head on a downed fighter right and then the really dirty shit like eyeball pokes and right the balls just gonna yeah so it's always gonna be a match right you can't bite someone's nose off it's always gonna be a match right right I mean it's not yeah there's gotta be some limit yeah yeah yeah but you still call it a fight right so how how many hills do I have to run to get back into my old shape well I think it's this whole fucking goddamn delicious bread you're making that's an issue you know it happened I uh I visited this woman in Ohio's really good bakers Cates breads just anchor yeah she's amazing and I saw what flour she had I'm like oh that's I gotta get that flour that's what I gotta get this Floquet so I looked up online where she gets the flour he comes from Utah whoa and you could the smallest you can get as a 50-pound bag so I have two 50-pound bags of wheat and artisan all-purpose flour in my kitchen and I'm like I was thinking like if you were to eat 50 pounds of flour you would be a big fatso dude but the flour makes such a difference a huge difference you know what I discovered recently is a double-0 wheat pasta from Italy double-0 yeah yeah you do know yeah most folks don't ya know double zeros what use for pizza dough yeah the good stuff good stuff and I also found out about heirloom wheat heirloom wheat yeah that most of what we're getting here in the United States of good old Merkel yeah is wheat that has been and people love that term GMO right scares the shit out of people GMOs wrapper organic yeah good all good thoughts but the reality is most of the wheat we have according to you know Maynard Keenan from tool mm-hmm the singer the singer he also owns this great vineyard right yeah in a restaurant oh yeah she's explaining to me he explained it on the podcast right about the differences between the wheat we have today and the original week yeah the wheat we have today has much more complex glutens in it and it's a larger yield for the same area right but when they would grow the old wheat they didn't make as much of it but it was easier for a person to digest right it's interesting yeah yeah there's a huge there's so many of these little farmers and littles you know some are pretty big for being little but compared to what these giant things are that really concentrate on growing the wheat the way that used to be grown yeah and then millet the way it was seeds though yeah and it's it makes such a difference like just I was like how big of a difference can it be and just in making the bread that I'm making a huge I would imagine it tastes like like it's a lot natural yeah it's earthy it's deep it's like it's really good or the-- Earthies good now it made a big difference but now I got to figure out how I'm gonna store 50 pounds of a hundred pounds of flour you probably have to do it in a controlled environment no I got to go bad uh you got to just put it in like barrels does it have to be dry and airtight er yeah yeah but it's good for a long time when you do it that way yeah yeah and I'm I'm still learning and cranking out a lot and giving it away and stuff and so I'm going through a lot I won't sit forever the way it's been described to me the differences between the difference of like a tomato that you get in the grocery store today even a good one yeah and comparison to an heirloom tomato makes perfect sense that those tomatoes that we have today like Neil deGrasse Tyson did a speech about this where someone was asking him not speech by the answer to a question I think it might have been in one of those talks that he does it was down all talk yeah and someone was asking him about GMOs and he said virtually everything that we eat has been modified yeah everything from the oranges to the like you wouldn't go want to go back to the original corn uh-huh it wouldn't taste good it wouldn't be a lot of yield to it mmm but then the real problem is the corn that we have today not that easy for us to digest right and not that good to eat a lot of it uh-huh you know it's it's all like how much of it do you use yeah but when you do eat a tomato like an heirloom tomato you get a farmers market this guy grew in this tiny little farm and just happens to have them that week phenomenal phenomenal but I don't think that's the same with corn now I think that golden sweet corn that we have today that tastes like candy yeah that's the best shit that's ever existed wool shit-ass original pinecone looking a corn people would hang that stupid corn on the door and Thanksgiving bullshit-ass multiracial corn scaring children away just try and eat if you can that was the original corn but it wasn't even that that's like yeah yeah yeah that's the corn people put what is that Sukie corn yeah that's some spooky corn right I've never seen the original corn see if you can find original corn plant images oh me I still want to know how much tobacco growers get paid I couldn't find much the only thing I found was an article about a guy that just started a business and it said somewhere in there that as cheap as they could be made was like 30 cents a piece and it was expensive as five dollars a piece no cigar itself it didn't set that included the wealth or a highly skilled wrapper to do it so Oh might be being paid per pursue guard a rule 50 cents per if they're doing like a bunch in a row you know it didn't say hmm whoever rolled this did a great did a fantastic job it's easy draw easy draw it's lasting nice long great podcast of your nice cars where Ari Shaffir sat down with Robert Kelley they smoked cigars and oh yeah Bobby Kelly said is that what it really look like Bobby Kelly is a crazy fucking he's go crazy with the cigars look at the original corn looked like like bullshit what yeah that's the original corn a quarter yeah yeah a quarter with that wow that's crazy the original corn versus the new corn Wow nice herbal wild and that shit was all done through like splicing right right that was natural corn look or nice look like that's weird it looks like it looks like the route that came out of your toilet yeah modern corn looks like the route that's crazy right I mean corn needs to be this tiny little low yield product whoa that's jellybeans corn that's amazing glass gem corn glass Jam corn I'll bet that tastes like shit yeah that's terrible that can't be good now otherwise people would eat it yeah you ever get a cotton candy grapes what is that Jamie black waxy corn what black waxy corn wow that looks amazing it looks pretty good it looks like licorice like a bite anyway looks cool I would eat that how would he dead - I would think that like if you went over a clever person's house - it serve you that black corn you believe what are those purple potatoes come from Peru right that's part of the same area is this I think is it Peruvian purple potatoes and that oh look at that one that's crazy that looks like you know the alien from the Giger that's its dick the tongue comes out and fucks your hair it jabs you in the head and then it shoots the baby into your body just when you're just sitting there eating dinner like no one's wrong sport grows on your dead body I can't believe that uh that the corn didn't I think between the original corn being that that weird knobby thing and the corn that we have year-round I think there's probably an ear in there where the corn tasted better right like the life of the taiga yes the the evolution of human beings - technological superiority where you gotta meet it halfway that's a sweet spot yeah the sweet spot there's no stopping it there's no stopping it we're moving forward there's no stopping it but maybe this spot is not the sweet spot just like living in a cave wasn't the fucking sweet spot right it was just a sweet spot for the time yeah right well yeah well you don't want to go live on the taiga no Tom pop I can't you can't no I'd be exhausted how you gonna bake your bread I'm gonna make bread flour you have to grow it oh my god you got a mill your own bread do you imagine if you had a grow your own fucking wheat to make your bread yeah I would never make bread would you though maybe probably would maybe I'll plant the seed right now maybe you gonna leave here I'm gonna be driving home in your lecture car I'm gonna be thinking hey all this comedy bullshit what I'm gonna do is get a big piece of land and start growing my own wheat and then chopping it down make my own bread and have tom pappas bread restaurant I have given this a lot of thought I have there's something there's something so not about throwing it all away but there's something about going bigger and deeper into it it's kind of just draws you in I'm not even making decisions there's just like oh now I'm getting bigger things of of flour and just yeah there's something very all-consuming about it yeah it's good you know whenever you get something that gets it it's rewarding and I like that it's small I like that it's there's no bullshit around that there's no phone calls to be made it's just all on my own terms but this is my control does that appeal to you as an overall life or does it appeal to you as a vacation from the current life that you enjoy which is very hectic and kind of stressful writing material performing traveling you know what it it I feel like I don't know it's an interesting question I do feel like the process of making it and and doing it is uh it matches up with writing really well when I'm when I am at home and I'm writing a lot and in between taking breaks and going and tending to the bread and then coming back to the writing that back and forth is very satisfying nice it is the best nose nice yeah yeah I often thought writing in some ways releases you from the stress a lot of people find of performing they're just writing yeah I heard nor McDonald said that on his uh on his show that you know he just wants to write books he just wants to write before we're there before people just want to go internal and stop being I know but I'd former I feel like I couldn't do that a hundred percent I really love it I have this my books gonna come out next year I can't even buy it yet but it is coming out soon planting seeds planted seeds for people to buy the book I see what you're doing yeah it's not yet it's not like I'm plugging my gig at comics and when he can sign or anything whoa you're there when is that that's coming up next week no I I feel like I when I was writing the book I got very deep into and I love coming in with my coffee in the morning and going to work for hours just in there tinkering with it playing with it it was very satisfying it makes sense but acting after several days of not being on stage start getting itchy he get itchy it's not who I am do you think that it's that you've experienced these jolts of fun that you get from standup mm-hmm that you become addicted to these jolts of fun and then seeing the happiness in people's faces when they're laughing yeah that relating to people that isolation of writing is okay but until I can take that idea out yeah share it with other human beings yeah that's what I'm built for yeah well you've designed yourself that way sort of like look at the human race we've you know grown to this place where if you made people like were you here during the heat wave yeah yeah weird right yeah it was intense it got intense it was a little spooky it was yeah because like really people were on edge yeah well quietly on edge waiting for the a/c to go right if the AC goes then we're all gonna deal with this yeah because is not me we have to just get in the shower all day ya know it's intense when it's all get 110 yeah you can stay in the shade and you'll stay reasonably cool but it's it's way hotter than you want it to be yes not sleeping right no no sweating like a pig yeah like the people in Florida right now there's a lot of people that don't have power yeah and it's humid hot it's fuck yeah fans blowing no it's not a feeling we're like oh I've always thought no disrespect people from Florida but that's one of the reasons why people think of people that live in the south is being dull because I think for the longest time before they invented air-conditioning day those fucking people didn't have time to think deep and warm move quickly you're not gonna think your best thoughts when you fucking sweat like a pig in your exhaust yeah why getting the power back on in Florida could take weeks oh Jesus Christ fuck that hey that's rough it is rough weeks why he's bringing up it why'd you bring up the weather is here during the heat wave because it was so evident to me during that time that we really can't even exist in this environment without the way we do and enjoy the way we live without the modern conveniences of the electrical grid and air-conditioning units and the delivery of food yeah this shit that we just get like super accustomed to so like yeah we think now of life without that stuff as being like impossible but at one point in time we were adapted mm-hmm one point time life without that like those fucking people that live in the taiga the worst it gets for them is he gets crazy cold they bundle up and then they go inside and they burn wood we have like a whole system built in yeah to survive that environment for us that would be unthinkable yeah your house doesn't have set at central a/c right you don't have heat you know a thermostat wait a minute wait yeah see you walk in your house that thing doesn't glow in the wall and show you the temperature you can walk by it exists Thanks yeah it's not programmed or its kind of knows I'm home yeah a friend of Mines house you walk towards his thermostat and it lights up it's sin this is you it senses you're there right yeah yeah it shows you the temperature like it's off and like you'll step away little dim up and then you stand right in front of it and it like to have like this is freaky yeah it's pretty nice as people have that man they have windows - shut yeah they fire fire keeps the heat in yeah and I Gundel up now I couldn't put animal skins on yeah yeah those are people do know I'm not doing that yeah I'm not no so we've adapted for sure to this you and I have adapted to this the question is who's happier what's it better is it better I'm pretty happy when I walk in after after that heatwave and I would walk into my house oh you take your shoes off and you put that bare feet on the cold tile I'm pretty happy I'm happier than the tiger guy yeah watch TV ruin the goal yeah but I found that that writing is very and I as I was writing I was reading a lot of writers and stuff and it's very isolating like the more you write the more you are shutting out the world the more you are you it's a hermits life it is it really is in a way it's not a you are very much within your own head and eating up a lot of time just being by yourself yeah it's uh it could be rewarding for sure but it's if you were to write all the time like that it's pretty isolating well it's also in a lot of ways almost like a mental marathon mm-hmm cuz you're on this one thing for a long time yeah yeah sitting there staring at this thing and you're writing and you're thinking about it you're sitting on it and then you're going back at it and you're thinking about it you focus on yeah becomes like a part of your daily thoughts even when you're not doing it sometimes what was really a remarkable was you know when you're writing your stand-up you know it's like in blocks it's like you know chunks and I was thinking how am I gonna keep track of like a whole book but your subconscious really does like I know exactly where things are I would glide through it and know I think I have to change this part and see on my notes yes indeed that is where I was going to change it mmm it is your your brain starts to take in all that information and treat it like chunks mmm you know what I mean it's no different really than writing your stand up do you do you take notes like chapter chapter notes like you have like a notebook that you have sitting on the side and you like to say chapter 1 all here's all the things that I like or don't like or not that specifically but if there's something that I can't wrestle to the ground and I'm like I got to fix that ending I'll just write on the side pad page 35 and mmm you know and then keep going and you writing like this what's the what's the subject of the book it's a funny essays about family life okay so it's all just different different chapters about everybody in your family your parents your kids your uncles cousins everything that makes up family mm-hmm so it's all these little there you know it's like 300 pages and each one is probably four pages five pages mm-hmm you know what I mean yeah yeah how are you working on um a little over a year yeah and it's like this week it goes back and I don't get it back ooh this is it yeah this is that feel great yeah yeah done yeah I'm talking about it not like sick of it no but yeah it's very proud of parts of it but every time you look at it you're like well how did I let that go this is terrible this is so corny how did I let that joke in there that you know but uh do you find that sometimes you have an idea that you're not getting out totally but you leave it as is as a placeholder and you review it later yeah like maybe you listen you feel like there's something this idea but whatever I have right now is shit yeah but maybe there's something if I just like leave it there like that maybe I'll come at it from a different angle but at least then I know to think about this one subject that I thought had some promise yes a hundred percent a hundred percent and I really feel like it kind of taught me how much your subconscious goes to work on it without you being conscious yeah like you don't realize that your brain is actually going it's going to work on this when you shut out the shut the computer and walk away you think that's it your brain is still going at it without you even being aware that it's happening you ever read Stephen King on writing yeah but it's a great book know things one of the things I thought was most shocking was that he doesn't really like have a like a whole outline of his stories yeah starts writing them it's crazy just has an idea and just go yeah which is brilliant you fucking amazing you got to trust yourself you just got it you've got a I mean he's a brilliant mind but you know when I was a kid his books were thought of as like fluff but if you read Stephen King you weren't really reading he's yeah well that happens when you're really popular it was a little bit of that right but it was also that oh you're just reading monster stories it's so stupid you know like you should be really depressed heroin users right exactly yeah middle-age crisis in Europe yeah hey man this is Alphabet City a 1960 these people were doing smack yeah they were listening to Lou Reed and punching each other that guy I mean how you ever go to a bookstore and look at the Stephen King section in the bookstore it's a whole say it's a whole part of the store this guy just cranks it out yeah amazing there's definitely errors though there's like you know what I feel like I feel like there's drugs and no drugs Stephen King uh-huh drug Stephen King is the shining Kari Cujo dead zone and zone all the crazy shit yeah all the like dark weird twisted no inhibition whatsoever yeah shit and then he's like more content now and probably a healthier person uh-huh the stories aren't quite as fucked up as it yeah it was fucked up but there's that one mr. Mercedes that do or one of the more was oh he's still got a venom for sure dark oh sure sure dark well it's not just dark like if you go back and read Carey yeah it's not just dark it's like the psychological profile of this poor tormented young girl with telekinetic powers is fucking fantastic yeah nailed it oh my god burnt where you want her to make those kids heads explode yeah you want her to cause accidents girl like finally the tormented and picked on girl has an option yeah I mean he made it perfect he make really created like the ultimate outsider some poor kid that was unfortunate to be born into a situation where her mother was absolutely psychotic cunt yeah and people were trying to fucking throw a pig's blood on her and run her over with a car so mean yeah but she and she they faked that this fucking handsome guy was gonna go to the prom with her um dumped blood in her and they all thought it was funny they were laughing at her uh and she got back at him all because we realized that I think the worst case scenario for a human is someone that could do that to some poor misfortunate girl like Carrie yeah yeah we show without killing her right into the worst people that you could imagine yes he had this fucking ace in the hole fucking great it's so grand he's amazing fuck he's good amazing but I remember people telling me like that's all fluff I'd be like Pet Sematary most shining that book shining is not fluff it's not fluff it's not fluff no look is fucking fantastic oh my god and the book that guy goes crazy slow yeah it takes a while that's what he didn't like about the original Jack Nicholson version the Kubrick version which is fantastic yeah but it was a different story I think the argument that that story was more adaptable to a film that takes place over you know two plus hours or whatever whereas his book it would have to be like a 30 hour movie yeah you know I mean it's it's a long process of Jack maybe 30 Tyrion yeah yeah when he really starts going nuts and the family realizes he's actually losing his fucking mind and he my god taken over by something that lives in this house yeah this demon it's good he felt like Jack Nicholson I think if I remember correctly his criticism of that Jack Nicholson seemed crazy immediately oh really he was already crazy uh-huh like he'd heard like hurt the kid once and he was drinking right I don't know if that was in the book I don't remember yeah that Jack Nicholson's character was too crazy right away right wasn't enough of a transition like the the one thing I took away from that from his book on writing was just get to the end don't share it talking about it just keep going get to the end don't judge it yourself just get to the end and then start going to work on it and that really was helpful getting to the end of this because and then it actually became really fun going back and fixing it up fixing it up and even like just the clarity like just make it simple just make it get this message across like why am i taking three paragraphs repeating myself mmm pare it down mmm peel it off make it clear for the route for the reader Lee you don't want to go in circles make this very like a lot of times I'll read articles like in the paper or something it's like not understanding it it's not that I'm not understanding is that this isn't written well this isn't clear right that's your job like just try going back and trying and clear I mean like sometimes when you have a bit and you're like you're working on new stuff for your stand-up and you have something it's like this big chunk and when you're done working on it it's down to like five lines as you learned how to say it so effectively so direct and you realize the parts of just you were enjoying them but they were tripping you up the whole bit right they were getting in the way they're like you're asking the audience to think about this why this is getting in the way just confusing the the clarity of the original thought you know Ari has this piece of paper that he has glued to the tapas keyboard that's a Hemingway quotes is the first draft of everything is shit oh nice yeah that's great it takes the pressure off well it's also real yes I really really just get it out there and don't think that it's done and Hemingway writing yeah yeah his first draft was shit so yeah my little stuff is gonna end up shit it's it by Stephen King Hemingway it was fucked up all the time like Stephen King's early days yeah was Stephen King really fucked up oh yeah oh he was a book no I don't do that part yeah dude you mean he was just drinking cases of Budweiser and fucking doing coke and he said he didn't even remember write and carry what yeah didn't even remember it came in a haze or is it Cujo oh wow carrier Cujo I think Cujo remember right in Cujo I think he was anything I don't know I might I might be wrong it might be Carrie but just he was that mess those one of those books Cujo thank you Wow so to be so blasted they didn't remember writing one of the great horror books ever oh my god and a horror book about a rabid dog or a giant rabid dog that used to be everybody's friends so scary I read that as a kid like in a summer and just you were in that car with that kid with the mom just like Oh God he's just slobber on the on the window next to you dude so he was that messed up yeah it was selfish yesterday yeah I mean he was doing everything when did he get clean years back I think his wife put the hammer down they gave an family and friends stages an intervention yeah that time oh yeah here got that bad huh late 80s I guess yeah see so I'm not I don't want to say that he couldn't have written amazing stuff without drugs no but the the original stuff that he did he was but well I mean he was it that he was just fucked up and he was writing amazing stuff or was it that he was writing amazing stuff cuz he was fucked up but clearly it has an effect on your mind and your mind is where all your creativity allegedly is coming from right yeah I mean you're writing and you're concentrating the way you're thinking about things yeah rectly effects the work so if you're thinking about things on coke and drinking and you get this like psychotic overview of life on earth and the interactions that people have with each other and and this is what you're right this is how your writing influenced by these drugs has a giant effect on creativity sure but without talent to harness it and you know oh yeah we get you if you don't have that talent that he has one question you can get just fucked up and then just you don't do anything with it it sit in your room you know but he it's uh there's like real talent there yeah that then the drugs influence that it's manipulating that giant talent I mean I think you could also say the same about a lot of great comics like Kennison and Pryor yeah obviously they had a great relationship bad relationship with some drugs yeah but there were also fucking super town on top of that for sure yeah it's a it's a fascinating thought right it's like what what are your thoughts and where where are these coming from are they coming from the environment that you live in the things you've been exposed to the pros and the cons the goods and the bads you be here I mean sure you have but I'll ask it anyway but you ever hear singer songwriters talk about where the songs come from yeah Tom Waits Bob Dylan yeah but they a lot of times they talk about catching them out of the air yeah that they're there they weren't like they didn't come from me they all have this overwhelming feeling like it came from somewhere else yeah what do you make of that for sure I think that you know Steven Pinker calls it the muse he uses the expression the muse or the you know the idea of the muse mm-hmm and that even if it's not like a real music some sort of a guardian thing but treat it like it is right and that with respect like show up to work and that Muse will show up more often right like tune it in and have it come to you but I think it goes back to what we're saying about ego and like getting out of your own way like sometimes when you're writing you're so immersed in these thoughts and these ideas that you are out of your own way yeah that tunnel yeah I think then the booze and the coke and the weed or whatever the fuck you're doing helps you stay in that crazy zone of just letting these ideas sort of create themselves in your mind and letting the story play itself out in your brain but how much of it is from within your brain and how much is it in the ether it's a good question you know does that mean and what is that yeah what is me what does that mean floating around in the ether yeah and letting in you just being a thing where it can kind of show up yeah you know is it just harnessing us I mean because whatever you talk about meditating or even the yoga or the jujitsu all that stuff we're talking about it is a relationship to the universe right right it is a relationship to these forces that are outside of ourselves yeah it's interesting it is and it's probably I mean every human being is a combination of so many different experiences and jeans and environment and the culture they live in I mean there's so many different factors that would affect your creativity - there's so many different factors that would affect the way unique ideas enter into your head yeah yeah and you know how much how much respect do you pay to those ideas how much time do you spend alone with those ideas right can you focus on a lot of different things like if you were writing but can you focus on your act and another project no it's hard right no I'm not good at that I've tried that I don't I don't do so well at that I write different things but if I have like a main project like the mate it's like I'm trying to do a special or something like that the main project it's always got to be the stand-up right and that all these other things that are right are just fishing for more stand-up right you know so I don't a lot of times I don't write like try to sit down write a specific joke yeah I get a joke and then I write on the joke but I get a joke from writing blogs more well like almost like essays so I'll start thinking about a subject in this way I'm not restricted to a punch line format uh-huh I just I'm just trying to explore all the different things that I think about this and then I might find one or two gems in there right and then I extract those and I go okay how do I get that gem right turn into how does I know there's a thought there that makes sense yeah how do I do that without all that other bullshit right how do I get to it quick I really think that great stand-up is like poetry cuz it's all pairing you down to this one simple way to deliver all that thing in that blog yeah right that's why I tweets are so good like you know um Ian Edwards was telling me about that about like writing tweets and writing like a little face post Facebook post like having real limited and he would just sit there and try to write like really funny shit on Twitter and that it forces you to boil it down to 140 characters ya know yeah it's a skill yeah it is it's a definite like you you learn how to have like a quickly impacting thought yeah as opposed to like some long or like here we read I mean I've been guilty of it too I've written some stuff like that but that long drawn out stupid shit that could have been like parsed down it's almost like come on man don't put this out there yet a first draft yeah right oh my god yeah the world is filled with those specials right now yeah those specials those articles and you know so much so yeah just kind of hanging out yeah you know it's a it's an interesting thing but I really do I did like the the process of having to write you know what I mean like knowing that someone's someone out there is waiting for it you know I've got to hand this thing in it was kind of it was pretty cool that's why people like doing specials too because you know that like hey I have to film this thing in six months so I have you know X amount of work to do yeah get it done right like as opposed to if you don't have hanging out yeah just doing sets right he realized that same new joke is six months old I mean how many guys you know like that yeah sit but this is so much comfort in the port you know you're already in port you don't want to go back out to that ocean of ideas right exactly come on I got to go out again I got this act got a nice and honed hurricanes coming and I found my beachside house I got a rebuild I can't possibly I can't do that look I can't grow I'm 70 years old there's no learning yeah it's over I'm done you are what you are I'm done man you are what you are so uh can we talk about what you did yesterday sure you sent me a pretty cool picture oh the elk oh my god yeah holy I told you that once a year that was a savanna Mille how big wild elk thousand pounds probably Jesus big animal oh my god yeah and how long did it just come were you set up in one spot and he kind of crossed your path it was a couple of days of trying to get close to one couple days yeah that that's that's really quick Wow usually it's a lot more days but you know you're obviously sometimes you'll have encounters with an elk like your very first morning there's a picture of the rack on that is amazing as a big animal huge rack yeah that's the most one of the most I think majestic of all wild animals that is amazing I mean that is a mountain of an animal these animals get killed so often by mountain lions like mountain lions in particular yeah and how old is he you think there's I don't know I mean that's about how long did it take to grow that rack you know it's really crazy they drop them off every year and they regrow them quick every year yep so that grows that quickly within a couple months oh my god yeah it was insane it's like one of the that looks quickest growing things in nature I would think that was around for 20 years no no no they drop those off every year oh my god and that's where you can tell very specific like there's very specific characteristics of certain antlers and you can tell like by the sheds if it's the same antler if you catch them like a year later man oh man one one arrow one arrow really what are you aim for with the lungs like the vitals the lungs the heart rate kills him like the lungs get deflated and they die quick he died he fell within five seconds really yeah from an arrow yeah and then it takes a few seconds for them to expire but I never knew we were there he had no idea we were there so how long were you in that spot were you well we we were trying to get to him for a couple hours ah because he was screaming they scream when they're trying to get laid they're trying to pick up chicks fight each other to the death we find dead ones there really yeah you find him all the time one of them they found though had a mountain lions claw stuck in its head which is really crazy really yeah they found this one that had been chewed up and when they you know like when I think one of them dies they want to find out like what killed them and think that you bring the skull to like Fish and Game and they you know to an examination on whatever they can to see what's going on outside it was poached you know sometimes people will shoot an animal and then just they're not supposed to be there like there's people are assholes my like Ted knew really place in some people are obviously yeah Ted Nugent has a place in Michigan and it's this big giant fenced-in deer park that he has hundreds of acres and one day while he was not there someone killed like all of his bucks so they climbed the fence just shot them all and just shot him and left them yeah I shot him oh my god people have done a terrible things like that so I think there's one they have to think about that they find a dead one and also they have to think about what's killing it is it a bear that's killing it right not that usual they're pretty big for a grown bear to attack that Barry that's how easily crazies like bear in America or there's no Grizzlies in California runs right but they do get jacked by Grizzlies in like Wyoming really especially their babies almost all their babies would a grizzly fight it for food or just yeah protect itself no for food oh yeah yeah it was you have to protect yourself from an elk right you have to protect yourself from a moose moves to try to fuck you up yes different animal right they evolved around grizzly bears all the time so the ginger up in Alaska right and there's a certain parts of America they are too but I ran into one in dental Colorado yeah you can find him call oh they're in Wyoming I think I told you that story I came around a trail oh you're a backcountry for a couple of weeks and we just came around his trail it was a baby moose like on the middle of the trail or like oh it's so cute it was like he just heard its mom's got him around the air and this yeah this we got out of there really quick friend of mine has a ranch British Columbia he was on his horse and he got too close to the baby so the mother moose start chasing them at full clip oh man he said it was fucking terrifying yeah cuz the moose is so much bigger than his horse Giganta no he was on a horse a horse oh and he's just hoping that the horse can get away from this fucking moose almost is sprinting at them God and if the moose will knock you off the horse and stomp you to death jeez yeah Oh Mike yeah you catch a mama and she's around her babies and she decides you're a problem and what about the elk does that have like are you would that run you down like if it saw you and felt threatened no they're not as aggressive yeah they're not the same there bill I mean they would they if you got close to them yeah especially during like it right now which is called the rut which is when once a year they get laid once a year they grow these giant antlers and they get ready to fight those antlers are not to fight off predators then to fight each other ah yeah they go to white another dude yep they go to war for balls Wow smash each other for four chicks really Crazy's animal of all time that's wildly screaming man like our Lord of the Rings sound it's like Oh Mike yeah and then the females go it is he yelling so she'll come to him yeah there's Alan so she'll come to him she's mooing so here you listen to this hear it this is from YouTube terrifying elk scream this is what they sound like now looks just like the one all it's got I just keep going he's adorable yeah that's not too loud that's it that's weak look at that business rat whoever put that video up that is a lie yeah it's not it's not terrifying hear that bitch you better stay home if you're in your tent at night and you heard that you'd be a little scared see if you can find a better one cuz there's some awesome one amazing elk bugle so you were in one spot for a couple hours after you heard one that we spotted him in the distance we spotted him on the hill uh-huh with binoculars and then you got to play the wind you got to get close to him you got to figure out which way the wind is blowing so he doesn't smell you yeah the wind changes as the day goes on uh-huh because the the ground heats up what is this [Applause] how about that that's scary his moves going to war in Alaska moose bang they go to war like right on people's lawns and shit fucking up their cars she's I mean they're so big a moose is like twice the size of an elk twice the size oh yeah mooses get to like ate meat mooses misses two pieces my niece's they it's really big to get to like 1,800 pounds holy cow they're huge they're so big didn't even look real geez I saw one that my friend been shot in Alaska NBC in British Columbia and when it was walking across the road there was like a dirt road that we were on we saw it walk from one section of forest into the net it looked like remember that war the world's movie of Tom Cruise or think more holy shit can you eat moose oh yeah yeah lishus you ever hunt for moose yeah hi for moose oh you did once yet and at that time me I shot a moose that's some lose right there this is it oh it's a young moose that's why it doesn't have much antlers and what do you like what's better to eat what's better to eat moose is fantastic moose and elk are all similar that was really good too yeah all wild game if it's healthy yeah if it's prepared correctly and taken care of correctly yeah it's got an amazing taste to it it's just really like nutrient dense for protein dense very different than any other ends again if you want to eat meat in my eyes like this is the best meat for you and the best-case scenario because it's just not like a factory farmed animal and if you don't go and kill it it's faith is sealed by mountain lion here or bears or wolves depending on where it is right or starvation or freezing to death and it has a very short life yeah oh really yeah I mean if if you find a nine year old elk holy shit it's not even possible realized yeah 50% of them in grizzly bear areas they get killed by bears when they're babies that's a hyper yeah their fawns one out of two fawns get killed deer fawns too and a grizzly bear infested areas Wow yeah I tried making that elk steak that you gave me and I messed it up yeah well you gotta cook it very lightly you don't want to like cook it you should use a meat thermometer I'll give you it wasn't long I did it short amount of time it was wrong I think he said that uh there's some layer that oh the silver skin yeah yeah Asha I didn't take that on well I gave you a wrapped one that was from the butcher what was it a roaster steak like what was like a steak do you remember what see what is it there's a white like film that they keep on sometimes it sort of retain moisture and when you when you see it it's like the fashion outside of the meat you have to slice that off it wasn't like a real visible thing yeah it's really thin and sits in between the structure of the muscle huh you got to find it and cut it out or eat around it this is a different kind of animal the taste was good was very yeah cute you too that's that part you got to cut out that's all it is right it was good that the ground oh yeah that's that's like four burgers and chili and all kinds of eggs in the morning oh it's fantastic oh it's so good and again you have to worry about any bullshit there's no hormones yeah by antibiotic that's the worst part like and it's an animal that lived wild I don't like the idea of just blindly ordering meat like when I'm out because I'm not knowing where it came from or not knowing you know and worse how about knowing yeah even worse it's like you think about like what the animal was yeah no yeah we're in a weird place where we're jammed into these boxes of people so no people giant fucking populations and these people food and so they want they don't want to know they don't know where it came from no no I know I think about how many people are looking for lunch yeah every day I mean how do you feed this number of people the Adler pastrami you know a sandwich place get a fucking big corned beef with in Swiss and mustard you're sitting there with a friend eating at Jerry's deli yeah a great time right and fries thank you thank you with your help nothing whatsoever to the whole process of what makes corned beef how do you get that where'd that come from where is that yeah no thought no thought at all dude it's creepy you know yeah fucking weird man but what do you do there's so many of us you can't do anything like there's no wet what you can't obviously do something but I'm saying like the situation that we're in right now it has to be like resolved but it can't be resolved instantly because to try to get all these people some sort of ethically raised animals pasture fed animals that aren't forced to eat some shit they're not supposed to eat so they're unhealthy yeah get your vegetables all free of pesticides but also a high yield do you protect them from insects and yeah pasts and bullshit and disease and don't you feel like it's gonna have to be like there's this new I think it's called better burger looks like a plant-based burger yeah that like that almost looks like it's bleeding like it actually has like a like we tried it I haven't tried it yet but people who really have been talking about it a lot lately don't confuse farm raised plants with not having any consequences though that's another problem that people have well they look at like grain in particular right and they look at this idea of like grain being completely ethical I'm not saying don't eat grain right I'm saying if you look at those gigantic combines that chew up all that grain yeah and when you go over those fields after they've been freshly cut uh-huh you see vultures right all over circling because there's a ton of fucking things that got killed in those blades right rodents and rodents and rabbits right all kinds of shit occasionally fawns you know if someone you know fuck's up and refunds apparently will when they're scared when they're really young they just stay put they're scared and then get run over by shit but how are you gonna feed seven billion people they don't feel like you know here there's a cave and preservatives without preservatives like everybody wants everything to be natural and organic right totally true but without preservatives it's very difficult to get supplies of shit and right stockpile things and to have things in surplus I mean other than grains yeah beans you know and can things yeah you know you'd have to can everything but a lot of like shipping and how we move stuff around how long we want stuff to sit on the shelves and real long we want stuff to stay fresh you want to avoid mold by putting stuff in that avoids mold it also fucks with the natural gut floor that we have right and ours bad seat I'm like a scientist you repeating shit I read but isn't it crazy but isn't it crazy how passionate people like I talked about that I was a ate like a vegan for a couple years on my podcast we got more hate comments like people are so uh like like passionate like screw you looting that way what do you mean I mean I was eating that way I wasn't saying you have to eat that way but Pete there is like a an anger if you show them a different way of living or eating eating just eating well they look at you as a person who's responsible for the death and suffering of animals right yeah that's what it is right and they wanted to show that they are in a better moral position and they feel genuinely outraged by your eating meat but it's the other side too if you say that you eat like a vegan meat eaters come at you and say who the hell do you think you are yeah oh yeah dirt isn't it weird it is weird like what do you care well the baby is it doesn't make any sense then with the meat-eater ragged on the vegan to me doesn't make any sense at all unless that's just like you ever beat a woman that is just so mad at man because she's ran into a few fucked up man and you can't even talk to them alright yeah people just trying to be nice to you like you yeah like every man is shit alright it's sort of like I feel like maybe some meat eaters that shit on vegans huh they get mad because vegans are so proselytizing it's such a common thing to be a proselytising vegan right that meat eaters like almost like attack first first right you know yeah like screw you you're not gonna make me feel bad about what I do yeah but then there's also there's a legit thot point that could be made that the people that are a lot of people maybe they're shitting on vegans and veganism they're doing so because they don't want to address their own complicity in the suffering of animals mm-hmm and they don't want to think about it you make me think about I just want to go to Carl's jr. they're fucking breaking jalapeno cheddar thing with yeah there's that too yeah you can't deny yeah it's not there's no absolute it's not one or the other yeah it's it's very possible this is a bunch of shit going on yeah but that the idea that you could get mad at someone for eating vegan that seems crazy it does seem crazy but I think that people are so connected to what they eat that it it brings up this yeah it's a team thing yeah right it's like we were talking about yeah a lot of lung same I mean how many goddamn vegans out there have the word vegan in their Twitter profile or their Facebook profile or their Instagram photo jesus fucking christ right you're wearing it like a badge of honor right yeah and they feel like they're gonna help the world with this whole plant-based plant-based right yeah but if you wrote like meat-eater Tom Papa meat-eater on the good cut yeah you know unless you run a TV show like meat-eater Steve Rinella the Sportsman's Outdoor Channel unless you're doing that yeah you would never do that no good right plant-based you know at a plant-based and plant-based people right that in their profile it's not a vegan happy vegan yeah I'm the healthy vegan yeah this is made vegan I want you to know what I am what I stand for athletic vegan like there's so many people that have that in their name profile it's so obvious what you're doing yeah part of a team I just want to be more of a healthy lifestyle I'm promoting the what's gonna save the world I'm promoting and I know they believe that uh-huh I know they believe that but I think we tend to look at like the entire thing right we tend to look at the entire group of people like we have to stop eating meat look at what we're doing to the environment yeah well some of us definitely don't have to eat meat you could do whatever you want right we should all look at factory farming and say this is despicable you this is horrific that we've allowed our civilization to accept this yeah you know inside of our borders right mm-hmm this is a barbaric practice yeah it's terrifying because it's a complete denial of like the natural order of life instead you like no I'm gonna just capture this life and cage it up and then shoot it when it's ready yeah like whoo that way it stays tender because it doesn't move yeah dark yeah to me what makes sense to me everybody has their own thoughts on this makes sense to me is to just go out in the wild and get it yourself if you can yeah everybody can't no I know people don't have the time right I understand that too yeah I get that I don't I'm not telling anybody what to do but for me I was at a point in 2012 where I was trying to decide if I was going to be a vegan or vegetarian I would lean towards vegetarian because I don't think there's anything wrong with free-range eggs and things along those lines and yeah and I don't think there's anything wrong with catching fish either so maybe I'd be a pescetarian right but what I wanted to avoid was though the factory farming thing is fucked up it is completely so then I started hunting I was like it's gonna be one of the other once I started hunting I was like oh this is the way right because this is exciting and crazy and wild and it puts you in tune with nature and this crazy way and you have this deep intense respect for wild things that I never had before I didn't think about the management of wildlife or the resources of the land that we have yeah look land and that these animals roam these areas and these areas have to be supported with money and that money comes from hunting tags and attacks on sportsmen gear and supporting gear and right you know anything hunting gear related they pay a giant some of that money that goes towards conservation it's a big tax right it's like 11 percent well yeah so this is like what supports that and all the licenses and everything that supports the the Fish and Wildlife Management right of this country all this wild game yeah it pretend that's why there's more deer in this country than there has been since Columbus landed there's more deer in this country than when Columbus landed stop that's true yes it is more white-tailed deer in this country then then there ever was before and then there's other animals that they had almost extirpated because of what would these call market killing huh market hunting needs to do at the turn of the century back when they didn't have refrigerators they would and they they would just took advantage of these wild animals roaming around they would hire assassins especially right shoot these animals and sell sell the meat they almost wiped out all the elk they almost wiped out all the deer they almost wiped out everything she's at one point in time before fish and wildlife management company started managing all this stuff huh there was a severe problem with the lack of wildlife and the you know the the possible impending inst extinction price crisis but since then they've repopulated elk in a lot of areas they repopulated deer almost everywhere that was before there's a big family in new jersey and they're deer all over the place and i always thought it was because there was so much development that the deer have nowhere to go what's because there's no predators Jersey has more predators now than ever before was really new jersey oh yeah dances population of black bears in the country really yeah yeah those the Predators that control the deer population but a lot of times that's not enough food for them and then the encroaching population they find out about garbage cans and things like that and then they become a giant problem right because there's also the densest populated with humans well it is but it's not see New Jersey has a lot of really rural area so a lot of people aren't really thinking about they're not aware there's a ton of wildlife in New Jersey yeah people might think about like new ones working yeah which is where I was born yeah you know they think of like northern New York which Anor New Jersey rather right closing County that's where I was born southern New Jersey and like then last the whole West it's all fuckin crazy yeah it's crazy rural out there yeah my my brother-in-law started to similar the way you started thinking about how he's gonna get his food and stuff and he started hunting deer mm-hm and cuz it's in New Jersey there's all these deer so he goes out he gets like to a season yeah and it feeds his family for the year yeah and amazing look it is a fat first of all you're controlling a population that needs to be controlled because there's a ton of accidents two million car accidents in this country last year people hitting deer and 150 people died two million from hitting deer yeah in this country alone yeah that's crazy huh unless you want to bring mountain lions and wolves everywhere you have to figure out a way to control those things right one of the best ways to control that also contributes to wildlife management funds is hunting right for hunting tax see it's all it's all very counterintuitive because we assume the people who hunt don't like wildlife right no you don't like it if you let alone let it let it live its life man right but yeah but the problem is we've set up highways and these cities and like you can't just leave it alone now we've already interfered a nature to a point we've altered gigantic swaths of land to suit our bidding so you either want to regress right away from technological so the people that drive Tesla saying this is the most crazy what oh sorry I mean it's like yeah people who want cities and want technology but they don't want management of wildlife you don't understand they don't even understand it they've got something out there the city's not even possible once you manage wildlife right because of mountain lions and bears start moving into Pasadena and start killing people right exactly manage them if he deers are everywhere and everyone's crashing into cars you can imagine what are you gonna do right yeah wolves humans shouldn't play God man just go outside and hope hope you don't get eaten but no percent I would say a high percentage without knowing anything of people that hunt love the outdoors love being out there but then you have those stories like you were saying with the Ted Nugent where people just kind of come in with their guns and shoot and get drunk and go off those are those are tranq he doesn't do that but he is a very boisterous right-wing type character no I'm saying the guys who came in and just shot his bucks and blows guys yeah yeah crazy they were drunk okay they were all cracked up there mounted up yeah they weren't crank crank well I hope this that this discussion doesn't dissuade you from going to Musso and Frank's like gentlemen are sue has to do we got to do a martini and a steak once a year all those those cows once a year um but this this meat that I ate last night that I shot yesterday morning and ate that night maybe the best thing I've ever eaten in my life really fucking funny picture on Instagram that one yeah phenomenal so rich with my feels healthy just looking at those pictures dude it's so it's so good oh my god I'm so rich with nutrients so how did you cook that I cooked it on I have a pellet grill right called a Yoder there's a bunch of really good ones Trager makes a really good one right it's on Green Mountain grills makes really good ones a bunch of companies that make them I cook it at 275 degrees until it hits an internal temperature of 125 degrees then it's not so long right no then I take it off and then I heat up a cast-iron skillet this is I've tried a bunch of different ways this is the method that works the best for me that I like the best I heat a cast-iron skillet very very hot and then I put some grass-fed butter in the cast-iron skillet and then i sear the outside I put crust so after the internal temperature is already 125 degrees I cook it real quick so lastly to know in it yep into the pan which is on the stovetop mm-hmm yeah and just sear it yeah like maybe less than a minute each side right maybe yeah like maybe like 45 seconds maybe each side just to get a little crust on that it just is the perfect combination of the outside and the inside is very rare like but warm that's like when you take a bite of meat just start pounding the table and it makes you feel physically good yeah not like Laguna and killed an animal that's not what I mean I mean like your body responds to the nutrients and the meat and almost like an instantaneous way and part of it could be the thing that's very different than going to Jerry's deli and getting that pastrami is that there's a incredible deep immediate connection with that food and especially for me that day yeah knowing that I shot that that morning how did you get it that don't doesn't have to go to the butcher no we take parts of the body off we're gonna take the back straps and the tenderloins which are like very easy to manage cuts a butcher shop will cut steaks out of the back legs and the hams and gotcha roasts and things like that gotcha so what did you what was that piece that you had last night was the tenderloin they just took with you yeah well I took a bunch of it with me right put it in a cooler a Yeti cooler but dude it's a it's it's the total opposite of going to a burger place well you know yeah can I get a double double yeah onions large diet coke - please right you get that and yeah right let me taste good and everything like sure but that's there's no connection nothing where's this nose thought this insane connection and it's really difficult to to accomplish yeah shoot up elk with a bow and arrow it's crazy it takes years and years of practice and I still suck at it yeah there'd to like a really good Archer and a really good hunter I'm still constantly practicing yeah absolutely trying to know I mean evolve it like if I were to get into hunting and go out there I'd have to take a gun because otherwise I'm gonna be shooting it in its I even that you have to learn how to shoot a gun properly this is Nauti it's not people think it's easy to go shoot an animal with a gun yeah not getting close to one right you don't know what the fuck you're doing you could luck out and yeah wander into a deer is not paying attention shoot them right but most the time no like most the time you have to get within a couple hundred yards of them you have to do if the wind is wrong they smell you a mile away they reckon bolt immediately yeah we stink doing we smell terrible when animals smell us yeah I don't know what I would wish science could figure out what it is that hits an animal's and nostrils when they smell a person but like a deer they like fuck this they're gone really yeah the wind hits the back of your neck let's see if you're like winds change right it's like say if you're looking at these animals and you're trying to make a stalk on one and then the wind is blowing in your face like this is perfect they can't smell me because the winds in my face and then as you get closer the wind can shift right sometimes do you get the wind swirls and you feel in the back your neck and they just the animals perk up and they're like fuck right and they're gone yeah it's amazing it's because they're thinking about cats that's what they're thinking about they're thinking about smelling a cat right and that fucking that scent hits them yes weird human scent the human things bad too I think we probably smell we probably have our own unique danger smell yeah but they're mean they're the evolution is not to avoid humans we've only been here a couple hundred years the evolution of the alq most likely to avoid predators cats and bears right they smell a predator right fuck this go I just went up the breath of a grizzly bear you know and the wind hits you I saw coyote the other day out on my neighbor's lawn it was like a husky who's a big ass look like a wolf's probably a coin wolf to me other half those are happening uh-huh there's coyotes well here's the thing there was a guy named Dan Flores that I had on the podcast yeah he wrote this book called coyote America fascinating book with history of coyotes in America oh yeah I can absorb that book it's so good really oh it's amazing cuz it's so great and there's all the shit that I didn't know one of the things is that a coyote is a wolf it is a small wolf it's a small species of wolf that's why they interbreed with wolves and no problem every wolf except the gray wolf the gray wolf left America for so long and went to africa and became my jackals and all these different dog species over there right but all the dogs that we have all of them came from wolves all of them and all of our dogs my dogs every dog and they all can breed with the wolf really all of them yeah so in the coyotes they breed with different like a lot of coyotes like what percentage gray wolf what percentage red wolf like there's separate species they're all the same thing genetically like every dog when they trace the DNA of a dog they give give it all of them come from wolves really yeah Sonny my little black lab the koi wolf yeah your little black lab at one point and you know who knows what yeah way exactly of that process was a wolf so these coywolves you see the one in the black that's the coywolf right it's like a combination of like a wolf and a coyote that meanwhile even coyotes though this guy Dan Flores were saying our kind of wolf that's why it works in the first place because they don't like if something like a tiger fucks a line and they make a liger that liger can't have babies but because they're totally different species but a tiger can fuck a lion and get it pregnant there's a real life I would say it's about to talk to you okay Billy were you this is not the woods for you I wouldn't go there slash out here buddy let me get you back home to your parents hold on here comes a bear protecting these kids you fuck dude you smell you smell terrible get out of here so what you've seen is larger coyote this was a big coyote yeah it was big I was oh my god he might just be a regular that's big did you say a lot yeah food out of your mouth man mostly pets a lot of pets a lot of pets yeah a lot of bats man believe me we got it light deal with coyotes approach those people in New Jersey they're dealing with bears yeah people people don't know people that live outside like go go to that video from Far Rockaway where these two 500-pound bear on might be exaggerating 500-pound bears are rustling and fighting in the street knocking over mailboxes in New Jersey and cars stop there they're into it and if I'm exaggerating it's not by much look at these two things oh man look at the size of these fuckers dude looks like my sister's house but look how they fall down and they knock shit over they slam later they knocked over that fence post look at the size of these fuckers all right and they're fighting over territory they don't attack people though sure they do they do Rockaway New Jersey a kid in Rutgers was killed a couple of years ago a kid in Alaska was killed by a bear who was on God they're big a kid in Alaska was killed he was on a race he was on a trail race kid he called his mom said a bear was following him oh my god and then then it got a bear got him they found the bear protecting the kid's body look at the size of that fucker that's huge I thought black bears were small no that's bullshit they're they really I thought they were small how small do you think they were I thought they were like smaller than that with the cutout size of that when they first are when they're babies growing a little bit really big the ones at the jump in take a huge man be huge they get to be like eight feet tall jeez yeah so what's the predator for the black bear and he seriously hunters yes it that's it bears on how many predators none well the only predator to a bear is another bear which they do kill each other a lot we're gonna eat each other a lot especially babies she they eat a lot of babies they do oh yeah a lot of really good yeah how would this guy he's riding his mountain bike and he sees that bear and fucking fall downs like Jesus we don't have him out here look at this panic Jesus you ever see the one where the guy hits the bear in his car and he fucking screams holy fuck no he's driving his car down this road going like 35 miles an hour and this bear jumps out last minute boom hits the cut hits the car and the bear goes follow line runs off into the into the woods oh my god probably died yeah but watch it slowly watch this is crazy yeah watch this shows driver's car dude you just having a good time make your own oh just driving oh my god that's not even the one it was denying that's the Daily Mail one and then ran into the wood yeah there's another one that happens even quicker this is a little different because it's got a guardrail the other one the other video is there's a bunch of trees to this side this is it yeah North Carolina watch this one whoo-hoo I'm just driving along thinking about the time why people used to run the world slavery was oh my god that thing's huge [Laughter] [Laughter] there couldn't be any better than if somebody narrated over I'd accidentally thought oh it's smug fucking big boy missed that part oh my god that is scary I just hit a bear they're huge dude my sister-in-law just hit a deer she's like going like a you know Bergen County like like not a rural part my friend cam lives in Oregon and one of the guys in his neighborhood died because someone in front of him hit a deer and the deer went flying through the air and his car was behind it and the deer landed through his windshield on hill the hood G muck it's just so yeah it's yeah flying bones I mean then here's here's the angry vegan argument sue you just want like all these animals to go away so you could continue destroying the world with your stupid fucking car man is that what you're saying so yeah there shouldn't be any wildlife cuz it didn't convince you how about it's their land man how about it's theirs well then you couldn't be there knocking to me because there'd be no computers I can't live in their land you wouldn't survive we carve off swaths of it far on what we decide the cities are are nomads the cities aren't even real man this is something we built over there sacred burial ground this is where the Bears just buried a young man yeah talk to each other in an ancient language you don't understand anymore yeah we can all look and we all have our own little fantasy world yeah well the anthropomorphize ation that thing that disney movies did they made animals talk yeah that fuck people up it really did fucked us up as children it really did it really did yeah no I know I mean people think that's a joke I'm joking around I'm being dead serious i watch my kids are vegetarians because my place is what and no a big part of it was seeing them as people like seeing them with a little bow tie or like you know it it really has an effect of you know fuck of of course especially when you're a little baby yeah you know when you grow up watching Yogi Bear you know foghorn leghorn yeah but it's a trial that when I was watching that stuff my mom was also making amazing meals did not connect it now yogi was yogi and mom just made lasagna there's a little problem with representing something I mean look it's entertaining there's nothing wrong with that for us as an adult yeah that's a child it puts the idea in your head that these things are something other than what they are right you know not that there's anything bad with what they are what they are is amazing even predators like I don't I wouldn't want predators wiped out I think bears and wolves are fucking awesome and it's crazy to see - oh no yeah and look I mean that's why the factory farming thing is so gross there's a consciousness to animals I mean my dog you know oh yeah has a sensitivity and a love and I mean there's you make those animals suffer I mean that's exactly that's bad well the other thing is that that animal especially dogs they have developed this intense sensitivity in connection with people over thousands and thousands of years they're having this weird symbiotic relationship with us yeah when we get like like I have a golden golden retriever yeah dude this is a sweetest dog I've ever had in my life yeah there's a big ol snuggle bunny yeah he's a baby and he's a sweetest thing occasionally he plays a little too rough and everybody gets mad at him nothing yeah such a sweet bucket like when I come home that dog he runs around me in circles then drops onto his back and I start rubbing his belly yeah I sit down he climbs on top of me and circles around and kisses my face licking like crazy legs up in the air he wants me to rub his tummy yeah bastard to the fest he's so sweet you know they did a there was an article the other day which I didn't get too deep into but that they this guy trained dogs so they would be calm enough so you could put them in an MRI you could actually study their brains oh wow it was hard to do because dogs you know think freaked out and that but you need them just to stay still like a human so you could study their brain and they learned that a lot of the patterns of a dog's brain are similar to ours empathy and feeling for things like a motion of like you know it was so similar that it really showed like just genetically wired mmm to feel and have emotion very similar to the way we do that's fasting you know I also genetically wired to do kill chickens Wow real problem yeah do you have chickens yeah I don't know if he's killed one but he definitely brought a dead one to me once I was like did you kill this what the fuck happened because it didn't make sense nobody me because he he doesn't seem that aggressive with the chickens before I might have died they just die sometime sure they just die you find him in their pen yeah the chicken coop they have this big-ass like a chicken house sometimes just find them in their dead oh yeah you know there you get all your eggs yeah it's great you don't live that long you know but yeah but he fucking now they had one in his mouth he's carried it around you know now he wants to go near them all the time yeah yeah cut the shit can you train him not to do that sort of yeah but you got to be on it all the time yeah it's got to be like a daily thing like he really likes chasing chickens yeah Jody know these are back here yeah it was a baby yeah it's instinct of course oh yeah dude he's so happy too and you catch him doing it yeah my dog like it's great black lab she's so sweet same thing and because we it's a vegetarian household it was only when I don't make meat that often when I'm with the family because it just kind of you know it's kind of weird to be sitting there eating meat in front of him so but when I do when we're alone sometimes in there giving her some meat she started to see me as the one thing in the house that gave me whatever that was our relationship went to a whole nother level yeah yeah now she looks at me differently meat with butter on it they don't even bother chewing it you're seeing when you give on so fast it's a gun so I really feel like no to enjoy that if you give them dog food they never react like that like Ali does yeah you're calling it chicken this is all bullshit I cut off a couple peaks of elk and put it in my dog's food yeah take your time good instinct yeah it's yes it is a weird thing that we've created these animals not created them but sort of bred them to the point where they become a part of the household yeah I only live with you but they don't speak English no rules they know the rules yeah I'm gonna kill you but they don't when you're dog sometimes like it's just like you're face to face you know just looking you in the face you're just like and you just see the teeth yeah this is kind of weird that I my face as close to this job yeah thank god this thing is really nice because it could just bite me in the face right now that's why erratic dogs like Cujo are so fucking terrifying yeah cuz they're part of your family then all sudden something goes wrong I had a dog when I was a kid that we got from the pound and had distemper and we had him for a couple days and it just kinda kept getting worse and worse it was a Doberman Doberman Pinscher oh my god and it got to the point where was growling and barking at us in the house yes we cared of everybody and growling a barking oh man we were talking to it like what's wrong like what's wrong and then we brought it to the vet and they like this dogs fucked really got distemper it was just is that it like a chemical thing it's some sort of a disease they can get from other dogs and a lot of times dogs that didn't have their shots they get it and uh it can make some dogs behave very erratically and you can't correct this I don't think they can yes they couldn't when I had a dog right canine distemper contagious and serious viral illness no known cure disease affects dogs and certain species of wildlife such as raccoons wolves foxes and skunks common house pet the ferret is also a carrier of this virus oh my god so that was in your house yeah well it's not as bad as but for this one dog whatever kind of distemper he had yeah it was major Simpsons include high fever reddened eyes watery discharge of the nose and eyes and in fact a dog calm lethargic and tired and usually become anorexic puppy that had this as well and his his thing well he didn't have this but he had something that gave him seizures and they thought it was distemper see fish seizures paralysis and attacks of hysteria see that was what my dog had he had the hysteria part oh yeah I don't know if he was lethargic he was just sitting there even though he's growling it wasn't like he was trying to get us oh yeah but he wasn't doing that right he may result in two to five weeks after the initial infection sad yeah do you have one dog at three you have three yeah do you think it's mean to have one dog no I mean if you're around the dog you hang out with them yeah we hang it's a lot of love dogs like dogs though they do like dogs pack animals yeah have a good time together oh my god we had this little thing came over to the house and I was so happy yeah my daughter's got Chihuahua and so the Chihuahua and the the golden get together run around and play and it's like they have the fucking best time no I mean I'm like you know I it's a lot of work having I'm like 1z yeah but when I saw them together I had a little weakness like yeah she's a good-size yard with yeah and around yeah yeah it's okay dude crazy thing is that that used to be a wolf even like an English Bulldog yeah somewhere along the line that was a wolf it was a wolf they all come from that yeah and then the wolves like slowly got closer to us by the campfire we had food we talked a little food he'd be cool to us the other wolf so back off these guys got food they're cool people they're cool man then they became more more submissive they think over time right one that were more submissive were more accepted and they bred more and then their ears started to flop more submissive versus like like the ears up like listening around for prey right right instead they became this thing well came to know as dogs it's pretty great strange man it's weird know that when they were like well they started doing those DNA tests on dogs they thought that they would find that dogs came from like a bunch of different wild canids like a bunch of different wild dogs yes that's what I would think oh yeah from North America too because they're so different looking mmm that's crazy I don't really eat now well so are people though right I mean that's the weird thing my life life just that's one of the reasons why it's so easy for us to like gather up into these stupid tribes yeah it's because visually we look so much different well I mean people from South Korea look way different than people from Africa and it's very different to not think of us all is the same yeah so you tribal up with the people that look similar to you because you're scared of the other and not even the look there's probably with like within us there's traits that you don't even know that you're recognizing like when I'm around Italians it's like there's something about it that's yeah you know that's comforting for sure you know yeah that's why it's like really funny not funny but it's really odd when like super light-skinned black people are like really radical black activists you're like hey you actually really want to gain acceptance in this trihard course every tribes been knocking you like show your your you know cuz it's one thing that a friend of mine said who's black he was talking about black racism and he was like one of the weirdest racism that I've had to accept is dark people versus like a lighter black skin light skin yeah light-skinned people were oftentimes be really racist to dark-skinned black people interesting and I was like really oh yeah yeah there's a big difference difference between how light-skinned black people feel about dark-skinned black people and vice-versa and dark-skinned black people racism within black people I was like whoa yeah that's a whole mindset that I was try and understand just give people enough time and they'll eventually find a group to belong to yeah that they even in the group like if you act right the black people who are light-skinned do they identify more with the dark-skinned black people or white people they'd probably see more the dark-skinned black people this is obviously we're great generalization yeah yeah but these people that have these issues with this thing right but they probably in comparison to white people like well I'm not that person right I'm one of these and more like that guy this guy's not like me cuz you know he's that and I'm this and then this is my group and their group you know so even inside groups we have these factions yeah yeah hard-line Republicans right you know versus I'm more of it on the libertarian side Rob all right right just check my profile let you know what it's all about a super Wonder person there's good ideas behind all these things yeah notwithstanding especially like when you talk about idea not race right like good ideas behind being a vegan even good ideas behind like a lot of right-wing Republican ideas like what they're trying to do is noble right yeah no absolutely in some yes it's the extremes it's the extremes it's it's saying that that my team can never be wrong in any regard and it's just been a team period yeah just there's a lot I wanna belong got except a lot of bullshit if you want to join a team yeah Billy dropped the ball that fuck now we lose no Billy twat kinematic a that twice what's the best word is so good that sargon of akkad guy was trying to say me tell me it was I was failing saying it wrong it's not twat that it's twat twat twat please mine twat how do you say SWAT like SWAT team yeah you say you don't say SWAT it doesn't first of all the idea of English people telling us how to use their language English person back off we own it now my favorite variation of English though is Australian because it's a very distinctive version of Inc it's not American yeah you know no pink t'v how completely they're off their own island to making up their own rules right Adam my friend Adam Greentree who's by the way has the most exciting Instagram story in the world right now he's been living by himself in the back country bow hunting in Colorado oh yeah totally struck out in Colorado he was there for like 20 days I started watching because I heard you talking bailed on Colorado and now he's moved into the Grizzly infested mountains of what not only that the Grizzly invested mountains of Montana but not only that he documented officially documented grizzly bears in Colorado where people are saying there's no Grizzlies in Colorado and there's even a website deals with it and says the people who say they sighted a grizzly bear in Colorado it's often times like Sasquatch like you think you saw no he is an experienced outdoorsman who's been a bow hunter his whole life knows what he's looking at and he found several grizzly bears in the mountains deep in the background and recorded it 16 miles in yeah I mean they're little blobs moving around the back where I'd see but but they're big yeah and he said that is absolutely 100% a fucking mountain grizzly bear so they're moving into Colorado - he's been in the woods a long time 20 days and now he's back he got in a car I rented a car took him a day he drove into I think Wyoming or Idaho whatever's connected to Montana I think it's Wyoming no Idaho think it's Idaho yeah he drove into Idaho and now he's making his way down from Idaho into the parks and I know he's hiking into Montana into grizzly infested back and Wyoming yeah it's fucking scary shit managed Grizzlies everywhere up there he has a family yes he does and he's just out in the woods I'm not scared I'm what I'm envious of how he gets out of his house to go to the woods for that 20 days 20 days oh my I don't know if my wife would let me well if you were love it if you're updating your Instagram story constantly see that's my theory as to why he's doing this this way it lets everybody know where he is all the time everybody knows he's okay versus like him just disappearing off the map 4:30 right it is so interesting that you could be out and be able to film stuff and communicate and look at maps and he's a savage not a lot of people could do it that way yeah even most bow hunters will tell you like man I'll go for a backcountry camping trip for like seven days by myself yeah days but this guy's just gone so deep he's and by yourself I'm self that's that's the thing I mean even hearing one other friend makes a big difference he ran out of food a while back so you could see him like getting skinnier and skinnier as time went on and he had to go into town to get more food oh my god and ran out of food he's like you see it in his face really face is getting more gaunt his eyes are getting more sunken in it's like whoa I saw him like exhausted at one point he was like laying back so deep man I mean what'd he do he had a filter water through a piece of wet like old rotting piece of wood he poured them all because his filter was back at camp 16 miles away because he had been running he'd been getting so much fresh water that was pumping right out of the ground for my rings you could just drink that but when you come to a creek like you have to take a chance yeah because it could be Giardia because beavers shit in the dam and you get what they call beaver fever oh boy you shit your brains like rocket projectile broken fire hydrant diarrhea just blah well your body's like hey fucking guy so I'm taking a sip and saying I might regret this in a couple days oh man yeah he drinks a lot straight out of the ground and he just does this is his gig well he has a company in Australia and he's kind of his own boss so he gets to decide that he goes on on the road Wow but he's a very famous professional bow hunter - Wow yeah it's crazy crazy insta story if you're interested yeah it's like for these guys that want to do these backcountry solo hunts but it's uh there he is look at his face on the far left he asked a lot of wait man yeah he had a little he's gonna be shredded with a guitar and pose for a fucking calendar he's a handsome fellas yeah it's so funny like that it's amazing like just social media it's like you watch him he's lucky out in the woods by himself then the next story is hey but my show my show the ice house it's really I'm a good time I know he's crazy he's pretty hard with different lives yeah you know but I was gonna say they're their version of the English language is the best yeah he'll say you know but I've got me 10th I got me Bo over here you got me water supply I'm all good everything's me this me that yeah that to me is like my favorite version of the English language yeah slightly cooler than American mm-hmm but Australian is slightly cooler than English that's the vert the most usual English language sounds a little sends a little reckless to me do you think so it's a reckless language yeah Oh everything kill them over there wound up yeah they gotta be wound up fucking snakes and spiders and crocodiles and they're surrounded by sharks they're all out there on their own there anyone attacks them there there's no one no one's gonna help yeah I mean how BIG's the Australian Army it's like 25 people I think well the whole place is only the amount of people it's the same size as America but the amount of people is the same as California slightly less than kaha that sounds great just drive around I was just saying this before Jamie that I I think living in LA I just feel like I'm gonna end up be the cranky guy that can't be around people right I there's so many people around us all the time you know it just it's exhausting it is but it's also energizing right somewhat yeah when I come back from the woods I know somewhere like especially camping yeah and then you come back to civilization you kind of appreciate restaurants and yeah movie theaters yeah it's a popcorn or watch a movie just like being around it maybe that's it you just need breaks from it yeah that's what I think yeah I think the best of both worlds is both worlds right I think just living by yourself in the woods like the Unabomber like what the fuck dude I don't want to end up that way that's a loan with nature nature no fucking phones pussy yeah what's gonna get through that total military personnel eighty one thousand we have eighty one thousand military in my house military the P Erica what's the amount of military in America let's guess let's guess before we search how many military in the United States military military members we're not even gonna include the Coast Guard you have to include the Coast Guard all right Navy Coast Guard Marines Air Force Army 4 million 18 million 70 million 70 I'm going crazy no 3 2 point 6 to point 3 brother yeah total population 323 well they're not including my scans is Rena 23 million then told them military two million three hundred Wow so less than 10 percent you know what's interesting about that number man I remember when 250 million when I was a kid the population was 250 I remember because I remember thinking me and my friends were sitting around we're in high school were like 250 million yeah how the fuck are there that many people yeah we were like wow that's to Fanny now it's almost a hundred million more my god in the world like 7 billion but what was it then I think I think in like the 80s when I was in high school yeah I bet there was half yeah I bet there was like three yeah we met we met we've learned to survive too well it's amazing this is how many people got all this food shipped into these cities and medicine factory farming in medicine we're living longer living much longer long so many people during the last Eclipse that's what the the stat that blew my mind during the last time we had an eclipse total eclipse like that on our on our continent it was a hundred years ago a hundred years ago there were fewer people in the whole state of California than who live in LA today oh it must be nice oh must been glorious yes to the Comedy Store in like ten minutes on a bike yeah where in the world sweet it was like a small town so many damn people 1917 there's three million people California in the whole state that's way less than la always like John Oh again three females in the halls mate and they're probably like there's so many fucking people you know gross right I can't go to town one more time asshole what is today Texas what does Texas have today go to the very end here Texas has 27 million Canada the entire country Canada 36 million oh my god California 39 million so California has more people than fucking Canada so I'm not going crazy it's a real thing I'm telling ya well that's also one of the reasons why California or rather Canada the people are so nice they're not as overwhelmed yeah they're surprised to see you see that that bear on the fucking California sign yeah crazy that bears like that are extinct in California what is that that's Rizzoli Risley these two have Grizzlies in California in fact the last grizzly that killed a man in California before they killed him was in Lebec lebec California there's a guy that was the last guy killed by bear in California his name I think was Stephen Lebec something Lebec le b ec right and they named a town after him he was the last guy in California to be killed by bears we stand wasn't huge bears in like the 18 under I think it was I think it was then right in the 1800's but they killed him because they were killing all the people like they were killing us right but meanwhile it's them we put on the flag like we won but we miss you buddy put you on the flag we love you we love looking at you but you got to stop eating us and so we have to shoot you all you know it's lame about that is a it's similar to the what happened with the Native Americans but it's not it is you know what most would killed most the Native Americans in this country dizzy smallpox like a bunch of diseases yeah the 90% that we brought to them yeah and they're crazy 90% of them were killed wiped out by disease yeah I was thought we killed them all we killed a lot of them for sure not we I shouldn't say we I was his room this shows grandchild of immigrants yeah I was just exactly we were in Italy at the time enjoying ourselves there was Lake the Tenaya Lake in a Yosemite is named after this chief tenaya who we killed his son we killed his son in front of him which is stop saying we I know I had that in my act for a while my daughter's like why do we do that I'm like easy with the we we were on Vespers and eating spaghetti we're lovers and then name the lake after him like killed his kid in front of him made him suffer killed him and then named the lake after and it's like it absolves us of the guilt and we just apparently Taniya there's a name it was some horrible horrible shit going on back then horrible all over the world I mean and even before that like the accounts of what Columbus did when they encountered the natives and then you know they were trying to get gold out of these people and slaughter these people slaughtered so I mean it's a serial killer type shit I mean that's we used to have Columbus I guess we still do not ins California they're getting rid of it yeah yeah but in New York you know Columbus Circle and they still the someone to face the Columbus statue in Central Park stop doing that man just like you got to stop you can't deface Genghis Khan statue like it's one thing to Revere and worship these people we definitely shouldn't do that anymore yeah but like to with those statues our history we should look at it but understand what we're looking at you know we're not worshiping a statue of Christopher Columbus but it is a fascinating thing to know that this monster got in a boat and sailed across the ocean if it wasn't for him likely wouldn't be a whole population here right and the people that he went with I think you got to add some new statues yeah sounds new statue that's a good man yeah of other people that had a positive impact on stuff you know you know what's fucked up though about a lot of these civil war strategies that people are wanting to tear down now and destroy yeah what's fucked up was when you look at when those things were built mmm those things weren't built like way before the civil rights movement and they're a relic of an ancient past right a lot of them were built in response to the civil rights movement so there they are racist in origin yeah a lot of the robert e lee ones and all that shit like the world in the south for a union and yeah no they weren't around right since the 1800s there's like 1965 yeah and laughs am i made really quickly and shittily yeah in response to the civil rights movement and that they were made out of like copper and bronze and shakers there's easier to do than stone oh really yeah yeah no it's not good now we had to create some other people what's that she's like a visualization of the number of monuments that were erected and what like this is awesome these are all civil war monuments yeah look at that shit n double acp was found a giant spike in civil war monuments Wow look at that man that's crazy yeah it was a retelling red summer race riots giant spike in Civil War monuments Tulsa Race Riot cyan't spike and Civil War riot is civil war statues that's nuts man yeah like you could track it bigger version this I find right now but wow that's spooky yeah cuz no one's talking about that when they're talking about keeping these things up and they represent our heritage like yeah I understand what you're saying but worshiping this is a real problem because you got to realize what was the motivation to put like why is it okay though for me why why why do I look at it and go I have a problem with this because they did it during the racist 1960s or during the early 1900s in this n-double-a-cp was created i would accept it better if it was 200 years old instead of a hundred like what's wrong right like why do I care right what do you mean why do you care I mean why why is it like I mean what is it more offensive that it was created by racists in the 1960s then if it was created by racists 200 years ago maybe it's cuz I line yeah alive right now yeah exactly yeah that's dirty it's dirty when you look at the actual spikes yeah George Wallace it jumped up during the assassination of Martin Luther King jr. whoa when George Wallace is blocking the schools yeah Detroit race riots boom I got a little spike yeah hanging on to it not so fast teams at war yeah teams act out of kindness that's not an act out of kindness that's not putting a statue up there out of out of love do you ever think though that those people that we're doing all this stuff back then they really didn't have it then direct connection with the world the way we have today and then one of the reasons why we're seeing all these people tearing these things down now is because we all have a direct connection with each other and we realized that hey these civil war war statues they're fucking horrible yeah what the Civil War was was horrible right like saying that it's a part of your culture this is horseshit like no this is a part of a terrible genocide on black people did demonizing to the point where they were the other and it was okay to enslave them yeah hundreds of years no you could live in in New York State and not have any idea really what was going on in the south at the time no no no you don't understand the Civil War was about economics yeah I've seen that argument too but I've seen that argument torn apart if there was social media back then do you think slavery would have even existed no and here's the thing nobody wants slavery today if you do you're a cunt too it doesn't mean that like when you guys define yourself by a war that you lost and the war had a big part of what the war was about with slavery that's a giant problem it's a big problem to draw a giant problem and how the world looks at us and looks at you and the way you look at yourself like you're yeah you're like justifying some of the most horrific shit in human history so far from an American history yeah that's not out of kindness slaves oh gee that's weird wouldn't how strange is it that people live better when you fed them and they lived in fucking cages than when they were released with no skills and no education and couldn't read and how to repopulate oh my god in a country that they don't even then it's not even the country of their origin yeah as you're still putting up a statue on your way out the door fucking a general who fought to keep slavery alive yeah let's move on doesn't the south isn't awesome folks it doesn't mean that you're not awesome yeah but let's move forward stop with the teams here's the problem right what do you do about old Lynyrd Skynyrd albums that that fucking fly I know right yeah I know Oh Neil Young it's tricky yes like all things it's not that black and white you can't absolute that because there are some awesome shit well you also don't want to there is a danger in wiping out history so we don't learn from it like you can't do that either like you can't just pretend this thing didn't exist and that there's remnants of it's still around you need to be educated of if we're gonna learn from history you need to educate yourself about it yeah absolutely so you can't just sweep it all under the rug and think okay if we don't see it it didn't exist yeah yeah absolutely you know and on
