the Joe Rogan experience but I got a story that I don't want to tell because in front of my girlfriend cuz it will upset her because I will make my life a bit harder and I don't want to tell it on any tonight's shows anything so I'll tell him I just did a zombie movie in Australia which isn't anything to do this story but I was in Australia and so I'm in Australia my parents drive the camera where we were on the weekend to spend a day with me and fern I fancy my parents in six months or something so I'm spending time with my mum and dad now back in the early 90s my father was getting closer to retirement and then he found a credit card because my mother took care of the money found out that she had run up $90,000 worth of bills which meant my dad had to work an extra sort of eight years past retirement to pay these all off and she'd kept it all secret okay so now my parents have got to retirement they are in the house and they just get a pension of like Australian government gives each person like $300 a week pension which is like 260 American right so my parents live off that and then but my father takes care of all the money he pays all the bills and he bounced books because my mum can't be trusted when it comes to shopping and so I'm talking my parents my mum goes all I want is my half of the money here's half of the money and then we'll see can have his half of the money we'll split the bills and then I can do what I want with my money but instead I'm given an allowance because I'm not responsible everybody I said mum you can't take care of the money ma'am you can't cuz you'll fuck it up you'll go online you've you found internet shopping now you'll fuck it up you'll get rid of or credit cards you'll be terrible and she goes oh I'm not the problem with money anymore your father's the one that spends all the make now we're in a public bar by the way there's many people sitting around us it's a very public open area your father's the one who spends all the money now and then she points about angers tell him tell him what you spend your money on and I've already clicked what this won't be and I've gone oh no wait look I don't want to know I don't want to know and then my brother goes your father gets prostitutes right and I've gone oh just shut up both of you please four farms I God and she's gone yep every Wednesday your father before he goes to play lawn bowls goes off and gets himself a prostitute and then my dad went not every Wednesday not every Wednesday may seem sounds like at least three out of four Wednesday it takes a week off every now and again yeah like it cost him in Australia money for a very cheap prostitute it's legal in Australia in a brothel maybe a hundred bucks for a pretty low end sort of girl a rub-and-tug power so he went to a place to get it done he didn't no no it's not like he where you got to go to a hotel and I type of stuff there's just brothels and there they're very legal they're very well signposted and stuff it's not it's not such a big deal in Australia it actually makes it a bit safer if anything because the girls have to get tasted have to bring their results in all the time and they're playing it definitely makes it safer it's like everything else as soon as the government says it can't be a legal when it's something that people really enjoy doing Louis doesn't work substantially of course does oh shut up Jake it's like laughing I don't begrudge my dad for doing this I just don't want to hear about my mother they're in their 70s my mom is morbidly obese my dad's still quite fit of course he wants to get his end away sometimes you
