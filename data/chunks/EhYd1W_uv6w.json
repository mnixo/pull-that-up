the girag an experience if I was a young man I got an argument someone I would relive that argument like every day for like 10 minutes for like a year maybe I'll come back to it a year later yes fucking guy should've told that fucking either oh shit yeah well fuck you mr. you have to let go through your nose like what was I gonna say to him oh yeah I was gonna say that I just talked about this on stage this is totally true when I was I guess I was like 26 i live i was living in Encino and I rented this house and had an orange tree in the front yard I didn't pay my bills was very irresponsible so this guy came over I had to turn the power back on the guy came over to turn the power on and seemed like a nice guy said hey man those oranges are delicious if you want one go grab one and he goes oh ok thanks so the guy took nine fucking oranges i SAT there watching them like this motherfucker is taken more orange I can't believe this shit and to this day man I have to fight off the urge no no no about that story there three times did it's real like I was an asshole for it to this day I'll be in my car and I'm driving down the street i'll just go nine fucking oranges do really that was nineteen ninety-three did i tell you the story that alone told me I tell it on this podcast know the this shit like this never happens me and Piven one time flew to we're gonna fight to a mayweather fight and we get on the plane and fucking Stallone is waiting for somebody come on in Maloney's alright I guess we're going to a fight with Stallone it's great thing about Stallone he knows what his good stories ours he you know I mean he like knows what people want to hear about they want to hear about Rocky they want to hear about fucking they want to hear it so he's talking about he was directing the movie staying alive oh uh yeah I remember that yeah he was in it was a Travolta movie that that Frank Stallone sang on the soundtrack is correct um so this is the yeah yes so Stallone said that he he goes to go so I I called John up to the house for a meeting about to get that song will play that song while the story's going Frank Stallone this is the end I think it's called this is the end and I'm staying alive soundtrack he goes he goes so John came up and he goes John's got a real food issue people don't know though and it goes so well though so he goes John comes up we're sitting at the table he goes now my wife had made some homemade fudge that day so we sit at the table my wife puts out some fudge travolta proceeds to eat the entire plate of fudge oh yeah this fucking guy over he goes which first of all is fucking rude which is fucking made me laugh my head off of that was like that he hasn't forgotten that he that's his orange door does it was that is that dangerous when you have a situation like that and you know your guy is going to face him is that is it dangerous is in any way like to have that attitude to go into because Glover doesn't have that attitude right he doesn't mean as much as he likes and he's there to do the job Travis yeah glove was there did job and clover didn't have the closeness that we did to him because he came Kyle came around more when Glover was on his hiatus to Brazil hmm so he didn't have quite the closest he really liked him but I mean the the MMA spirit and I'll take out an M the M a spirit martial arts is just so different than boxing which is I mean technically a martial art too but they just don't carry themselves most of them like martial artists right carry themselves like more like thugs or just and they don't have the same camaraderie I mean I have a picture of a Sylar of his fight in in Kentucky I didn't know I forgot the guy's name really tough strong wrestler he lost a close decision it was his last fight but they were actually the the day before the fight at the weigh-in they were there hanging out playing video games together like huddled together and I was and I didn't know who that guy was at first I walked over hey what's up man what's your name and he's like so and so I go aren't you guys fighting tomorrow and they yeah yeah coach we just got hold up we got to finish this game and they hung out for like two hours at the weigh-in and then the day of the fight they were like hanging out in the dress room and then they went out and put on a brutal I mean it was a very brutal fight it was a good fight in as a bruiser they didn't hold back anything they definitely fought yeah it was Dennis from you guys who's a great guy as well yeah he's a bit and I mean and that's the camaraderie you don't see that in boxing and MMA you see it more than you don't what do you think about Bitcoin what do you think about crypto currencies what do you think about emerging Elsie's look there are a lot of people um that are libertarian or some people that believe in hard money they're people that believe in goal that are in Bitcoin and you know I think that you know a lot of people who you know bought Bitcoin a few years ago and you know I didn't buy it and sure you know i wish i had bought them because i would be selling them now in fact i would have already sold them so I jumped it already oh yeah why is that because I think it's I think it's a bubble I think that I think that bitcoins 34 app so you here with vegas casinos to casinos just started accepting bitcoins yeah but you know I think merchants starting to accept bitcoins are actually going to be negative for bitcoins not positive well yeah well here's why you know when bitcoins went up from Penny's a coin to a thousand dollars right you know you really couldn't do much with them except whoredom so before you go their way I'm sorry i sorry to interrupt you but explain to me what is it actually worth what is a bitcoin is worth whatever somebody will give you for it I mean it has no actual value because you can't do anything with it okay all you can do is give it to somebody else so is it in one's it means it in one Bitcoin to bitcoins well what is the volume what is the they usually sell them in for one Bitcoin but you can pay you can break a Bitcoin up into like a hundred thousand peaks of it ok but give me how much is a pizza how many bitcoins is a pizza well a fraction because right now an entire well an entire Bitcoin right now about nine hundred fifty dollars so how many pizzas you can get a pizza is like nine dollars fifty cents you get 100 pizza they don't have any other thing other than a Bitcoin that's it it's just a Bitcoin well I mean you can get Bitcoin I mean you can get you know fractional coins you want to buy a whole coin yeah but they need to figure it out that you have to have like nickel quarter no it's just Bitcoin you have dollars an hour a deca deca coin is sent to coin out okay so it's the exact opposite of pesos like a million pesos like a dollar but the important thing is that you can't do anything with it you know there's no actual value with you collect drugs right now right well you kill road yes but you you can spend it as long as somebody is willing to take it right but there's no end user there's no it's not a commodity lysol the same with our currency currently yeah walk currency is crap I'm like you know what a bit coin is crap in our currencies creo the difference between the crap the government issues and bitcoins is the crap the government issues for now is legal tender I can you know people accept it I can pay my taxes in it i mean i have a use for it right but it's the government's saying it's legal tender man isn't the government enforced being someone who's so anti-government as you assume that yes my own goal but you would enjoy something like Bitcoin but then one house but it has no real value I recognize that it could collapse I don't there's nobody agrees is of value isn't there a value just like we did well with all about tomorrow everybody can agree there's no value see row gold was valuable long before it became money Bitcoin had no value until it became money but I don't think it can withstand the test of time you
