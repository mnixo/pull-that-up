four three two one howl Donegan ladies and gentlemen that's right baby headphones are no headphones headphones grab them right there be a goddamn professional sir yeah that uh where'd you get that yeah yeah was notice she like she answers herself my sister she yeah I'm very politically correct yeah but she'll be like yeah sure I went I botched um Jimmy Choos yeah yeah I caught my share yeah so she's like I think she spends a lot of time alone maybe and she's yeah crazy answering herself what is going on with her voice because she didn't have that voice when she was Bruce it's a different voice is it I thought it was like pretty similar it's like what's different small high or something it's like numb like her face is numb broche wish I thought she was I watched you did you see your show I am Cait she had like a reality show huge bomb I mean you know how much of a boring person you have to be wouldn't how interesting is like an ex Olympic athlete turns into a woman and you're so boring still no one wants to see that show yeah she needed a better producer it seems like put her in interesting situations that she's going from is boring like I watched it I tried to watch it it was boring I feel like there's I just feel like they've missed the formula look that is a fascinating situation how did until they're 60 years old and then becomes a man yeah how could that show not do well how could it I think what happened was she wasn't open about what her transition it wasn't about that oh she didn't really talk about you know she she doesn't believe in gay marriage that that's when I like I was on her side and they're like yeah she's a you know why not Porter I mean what how she said well karma tradition was yeah I'm a traditional girl shall yeah and that one is very maybe one of the wittiest very witty and she wear like this well how she was completely lost for words yeah because it's it makes no sense it's well Ellen held her feet to the fire and their big feet she burned those feet I'd have my seventeen Jimmy Choo shove the fire order those custom right oh yeah no way around sure I am you know for her to be against any group that yeah she's been she knows what it feels like to be shunned or yeah unbelievable it's just crazy she's just decided that she's a woman yeah a Republican gentleman L lesbians growl but she's a lesbian now yeah but now I gave man baby does she her she's dating a trans Jesus my exhaust what is happening imagine if you were a man okay and then you became a woman and you dated a woman who became a man what in the fuck is happening you're like you're like one of those yin-yang spinning through space yeah and then you're like gay marriage is gross like I'm gonna judge that it's it's they need to cut her brain up and and figure out what's what's going on there's a lot of confusion and a lot of wanting to fit in and a lot of you know it it just doesn't make any sense and I really like people going through that and I doubt what a you know hurt anyone's feelings I just think she's she's kind of an asshole oh this is her friend girlfriend oh so the girlfriend used to be a boy too yes fascinating that is Wow wait a minute girlfriend used to be a boy that's what she she look like oh Christ the world is so strange and then she's like I just she's not a great person I mean she killed that lady with her car and then said nothing like that was the weird you see the footage no she it looks completely her fault she bumped into this lady who was stopped and the lady went across traffic and died yeah and no one talked about it like I was you know putting on my Lancome in the mirror didn't share is that what she said no nothing she was looking at her phone yeah I don't want to see this uh-oh I'm gonna feel bad yeah some poor lady died and no one no one gives a fuck because the story is not that the story is she's a woman now she's always been a woman she's always been a woman I mean it was good timing for her because people like ignored that and sort of went well it's crazy timing that was Bruce yeah that video that you did of that why did you start doing these videos I'll tell you I was having like midlife crisis panic waking up at 3:00 in the morning like real moments I was writing for the show was last year and it's crows great job every was really nice and I liked something in my subconscious felt like I I don't know like I had to get out and I I quit the job and I was like I'm just gonna make videos on Instagram like what what a great business move let me lose my health insurance and make videos for free on Instagram dude you have the funniest page on Instagram what does thank you I haven't seen them all but if all the ones I've seen without a doubt you're the funniest page well thank you very very much I mean I went because of you from like 20,000 I know like 240 something that's awesome view and you know and Tom cigarette and wells are also like it's just how good they are man it's one of its viral once once people watch a few of those dude the one that you did where she was describing the different utensils that she uses to get herself off with a weed whacker oh my god oh yeah my girl she helped me I gotta finish so when did you start doing the Face Swap thing because is it you're using face yeah a swap app you can download and there's one for the Trump I just I was doing Trump at first and I don't look anything like him so this was like a way to do write a character never gonna be Daniels what terrific story how'd you get my number okay oh the other one that made me cry was Kim Kardashian and Trump what Kim couldn't figure out how to open up the door yes for it wait for the buzzer there's the weird buzzing noise that's when you push it uh those are takes so long I don't think so I'm making videos you in the door closed yeah you're gonna push it it's a locked yeah weird ill that buzz you okay pushing why don't you open it there was a weird buzzing noise get that meets that beads open the door it's a balk you have to what you have to wait until I buzz you Jesus Christ but I just got here now go in the door but I can't go in the door it's a solid holy shit this would have been a lot funnier if I was in it oh that's what I do with my time my throne man hmm yeah you're an actual full-grown man I'm an old grown man I'm a man boy so you really just decided to start doing these full-time it's just like it wasn't even like a brave decision or anything I really couldn't sleep I was having panic attacks that I was I think I saw my future and it was like I'm gonna be a writer and writing for people for the rest of my life you get addicted the money and yeah it happens just so many common it happens like I and I heard about it I didn't see it coming and it just I suddenly woke up last summer I'm like I have to stop or I'll do this forever there are a few friends of mine who are really really funny comics and they can't work because they spent so many years doing sitcoms as a writer or doing sketch shows as a writer that they don't have a following yeah they'll have a following in the road but they're world-class comedians yeah do you know Owen Smith yeah he's fucking hilarious nobody knows who he is I'm like dude you're one of the 20 best comics in the world yeah it's crazy nice great guy Ian Edwards same shit ya mean more people known to Ian now than before but God it's a charge no it's a fucking trap you've only so much creative energy yeah and if you're giving it someone else you're done it's not just that you're tired all day you're stuck in an office and then you have to go on the road like if you want to be a comic you have to do sets multiple times a week and you got to go on the road it's just the way it is there's no way around it yeah there's no other way to do it if you get new fifties and you're not famous you don't have a decent following like your fuck you're screwed you're fucked yeah you're fucked unless you're on white like Ron White got famous it is late 40s he was living in Mexico in his 40s oh really like I've done and then Jeff Foxworthy contacted him and they started doing that Blue Collar Comedy Tour boom no private jet ballin out of control yeah big fat house in Beverly Hills whoo sweet whoa Rodney Dangerfield - yeah well he quit 50 he quit doing stand-up was selling aluminum siding oh that's right and then came back but the entire time he was away he was writing which is really crazy so he came back with a fuck load of material mm-hmm and also came back with a sharper style like came more edited more precise yeah you know and yeah that's where it changed I feel like I can't believe how old I got like you don't notice it and if anyone's listening they're like in their 20s you know you I'm 40 I just turned 47 I'm 50 yeah yeah you're real further along let me career wise so I'm not I'm I was worried about you you don't wake up with night terrors do you but you did huh yeah I really did when and there's certain moments like you know you don't think about being old but like like you and you put the your date of birth in online to buy something that that's scroll scrolling forever life going by you born in 70 71 yeah it's good year for cars you're the pig last good year for cars is that true yeah what about a Tesla no no I mean muscle cars like my American muscle cars yeah like the 1960s to the 1919 71 1971 was essentially the last good year for cars yeah we like must be me and Joel are like both ripped but you know to shit those classic American cars there was a few years where they were unbelievably cool and then after like 71 they fell apart so you just none he caught it at the perfect time that's I mean that's what I'm known for being born right at the end of muscle cars there's 71 Barracuda tells probably the last your big car guy huh I love cars yeah I do too but I Drive a Honda Civic that's what I can afford well I had a Honda Civic once too yeah yeah they're great they start up every time you need them too yeah I've had it for fucking shit those cars every time you put that key in there's no confusion no problem it's no worry no anticipation come on baby country like crap yeah it doesn't matter those things are bulletproof yeah they last forever I enough Toyotas I have a Lexus I love those things they never fuck up I'm on the waiting list for the Lexus hmm no I'm sorry Tesla Oh which one the three who knew that cheaper one the three yeah three yeah but it's still like suspiciously expensive do you see what's going on with Tesla and the formula employee some employee was was sabotaging code and leaky information now the employee is saying that you know trying to say something about the Elan musk because there was waste that he was a whistleblower he's not saying he's a saboteur ease of whistleblower but they were saying he's a disgruntled employee because he owed money it's become this gigantic thing and Elon Musk is suing this guy stealing code and then giving it accepted no I don't know the exact specifics of it but he did something did something bad no no we hate that guy we know like oh well that car is like it's like it's 35 grand but if you want tires it's 45 oh it's you can get it 75 grand right yeah if you want a Tesla you know yeah I just need I need my I'm thinking think of a starting like a fun so I can get a Tesla you people have like charity if I go fund me page on well yeah just commit to doing one of those videos every X amount of days I'm hearing about that I gotta get into the business side of things but that's the problem is creative people rarely our business minded I'm spending like four dollars a month on just phone calls I'm not making to like AT&T and stuff I need to like yeah get my my business side in order what do you mean you know like you keep you get a subscription to something you don't use anymore and then you don't you can't figure out how to cancel it like a lot that's happening in my life that's that's what they want yeah they're good at that I'm gonna make it difficult for you to quit yeah like they'll go hey have these vitamins you have one month free and then before you get the vitamins you have to cancel in order to stop the next month from being charged is I'm saying oh you know look I'm up on my photography let's move on sorry no it's okay talking about I get it yeah so when you do these videos how many how many hours you think are involved in like like the Kanye one the one the most recent which is fucking hilarious thank you I am I've gotten quicker Adam but it still takes inordinate amount of time probably cuz there's like I get the idea Nick I'll write something quick and then like I'll sleep on it and then I'll go working a little more try to edit it down because you want to make it like pretty tight with like online people don't want a minute fluff or anything so you got to go quick yeah and the actual process of getting them to talk I'll take the person who talks the most like if it's Caitlyn and I'll film that and I'll have the whole script written out so as I film it in my mouth I'll talk the other words so the timing is kind of closely yeah and then I'll send that video to myself to my or drop it to my laptop and turn it really low and they don't do the next character and have that playing so I can have that synced up right and I hear those they do the next person with that whoa got a lot of time in my hands yeah but I'm only 47 so so what was the thought process when you quit you just couldn't do it like you had to you had to get out yeah I I just something was like panicking it just was I think seeing my life and going I I want to at least try to be like a performers why would I wanted to do I can't even read very well being a writer to me as it's not as fun I mean if I didn't have the experience before and like I don't think I'd feel this way it's just I got a taste you know I had some stuff that I did that I really enjoyed you know it just I think I just saw the the trappings of it well some people are really good writers and that's what they want to do that's all the I wanna do they don't want to perform but the problem with being a good performer is sometimes you can help other people out like hey maybe if you just tighten this up here and like maybe if you just explain this a little better it would work better and you know you start writing next thing you know like hey would you work on my show sure yeah and you're there in the office and you're got a corkboard and you're putting index cards up and you're like oh my god yeah and then I'm get that check every week and you're like that's a nice check sweet and I I'm really thankful for those jobs never they're really great and they I can you know yeah I have a house and stuff but yet this is like last Powerdrive I think if this doesn't work out with Instagram I mean just this though I'm really excited because now I can do little theaters like the draw directly from Instagram has enabled me to like get out of you know clubs and stuff so it worked and the I feel the audience I just did shows in San Francisco and it's such a difference when the audience knows what you do and who you are yeah instead of like having to you know take them through this well you might be one of the only guys that's done it that way though through characters in little short one-minute videos yeah because I really I started off with that but then there was no money and sketch really you know and so I got into stand-up because I needed to make money and so I felt stand-up was what I did the best but now I feel like I'm getting a little better at stand-up and I'm actually enjoying it more now but the characters and impressions is when you do shows do you ever play videos do you play I did a show I wish you a Largo that I do like every couple months and I did show videos it was the owners idea and that was you know really fun it's a great idea yeah especially if you make some videos specific to the show that's exactly I didn't do that but but watch you know like that's what I should do like have Trump be like next step is terrific yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you know have Caitlyn Jenner's take on different things yeah baby and just you know Caitlyn's tips Caitlyn's caption I did a thing where she I brought her out like in between is she's a work on her one-person show was just the idea so like that greatest love and when I had the all like audience surfed it was really fun oh yeah I mean you you could do easily like some sort of a multimedia presentation type thing yeah that seems like it would be a really great idea yeah I'm trying to put together something cuz to do like some kind of special yeah oh fuck yeah yeah just sandwich bits in between you know like toots do some stand-up and go you know and you know like you know I wonder I wonder what stormy Daniels would do or you know it's just yeah you could any weird way Donny decide to yeah transition where did you get the story Daniels voice is seven anything like I mean I have no idea at all I just thought you look like math Oh can't wait to get your cock in my mouth again she's called she actually sounds nothing like that I'm sure yeah but it doesn't matter but she seems like she talked like that for me oh my god there was one that you did that looked like your face you played kushner was that it like me he's like but all of our face swap none of them are you I do a character Craig that's like oh that guy with the glasses yeah Graham yeah checking Matt that's my real mom probably know that really yeah oh that's hilarious she's a good actress the first take she didn't know what I was doing and that was like real and honest but after that like I told she knew she was like acting she's very good oh yeah it seems like you're annoying the shit out of your mom yeah it's very funny yeah so when you decided to do this there's no reai mean unless you're a hot chick selling whatever what do they sell sunglasses or some shitty makeup TD toxic skin et detochkin et yeah unless you're I've never made a fucking penny off of Instagram I mean neither have I you haven't either well I've actually just ticket sales I have I guess right right right yeah but yeah I haven't monetized or I've been thinking about that I just kind of I feel good if people like it just makes me feel like I have some purpose or something yeah I feel like I've done something and building if I could build an audience and that come to my shows I'll be really happy about that so you were doing mostly clubs before and now you're moving into theatres is that what yeah yeah this is all over the last four set from Instagram that's incredible it does so it worked here's that story well I mean it's working it's working yeah yeah that's fucking great it's really exciting and thank you again I mean my personal Santa Claus dude my fucking whole family's so sick of watching your video my wife got angry the other she was in the toilet I was like just watch I opened the door goes watch this watch this one watch this one cuz with the Kanye West when I was crying she's like what the fuck are you laughing at and I was like watch this just watch this yeah Kanye West my worst impression when when it came like shut the fuck up cam he's a genius God can check genius at work yeah I can yeah the other one the other one about the baby dying in her womb was preggers yeah I'm pregnant Oh babies could breathe in the womb yeah shoving them up my new vag dad do you have a womb oh shit let me go crap this out it's probably dead but then they go immediately to the lipstick oh oh it's just so perfect because like Instagram it's almost like you have optimized Instagram better than anybody you really have nailed it you've nailed it for comedy does everybody else like mine included if you go to my Instagram you have to fucking dig to find out I'm a comedian and you got to go looking around yeah you know you can find anything there all kinds of I just take a picture I find a picture I think it's cool I put it up there there's no rhyme or reason that yours is like a show like your Instagram page Kyle Dunnigan one you gotta go to one my Neff there was a kyle donnie he's gotten all my gmail accounts he grabbed everything and I asked my nephew Mike what shit cuz over Christmas I'm like I'm just gonna do in scrim videos and see what happens and I was like what should I do different he's like should take the one out it's stupid yeah the ones are yeah it's stupid why'd you change it now how about the real guy I don't know that's the thing marketing is not my thing though I am Kyle Dunnigan that's another what's another one people do that Kyle done in comedy would have been fine hmm that's a good one but it's a lot of words a lot of letters yeah it's I think in scrimmages like in my wheelhouse like I like to edit I like to do quick you know stuff ya know it's perfect but you but your channel your page like a channel unlike most people's Instagram pages yeah treat it like a show yeah it is like a show it's almost like you should have a regular Instagram that you shouldn't even you just keep doing what you're doing because you make those long-form videos now for Instagram TV did you go Dyke up to an hour oh yeah that's right but I think what he's doing is perfect Instagram TV yes a new thing just came out oh boy oh boy I just got a panic attack an hour of Caitlyn for an hour 45 more manage everybody I just spilled coffee all over the studio okay you're not gonna I do it all the time no laptops I killed a bunch of laptops man that's nothing about Mac that pisses me off guess what Lenovo you spill on it nothing happens nothing they make them waterproof they make them dust resistant they make a milspec we need to spill on them you can throw a glass of water in the keyboard not a goddamn thing happens you put one an apple they just tell you nope you need a new one new new one we need a lot more napkins it's okay so if you sneeze on it it'll blow out sons of bitches want to go grab some napkins hey grab a couple of those kill cliff's those lime ones mmm I'm very uncoordinated dude you're not just I do this all the time I'm pretty coordinated and I fucking spill coffee in here all the time see you know it's your microphones in front of you start moving your hands what is your background mostly Italian one-quarter Irish I'm the same thing shut the fires people are cool that's crazy you do 23andme I did that no I'm doing it right now and I'm doing a bit about it because I'm secretly hoping that someone in my past had sex with a black person I have I'm hoping 2.7% really nice but I think it's northern Africa let's all take it I'll take it and I'm gonna run with it it'll open up a whole new realm of material yeah just bring your 23andme and I'll wipe you and it's a start shitting on my people so hard to be a white guy that's the hardest thing to be like man you have no one to blame you know it's always that's true your fault but it's also the easiest thing to be of course I'm just you know I know you're kidding you have to say you're kidding you're fucking comedian how dare you hey you're still cleaning you don't have to clean anymore man I'm still cleaning this is I keep the thing is the more coffee that's on this table the better it looks it's gonna smell good yeah there's this thing's weathered this is a weather table the garbage shine thanks this this coffee has character or this table rather character high-maintenance no you're fine dude so you gotta have some measure of satisfaction that this moment that you had that cozy I love stories like that because you have this moment we like I can't I got to do something I can't do this anymore and then you did and it worked yeah I I'm really I'm sleeping a lot better and you know I had you know been in this business for a long time and there's been so many I'm I could talk for nine hours about the disappointments but I still feel lucky you know that I got you know I was able to like make a living or whatever but there's some luck involved I mean I was lucky you came across it and I mean I've had so many I wish I knew who told me about you I wish I could remember it might have been Tom Tom yeah Tom probably was Tom he was pretty it was a comic pretty sure as a comic it might have been Tom he was the first one to repost one of mine I think maybe that's what it was I did this show well I have so many disaster still where I thought I was like get ready for the rocket ship Kyle you better go mansion shopping because things are about to take off and just always something I did this jamie foxx like sketch show pilot and it like to get a part on a you know Network show it's a lot of auditions it's you climb a mountain to get the role and I was like feeling like this is my last shot and everything and I got there and we couldn't we weren't allowed to write for ourselves what is a WGA rules or something and you know you have a character no one else can really write for it and the people that were writing to of them just got out of prison and they were not comedy writers like Jamie if I see it's a huge career here I'm really I think he just was like let me give my friends this cuz I got all this other stuff I just didn't give a fuck I need it no you would show up like once a week no yeah really yeah he's busy and you'd come in he come in with glasses like che and we couldn't we'd read the script and there'd be no ending or seemingly point and then one time he threw the script in the air was like fuck that script do you you do you you know when he walked out and the executives like no you can't do you it was like that it was like he climb this mountain there's an Arby's at the top just like oh yeah who's gonna be these writers called me into their office once and they were like you know we had this idea for it these these guys who never wrote sketch before and their look is I did like your your Jimmy bond James Bond your Jimmy bond alright and you're you're in an airplane right and like to take it take it in the next I'd be like yeah and you order like a soda like a like a coca-cola or a sprite or like a any point that I gotta go Mountain Dew that Mountain Dew or die coke and I'm like uh-huh and then that was it and then I I just was sitting there dead silence what and then we had like the show which came out very media was a sketch it was it called it was called in to flow it got changed to like something else and it just became like it was a fee on Crockett's show I was like a hot like a cast member or whatever and then at the end you know Fox pays all this millions of dollars and avions going all Fox cares about their wallets but we showed them not realizing we had to wait for a pickup and I'm just standing on stage thinking this is my last shot to have anything cuz I was already like 40 and I just was like then we go to the wrap party and the whole thing was just me and Eric Andre's on to okay so we just were like what's happening and we go late to the wrap party and we walk in this nice restaurant and Jamie Foxx is standing up and into the whole big table and he's going down what's your favorite animal what's your favorite animal it was like goose I mean a rabbit like it was what's your second favorite animal what's your second paper because the first animals who you think you are the second animals who you really are I told Tom Cruise that and he said it was awesome Instagram yeah I'm gonna write a book one day I just called humiliated a long career of ground balls I've had so many like where I really was going shopping for houses it had to stop really except for like I had this Pizza Hut campaign which was like get ready to like open up several bank accounts and it was like the big New York of Pizza hey you know there's an explosion of flavors as a shooting nine oh there's a campaign of videos 9/11 happened as we're shooting the explosion and it looks like it was just the wrong vibe to decay New York a big explosion of flavors this whole thing so they canceled the whole thing they played like I don't know if like a month they played a few and then they like dropped it but it was like you know it was I shop for I got paid like pretty old but but we're gonna do six more it was gonna be like one of those flow from you guys I was a hot guy of Subway yeah for pizza yeah thought you were gonna be the Verizon can you hear me now guy because that's what I was waiting for that trust that guy anymore no I don't switch to is it wears yeah now sprint that's not cool yeah I don't hear you as well my my mother walked into a Pizza Hut once well this campaign was happening and and she just pointed I mean she was my son's Pizza Hut oh I'm actually not Pizza Hut anyway so I feel lucky but but but you found the thing like look dude your fucking videos make me howl they're really really funny like that's that you you for whatever did the way your mind works it works best for these Face Swap videos which is fucked up man because it didn't exist yet like when was it like two years how long ago how many years ago three years ago remember I'm the first person ever so use it was Chris D'Elia D'Elia was he did some video where he was Rick from the walking dead yeah and he put it on his Instagram page I was like wow I'm like obviously I can tell something's going on but that's amazing how close that is yeah I was excited right away because I knew that the impressions that I do I don't look like most of them dude your Trump is fucking phenomenal and when you do it with that wacky fade to one face that you picked for the face was so perfect yeah because it looks like he's out of control amazing ears up it's amazing did you see that what's going on today Tom Arnold who hates Trump a new show on Vice where he's just running around trying to find incriminating video and audio on trouble that's all he's the whole show is him on a quest to find incriminating and humiliating video and audio on Trump and he was with Michael Cohen today what yes how could he Michael Cohen is apparently gonna work with Tom Arnold well on this show who is he is the FBI okay with that yeah they were together this photo I mean Tom Arnold could be just bullshitting yeah well I'm tivoing that yeah that's coming out you're still tivoing why don't you get out the VCR do you know how to work the client I had things come out of my mouth where it shows my age what is this video on Twitter this is on Tom Arnold the Miss Universe tape there's another tape Celebrity Apprentice [Music] don't worry Tom Arnold is on it and I'm Tom Arnold for the chump tapes with Tom Arnold I mean no one's gonna care no matter what he no one that's not gonna have an effect probably yeah listen fuck John Gotti Trump is a Teflon gone you see that movie they're saying they scammed Rotten Tomatoes was that supposed to be the greatest movie of all time we'll get a zero Haiti from the audience and like 90% was from like there Chloe yeah thinking that there's on the mic well when was that take this is a correction some sort of correction he didn't say me and him were teaming up to take down Donald Trump Michael has enough Trump on his plate I'm the crazy person who said me and Michael Cohen were teaming up to take down Trump of course I meant it Michael doesn't get paid by Vice okay thank you Tom for correcting the record okay thanks Pam thanks for clearing that up Tom that's why I feel like if I was Tom Arnold I'd be nervous as fuck why I don't want to get killed Oh No impossible impossible you can't kill Tom Arnold what if Putin did it for a favor Putin might be able to do it put some wages decides I don't like what you're doing with mom today good Eve land this is not that good Russian accent would you consider doing a Putin on your page oh I will yes that's a good idea it's a great idea what is the Russian that is the Russian accent is this good yes not bad just to just listen to him talked a few times and you'd get it I'm Putin that's good and then a bunch of really harsh Russian prostitutes like water squirt so over video that's it next week yeah I mean that's not a bad idea for a sketch is there a pee tapers that a that a rumor do we not know this isn't I don't know I don't think it's supposed to be real I think it's supposed to be fake I it sounds fake it just sounds like something someone would just make up like not even well planned out who how many what percentage of people like to be peed on it's got to be below 1% that's still a lot he's 300 million people that means three million people like to get peed on that's just in this country alone that's a lot of pee cleanup I don't even think it's 1% but even if it's 1/10 of 1% its 300,000 people look I love a chocolate sundae but if you smeared it all over the place and after to clean up I probably yeah I'm not into that yeah what do you what do you into it's a freakish thing you're - I'm surprisingly tame I'm not into anything freaky I've never even done like whipped cream or anything mmm hot what about when a girl asks you to like choke or a little how do you feel about that um that's a scariet request I'm not into that I'm not um I had a girl that I used to date who wanted me to rape her she told me the raper that's that's tongue and problem when she was fucking hot and I was like I do not want to get interested in doing this like the right thing would be you really like yeah because I was in my 20s what if what if I just have a connection I got into like only girls that want you to like force them to do shit that's that's very true when you are young and you're forming your sexuality whatever you first got your like when I first danced with a girl and I noticed her hips were wide I I got like a boner and there's like in eighth grade it was like this is she's different and it linked and for years till I was like it may early thirties I could not dance with a girl without getting a hard-on I was at a wedding once and I asked this girl to like I never do this but she was like alone and she was hot and I got a dance for my mother's there and I got like boner I don't know this girl at all and I had to tell her because you know you know like your wedding pants are not keeping things and they know and so full pitched and I she probably already knew so I was like I'm sorry can you help me off off the floor and I had to how humiliating is this I did ask this girl to like shimmer me off the floor away from honey yeah she had a good luckily good sense of humor about it but it was humiliating well that's not what she well I shouldn't say she should be flattered but a good sense of humor would be flattered she needed her Halloween party after that which is new time but that would went bad I got all dressed up as the universe like I worked yeah I'd like a whole black outfit I glued like planets to my body with Velcro yeah grown man and then I go to her house on time which I didn't realize you don't go to parties on time I just got into LA and then I went and I went to hug her I knocked over the skeleton on the wall and her dog ran up and like bit Venus off my leg and took off and now I'm just in the room and no one's dressed up people are coming and they're like have a bad day it's like I'm a pirate but no one's really dressed up except for me so I was a pariah and then no one talked me except with the at the end this guy cuz all our friends were like frat guys he goes I asked you a question and I was like yeah like I know someone's talking he goes you faggot no like really yeah as like now I mean this all started with me getting a boner with this girl but anyway I gotta go Jesus Christ what a dick yeah he was kind of a dick was he dick before that yeah they were all kind of like jockey jockey and they were drunk and I think I seemed like a target cuz I had the universe on my body seem like anything oh yeah yeah but that's that's a severe weakness mmm unless you were doing something I mean they why wouldn't they think that was funny like what are you doing man what's with the outfit and then you start talking you start laughing every other yeah yeah we would had a good time yeah you went right over your Ferger oh yeah you know that's funny though the boner thing yeah because there's a girl that I dated when I was in high school and she she was into like rubbing her feet on me and I had a foot thing for a long time yeah that's because of it what where was she from her feet on my back I meant like were you at your house no Google yeah whatever she would just rub her feet on my legs and put her feet on my girlfriend's yeah okay yeah I used to go to this math class 10:30 ugly teacher but her smell boner every time I gotta go get a boner that is a real thing about like getting connected to like an a particular like thing like whether it's choking someone or any of that guy hurt the girl wanted me to rape her also would grab my hand and put it on the back of oh I get me to force her head down oh she was crazy hmm she was just really into it yeah but it took a while for her to warm up it's almost like when we first started fooling around she's like no one told us motherfucker what I like yeah normal then one day she wanted to Russell okay yeah she's like the gateway drugs like what she's like one of Russell yeah I bet I'll kick your ass I was like fuck are you talking about like what are you doing I didn't I didn't beat her out but I was trying to figure out what we're doing while we're doing it look and she turned in sexual oh yeah she got into it yeah I think like like louis c.k i like i remember his show like one of the first episodes he had a show look an older girl asked him to jerk off in front of her and I was always like I bet that actually happened and that got linked up you can't really decide what links up your sexuality and what it is it turns you on it just could have I I have no information but that's my guess people aren't a weird shit man what are in a weird shit I think the weirdest is this is the smelling the shoes Oh Marla maples Trump's ex put a camera in her bedroom because she kept in her closet cuz she kept loot she did have one shoe and it was some friend would come in the guy that caught him just like just coming in and the stealing sniffing her she's just Christ does that get linked up Oh anyway yeah there's a lot of that stuff right like stealing underwear stealing shoes yeah thing is I mean men get picked on cuz we're pervs and that's it's true but if we weren't pervs this species wouldn't be here let me tell you why yes we were down to like 70,000 people if we didn't have this super perv gym to go through the snow get some pussy I think it's less than 70,000 people they were saying that after one of the super volcanoes it might have gotten down to us just a few thousand yeah well there's a definitely what is it Sumatra is that where it was Indonesia some some massive supervolcano 70,000 years ago killed off almost everybody oh I didn't know about that yeah it got we got down to extremely low number I think they estimate it's somewhere between like 2 and maybe like 10,000 people yeah you need people who like to fuck a lot that a real curve eating curvy jump that up well you know Brett Weinstein who is a hmm he was a professor who's you sorry you know what's going on means I smoked weed before the show well not gonna lie to you people he was explaining with his wife who's also a biologist that there's two different things that men are attracted to they're attracted to a beautiful woman but they're attracted to a hot woman like a hot woman doesn't necessarily have to be beautiful but what she does is offer an opportunity for like very quick sex like you could just have sex with her you don't have to court her like a girl with a short skirt and her tits are popping out and she's wearing a lot of makeup mmm that what that signals is that there's an opportunity for you to spread your genes and you have no responsibility you wouldn't have to take care of it you would have to you wouldn't have to spend a lot of time with her court her that she was she's the type of person that allows you to just fuck her you can spread your genes elsewhere that makes sense yeah that there's a like an evolutionary reason for that being a stimulating thing for men like for men like this idea of like these loose women like loose women are very attracted very attractive to us for that reason it's not just that like oh yeah if I can get some not deal with all these bitches in there problem no it's literally an evolutionary trait that we have adapted to the disease thing knocks it back a little bit for me yeah I'll go like my disease their anecdote and antidote for because I I don't feel like there's any woman who could no matter how hot like come and and and and take me away or like forced me to like what am I trying to say seduce me well here they don't think a woman could seduce you know if I don't want her to I have an anecdote anecdote I have an antidote okay and it's I've been development over years and people that can listening could take this if you like let's say you fell for somebody and she like and she dumped you and you're still pining over her right you put her first you'd like think about like the blood moving through her body and her and her skeleton and you put her on the toilet you think about like she's making bio I know it's gross but that's you think about her as this animal and you think about her on the toilet and you whenever she pops up you put her on the toilet you're welcome that doesn't work with me it will I won't care no no no if I think she's hot what if she's really struggling on the toilet I struggle on the toilet so you cannot rent oh I take I eat a lot man I take some horrific shits but think about like the Bachelorette or something there there fantasize a lot of times like early on there's this fantasy and and you know you're married yes so you're you have there's intimacy and you get past all that but that early on fantasy make filling in the blanks as a perfect person you usually leave that out I never bothered me I don't I don't give a fuck about periods what about things gal anything does that kind of go oh yeah Alton if you just imagine there's a skeleton underneath this woman I'm like pining over she's just like doesn't work on me it works really tell you man if I think someone's hot I think there are don't care if it just took a diary hush shit how about this I imagine they have bad breath they'll be like a bitch is bad breath um I tell her mmm Oh your eye see I just say listen I'd say something really nice you're hot and I'm gonna tell you something compliment sandwich you start with a nice thing and then then you go out against yourself or go sometimes I get bad breath and because I'm a person everybody gets bad breath but when I get bad breath I want someone to tell me absolutely I do not want to be wandering around gross nobody like hey hey good to talk to you Jose they turn the head yeah tell me I don't know I'll take a Listerine stripper I'll chew gum or whatever the fuck some people good so tell her but some people have an app like here's an example I was with this girl and I could not take the breath couldn't take it that bad and then I said hey let's brush our teeth it was either it was either you gotta go I can't do this or I've got to figure out how to brush our teeth so she brushed her teeth reluctantly oh my god reluctantly say I hate brushing my teeth clearly but it didn't fix it at all like it was coming from her guts like you know what that happens to a lot of girls who a bulimic or yes even anorexic do they GERD they regurgitate bodies all fucked up yeah your body's like super confused yeah there's the data girl puked I didn't know and to like like deep into the relationship yeah it's a couple months and then I found out she was saying like if she eats too much they'll force herself to throw up and I was like why it's easy to hide that is I not I mean I knew it existed but I didn't know anybody who had it you know and that's a disturbing thing like you eat you're hungry so you eat and you're like what have I done yeah yeah shove things in your mouth ha and force it to come up again on you did you just talk about our to that cliff and the relationship he moved away no no no she brought it up um and I said well sure that this was the fucked up thing was she wasn't in any way overweight I she was beautiful she had a great body she just it was just like a weird she was an actress you know and I think that that Pratt the pressure that gig is just so crazy yeah it's just first of all you take someone who most of time the reason why we want to become an actor is because they didn't get enough attention that's a lot of what causes it especially if you have like this weird sort of nonspecific desire for fame it's not like you you're a really good character actress you know you're a fade done away or something like that you're just really good at you love the craft of creating a character no there's a lot of them that just want to be famous and why why is that it's usually there's something fucked up from childhood usually somebody wasn't paying attention to them parents split up something went wrong right yeah so you take this person that's super insecure and this is exorbitant need for attention and then you put them through this audition process the audition process is the craziest thing ever it devastates people's self-esteem because you just get rejected all the time rejected all the time yeah you're not selling a t-shirt that no one wants you're selling yourself like yeah tonight's date this girl when I first moved to LA and when she would go on auditions when if she would get rejected she would want to fuck like a wild animal it's like she wanted something to just like she wanted just fucking house a dream - she wanted yeah she was it was like the stress of it all was so crazy she wanted validation she wanted to blow off steam yeah it was just the the stress of it all it's so unhealthy and the people that go into that are some of the most the least it's the least advisable career path for them yeah to be how exactly yeah it attracts the wrong people yeah it's just a fucked up situation you have these people judging you like come on in Kyle yeah I can't comment tell us about you just have a lot of trouble auditioning tell me what your favorite animal is yeah what's your second that's who you are I told that I wrote you told opera he'd loved it allo that's great mm-hmm Wow Tom Cruise I want an audition once and this girl told me she asked me where I was from and I said I was from New Jersey and she goes uh she goes I'm from New York she was well I'm actually from New Jersey but I don't tell people that I go why she goes well it's cool to say you're from New York I go that's ridiculous oh yeah that doesn't make any sense at all I go why would you lie I go and then he just told me and she goes are you ready to audition I'm like okay so she's like giving me like this sour look and I had a saying wait the audition I told you yeah yeah and then I she had this sour look in her face and I had a sing a line from a Bruce Springsteen song to her in the audition it was so humiliating for some terrible movie some terrible movie was a singing in the movie where there's a guy and a girl and you know like telling the girl much I love her and I'm singing like fucking Born to Run or something like that I don't even remember I think everyone would love to hear a little bit right now [Music] [Laughter] get it no no no not not only did I not get it but this very very important moment for me I left and I realize that's when I realized I was like this this whole process for me at least is broken like I'm not good at this yeah this is not I'm not good at pretending to be someone like everybody who goes in there they they go into these auditions and there was these people who were like air quotes working actors yeah they do little you know I was on just shoot me for saying you know I had a nice ode on this you know those people they're like hopping around those people they developed this real slick way of talking and they don't say nice to meet you because they might already met you so they say good to see you good to see you I'll I could to see usually oh it's because I keep remembering or getting boobs you know Dunbar's number yes or certain humble people you can keep in your head but this this this way of doing I was recognizing it the way they would talk everyone was like super left-wing super progressive no one explored ideas you just adopted whatever everybody else was going with and ran with oh yes I agree Hilary is so much more qualified everybody was just people who just say shit like that it was just it was really strange they were like real obvious Democrat lean they weren't thinking it through they just adopted this mindset yeah and they were just sneaking their way through this system they were like exploiting little personality holes in the system and they would get become friends with casting agents and one of the casting agents was a woman I knew this one casting agent who was friends with a friend of mine and she was kind of gross I'm just being nice I'm being confident kinda and she fucked all these actor guys and she would go I want to know who this I can't tell you she she's a nice lady she just looked she was basically doing what a lot she was doing the casting couch in Reverse right but she was like aggressive sexually aggressive with guys yeah and one of my friends she's super sexually aggressive with one of my friends is it Henrietta Weinstein I can't tell you well she you know she was she was casting quite a few different shows yeah and she knew how to she know how to get these these exploit people these guys that were saying good to see you those guys she would fuck those guys yeah cuz that was that was the way they could play it you know that's like this yeah when I was a ducks you I don't know what it was it's brutal though auditioning it's hard I'm terrible I booked one I've gotten like sketch shows but I've only booked one show where it was like a script okay it was a sitcom I booked like a guest starring thing and I went in and I'm a terrible reader and for the read-through they do a read-through with the network like I don't couple days before they shoot and they gave me like oh you have eight new lines whatever and I can I read like a third grader is very poor so I made the big table read through and I stammered through the whole thing I got fired so the only show I booked really off a typical audition reading a script I was fired from Jesus Christ I mean so many wasted hours memorizing paying acting coaches none of it worked out for me why because I get really nervous I feel very judged I feel very uncomfortable I'm a terrible reader so I end up like having to memorize it and then most of my time is like trying to remember it's just basically get too nervous yeah did you ever try to like see hypnotist or anything like that or come on no but that probably would have been a good idea because it wasn't mental yeah the shutdown like you know some people just react you you don't can't help how you react but it's like if you could imagine if you're afraid of bees for example it's like going an audition with a bunch of bees flying around you did your your body's reacting and like a fear way it's really hard to grab your facilities to act or whatever you're doing it's impossible you know so yeah no I get it I mean especially if you think like this god this could be it this is the big moment it's like one of the worst ways for you to behave like or to perform rather in something that's like really important especially like an acting situation where you you're supposed to pretend to be in love or to pretend to be you know happy and but whatever the fuck it is like you're all you're thinking is don't fuck this up don't don't fuck this up and that's like the overlying mantra to all your thoughts doing it do this correct is not the great mindset we're gonna do the performance I had like I just thought out of my head whatever I was about to say was gonna be hilarious it was the best part of the show it's gonna be great yeah it's but this is one of the reasons why so many people are so crazy out here it's they come here crazy and then the system gets um crazier and then you also realize that unless you're doing something like what you're doing or you're just doing your own thing on Instagram somebody has to pick you to work you have to get picked which is just nuts like as comics all we have to do is just go to an open mic night practice you know right come up with some jokes do well you come back do well you come back you just keep grind in couple years down the road you're starting to get a gig here and a gig there yeah I'm opening up for this guy and yeah I got a gig em seen at this place and then a couple years after that I'm middle in that a couple like there's a there's an actual thing you can do yeah if you're good you can do it you can make a living I can't imagine just just being an actor oh forget it oh they go crazy dude I have friends that are just actors they go crazy they all go crazy yeah by the time they're in their 40s they're out of their fucking mind and women oh that they feel like they're they feel like they have this little tiny ass hourglass and it's just run us and everyday yeah and like you said it's you know a lot of times you're not starting with the most secure people no almost never I see most never I got on stage cuz I was in so much pain like I literally like was but pushed I was in college I'd like no friends I'm really paying up pretty picture myself today but I yeah I wanted like a tension like that really was the first impulse and yeah yeah but sometimes that leads to the funniest shit and the funniest people like this that pressure one way that throws you in another direction you know that that bad feeling when you just try and escape that bad feeling the energy and the desire to escape that bad feeling is so intense that it creates a good feeling and after a while though it flips to like now I you know like sometimes I don't want to be looked at you know I think if I got into a bad spot I'd want to go on stage again but sometimes do you ever feel like that like you just don't feel like being like looked like I'm like that's not what happens with you oh I don't feel like going on stage yeah no definitely yeah one of the things that I've been doing lately is for a long time I never I hardly took any time off but after I did my special I just filmed a special in April I took a month off oh I didn't do any stand-up for a month yeah at least like three weeks right like three maybe it might have been four weeks but I was like I'm not doing shit yeah I went to Hawaii I fucking hung out I did podcasts I didn't do any stand-up and it felt great it felt great that I would leave here and I'd be done oh yeah I wouldn't have another gig to go to at night yeah you know there wasn't this like overwhelming thing looming in the background yeah but after a while you know I realized all right I could get back on the horse yeah I'm enjoying more now go ahead what's that where is that Williams interrupted you you were gonna who said join more now what I I'm enjoying stand-up now like I could I feel like this Instagram gave me a little confidence to bring that into my standup cuz but more i I just kind of was I think scared trying to do what people said and there was this thing where like you got him to get a sitcom you gotta be talk about your family I had managers who were like don't do the guitar don't do this do talk about your family and they were trying to get you to make something that could be turned into a sitcom yeah so they could take it away from you once your ex-girlfriend says you were shitty boyfriend yeah yeah exactly like today mm-hmm yeah it's a new thing that's what they're doing now that's the new thing that's the new thing yeah yeah there was a lot of that there was a lot of they were trying to get people to basically put together an audition for a sitcom your your act is essentially like Tim Allen or Roseanne or whoever what Brett Butler you they put you you know and some people have the confidence not to listen I remember as a Calif enactment was one of the guys who like didn't want to sitcom and I was I was like I didn't believe him because I mean that's we're all doing right but he had like a sense of himself I I got like out into the world without really having confidence in myself like to make a decision to do something I really felt like I needed someone to tell me that he there's this experiment I'm explained doesn't explain myself real quick where they did this in the settings had rattle a rattle in front of a baby and the mom would do this baby would like it and they haven't keep rattling it and the baby would start to push it away they have him keep rally and the baby start crying all babies go through this exact thing then after the crying they have him keep rattling it which is like something they would never do now at the last phase of the baby is numb out and start drooling Jesus and that's how I let came into the world I feel like I'm waking up now a little bit that's fucking dark that they did that to a baby only in the 70s would they do that how many people did they fuck up in the 70s I know the brown eyed blue-eyed experiment remember that this they told a classroom of kids blue-eyed people are smarter and better brown-eyed people I took kids what so then the blue-eyed people started you know doing better work behaving better the brown-eyed kids started misbehaving then they switched about like we were wrong the brown-eyed kids are the ones who are smarter and better and all things switched so they do it as a psychological experiment yeah just to see like the fuck was this is really fucking loud well yeah if you tell kids that their shit they feel like their shit yeah you don't really need to do that experiment yeah don't do that yeah you do the opposite of that I know that yeah we're talking now about like the effects on kids with the Trump thing and the border it's so dark it's soaked what the fuck was Melania wearing that jacket it says I don't care do you do you think I care what does it say I don't care do you think I do or some shit I don't care do you is that what it is what in the foam is going on in that house I think she's losing her marbles he think was precision do you think she had any idea when she married that billionaire dude in 2005 she thought she was just getting hooked up yeah she's like look I'm gonna have a kid but this guy it's gonna be great I don't have to work anymore yeah all these fucking nude modeling gigs that I was doing and you know learn how to speak a little bit of English whatever ya know go shopping all the time fuck yeah I'm a done beat good boy don't be a bad boy yeah boom I'm in and then ten years later she's the fucking Vice Prime and she's the the president of Asus well she's more popular than the vice president oh yeah fuck knows who Pence's yeah I don't know a goddamn thing about that guy he scares me all about well might be the president one day cuz I like Jesus stuff going on a lot of Jesus a lot more than ever pen sauce sessions Huckabee a lot of Jesus yeah Chris Pratt's being praised because he said people should pray which is a legitimate thing to say I mean look just what or whatever prayer is mindfulness meditation feeling good you know just being thankful you know you don't have to attach it necessarily to any ideology or religion it's still a good idea to think that way but people are going yes we got a Christian as an actor yeah from fucking guardians of the galaxy one of us whoa and like it the idea that no atheist be President no atheists and no single guys yeah better have a family bitch otherwise what you gonna do you're gonna fuck everybody and launch bombs just to see what happens that's exactly what happens happen I mean could do you think that it's possible to have a single guy or gal as the president I do not I do not think it's possible it's got a stigma people would get weirded out by you how old are you you're 49 you don't even have any kids you fucking weirdo you don't have a wife even a sing even a guy who's married with no kids I think people big yeah he's not like us because you could be married with kids and I could be single and I don't feel weirded by you I don't feel like this fucking weirdo what's he doing I'm married with kids because that's a normal path but it's not a normal path to be like a 55 year old guy with no wife kids never been married yeah no desire to cause like when your it seems like you're more stable if you're the whole family oh for sure well you have something you have some skin in the game you know you care about your kids that's true - you don't want till I blow up the world it's like that sting song if the Russians love their children - you know it's you we we can hear a bit of that Joe it's not I'll stick it for this audition but then I walk out of here Snoopy on Broadway humiliating yeah I don't good voice but they wanted a comedian or something it's like I got his audition the song was like sup sup suppertime sup sup sup earth literally I waited my friend Johnny and John Bush comedian uh no I'm really funny guy he went in before me and I walked in I know his name felt like a bomb went off and I walked out in a Hoffman well what happened he was like man and I went in there and they were just dead silent and I did like a whole dance except sup suppertime - people just staring at me and I left and I was like what what happened in there because I the guy said that my audition was cute and I was gonna leave but then I walked back in I tapped on his table I said you know what you're an asshole I mean he'll oh and I was like hi you're an asshole because you said it was cute yeah he's a wise every sort of defensive Val yeah you're supposed to be Snoopy bro yeah snip he's not mad is is this Bush character is he always like that he's hilarious yeah like he just doesn't like fuck he live in Iowa now Iowa yeah what's he doing there he's got a nice little I've got family and no house as a corporate stuff mom mostly no those corporate gigs yeah that's her that's a weird world the world of corporate gigs where the guys they give up mainstream but they can do those corporate gigs that pay really well yeah but nobody knows about them mm-hmm nobody knows they're alive yeah they just they just do these corporate gigs yeah and you can make some money doing that mm-hmm but they're like a lot of times like there in the afternoon people are eating food oh well then you staying at some Best Western somewhere Kansas City staring at the wall what they do to comedians they go we'll get a comedian when the environment I'm sure you've had two gigs like that where you just at a place like why did they think oh that's good for a comedian to come here terrible you've done colleges right oh yeah the kids run it they like these seventeen yeah I went to one and they had a poster of me but they didn't put the date or the time on it guess how many people show that million a million people that's amazing it's great how'd you do I did fantastic I asked if I what time I was at Amherst oh no it was a giant field there was one guy in a red hooded sweatshirt in the center of the field sitting indian-style and I said I don't I don't we don't have to do this right and she goes now just go out there people hear you will start coming out oh my god one guy one guy Amherst is a tricky place that's a that's the People's Republic of Amherst it's like if you took Boulder and you moved it to Western Massachusetts but that's Amherst yeah super super super progressive and liberal I did not know that well they don't like comedy that's for sure we'll be right back that's too bad most people don't know that impression nobody knows folks just not anymore that's Johnny Carson yeah back in the day that is you know I think of when I think of Johnny Carson's the fucked up thing thing of but he died smoking like some ungodly amount of pall malls he just kept pumping on these pall malls just smoked him constantly and his gut had become distended like he was pregnant and it was just he was just rotten with cancer like his whole body was just fucked up yeah and apparently like when he died like as he was as he was dying his like last days he was like these goddamn cigarettes oh yeah I did hear that oh I think I'm gonna think of Johnny Carson I think of him poisoning himself with these things that he can't keep from his face he just can't he's got to keep doing it and his body is rotting and he goes from being like America's favorite all-time talk-show host he was the fucking man yeah I mean he was the man yeah he goes from that to just quitting which is stopping just stopping doing it and then it becomes this weird thing he becomes this weird guy raceless recluse yeah what what is what happens there how does how does one go from being The Tonight Show host to just being a recluse yeah he never tried to do anything else right no I like what Letterman's doing he's doing those things on Netflix now I haven't seen them I haven't either but I like that he's doing them yeah I'm worried about him I worried he would be one of those guys you know cuz yeah he kind of vanished yeah crew is crazy beard I'm gonna do that crazy beard yeah yeah okay man that's cool with you guys do you think these guys they just like get to the point where they're like I can't do this anymore there's just too much people too much pressure too much yeah I think it's a lot of pressure every day to do a show takes a certain personality different kind of thing right exhausting I'm sure and you're doing stand-up that's never been tried I think no it can't be great I'm terrible take so long as I happen to get an act together yeah that's really good so did you hear what happened today in the news that today that was good about cars though he would make kind of fun about how bad he was yes yes well Jay Leno was the best at it I really feel and that's why they extended his monologue but even right he wasn't good he was a workhorse every Sunday go to Hermosa Beach Club yeah I did I was on that show and I filmed something and he brought me into the office and he didn't want to air it and he goes I don't want to get any letters because like I did that Craig character and he just felt those two like um retard or something yeah he played say yeah he played it safe when people swung at him he never swung back yeah he just just roll with the punches yeah would you do a talk show no I'm doing one right now in one on Instagram Kyle Dunnigan one the worst name on Instagram why would I do that it doesn't seem like a good way to talk to people it doesn't seem like it's fun it seems like it's too much pressure it seems like there's too many people it seems like the conversations become fake because you have five minutes until you cut to commercial and they come over with cards and the executive wants to talk to you and just want to get in your ear and well we just feel like um it just needs a little levity so we're gonna bring you how we're gonna bring the Jester out hold the child I'm tired of the Jester I don't like the gesture and the Jester comes out as Lulu everybody's here and the fucking crowd starts clapping the audience they get that sign this is cheer applause applause I've seen too many of them I just I think it's a dead medium I don't like it I I'm not recommending it I'm you have it people should see or you should have studio tours Joe's got the pool table here if the puccini are on we got the VR goggles now look at HTC vive I don't know what that is VR goggles virtual reality poll yeah big dude in front of you throwing punches when it hits you though the screen goes white oh really you get popped yeah that's great it's fun there's a bunch of them there's there's archery games there's one with a lightsaber where things come out you got to slice them when you're chopping them up that's cool doing it to music oh it's fucking amazing in deprivation tank you got here I did I do I have that too yo you want to tell him how we did on pool today we did really good it's fun game how many balls did I get in two games we played you made one ball I did get yeah you made one got it in that's not bad what you wanted yeah you aimed you shot you fired it went in that was really emasculating those two games it shouldn't be two things one that table I didn't tell you because I don't want to freak you out good no very tiny pockets the pockets are much smaller than a normal table that's our table has five and a half inch pockets that table has four inch pockets they're actually slightly under four yeah so they're really small so it's hard to get a ball on okay and I play on it every day it wasn't hard for you to get the ball and just once that I told you I plan it every day I really do every day after after we're done I that's how I unwind we do the podcast it's over and I go knock some balls around that your best game Poole yeah yeah I'm not good at any games that's the only game I'm good at really yeah I'm terrible at every video games I could play quake pretty good at quick okay on our tree or get up good at Archer but that's not game man not game to me man serious bro yeah archery is very different than all of them because archery is like it's very much like a meditation you know it requires so much concentration and so many things have to be in line that as you're thinking of all those different things it cleans your mind it's some weird way very meditative youvery does then in the art of archery no really good book interesting book it's funny because my friend John Dudley read it and recommended it to me and he's like and he's a world-class Archer like he he just got back from Europe where they flew him out to coach various international teams he's a like a real world class coach and Archer himself and he said he's like it's interesting he's like this book is really good but I have a feeling that the guy who wrote it wasn't really that good at archery no I'm like oh that's fascinating it's like the guy he goes I feel like he was kind of there but not quite and I'm like that's interesting coming from a guy who's a real master like recognizes some something some errors in his thinking or the way describes things or his approach really interesting by the way you never have to ask me again did you read that book I did not quickly don't read any books I haven't read a book in a long time thank God I mean you could say did you hear this book sometimes I got an audio book download oh I love audiobooks I read one audio or read one book for every seven or eight audiobooks I listened to yeah I read one Nabby and I don't even read most I don't even read sometimes I'll start off reading it and then I'll go this is too much work I'm just gonna listen to it might yeah I just listen to it I don't it's like there's a lot of dead time there's a lot of time that's not being used and that time is when I'm driving and I'm always driving here I'm driving to the gym or I'm driving to the comedy store I'm driving to the airport I fill that up with books on tape you do self-help books no no mostly like right now I'm reading I'm reading the tipping point which is a Malcolm Gladwell book and also reading sapiens which is who wrote sapiens I heard someone read the book tipping point is great mm-hmm it's really great really interesting and it is but I also felt like who is it you've all know a horror re oh okay that's great - and also the talent code it's another book I'm in the middle of I feel like the tipping's great book this book sapiens fucking fantastic ideas a brief history of humankind very enlightening oh yeah that tipping point I feel it could have been three sentences long yeah it was it was a little you know there's a I get it after why like I get it again yeah a bunch of things collide together and anything can happen and next thing no hush puppies are really popular my tipping point was Joe Rogan like played my Instagram videos not crazy yeah that's the only tipping point that makes me very happy it's not doing that I am you know I will always I will if you need just between me if you need me to murder someone or you need some favor good dude I'm good but I'm going to contact you in behalf of Donald Trump to deal with Tom on it oh yeah you really are worried about [Laughter] gonna kill Tom Arnold before my prize drug I don't know what it's over now when people do kill themselves you gotta go okay um how many times did this person think about this yeah how how many times did they get close and they didn't want I don't have that in me you know I don't know why whatever whatever it is maybe it's cuz I take care of myself maybe its genetic maybe that's because I live a happy life basically the lock prob I don't either doesn't have luck - but yeah I had I think luck is a big I think it's a big factor I have a friend who killed himself and his brother had killed himself before that and everybody loved him and it was just stunning to everybody everybody's like what the fuck I didn't know him that well but I knew him well enough to really like him she's a really really good guy yeah I mean people get down it's you have to be in so much pain - yeah to that they I don't know what it is it's uh so you know a guy like Tom Arnold who knows he might be like he might have tasted the barrel a couple of times and be like you know what I'm just gonna focus that wouldn't shock me he's uh got a lot of energy does he mmm Tom from what I've seen yeah what have you seen I played like this game what's with him it was like a big house game bunch of people and it was he just run around and tag things I never quite figured it out but man he was sweating like a pig and running around oh yeah I like that show idea though I'm gonna check it out his show it's not out yet right I don't think so I think is vice what is what's going on with Vice so many time with advice is going away it's not going away the changes are happening so they hired a new CEO or VP or something that's so that all the program and probably change for the fall that's like it's weird that it's a whole Channel it's like it's a whole channel is a channel I couldn't find it saved my life yeah there's too many goddamn channels there's all my 600 plus channels you know what's hilarious I watch a lot of hunting shows and the outdoors shows they're all like a lot of like really Christian II people like a lot of these hunting outdoors type to like to know Christ yeah just like just want to thank you Lord for this opportunity to take down this man like there's a lot of that but what's funny is that on Direct TV they're only like two or three channels removed from hardcore porn so it's like you go through the lineup you go in the get into the 500s and it's hardcore porn hardcore porn like daddies and stepdaughters and big cocks and Smurfs holes and then right after that it's like the great outdoors you know on Jesus and yeah yeah little landmines blessed like I sit with Mike the hunter I'm blessed him out here blessed this great world in this great country blessed to tell you what and they have like the yeah they have a Scientology Channel now I think it's up there 500 nice nice I did radio once I'll never forget this I did this radio show in Denver and just morning radio before a gig like you know you do you promote the gaeke Joe Rogan's gonna be the Comedy Works in Denver here this weekend and then in the middle of the thing they go it's time for our Pledge of Allegiance ladies and gentlemen and so I'm sitting there like going what is happening so this is - they put their fucking hand on their heart and they go I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it and they they get into it like full earnestness and we're we're looking at each other me and I think Ari or Duncan was with me we were like what in the fuck is did you go along did you play along well I would if it was like a game or something like that and you know stand for the flag okay I'll do that anybody feel bad that's not what it was it was a radio show you're in the middle of the radio show and you do a Pledge of Allegiance so what the fuck is this did you stay you just stay still or yeah I remember what I did I remember I remember being high as fuck oh so made it extra hard because whenever I would do those radio shows we would just meet downstairs because you know you got to be at them at 6 o'clock in the morning you're exhausted and you know you don't necessarily really want to do it but we would meet downstairs and get barbecues and so then it was an adventure it was like everything was free that the wind was scaring me like where's the car that's taking us we get in the car and then we talked to the people and it was always like alright to the driver like okay who's the biggest dickhead you've ever had a drive because there's always like one story comedians that hated be in there and it was always oh you would hear a bunch of them but like disgruntled angry people one of them was always Richard Jeni there was always a Richard Jenner was always properly yeah Richard Jeni because he never wanted to be that guy he never wanted to be the road he wanted to be that guy who put together the act that got him the Jerry Seinfeld sitcom right and meanwhile he was one of the greatest stand-up comedians of all time you saw him a bunch of times when I was coming up and a bunch of times in in clubs and he was a fucking killer like one of the most unheralded and unappreciated underappreciated stand-ups of all time he's only one of my all-time favorites but it was bumming me out I would hear oh he thought he was miserable he didn't wanna talk to anybody I thought bummed out I was like I heard he's like the god of his death his girlfriend's making pancakes and he he blew his face off oh he was still alive he like did it it went wrong oh Jesus Christ not to bring the room down so he went under the chin yeah I guess it's lit that happens like more often than you just take the face fuck taking the face Jesus Christ yeah that's another one another guy who killed himself crazy that you know it was so common it's so common it's hard to be a person but we're the first species that knows we're gonna die very aware of our like impending death that right there you need to medicate that species if you looked at look at chart Aleutian of monkeys you go okay this first level of primate we got to help them out right they're doing this so they're gonna get very religious which is good but some of them we got to medicate this group yeah they can't handle it on their own well we used to die young so it was like you wouldn't get yourself cuz you only live to be 30 right and now we have so much more time on her hands don't have to work all day to get a meal and then collapse we're sitting around and I could think about this fuck see yourself getting older every day no it's happening it's happening I love it do you love aging I love it what's the fact your favorite part the pain or the I like the pains I like tired that's tough I got some bursitis it's pretty sweet nice I do like though I do feel more comfortable I'm feeling less anxious yeah in some ways more another I guess I'm pretty even though well you're more aware of things but then you're also gonna be more aware of your impending demise we don't live long enough like we need to live 500 years I've thought about that first hundred years to fix I get Child's and stuff you imagine though if you did leave live 500 years would you be dating like a hundred year old it'd be like he's fuckin hundred year olds don't know shit she says no shit and then around do you imagine if you were five hundred years old and you were dating a thirty year old people would be like what the fuck wrong with ya you couldn't do it but why not she's a grown-ass woman she's thirty years old that's a grown-ass woman right like a thirty year old could date a fifty year old could date a sixty year old and you're like he better be rich a seventy year old like something that have been going on yeah I don't feel like we mature after 25 men myself I don't know but don't you think though that there is a certain requirement of a lack of maturity to be funny to be like like some of the shit that you did in those videos like grown up would not you would not do you know like ah you hit that retarded kid when you have Caitlyn like Caitlyn like driving with a clean record now cuz Bruce killed that fucking lady yeah I mean which is I wonder if that's the case what I don't know what's happening with that case but the video doesn't look great I mean it's an accident obviously but uh no it's horrible that family must be like to have that happen to them they lose their loved one and then to see her just like complain sit around just hero of the year and although much more hard smarter now Barbie there's a show called lost in transition which I recommend highlights people transitioning and it's a lot of old you know people like in their 50s and stuff Wow well that's what's weird about it's like there's a lot of it as people that have kind of given up on sex didn't even want to have sex anymore yeah which is one of things that Caitlyn said yeah sex is kind of like it doesn't matter right right but then why why snippety-snip I don't know but the they say that they become like teenagers when they do transition there's like a period where they're feeling this like how teenage feels are coming into their own finally but their older men you know and it had this period in Caitlyn they kind of got caught it on that show a little bit it's like you're kind of like a new person I guess you feel like that it's time feel like this is remember when we read about George Washington having wooden teeth yeah he'll read about that is that not true yeah I'm sure he did yeah that's best they had but I think you hear about that if you heard about a guy today that it wouldn't teeth you'd be like what the fuck get that kind of a dentist the fuck is he do they have implants I give him real teeth yes crazy I feel like there is going to be a time maybe not in our lifetimes but maybe shortly after where you know they used CRISPR or some gene editing material something like that where they can actually turn you into a one oh well I mean once you go through puberty no no no no if they can alter your genes look what what they can do now what mostly what they're doing now is they're there doing work with embryos and there they they're planning on altering people from the jump like from the time they're born but as that technology gets better oh yeah effective they're going to be able to utilize it on regular people and they've actually started introducing certain genes into people that didn't have them before in order to fix certain ailments or alterations and genes to like to try to combat certain life-threatening diseases like all these things around the table and I think it's just a matter of time before they come up with the technology that allows someone to completely alter their their actual sex mmm I have things that alter about myself what would you check I first I'd be hot as fuck okay would you be hot in like like nobody likes you way yeah like like like you are like Thor or like Thor he came I was on a plane he came in his big four hair and he like whipped it back whoa I wasn't my girlfriend the time and I saw her like look at me that recalibrates like what you see is good looking when you see actual because his wife was there and she's this model because we see her face every year you're like I'm alright looking yeah but when you see actual gorgeous people I was staring at them for like 20 minutes real creepy like and then I went to the bathroom and I must have recalibrated I look like a monster as soon as you looked at yourself yeah just like nothing symmetrical my hair look like a lettuce anyway I yeah I I would not change any personality I wouldn't make myself a better person you wouldn't I would just make myself gorgeous that's all that matters to me Joe would you like care about would you be built like the rock I'd be ripped he shit right I mean I'm pretty huge right what kind of a giant hog would you have on I have to take I probably like ten inch hog I'll take four inches off my hog right now will you put it will you put on the table and you hear it yeah I had a nice like that guy was that Tommy who was like I'm pushing the boat horn with his cock Tommy Lee oh yeah good a Tommy genetically-engineered Tommy Lee cock nice I actually don't care about that no I might think if I had something mutated but right there's a there's there seems like a zone as long as you're in that zone you don't want to be micropenis you want to be too big that's yeah you don't want to hurt people yeah I hate having a 12-inch cock because I I can only get the tip in I got it it sucks especially if you're the tip it's like a beer can yeah big old fat boy wrong with those 500 channels right now starts yeah there's uh there's quite a lot of those channels still it's like don't these people know about the internet like why t-pain $29.99 for this yeah whatever you're paying how is that not dead yet I say it's probably kids their parents aren't looking and they just rack it up or guys who just want 4k in the big screen have enough has enough time gone by we've noticed the effect of online porn well first your with pubic hair Oh pubic hair vanished that's true yeah I bit my act about it it's like the best sign of porns influence in our culture is the absence of pubic hair like if you had a time yeah and you can get scientists from the future and they're studying the time period between 1990 and 2018 the most confusing thing would be what happened to the pubic hair because there's no historical record nobody discussed it interesting they just started hacking off their pubes how do you feel about the bald situation it's normal it doesn't bother me anymore but when I was a kid I mean when I was young nobody did anything girls but it was chaos down there it was a disaster it was Lee he would touch there like when you were going down on a girl or you were fooling around you put your hand down their pants and you feel it outside the underwear there was like an afro in there you had like a covering over like the forest buffer yeah I was like somebody threw like a five haircut somebody threw a parachute over treetops just touch it yeah I mean I was an adult when I really like I I thought it was just like a Barbie doll like I didn't really know that there's so much going on until uh there was a funny moment when I was in high school there was a girl that I was dating at the time was actually right after high school and she had this guy that she's I we had like fooled around a bunch of times like you know fooled around don't fall around for a few months fooled around that kind of thing and she had some boyfriend that she was dating for a while and this boyfriend apparently got her to shave her pussy and she well we were fooling around just like I can't I can't I go what's the matter Jess I can't show you I know you can't show me what and she was like he made me shave he made you shave she goes I don't you see it's so embarrassing I go I don't give a shit know what so you know how many hair down there I was like but it was weird that's the first time I've ever seen imitates box weird when you whoa it was it was like my beard Yeah right it was like this I shaved like three days ago so it was like that yeah it was like it was coming back yeah it was but it was coming back and she was Italian so it was just chaos I was coming back like you know it was the whole fucking they women really do I have to wax that I'll do everything really you have to shave their feet they have to shave their legs live to shave everything whatever everything this kind of hair on it me too hasn't hit that area well that's not what it is me too is about sexual harassment and assault so the battles to be about grooming choices me to should I hate shaved my legs me too but me too is it's so ridiculous I've been reading up on me - That's not me - you just don't read like what is me - anything they're upset feminism well they went with armpits they try to keep the armpits like girls were like keeping the armpits with it you have to be super EXTREME and not shave the legs yeah and to let your ass hair just grow wild you just got to be a reckless person yeah yeah you have to be just careless you don't care you're renegade you're an outsider yeah crazy jungle asshole hair definitely better to be a man in terms of grooming 100% yeah you just out you just don't just have to be clean if your wife said I'm not shaving anymore would you have the talk would you say yeah it's okay whatever you want I would I'd have to figure out a way to get her to play with wax or some point on just rip it all off there go Blazers yeah play a game of laser tag you imagine like they had like that's how they get rid of it right there's laser hair removal but imagine if there was like a gun you could just drive down the street and shoot people's hair off your pipe you think that's a song you like those eyebrows pew pew pew seems very dangerous all those shooting a laser beam that's how you get LASIK surgery which sounds insane to me is that how they do it so some of it is they do with a scalpel an actual scalpel oh I thought they just burned your eyeball away some of it but I think some of them they do would I think there's two different ways to do it I think sometimes they do it with an actual scalpel like a blade and I don't know if they think that that's more precise I don't know only thing I heard about laser beams before LASIK surgery was don't look at a fucking laser beam and yeah yeah that's all thing well here goes laser pointer burns hole and young boy's eye oh god damn it that's the story going around it's a nine-year-old in Greece that's the actual hole burned into his eyeball what the fuck from staring with those crazy lasers might be one of the new ones that are coming out that like I know like you know member they went crazy in the 90s everyone was buying red pointer lasers yeah there's a new version of them that are really high-powered oh I think you can light stuff on fire if you're pointing at a well enough like people have like lit bongs on fire with them what I'll know if it's these crazy ones that this same kid use but oh the poor here's a new high level like people are making YouTube videos with them what the fuck do you do what does I know does he just have a hole in it forever it says decrease vision so it just has a hole in his vision forever yeah I guess he's alright doctors found a large macular hole and the retina is left on the child reporter playing with the green laser pointer repeatedly gazing into the laser beam there right because of the large size of the hole the doctors decided on a conservative approach rather than surgery fuck are you fucking your eyeballs up when you're a little kid because some asshole parent wants to just play with their phone and let that kid shoot laser beams in the lab okay who's watching the kid how did he get the laser did you have a job did he go to the store and buy it what the fuck are you doing with your kid you got kids yeah that scares me yeah you gotta make sure that you know they're safe yeah you do well you're 47 if you want to do it you gotta do it soon no I got I got like 30 years Oh to figure this out well Trump had it won when he was 60 okay baron he had one news like 60 right yeah so you got time I go back and forth I I don't hear good reviews they never it's never like a clean do it it's great it's always Jim get ready it's gonna change your life you gotta get ready for DFO steady gal no sleep yeah how long a year and a half oh that's good yeah does she want him yeah how old she 20 she'll be 28 noticed nice yeah I know it's young but I move I really pursued may just get that attire and keep talking how'd it go how'd it go down on Channel five ninety-two well she wants to have kids she's still young and fertile you probably shoot a live one in there make a person it's at the technical term yeah she's a live one if you go to a doctor that's how you describe it yeah yeah round in there hurry like this thanks doc me I assure you you keep our legs up in the air you want to make sure ya get it is down there she rides on top your swimmers might not make it up the canal if you know what I'm saying is that a true thing it'll land back I don't know it makes sense I'm I'd like to have kids I would yeah someday I do you don't have some day when you're 47 you really don't have some day because one of the things about autism is a lot of it oh no you see the age of the father yeah it's not just the age of the mother it's the age of the father I feel like I've been in a coma you know a disease where you fall asleep for 20 years anyway yeah that's how I feel why I don't know I don't know where those years went I feel like I woke up recently and I'm like well how am I now do you think this is because you weren't doing what you wanted to do because you were just doing a bunch of other shit and the years just kept piling up maybe I mean do you feel I guess maybe kids you can track your life little easier maybe it's cuz I didn't have kids it sort of seems like one chunk that went by fast the kids you can mark years with your kids well the reality of being a person is if we really do live to be 80 9100 if you're fucking really lucky that if you have $100 it goes quick you buy a sandwich buy some drink and getting some chips and then you go to the movies and then you don't have enough for dinner yeah you know it's like the dollar here a dollar there your year is not that long it's three to sixty-five days it happened so quick the next thing you know it's two years and then it's five years and then 10 years later and then 30 years later and then then yeah oh you gotta get your hip replaced huh oh we're gonna do you're saying I gotta get my shit North that's like that's you're telling me right here you're giving me I think you've already done enough you're getting your shit in order right I mean I think I think what you did with starting this Instagram page like deciding that you can't keep this gig anymore is very brave and smart I realized it I appreciate that I don't feel like it's brave I feel like I do is like that fear not be able to sleep and I was forced that's how it feels well it's probably whatever the fuck it is your body the fate of the universe whatever it is this just telling you like you're not you can't do this anymore mm-hmm you can't you know and you just listen to it some people don't ever listen man they just start medicating themselves yeah and they just drown out they take SSRIs and they just show up and they just they just get everything becomes like a dull medium mm-hmm and they just keep doing it over and over and over again yeah I am glad I feel right now really thankful and just to have being able to do shows you know people coming out it's it just you know for years it was like up and down all over the place and now I feel like I do have some kind of following that I can directly contact no you definitely do and it's gonna keep growing I mean you keep putting out the videos like you're putting out yeah it's gonna keep growing there's no way around it it's it's great it's fucking look we have so many different avenues now that didn't exist before and one of the things that I think is really cool about today versus when I started I started an 88 is that there's there's not like a competitiveness with comedians instead there's like a hyper supportiveness everybody's quick to tell you about people who are really good everybody wants everybody to know there's like it's there's no famine anymore because I think before when there was only one Tonight Show right Letterman and there was a sitcom and everybody was scrambling for you want to get Thursday night at 8 o'clock on NBC that's where the friends pot is like everybody wanted to get in the right spot and you know there's not that anymore that's an interesting point I didn't thought of that yeah now it's like everybody has a youtube channel or a Twitter page or an Instagram thing or a podcast they're all doing their own thing and instead of being competitive with other comedians everybody's like everybody has everybody on their shows like like all these guys that are top podcasters we all do everybody's show yeah I'm always doing either Joey does my show her I'll do his shoe or I'll do Tom show or he'll do my show or I'll do Duncan show or he'll do mind it's like constant back and forth and everybody's supportive yes it's because it's it doesn't hurt anybody it just helps yeah yeah and the more like if I if I tell people you got to check out Kyle Dunnigan Instagram page they're gonna go and they're gonna say he's right hilarious so it's good for everybody it's good for me because they know that I'm not gonna bullshit them and it's good for anybody else too and it's also good because it's good for me because I want you to do really great because I want more of those funny videos to watch it's like for everybody I feel like giving a cache ah luckily just keep - keep taking dives and pool was that I was trying really hard it's a hard game it's been a while since I played that's my yeah that's one of those games you you're not supposed to take time off of that fucking stupid game supposed that's a game that you have to play every day all right well we'll play again play in a year okay practice practice up maybe after the show you'll play better because you'll be thinking but what you did wrong no I definitely yeah it was a rusty there hmm do you have like an ultimate goal what you want to do with pool with stand up my pool goal career now that you got momentum I was I mean I'd love to just build the audience and just do bigger venues so I don't have to travel so much I'd like to just have like a life and be able to do like weekend gigs then come yeah yeah and have enough money be comfortable yeah those Thursday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday week said a lot of people do whoo he won't realize you're alone for 23 hours then you have too much attention for an hour then you're alone for 2002 it just yeah if you're not even the right like mindset to go do stuff go to the gym if you're like I hurt you hermit you're in real trouble yeah until and a lot of people do I think that's what Richard Jeni did yeah you know a lot of people do wind up her meeting yeah I always make sure that I exercise and always make sure I do something go out do something it makes a giant difference yeah you feel way better yeah it's like a person root I need a routine without having a boss or like a job I need a routine just when you go on the road do you bring somebody with you like an opening act really afford at this point that's another thing like when you get a bigger orange you can bring friends Yeah right now I just I jog they're right to ride my bike there by myself do you have a basket where you put all your stuff front back little tingling I I started bringing people on the road a long time ago cuz I had a couple of gigs that I did and the local guys were so terrible and it was it made it so much more excruciatingly obsolete Lee because you got to sit through this thing about

tiny dog which isn't a great look for a man but what kind of dark love it it's a pug Chihuahua next song the way I talk to my dog is inexcus-- it's offensive to me as a man like I don't tell myself I'll give my permission like when I was looking or pause and this just came out of me I went are you looking new Stinky's stinks that came and I'm a grown man I just I think if I didn't say like let me ask her if she's licking her Stinky's I just why I stink I don't know it was even stinky there's like pinky's house like ain't like any Tinky's have you called Swami's before no it just came out of

a mastiff and he's it's really bad he can't walk anymore it takes like for him to come in to eat it takes several minutes several minutes of him walking you know five six yards it's like we adopt these terminally ill children because you can attached to them like kids and you wouldn't adopt a kid is gonna die at 14 well I have him and have another dog is also very old who's a Shibui no English bulldog max he's a little bit better but he's he's not gonna make it we have mobile dogs don't have long he's got real problems walking as well but then I have Marshall who's a year in six months and he's golden retriever and is the total opposite he just fucking leaps into the pool and he runs around the pool in circles and he goes running with me in the hills and he's a fucking just a ball of energy and love and happiness and you just get to see him at this stage and I'm like damn one day Marshalls gonna be 13 I'm gonna see Marshall like these dogs you know it's gonna it's gonna be just a giant struggle so it's hard really hard I mean fucking hard man I don't know why you know it's like to have kids but I feel like very I get really attached to my my dogs yeah you know it's that times a million with kids it's it's that times million one of the things had changed with me is the way I look at people because I always considered people just you know I meet you you're 47 I just stay well Kyle's 47 that's what he is but I don't I didn't know you when you were two you know and now when I meet people and I meet people like I meet some old asshole like that old dickhead he used to be a little baby oh he was a baby he became this old dickhead like how did this happen like what what went wrong and I'm so much more compassionate I'm so much more I care about people so much more and I care about I think I give them more of a break I give people way more of a Brea and I noticed this is something that I don't see as much in single guys who don't have children yeah you don't you know like this there's something about it that the world is dog-eat-dog you're competing for your career you're competing for love interests you're competing for this and that and everybody's like fuck that guy and fuck him and everybody's trying to get nobody's nobody looks at people and go oh that could have been my son yeah that's a little baby that became this weirdo 28-year old man that's one that I hear about having kids that is very attractive to me that it does shift your perspective and massive was whole new massively one life changed Who I am changed Who I am and it just it and permanently you scare me about that autistic thing though really good well it's real you know there's a correlation it's a correlation between older men yet prior instances of autism you get the percentages get some statistics right here for you great no I mean look a lot of people do it and they're fine and it's gonna help for sure that your gals young she's not even 30 yeah she should live one down there yeah run right down the old tube British okay just get to two years get to two years you guys have been together you know yeah yeah make it to two years almost yeah your when you hit to remove the goalie Oh shucks Bam Bam Bam from the free-throw line whoa yeah it seems like a important life experience did have it is even it's not for everybody and one of the things that used to drive me crazy when I was single is people would say you know you have to have kids you don't have kids you don't living a normal life that's crazy that's so stupid that is such a dot like the idea that you can't be a complete human being unless you recreate only recreate recreate its word I'm looking for reproduce word wouldn't come out it's not that far off though recreate I know but neither me why wasn't reproduced like right there I was having trouble with anecdote yeah antidote and I know but this is super close but that you can be a fucking completely fulfilled person and never get married to never have a kid you just have to have good friends and enjoy what you do there's nothing wrong with that so I raise yeah it's a little what but I just remember being a kid and like my uncle wasn't married or had kids that was always like huh what's up with them smart that guy it's partying seems it's going well more route do you purple without getting me to learn yeah that's right you do I saw you did you one of those people who thinks you're one of those people you're not okay there's no God okay it's very like ah I know everything yeah smart guy that shows a weird show everybody talking over each other five people on our panel whatever it is for know the phone so many people you see the Ben Affleck one gas with Sam Harris Harris yes Sam's a friend who loves Sam I love Sam - that was hilarious I think Ben I think Ben Affleck was roided-up right I really had that energy well he also was like kind of red and thick yeah his neck was thick like listen when you're forty whatever the fuck age he is and you want to pack on that kind of muscles there's only one way you gotta fucking take that plunger a prick baby I hope shoot yeah okay I think I think he was juiced up and I think he just was hyper aggressive virtue signaling and really didn't even know what the fuck he was talking about and clearly picked the wrong guy oh my god I would never argue with Harris I think about it I think like the fact that he can't be President really pisses me off like why can't I want a guy who's smarter than me well he could be President I'm sure I don't think an atheist hmm maybe not yeah it's like why do I get I don't get this whole thing of like I want I want to vote for this guy I can relate to him he's like me I don't want a guy like me right it's like when a babysitter like I want a baby sir I wanted someone who's superior exactly smarter I mean he's very meditative Sam and mom and I firmly believe no one should be President I think there should be a counsel oh wise people I love that idea yeah like the Jedi Council fucking eight people or something just really really smart people that have you know have and I think they should all have had to do mushrooms all of them Wow about that all have to do psychedelic experiences although they should be high cannot not do mushrooms while they're on the job but have in the past where they understand there's there's more to life than this thing that's part of the platform the person needs to be like I did try mushrooms didn't they no you got it all you gotta go deep you gotta take the heroic dose okay you know yeah I love that idea well think tank yeah eight people super wise people I don't really think the mushroom thing is necessary but but consider it wise objective people that care and have a deep deep sense of responsibility to sort of guide our country in the best way possible I plan for their own interests exactly I put Neil deGrasse Tyson on this he'll be great well he'll be great for some sort of a role as a science educator in the government anyway so some will see but what's great about Neil is he's one of the first guys in our lifetime that made science fun mm-hmm made made astrophysics interesting he's so enthusiastic yeah he's a great guy I fucking love he said if we have if aliens like we gotta send one guy oh he's a guy Neil deGrasse Tyson well he's also even even though like he'll be talking to someone who is just doesn't really understand what he's saying he's not an elitist exactly yeah he the way he argues he's caring about ya guiding him he's a master at it he's a really likable guy but he is like that all the time like he's like that when the cameras off he's just a great guy and one quality has that rarely does someone who's like really smart heavies he's a big laugher yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like no human fun guy you know he used to be a wrestler time at mushrooms huh he used to be a wrestler really he wrestled in high school he wasn't like that yes I think he wrestled in college too he was jacked like fucking jacked yeah he's an all-around quality human yes Sam Harris did the way he argues just stays calm mm-hmm well he doesn't argue about things he doesn't understand either mm-hmm you know like if Sam has a conversation and say like he's having a conversation with someone about whatever the fuck it is some some discipline that's outside of his realm yeah and then you know he'll he'll ask questions like he doesn't have he's not it's not know at all that they learn yeah they'll forget but if he's talking to you about something and he's arguing it's because he understands what he's talking about yes that's a rare quality man there's so many people that want to argue about shit that they really don't even understand you know and I don't think there's anything wrong with discussing things you really don't understand to try to understand them especially if you're doing it in a casual conversation or even a podcast but there's a lot of fucking people that argue shit and they're just trying to win you know they're just trying to score podes yeah they're not really talking right you get a lot of that right I'd do it a lot but I'm more aware of it watching people who don't do it Dean you learned it's a normal thing you get caught up in your idea and then you want your idea to be right yeah and then you kind of like chase down all the evidence that would show that your idea is right you see this all the time when someone gets accused of something and we don't know exactly what happened you see these groups of people that automatically want to think that person is guilty and automatically have a preconceived idea of what went down how it went down regardless of what the other person said like they only want to look at it one way it just gets we're real weird with people I don't now to all the information you have to be you have to be a little more you know what hashtag fake news hashtag hashtag I'll come back I'll get smarter and come back what kind of smart you're gonna get book smart and get Sam Harris Neil deGrasse Tyson smart if I gave you a pill and the pill would make you super smart but you wouldn't be funny anymore would you take it what would I be happy that's a good question no one can decide whether or not you're gonna be happy but you what am I going to do again that's up to you Kyle Dunnigan I don't think I'd take I think gues there's torture and hey would you stay he's not stupid half retarded and funny weren't that very little oxygen when I was born I was purple and they were like this one might come out a little goofy and we have to wait and see if he stops talking and then I started talking they're all he's alright really but I have a theory that like I was born a genius got a little retarded it's just a theory but my retarded genius cannot be a bad theory Hey I mean want to roll the dice whether you're you're born super smart or not so roll the dice Oh some people are just having better brains yeah some people that are just really good at me like I used to have to friend my friend Johnny you could just yell out math problems to him yeah you know like 5 times 5 minus 6 divided by 7 multiplied by a hundred divided by three and he would go Oh 16 yeah what the fuck and like someone would be sitting next to him with a calculator and they would like try to keep up he could do it as fast as someone could type it in with a calculator yeah it was bizarre and useless have calculators asshole are you born 200 years ago batteries are everywhere happen we need you yeah it's a calculator my phone is a calculator not to bring up sam harris again but that whole like you know free will book mmm-hmm you know that kind of that's a mindfuck that somebody it really is because your mind doesn't want to believe it like just it's not a it's like not believing in heaven i want to believe it it's hard to it's just hard but there's definitely so much luck involved in who your parents were how you were raised life experiences for sure you know whether or not you've ever been attacked assaulted robbed whether you've been an accident or you got gravely injured there's so many variables that are just fortunate just luck yeah there's so many be just someone dance with it yeah whatever yeah there's there's so many things that you just fucking luck well look we're all lucky were here we weren't born in a jungle of guatemala so absolutely yeah we're just lucky I mean you're you're you want a huge one-in-a-trillion lottery to be born yeah and then to be born the u.s. at this time we have air conditioning and GPS why don't we Revere science more that if there's a God he's saying I'm rewarding you every time you listen to science and yet so much of religions against science I don't know look I don't know science is saying hey nobody comes back from the dead after three days hey people can't really walk on water hey why did he turn water into wine why didn't he just make wine he's fuckin magic I never thought of that stop with the magic trick bro we're trying to get fucked up just making some hey hey I'm tired of wine got any whiskey in that and those magic robes yeah the miracles were sort of like stepping on their fucking parlor tricks his miracles are horrible he no was the best it was a thing back in the 80s called the power team for Jesus and what they were was these dudes that would do like feats of strength for Jesus like they would they were fuckin break bricks with her head they would rip foam in half they lift up heavy weights do it for Jesus Wow but Jesus gave him the power yeah yeah but it was also like hey dude Jesus's he's magic he's got magic like he's not gonna be impressed by you breaking a board with your extra thick skull you fucking dad Wow look at them one of my children down there have you never heard of them no I used to watch them all the time they were all like this religious channel and I used to watch the Power Team for Jesus going what and the fuck is this that's amazing it was so you found anything on it I found a good a good one those guys are the Third Street Promenade Jesus yes whoa it break bricks Jess for Jesus approached this brick oh you just hope it seems a little too easy to break though we're really making a mess for Jesus who drops an elbow no up this balloon for Jesus it blow it up until it explodes that's why they have to wear goggles on yeah it's a bladder that's not uh this trick is not great Oh whacks you right in the face boom I rip the phone book what's that P

it's rooks ripping in phone books in half for Jesus oh look at this he's been to the bar for Jesus is gonna love us and by the way this is uh this is a newer Power Team this is not the original Power Team power cube 2.0 how is it well the older guys are dead from steroids Jesus now this is a 1991 yeah it is look at the fucking mullet bro and shaved armpits by the way notice that right that Jesus shaved all Jesus loves look at the pants those puffy pants those gym pants hold on what's he saying where's your bro show Jesus took the blinders and rolled him right off my eyes and inside him that bar for the first time in my life I saw the world for what it really had to offer me you know what it was a big fat zero I got in my car I drove home with my wife we got inside our apartment my wife went and sat on the couch I paced back and forth in the living room pro wrestling's a little too good a game it's pro wrestling without the other guy yeah for people who think progressing is too complicated like I don't get what they're saying in Pro Wrestling there's too many people too many moving pieces it hurts my brain I like this yeah it does a huge crowd dude that's like 20 pies plus thousand people I placed a giant Oh in the wrong business yeah look they lift things up for the Lord Oh what happened the mullet bro got real a mullet the fuck is he didn't jump bro looks bigger too he did more roids and got rid of them on his head grew its foreheads large multiple Bo they're gonna throw him into a pit or something this is crazy oh I wonder if he has the same speech or if he gives a different one every time oh that's the same guy bro other mullah Kaiser behind them no yeah it's got the chains on they're the same human yeah they're the same guys it's a clone acting partner maybe they're twins their tag team partners I'm Jerry Springer sometimes you know they find out who's the baby mo Maury Maury was who's the baby daddy yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah has anybody contacted you from them the Kardashians yeah ya know what would you do they slid into your DMS you saw a DM it was Kanye you see the blue checkmark you're like oh Jesus Christ I would snap oh and outside I'm tired of Caitlin - he always be on my side court Fabian yeah I would love that would you obviously yeah no I mean I feel like mmm would they be mad at you man whenever I do a comedy special one things that I do is I have a moment of panic after I'm done os all's I smoke pot I get super paranoid and I go oh shit on that bet yeah so I mean and the last one was my Caitlyn Jenner bet I love that bit when I saw this how you know it's a good day I was like I wish I thought you know you're all yeah that's the angle but it was well I I came I had to think for so long how to do that and that the way to do it was just to shit on myself first and then also have a lot of truth in it about how like I've never been happier but I've never been more of a bitch I live in a house filled with girls there was all women in my house I don't I have zero say you know like yeah where things go or what color things are it's all it's easier to to just let them run I want them to be happy and I don't need my masculine energy everywhere and it's also one of the nice place things about this place yeah this place is clearly like a big this is a bro house bro it's a fucking bro warehouse but so I felt like oh that's the thing because they're turning me softer for sure like women living with all these women I've changed the way I communicate and think and behave I'm turning into a bitch and I've never been more of a bitch in my life and that so the idea was like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles like every day they'd take two it's like what's the you have so many marbles god dad why do you care why do you even care and then I'm like I'm seeing where this is going and then I then I said okay this is what it is that's where the bid is the bid is I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner yeah and then I'm like he's like everybody's like he's always been a woman like maybe maybe or maybe if you live with crazy bitches long enough you fucking become one that's in in Kanye you don't like what you're saying I don't like what I'm saying I mean he's going crazy he's clearly going crazy you live with crazy peeling its entire so that bit was one of the ones where after I released it was like oh poor girl she doesn't need meet him pretending that she got seduced by demons in the mill and I while she's sleeping uh-huh but it was so fun to do it was also a fucked up bit to do because in order to do it I literally had to think like a demon like I would I would think like I was trying to seduce her like I was like I was like whisper in your ear like a demon we would like you better Wow there's no effect on the one of us you can just do that yeah that's really hard I can't I can't be one of you I was born a man you see the old like sentence you see the old like footage of the old Kardashian shows and Bruce will come in like he'll girls in your makeup and then apparently all who's cross-dressing that whole time yeah since he was younger you know what there's a theory by one of the guys who's in the Olympics with him that you know they had everybody was writing it up back then everybody I mean they just they just gave ya everybody steroids and one of the things that happens to men when they take large doses of steroids is that your testosterone shuts down your body just shuts down oh yeah and there's a real there's a depression period there's a lot of weird things that happen to men one of the other things that happens is your body starts producing way more estrogen you get something called bitch tits ah ever see that I got those god no it's different it's called gyno mastica and gyno mastica comes from introducing too much exogenous testosterone into your system your body starts producing estrogen to sort of balance it out and in that process you grow tits well yeah so what this person from the if they named the person who it was but they were saying that all of this happened right when Bruce got off steroids like right after the Olympics like he saw these this transition taking place where he was just baffled and confused I heard that when he was a kid he used to steal his mom's or his sister's clothes I heard I don't know maybe that makes more Simon I don't like these she's a you feel tortured in that leg must be an awful I I really like really feel comfortable like making I don't make fun of like her genitalia or something but like she's really a ridiculous person like you side with that forgetting the transgender thing like she's really funny well how about the fucking kill the lady you never bring it up I got alone that yeah that is I mean all the conversations afterwards all the interviews afterwards it wasn't this existential crisis of having accidentally killed someone and being at this point your life or you're like oh my god I don't have much time to live and I just sent some woman to her grave because I wasn't paying attention at the wheel of my Escalade that never got brought up yeah I don't I don't know like what she felt behind closed doors but it didn't seem like it slowed her down I think I took a month off and be like I got a bug not be out in public and yeah I feel horrible and I'm gonna take care of this family different shades I we care she wasn't even famish crash doesn't talk about that who cares you're so good at that impression you could do her on stage and you don't even need like the face swap like people would just start laughing they know what you're doing I did at large I got fully dressed up and I put like glasses on and I introduce you as Caitlyn Jenner yeah yeah no I came out as like it was a big risk and and Zack Goffman cuz his backstage I'm like I don't I was gonna go and he was like I've done I've dressed up as a woman and I'll just say this it's a longer fall when it fails which is true like if you get all dressed up and you bomb it's like dart has scared me it's just it's lucky that she's ridiculous enough that you could point things out like this is one of the things that people would say about you don't when people are clamoring about what a great person Hillary Clinton was I'm like do you know that she didn't endorse gay marriage until 2013 she was against I didn't know that against gay marriage until 2013 she's a fucking ridiculous person there's hundreds of videos of her lying yeah I mean you hear what she said and you hear what the truth is yeah like the Comey investigation with the FBI found the deleted emails Benghazi she's just not an honest person maybe that's part of the job I don't know but that that if you bring that up to people they have less of an argument well with Caitlyn you bring up the the fact that she's against gay marriage and people go wait what no are you serious like yeah yeah I'm gonna play something and then you play you're saying well I'm more of a traditional girl like yeah it really is so mind-blowing that it it went over you almost can't I can only wrap my head around that's gotta be a joke I can't baby don't seem to care that much they seem to be like letting that slide they don't see how fucking ridiculous that is very hypocritical it's crazy it's crazy as what it is it's like mentally unstable there's there's the bad processing going on absolutely I mean there's no sense or empathy to put that on to say there is crazy first of all the thing about gay marriage to me has always been who gives a fuck right are we pretending that they don't love each other like what are we doing are we pretending that it's immoral okay well it's a moral thing then we have a real argument right like what is morality if it's not two people that love each other you have a problem the fact that they're they're both boys they've done scientific studies that have shown that there's different they have a different pattern to the way their brain thinks yeah I mean they can show the difference in the way it especially with trans kids yeah and trans people there they're showing with fMRIs and all these different ways of measuring like their brains appear to work more like a woman's brain than they do yeah a man's brain like there's there's something going on right right it's not as simple as delusions yeah and then with gay people there's clearly something going on where they're attracted only to the same sex it's like a biological issue and this issue is it exists so to pretend that they're supposed to ignore that for your benefit right Todd no Todd glass sure thought of a great or insightful thing because he live a lot people didn't know he was guys he heard guys talking or people who are like you know homophobic or whatever and his point of view was like he thinks a lot of the a lot of this is from people imagine the act and they're grossed out and really bothers them and he was saying do you want to imagine your sister giving a blowjob no it's disgusting but you want her to feel loved and you wanted to have that happiness and that's all he was like asking for I thought that was a insightful thing I think a lot of times too it's just lack of exposure to gay people when you're young in particular you know yeah you know like having them be accepted by your family and other people and like what if you were around when I was a kid I got really lucky I lived in San Francisco from the time I was 7 to 11 and we were around a lot of gay people my next-door neighbors were gay and they would get naked with my aunt they would play the bongos they would smoke pot play the bongos cuz it was San Francisco rock in the 70s yeah so to me gay people were just like it was a normal thing it was just that this guy's gay this guy's black this guy's old this guy you know it's just a person just different kind of person and then I moved to Florida when we're when I was 11 we moved to Florida we moved to games we basically moved to a different country I moved to Planet stupid and these people that I live I had my friend his name was candy Candido and he was a Cuban kid and his dad was fucking super homophobic yeah and so I remember I went over his house once after school to play and his dad was like I can't believe these fucking faggots want to get married believe this shit he's throwing the newspaper down on the table and I remember I was a I was 11 yeah I was like what's wrong with this fucking dummy yeah why does he care like why is this bothering him at all it didn't even make sense to me yeah there there's a but a lot of people real rage underneath it all which I think they're scared of being gay I don't want anybody out there gay yeah they just it's just just putting it off and it may be like the act disgusts them like but all sex is disgusting any all of it you're doing it wrong oh I am that's why you put it in the butt like what no no don't do that how long have you been talking about like I've been talking to our like 40 minutes somewhere on their wooden ramp it up I'm a gabber huh no we always do this Oh what is a normal length of a show that really yeah you do this twice a week this week four times Wow you're banking of you know dig alive we're streaming live and afterwards we'll put it up on iTunes and it'll upload to YouTube and a little bit you got a whole thing going yeah but it's I have too many guests requests it's like there's almost too many and I love doing it so just do a bunch of them who's your favorite guest don't count down a second calzone again oh wow this is great I don't have one I'm so lucky I've had so many great guests I really don't have a favorite yeah you do yeah yeah I just never heard Sam Harris through yeah yeah and your impression has replaced her real voice in my mind if I see her our team at work yeah yeah yeah okay so I got my shy chef and change chimicherry yeah yeah I'm not sure what she sounds like anymore it might be different so do you have mapped out future ones that you're working on right now a couple I actually have like a song I just recorded because I heard that she hits from the ladies tees no I don't want to research it cuz I don't want it to not be true but that's what I heard so I wrote a song about her heading from the ladies tees do you ever in her neck if my phone is broken I need internet I could do a world premiere right now okay like Jamie can look something up well no it's in my email oh you need our Wi-Fi password yeah here give it to Jimmy Hill sorry let's type it in there yeah what's wrong your phone's just it died it but it's working no it doesn't do phone calls oh I got Wi-Fi but that's it and it dies sometimes for no reason I went to the 18 to 2 store before this I got to go to the Apple Store that's a major problem this isn't interesting but anyway I had my phone break my phone broke in Hawaii cuz I was uh I just dropped it too many times it started making random phone calls I could open the contact screen and start calling people and I'll hang here across somebody outside hang up
