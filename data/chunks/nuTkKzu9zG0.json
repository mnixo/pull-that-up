hello freak bitches is Nowitzki the ultimate Golden Snitch why say Golden Snitch was golden because he's at another level just but he's not a snitch he's an investigator yeah he's not like a garnish involved a snitch would be Victor Conte Victor Conte is a snitch but he didn't even rat on people when he got caught you can't even call him a snitch you call him a post operative cuz he's I can't they he used to rats where I come from but he's see here's the thing he used to be involved in it he's not involved in anymore now he's going after people who are involved in it so what is that that's like an informer yeah but did they ever actually let's not be a snitch because he's really revealing all this backstory like well I just love this time it's fun because it's really the same thing that's what's going on with podcasts you guys don't need like any sort of a country you guys can I have a company though you kind of have Fox I mean not really we have because again they don't tell you what to do because your EIN not well they drive when first started they've been great actually been so good they put this whole way yeah like there's they know they know if they're like hey don't do them like what see you do I that's the thing is like you guys have an advantageous position in the relationship it's not like a regular show where they could fire you from it yeah if they fire you you will have zero impact but there are zero it actually helped us because I have to tell everyone what went down and I will tell all the Fox dirt and I will blast pictures fucking I've always been a snitch on that golden someone fucking makes a Photoshop of you in the Psalter brutalize outfit I just says Golden Snitch Golden Snitch somebody made it already Jamie made it while working on the show Jamie goes yes we do a lot of directing right you did why I ran into you in New York when you were doing the Chappelle show at Dunn chappal the very first episode yeah well I would worked at the beginning and Dave Chappelle's not crazy that's the other thing that drives me nuts you know cuz he walked away but I saw those people micromanage him and drive him nuts they were so rude now Dave's not crazy he's a friend of mine I love you he's a very very brilliant guy yeah very smart and aware and how's the the cojones to do what you said to quit to walk away from 50 million bucks I'm uncomfortable saying this story but she's trying to use because I I know the semantics of the language I'll just say what happened people can make whatever but I was I was directing the show and white commie central executives came down and asked me they said can you tell Dave not the same nigger so much and I said Dave the White County Central Executive them so what Dave goes Bobcat push ah weird and awkward and then they left like I intentionally thought well this will be embarrassing for them this is exactly he told me oh good cuz cuz ya I don't think I've ever come forward that story but yeah I'm witness to that insanity just sell it sell it to the American people what is wrong what can be fixed and what can Gary Johnson do to fix it I want to make a pitch for myself and that is is that I think I really am a unique package I am fiscally conservative I'm as frugal a human being as you've ever met but that doesn't mean that I am cheap it just means that I spend my money wisely I got to serve as governor of New Mexico for two terms I served as governor of New Mexico for two terms as a Republican in a state that's two-to-one Democrat I got reelected by a bigger margin a second time than the first time made a name for myself as a real government skeptic vetoing legislation I may have vetoed more legislation than the other 49 governors in the country combined coupled with that I'm socially tolerant socially liberal look you and I should be able to make decisions in our own lives that only affect our own lives as long as those decisions don't adversely affect others and then there is a very real terrorist threat out there it exists but I do believe that our military interventions have resulted in making situations worse not better so I'm a real skeptic when it comes to government and the fact that government is too big I've been an entrepreneur my entire life I know what it is to hire and fire I know what it is to share in the profits and what a magic formula that is that when you share in the profits amazingly the profit pie grows significantly I've been an athlete my entire life a bit of an ACCI moron as a 63 year old but what athletics has taught me is you know life is putting one foot in front of the other athletics has taught me that anything that can go wrong will go wrong it's how you deal with failure that ultimately determines your success look things go wrong all the time you can crawl up on the couch you can declare yourself a victim you can give up or you can recognize that that's just part of life and wake up the next day with a smile on your face and continue to move forward and just do your best I've told my told the truth I think it's really hard to do any damage to somebody who's willing to tell the truth regardless of the consequences and then I admit mistakes I think mistakes have a way of so compounding themselves just because people don't acknowledge those mistakes so given this pitch all I want to do is just get in the polls that determines who is in the presidential debates I think that if I'm in the presidential debates I have an opportunity of actually winning because of this package that you've allowed me to present here today Joe thank you that's right my act is important not what I think so tell me to keep my thoughts pure is like my thoughts are mine I hate they're mine I do what I want with him that's right so if your girlfriend is just thinking about that big country fucker like a piece of wheat coming out of the corner of his mouth not a tattoo on the back of his neck just layin dick god bless her fat dick lessor whatever she's into like a sailors forearm I am NOT asking ya I mean don't you have moments like in your relationship where you know you're with each other for your life this is a little this is a long time thing I feel like wish me out on music there's times when you get some Incredible Hulk walk away musically and there's times when you're into her and that's there's times when you know there's times when all of a sudden you get you are you about to say this times and she's not into you yes unacceptable walk be a man suck it up you know what's naked not that psyched with me right suitcase in each hand with a boner you chew two viagra you get your dick hard as a rock I'm not saying you don't do those things what I'm saying is you don't ask her why you don't ask what what is it like you don't want to know these things I don't want to know why she's unhappy I want to know I just want her to keep her thoughts to herself if she's banging some big redneck in a truck stop no you don't what I don't want to do you don't want to know she's actually banging or thinking about bang I don't want to know anything you don't want anything oh no what a good husband I want her to just be a good mom a good wife and eat my bread and me and how about she cooked something once in a while why my bacon bread like I'm an old lady flower on my shirt she's sitting on the couch
