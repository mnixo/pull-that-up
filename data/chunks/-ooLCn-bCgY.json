hello freak bitches I was hiking on antelope island one time and just north of Utah they have this big Buffalo reserve out there it's like a public peak probably fixed out now day hike and but there's all these free range and buffalo everywhere on the island you know why and we're coming back down the hill me and my buddy and as we hiking down trail you know about 300 yards down I can see there's a couple Buffalo right on right on the trail on the footpath and we're like that sorry they'll they'll be moved on by the time we get there and we come down the hill come around this big boulder and sure shit they're still standing there me and I you know I my uncle had a farm E had cows I never been right damn Buffalo I don't know the difference in uh something well they'll move it's just a big ass cow you know so we just keep walking towards them my buddy he jumps up on a rock and he's just laughing at me like a dumbass cuz I'm standing there at this point this thing's 15 feet oh my god and it was grazing like sideways was with his hip towards me and just eating and finally he looks up and turns his head and looked at me man it I realized holy shit everything like the size of a Volkswagen Beetle man oh he's just looking at me I'm thinking I saw some dumb shit right wait what am i doing you know what do I do and uh that's a different Buffalo buddy that's a water buffalo yeah like this animal school right there you go topless bison yeah yeah that's so water turns and looks at me and I'm like oh I'm so fucked and uh I didn't know what else to do this is that thing took one more step forward oh you did towards him yeah I knew I don't know what else to do eggs were looking looking right at me and I just kind of like took I didn't know like he's gonna charge me I'm either running or what so I took one more step and he just kind of like often and him and his buddy ran but when he started running me like the whole ground shook and I'm ever standing there looking at my friend thinking like that could have been really bad oh yeah you could be dead no Sturgill Simpson but there's its art its but it's open to the public you hike out there all the time is Buffalo Everywhere's yeah that's how's that a winning combination I like it I do I like it way better than I like the idea of an intern eicher at your own risk thanks for introducing me to dawg because I have to tell you that that video of you grabbing that raccoon and chucking it down stairs was easily one of the most gangster things I've ever seen you bet let's do is this it yes this is this I haven't put a little disclaimer up here so that you know the animal rights folks wouldn't get pissed off yeah that's you can they're gonna get pissed off yes away right now I hear him crying cuz there's no audio on the cameras but he's like just getting mauled by this thing and you just picked it up and fucking chucked it like gangster food though I mean you didn't just push it away you picked it up over your head went back behind the head like you're throwing a medicine ball there's another angle yeah this is the best tackle over the back of the head and Shoom bang we're talking to Kevin Rose the founder of dig I gotta say though it was a little liquid courage I'd had a couple glasses of wine and number two my intention was to go down there and just kick it right but it was on top of my dog so I'd be punting my dog at the same time it was tangled who's tank yeah so I mean you know then I grabbed it and it's it's greasy and kind of bristly whoo so but you know whatever its kind of its when it's your baby I know it sounds weird to say with a dog but it's just like I thought he was dying he was howling like he was getting shredded but with his claws you know so I'm thinking my dog is being killed did you think was a coyote no you know we had seen raccoons in the backyard before and it was just one of those things where they always just kind of like run away the second the lights come on and this time I don't know what he was I don't know if he had babies actually there was some other raccoons that we saw with him at the same time so I don't know man those weird sort of Fringe wildlife creatures like raccoons and coyotes to kind of hang around cities are so creepy yeah there's a ton in San Francisco yeah just all over the place at night they just dig through the trash basically a friend of mine was living out with the Navajos to kind of get his head straight okay and he would help take care of their animals when they this male female shamans both would go off to do peyote ceremonies oh wow he stayed out there for about a year and he kind of put himself together and they what helped you and we were interested in what your medicine is and he said it was MDMA and they said what we'd be interested in trying to experience MDMA so I was invited out there and we ended up doing this ceremony in a Navajo they and they only spoke nama they didn't speak English at all and there was this like in the western movies there was so I'm gonna try a trail of dust coming in somebody came on horseback to be our translator and it was there the food it was there 17 year old niece holy shit and she came to mediate during this MDMA experience and it became clear that this was really for her not so much for them for for them to show their 70 or who's torn between the different cultures that that's something about our culture we wanted what they had or was we saw and respected it Wow and the and a lot happened and and in the it was wonderful in all different ways and there some important healings but in the morning when we were going this young woman was going to get back on her horse and she had seventeen magazine whoa and was reading it and that's right start figuring out that you know even out in the reservation in these protected cultures that it that this globalization of ideas an internet and podcasts and people are being exposed to ideas that they wouldn't have normally been exposed to even in China I mean they're having do so much just kind of sensor stuff [Music]
