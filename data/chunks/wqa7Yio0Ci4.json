the girag an experience that reminds me of the first time I bought drugs the first time I ever bought drugs tell me what you married do you maybe the first time your bio told me that you have story I bet the first time I bought drugs I was in high school and I went to a small high school so I was trying to be like not make a thing to ask about it at first you know you don't want it to get around and like be okay so you were curious yeah I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know who to ask because if you ask like at a small school you like it could blow up real fast right that's how gospel travelled so my friend Steve had just transferred from like the big high school like from a high school with like 5,000 kids and also it was like a weekend I was like let's get a sack and I think we did we just seen menace to society and we were like it was suck but we were trying to tolerate be like hardcore guys like pulling the hat to the side be like he's please did you wear your hat to the Sun no but I think you know a lot of like throwing swag in the shit right and like you know hey let's get a sack you get your blackness on definitely feeling it morning like what's up right I do this shit I got your back right making shit up little too white right yeah and so comfortable with your existence totally and then he's like I hook I know the guy so this is like a Saturday night this like long green like old-school 70s Cadillac pulls up and and it's like he's like that's the dude and this guy rolls the window down he's like yo get in the back and I was like all right cool we get in the back after thinking like that's where it goes down and Steve's like yo this is white Pete I was like what's up white Pete like and then he was called white Pete because they needed to give him a distinction for his name because he was the only white guy that ran with his crew right and he was like we didn't have driver's licenses so he was like exactly what at that moment what we wanted to be in a couple years like he had like the whole you'd like the oversized white tee and like you know go train yeah and fucking like fade he was like what's up I'm white people he talked like Snoop Dogg almost oh right and so we're like all right I thought he was like so we're gonna go get it now I was like go get what like I thought were just doing this in the car wouldn't go get that sack man like oh okay so we started right we'd go 30 minutes in a car we go to the next town over which is Fort Pierce which is definitely a shittier place right so we're driving through Fort Pierce and we go from a Main Street to like single lane highways you know in Florida there's like oh yeah right so we're on a busy then we go to a single lane that has like canals on each side oh yeah and we drive it and then we go from that to a dirt road and then the dirt road off of that dirt road like we're driving down like this is some Forensic Files shit like we're gonna end up on there's a lot of woods yeah la brush groves that kind of shit and I was like fuck man and at this point like I'm thinking about like menace to society and like I want to be in there right now but I'm feeling like feeling really white am I like really scared and so and now it's night and it you know it's like because we came over in the evening already so that's pitch-black outside and we're on a dirt road off of a dirt road like you could scream there's nobody gonna hear shit and on the dirt road up a gravel path I see a light and the light is from a trailer so we pulled up to the trailer and we get out and it's me Steve and white Pete and we knock on the door the trailer and this dude opens the door and he has this black guy it has like six dreadlocks you know each dreadlock is like a size of like a king size Snickers bar he's got six snicker bars coming out of in the hair and why he's like what's up pat pat he's like what's up white Pete and they give each other hugs I was like oh fuck like now this really is like totally Minister Society shit right but I'm tow truck so trying to be cool about it like so trying to be cool about it and then he's like these white boys looking for a sack and he's like yeah we could do that so we go inside the mind you were looking for $20 right and we like with that fresh are you drove in how long is it taking this is a - Travis point it's like we're already 30 miles south why the city we start why would you just say like nevermind after 10 miles because why does it white peaches sell it to you why does he take you on the trip to the guards house I would these are all questions I have don't the balls to ask like I'm in my mind I'm like like I'm 1415 I'm not saying shit to this dude right I'm cool what's up he's gonna sack right so we go into his trailer and he's like we're gonna get to do a sack we back in ten minutes I was like who'll be back in ten minutes he's like we will be you stay here and watch my place and I was like what like what the fuck are you talking about is what I'm thinking but then I just go like yeah cool totally so you're in his trailer and he's like watch it for me I'm like oh no like I'm feeling like that like real fear but I go yeah no problem like I watched people's houses all the time like it totally fucking right terrified right and then he goes like that you walk in the trailer you're in the living room because that's the way trailers right you walk into it there's a bedroom to the right I was like waiting here on the bed he's like there's a 45 and a 12-gauge and he goes anybody comes in my in my house you shoot him and I was like right and then he's like except for my mama my mama comes home don't shoot her I was like got it and except I kept trying to be cool about it I was like yeah like that's what's up I know I know what you say man go get that SEC totally like trying to be like he was like all right they walk out they leave me in his trailer with two guns and a fucking message to not to shoot everybody but his mother and I just sit there and I watch the MTV Video Music Awards and the whole time like every show that comes I just I'm rocking and I'm actually hoping that it's an intruder versus his mom because I feel like if it's his mom she might accidentally shoot her how is she gonna react to my explanation like pepper just told me to wait here well he's getting some weed for me but I'm not but I'm supposed to shoot everybody but you cool with that she's also like how are you gonna react to this so I fuck I mean I'm having a panic attack we finally they come back I get back in with a wee white Pete he drives us back and I'm sitting up again I'm like what the fuck dude that was the worst shit ever like I'm fucking terrified he was like yeah ham and Pat Pat Stephen Pat became like best friends so they became like like super close like that was like his guy who cooked and I'd be like no dude I don't want to hang out with fat fat at all and like six months later when Steve got his license we went he was like you wanna get some weed today I was like yeah yeah so where we go the other four piers pull it to Pappas and I'm like god dammit like so you remembered how to get there he did Steve we had to started going there all the time oh my god we pull up to his trailer this time he kids out now this time like well they're friends this is probably a much quicker thing he comes out he jumps in the back and he's like I was rolling when I was like ah look for a sack again way up high you just have this so this time we went to this buddies the thing pat pat scared the shit out of me the first time but that second time he saved our life actually because we went from his trailer the second time where he jumped in the back went to Avenue D which is the fuckin shitty Street in Fort Pierce like if you're going to like every city go you have like I don't know whatever so you're in there like that's you ever seen have you been in a street where you see open drug dealing where there's not even some type of a sudden loss Angeles right but but you've been down a street where there's like there's no pretense about it there's yes like Los Angeles what's
