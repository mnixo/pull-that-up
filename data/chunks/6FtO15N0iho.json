hello freak bitches speaking and dying tell me about Ian Coulter oh yeah that's what I'm dealing with all day so the same Coulter situaion Coulter was at the roast of Rob Lowe it wasn't live right I was wrong last night but when did it when did they film it last Saturday last Saturday so only a week away yeah so what happened well you know this is the sixth roast that I've written for the third one that I've been a staff writer on and it's always interesting when someone gets booked you know what's gonna happen pop up on an Coulter was one of the last bookings that we had and I was excited to help her in she she didn't want she didn't want to do anything that the writers told her you know that she sort of had to do like to be funny she's like what she didn't think anything was funny so she rewrote everything like the script that we originally wrote anyway she bombed really bad she bombed really bad but what was she trying to avoid like when you said she didn't want to do what they wanted to do well we wanted her to write we went we had stuff in her voice like with her angle and a little bit of self-deprecating at the top you know and I mean right it was you know supposed to be like hey I'm Ann Coulter you know you might be wondering why I'm here it's at the Rob Lowe roast it's because it's the first time that I'm not the most hated person in the room you know like sir like put it on her look you gotta acknowledge who you are but instead she's like man I'm like that I'm not gonna I'm not gonna put I'm not gonna self maybe like you're gonna shit on myself his self roast why would I do that you know she's no no awareness there's no I mean that's it was Werner exact words but she just said she wasn't gonna do that she would just wait out you go you go back and forth via emails and then all of a sudden all the good stuff is cut out and there's bad stuff and some of the stuff's rewritten did you meet her in real life yeah did you meet her in real life before the actual roast or the day of the day of I talked to her on the phone five days out which she was okay on that she's like laughing at the script but then once it's an email you know she rewrote it it was bad you really think that she's less hated than Rob Lowe no not at all everyone Rob Lowe yeah it was who was the most hated person in the room besides her was the joke about Rob Lowe yeah the joke is like ya know she's saying that she's hated right he's acknowledged exactly and she's saying that Rob Lowe's hated so it's a joke it's not really it that part doesn't need to be funny though we just needed her to acknowledge that she's a piece of shit oh yeah and she didn't want to do then instead she came out and literally is like you might be wondering why I'm here or it's it couldn't possibly be to promote my new book and she leans down all awkwardly and pulls out her shitty book and Trump We Trust he promised awesome and she says her new book is in Trump we trust yeah wait for it eeep Laura this awesome that's like the tag of the book Wow she said it and just the roar oh it is what a scrapbook she loves Trump get on that Trump shit money she wrote that is her 11th book she's written 11 bow it's worth good amount of money Jesus what's the purpose of having her on the roast to begin with it seems like the roasts have always had like I kind of like a goat you know like Jersey Shore they had a situation on that one roast we hold that back up I want to read this description put pull let's make it smaller so here we go Donald Trump isn't a politician he's a one-man wrecking ball against our dysfunctional and corrupt establishment we're about to see the deluxe version of the left's favorite theme vote for us or we'll call you stupid it's the working class against the smirking class now Ann Coulter with her unique insight candor and sense of humor haha makes a definitive case for why we should all join his revolution Wow she just bent over she bent over for the man who might be king yeah she was you know she wants to play that character but well if he wins and she wrote a book like that she's in deep deep deep deep deep she would be the one to defend him every time there's any sort a public you know he doesn't like her by the way he doesn't like her he doesn't like her and one of the really funny things is that he changed his immigration policy like tweak the tone of it the day before that book came out and it's sort of like messed things up because look yeah because he's sort of like yes office looks like all about like yeah don't let anybody in zero immigration and he was sort of just like you know he visited Mexico like out of nowhere like the day before her book came out and she's like uh you know it just wasn't good press her back to Ann Coulter yeah so silly bitch so what did she try to do she tries to write her own jokes then yeah you know there's you know I like I worked with Martha Stewart for the Bieber Rose and she crushed her crush crush the first thing she said to me was I want to kill as hard as I can so hook it up and I'm like Stewart's done time that's what I wanted to do yeah she's the best ever she's been in the pokey she understands shit at a level and Coulter with her privileged lifestyle of white people everywhere she goes correct and so Ann Coulter basically says that you know she doesn't like this joke she doesn't like that joke she write to this she puts a pitch for a book at the top first off she was like third to last she was second so Rob Lowe it went and Coulter Jeff Ross Rob Lowe end a show right so all these people went before Ralph Macchio Nikki Glaser Pete Davidson Jimmy Carr blah blah blah blah blah anyway and she got lit up and I mean big-time Peyton Manning Jule everybody they'd hit everybody on the dais you know cuz you always make fun of everybody at a roast of course and then you get the domain target at the end of your thing but when people went in Onion Colter they went in hard you know and very hard like Jimmy Carr at this one joke which I loved which I'm going to completely you know destroy right now because I I don't know exactly how he's set up but it was something like Ann Coulter is here and you ugly ratchet faced piece-of-shit scumbucket like something like that just like five insulting words just gagging I can't get a gang again because you are one of the most insufferable human beings on the planet but it's not too late you can change you could kill yourself and the crowd Wow I mean just everybody hate her so she was great to have on the dais Wow she could have killed me and Mike Lawrence who's a huge pro wrestling fan and Sarah Tiana who's an old-school pro wrestling fan we looked at her like wow we can write her as a heel she'll own it it'll be great we're all gonna look like superstars cuz we were able to make an Coulter funny but instead halfway through the week we realized like oh no she doesn't get it and she wants to do this and you don't want to scare her away from not being on the roast you know what I mean you don't want to be like hey you're gonna you're gonna do terrible they you know there's a chance that you might not do and we wanted it there cuz you know you know she's gonna do good great everybody's gonna shit on her but also you know worse comes to worse people love a train wreck and this was a train wreck super trainer this was like any of it you think no this was like a gif of a train wreck boom boom she was terrible and the one thing Comedy Central did do which is hilarious is the reaction shots that they chose for her jokes like when she was on stage are hilarious like it just cuts to just people just sort of just studying well she made her bones in the safest softest world which is the world of like political commentary where there's five different people and everybody's shouting over everybody and you don't have to say anything that's really relevant and especially her she's just a button-pusher she's a white lady button-pusher and she gets up there and she says crazy things like if Canada doesn't like it we'll invade them ya know she says stupid shit like that that she doesn't even mean you know and like this is what she does she pushed his buttons and Bill Maher calls her his friend and they laugh together ah ha ha ha and she lives in this soft world that world that she stepped into is not just one of the hardest worlds but for a person like her to go on after someone like Jimmy Carr and get Kuro and then attempt to plug her book and all that jazz like I bet she has no idea what the average person's perception of her is because she's dealing with that bubble that fucking talk show and 2dc crazy idiots yeah that that weird bubble where she's kind of legitimate in that bubble and you know she's the button pusher oh here was cum crazy and yeah you know she thinks she's wacky and another thing is you know one of the main things that a roast is when you get made fun of you should laugh yeah cuz it shows that you have a sense of humor that's like the main thing that's why Trump did it now he could be President Charlie Sheen did it you know Trump can be President did a roast hey you Justin Bieber's the number one artist in the world oh it's all gross [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
