and we're back to wrap it up stepped outside sacrifice the sacred plan to the fire gods huh you try to just put Brian in a better state of mind I think you feel like a lot of people are attacking you and I get attacked a lot nowadays I know you do talked about that earlier but we're not attacking you and one of the things that I think that's real important that I brought up earlier is be be generous to a point where it's indefensible be generous to a point where you know you people know that what you're doing is you're doing it all for the right reason I think I think if you're a listener you know that already what I comedy and that was the one thing I started screaming at Duncan was like you don't understand how much I do for comics my free time is devoted to 100% of doing shit for free for other comics now if they I will tell you what I would tell you this though but there's a lot of clubs over the years that have had this theory that well you're lucky to be getting the stage time and a part of comedians we don't respect ourselves we're like absolutely you're actually right but that other part is like fuck yeah but I'm also not driving to Pasadena fucking if we're editing audio software for you I'm not fucking doing all this shit be good that's not the same as saying like yeah usually listen heroes what you're doing you know I mean listen this is what you're doing you set up a beautiful thing all right it ain't bad there's nothing wrong with it and you know when I asked you about how many shows you want just to sort of illuminate people as to what you're doing okay I like what you're doing I like a lot of shows that come out of what you're doing but I think that we have to always be very careful that if there's any money that's ever taking place in any sort of a thing where you're selling comedy comedians get super defensive and super sensitive when you're selling a show and the comics are going to go up and do their stand-up and they're not going to get compensated from it but yet they know that money is exchanging hands if it was a show that people don't use as a workout room for the most part these are people that just like fucking around like not not actually like I'm sewing and plus the fact that there's like seven or eight people usually on each one of these shows I think it's a little different than if I were like hey me are you you are doing a show at the Hollywood scales and stuff well you would not have to do that first of all the reason why you get to control this money at all is because I gave it to you because I don't like I'm not paying you to rent that place out and since then I'm like look I'll give you all my money from my shows so pretty sure these shows will sell I said you do yeah it shows I do or 90% of shows that go on there well I do them every week no you're not there's a lot okay let's not say 90 it's more than half more than half and is more than it pays the rent right the the idea being that I think when a comic knows that you're even if you only make it 150 bucks to a comic that's like why doesn't he make 50 and give us 50 that's how they think you're selling and the problem this is why if at the fact that you guys are doing all this to me I'm like all right bottom line each one of these shows for going in there and wait and being there for five hours but for going in there and putting together all these comics put putting up advertising and making posters for it although this all this shit something for all this shit if it's not worth $100 is not worth $150 I'm not doing it if I'm getting this much trouble for 150 bucks fuck it then I'm gonna hold on hold on hold on 15 bucks a ticket 150 bucks even at 60% I'm saying on average after I'm saying the average after-tax uh-huh that I get after paying the host in comics or whatever it's usually about a hundred and fifty bucks look if you're spending money pay in the comics and you feel good about that and you can you know you could sit down with them and say look I'm because you know what it's the only reason what it is it's whoever you heard it from or whatever whispers you heard it from and Duncan for some reason he's been open long ago I'd say $15 yeah but Duncan's been on one show I like it we'd like the 15 bucks we go to the converse tour right yeah it's like oh what's something nominal say I get it you want it I get it man I get it but I'm just saying that after that I know what you're saying you're saying that you it's not where to do me out you're saying you doing a good thing by creating the spot for them to warm up and they don't appreciate that and that if you're not at least getting something out of it like 150 bucks you're not gonna doing it honestly you know how hard it is like devoting like almost every Friday to being somewhere and on fact of that being on there for like five or six hours that's called a job I completely understand that the worst night ever but two comedians they're also doing a job too right they're also selling something valuable their work in their material yeah and they know that they even if though you are putting together a promotion the promoter shouldn't be the only one that's getting money out of now and they don't well they will we need to work that out that that should be in doubt you know what it should be it should be each one of the comics that come on it go either goes hey can I get twenty dollars like okay I'm not gonna yeah well you might want to ask for money no no if you are somebody that that are like no I think I need to be paid anything I need to deserve compared to more to say those yeah but compared to me III I will do almost any she'll for free I never care about fucking money at all okay Brian but you promised hundred forty dollars what sir hold on just so you know thirty dollars to an MC is twenty paid tickets after I got eight but for comedy I I don't want to get paid for in most part I don't think that I need to be gay I have fun so then why don't you give up this minded people huh why don't you give up the night of people exempt given 20 bucks apiece comportable suffice to I mean I but you have you have in it yes I have a guy the first time I did that I don't think that but I was waiting I said you lead by the hosts so the proposal or any comics that I know like you know they could like how many people have asked from okay but just cuz I'm rewarded me there's less or more deserving of that money knowing if I do a spot for 15 minutes I don't care if you do a spot for 50 minutes to Joe I don't deserve that more right than him no no no one uh the only time I really ever pay somebody is if I know uh yeah for these shows right if I know this person would appreciate it you know like the like dude thank you so much man you know I fucking have no money and stuff like that but when it's somebody that's pretty comfortable like like I feel like I'm very face kinda like if it's some like me cuz clearly cover I don't want you to pay me and I I'm not doing it for money I know decision and this is a show this show has always been like when hey I got this room in the ice house you want to do it's like a workout room so I don't I considered this more like do you want to come to a really good audience at a workout room yeah well then here's here's what you should do now to charge no cover tell the Icehouse hey give me out of t bucks I'll pack this place charge no cover and there's no problem salutely that's a great idea terrible are there yeah great idea because you know why I take my door I'd like 90 nothing about you Jerry I'm not even my buddy I keep it as low as possible anybody who asks for a cop I give it to him and I still give the rest to charity I don't want the responsibility somebody else can completely do the desk desk washer there right right it's very difficult to say you're not in it for money and then say you need a certain amount of money or you won't do it because it's in my opinion uh if if I had to be asked hey every Friday you have work you put into it yeah if you have to go here you have to sit here record you know so I'm gonna go and then and then in these those podcasts usually go from like three to five hours I'm not the podcast cuz some people don't oh those pockets need is to put it all in the hands of the Icehouse give the Icehouse to contact numbers for all the people that want to well that's what I said that's what I taught them pay it that's what I do that whenever I do I know it'll pair they pay their headliners a hundred bucks those always helps people do they really well it's you got it was always a thing 100 bucks for headliners except for those comics fucking money they had an idea laughs yeah you mean they have to stroh that place especially it's got so much history behind and that place has been around for 50-plus years such a great place but I think that we got to be real considerate of comics and the fact that comics have a great legitimate gripe when it comes to worrying about someone making money I mean it has to be explained I think in a in a thoughtful manner and not in this knee-jerk sort of angry Yeley sort of shouty type of way I got other people when you don't even come to me and talk to me well our friends funky of Duncan Trussell oh come on man see this is this is exactly what I'm talking about this is fuck Duncan stop man stop look this is this kind of why because it is on a podcast meet because he's you know what I'm just done I've done so much for that dude and he just pretty much attacked me I was like fuck him well you know what if he had no point no place to stay if he had no the pension shit plane if he had no point if you have no place to to talk to you about this there was no argument there then it would be it would have no impact the reason why it has somewhat of an impact is because it is an argue position is there any other way to talk about it when someone says let's just say this argument say hey so and so you should pay this much money to so-and-so and instead of going like what the fuck I do this and this instead of going I go well let me think about that why should I or shouldn't I pay this person this much money or less money or more money and just have a nice conversation about it yeah now that's why I don't think it's worth it to me well I think you took on a job that you didn't quite know how much time I was gonna take I did take on stage yeah but it takes a lot of ararat them going stick actually to call the bidding people and schedule the times and have them come in it is how many filled with dollars Jesse I went I went from going to doing open mics with a lot of these people that I have on these shows or just going to like different clubs and doing stage time and never doing real shows with these people well you know so when I put decided to take on this crazy shit it was more like hey I got this access to this room I can make a show and we get all together we could have a show once a week week right and she was never it as a financial decision ever nice for fun absolutely the real problem of the things we're talking about the house conversation with Madrigal and you and there at the ice house those nights were like one of the things we're all saying is like and we'll just take the money not not then we will we'll be us but how much how many takes did you have to sell to get $150 fifteen bucks apiece average average I think that thing holds 75 or sometimes they swap in a lot so i 10 so 10 people and you only get you take tax out of that you only get 60% of that huh I'm trying to think how many ticket you have to sell to go over that hundred fifty mark that you normally I have no idea I don't know I don't get a hundred percent of the door you get sixty percent of the door I think so something like that did I don't talk about you need any of this shit anyway because I think I really don't want to talk about a mistake as well and I just handed it over to you because the first couple of shows I was getting happy that word but when I just handed it over to you I should have said let's sit down and figure out where this should go and that we should have the rent paid for the insurance live in all the white bitch internet I to me it's not even worth it to me I'll go I'll go I'll go somewhere else for once a week and do comedy somewhere else and enjoy myself and not get paid for it and just have fun and not that last thing I do is like thank you so much for let me have the stage time fucking you should pay me what the fuck am i talkin oh that's not the way people are why it's gonna be one of those guys it's not and comedians yeah but it just deals as you feel attacked all the time I am attacked have you not been attacked by fucking Jay Mohr getting attacked by Duncan Trussell I'm getting attacked by fuckers blocking more children she never probably attacked by everybody what does that mean attacked what does that I mean not exactly what does that mean they're saying a thing they don't like you you fucking do this to you I'm gonna get at you so there's a path you there's a path with least resistance out there I know it's kind of bring it up on a podcast and getting into it so everyone knows about this and thanks a lot guys what are you talking about Ryan what are you talking about man you make it impossible talked about anything when you react this way turn this into some crazy situation that it's not you know I if you I can understand you don't want it to book a comedy show I can understand it being a tremendous I want a book a time-consuming thing going in well listen let's all talk about this and figure out a way where we can have a show at the Ice House books let's be there professionals that's what you do you know what am I do is I'm Mary doing ice house Chronicles and I will make it just you know some other thing I'll make it just like a green room while somebody else can do the room and have nothing to do with that room what Ryan I just you know this reaction we're getting from you is the normal reaction we get from you when you bring something up so does that make it more likely for us to bring things up to you or less likely to open I tell you why because honestly I am so fucking busy that I don't even need to deal with any of this you know I would rather just do this podcast be happy do everyone else's podcast be happy and not have something that's such a big deal that I thought was just helping friends out I think you got a good point I think you got a good point in that I think it is a lot more responsibility and a little extra thing that you have to chew on every week and I think it can still be done and done through the ice house this way the ice house pays people and will will set aside a chunk of it so you can get paid for running the ice house quantities a lot of tickets plus pay the guys don't know what it's baby hawk so you know what what or I can just do the exact same thing I was doing in any comic that wants to get paid will tell I'll give them along man you can't ask people to ask for money I don't know what I do at the time I go hey you want some cash and then they go no dude and I'm like okay okay well those people how many times that happen a lot more than you would think re well all right never that's I gotta get outta here yeah never officer no don't worry about it's not stupid people are talking about it you don't want to come one of those guys it doesn't pay Peter I don't even feel like talking about I know you don't that's why it's hard to bring up that's why saying I don't get paid it's hard thing to bring up bug it isn't boring it's to me pockets be entertaining that like hey let's bust open Brian and fucking see why he's thinking about financial shit I was trying to bust your butt open on a podcast if we were at a fucking restaurant we could talk about all this I don't feel like doing about this on a podcast that's sorry I bring stuff up through out of the pocket you're the fucking paychecks let's talk about very understandable it's very understandable Brian but you do you understand that you get into this like really angry defensive position with people that aren't even attacking you okay do you understand that you do that sometimes listen man it's avoidable sometimes you can talk in a rational tone I mean and I've been guilty of it as well all the drama that's happening your life is easily avoidable there's some invited dad with like seven people right now some of you know that Brian what you doing is a great thing were you doing with your podcast network for those guys I think she look great those Chronicle shows are great I'll just to do it yeah and what you said about like Freddy Lockhart like needing the the network to get him on that is true it is all true it should they lead with you every time say hey just so you know you do a lot of great things for me but I like to bring up this one thing if it's without help if you don't if you guys don't think that what I do helps comedy it because I mean listen does your letting us I mean I just saw it as you must hate here right whatever you think there's a better death squad idea I would gladly change the name of death squad see something just to make you happy do they do it or not know that it's you desk what is you you're a part of death squad you know all of our friends are part of death squad a fact that you and Duncan don't talk right now is disgusting you know why oh man that is called trimming fat he's done a few things in the past that I've let go and you know what I don't need that guy I've helped that dude so many times and you know I mean been on his podcast wants well the same thing Duncan is no perfect person but I love that guy yeah I'm no perfect person either and neither you I think we can avoid these kind of conversations in the future if we just just calm down a little bit man and what I said about being being in arguably you don't have to be an always generous you can have a generous straight deal with people you don't have to say I'm gonna give you all my profits and that's all the profits I'm saying you just cook that's why are we talking about this on a podcast that's what I'm talking about it we talk about fucking farts in Olive Garden we don't have to talk about only farts and all guard Brian it's nothing wrong with this is a good conversation for all of us you know it's a good conversation for me to understand that sometimes you don't feel like you're getting enough credit for all the work you're doing for all those guys that are on your network and in in you built this platform where a lot of people find you fine people cuz of that platform you've built and I've been very supportive of it Brian and I've been trying to help it and I I talk about it all the time on this podcast and tell you to subscribe to it and I tell people to subscribe to it on Twitter and it's the only way to get it the Icehouse Chronicles is to go through death squad no one's trying to stop doesn't mean everything you've ever done with it it's completely the right way to go you have to be able to bring up something in order to get better yeah we know we're not trying to stomp anything I'm just talking the the Icehouse thing can all be worked out and I think it's it's a huge burden on your back to financially when it comes to the figuring out who gets paid and taking taxes and shit it's just not worth that's not worth I just wanted to do comedy yeah well we can still tell you where you avoid if you slap everybody ten bucks I'm like Ranger you know what I just need a play to go and actually do that for me good all right you talk about I don't have to the podcast we need to hire you an assistant so let's get going with that thought Asian guy what is he do that guy he's gone with the wind dust in the wind oh yeah he's just in the wind I'm sorry if this was uncomfortable a gentlemen uncomfortable but I'm not really uncomfortable it didn't have to be and Bryan needs to know that we all love him and he's doing a good thing just I think that's what it is you don't realize that people still like you if I mention any sort of critique but I did still do like you last Osburn please be positive last ounce price ah fuck Duncan Trussell oh come on how dare you after all that you go you go to fuck Duncan Trussell yep come on let's think of something positive how to end this positive go buy our t-shirt it's awesome no sale yet oh yeah say six eight weeks or sell it some eyes this Brian wrap it up bring it all home bring it all home in a positive way the fans no no it's not a contest there's a fight don't like fights yeah what do you mean the fans know they know how much I work for you guys they know how much you work for us guys you're interesting haut-brion they know they know that time I've been doing all this shit yeah everybody knows the time you put into it Brian it's not bad alright so we won't say I'm stealing from comics would you Brian I've never said you're stealing from coming I know you did it again Duncan knows he was out of line and he was upset at you because he wasn't making an argument about South by Southwest and he didn't feel that you should have been interjecting what you were saying when he is our whole argument was about they offered him to come out there and not Pam it's a silly emotional thing between two guys they got dragged out in a public way that was unfortunate and unnecessary he shouldn't have done that you acted in a very you know angry and you know fucking violent way and I had actually separated to you guys I mean the whole fucking crazy idea now he's trying to leave that the room and you wouldn't let me leave the room she's Howard's him you were pushing towards now I was screaming at him with my pointed towards it's derived you were moving towards him to the point where how to stop you what am I gonna do I don't know if you're gonna do anything I didn't think you were gonna do anything but you were so mad I was mad alright and that's why I say why are we so mad Duncan Trussell Brian and just be like nah you're wrong Brian you know we love you right yeah you know we love you yeah I think sometimes you don't Brian we really do appreciate the work you do we give you lost without you we give you a big hug right now you're gonna feel better no no he's gonna feel way more uncomfortable no big hugs yeah all right we'll see you tomorrow bryan callen mark
