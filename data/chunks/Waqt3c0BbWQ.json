the girag an experience how did it humble you like him away because I realized that when we were let's say when I'm when I film a documentary and suffer ma'am I found a documentary called Aqua nigra and in Cape Verde two years ago aqua negra yep agua does that mean black water yes in Portuguese and then we were there for about five weeks five or six weeks and then the living conditions were really bad and there was no grocery stores around and we had to catch our own food and it was really a self-sufficient type of chip and the first week I remember the only thing I could focus on was oh god this is this is terrible that we don't have a shower there's no hot water battery murmurs disgusting I'm starving is nothing around and then all you can thing is like how he comforts gone and after a week that's the the the focus changed on the good things I was seeing around us and by having nothing all of a sudden then I was like oh actually now for the first time in my life can take the time to realize what's good around me and then how we were having fires with the neighbors and then how we were offering and fish and we were think oh you know if I give this guy to fish it's gonna eat one today and then one tomorrow but no the inviting me neighbor is to share and they make sure that it was like a whole like community sentence to all of it and I was like wow I've been living in London for six years I don't even know the name of my neighbor and it's it's it's it's bad it's not it's not a way of living that I want it's not focusing in the right things and it's it was that that's in that way you know it's realized how much of how much of an asshole we actually became and I just didn't want to do that the moment the cameras went off mahsa walkie twisted a spoon he started getting it to twist the producer had a complete mental breakdown now to this point I'm just thinking this is tricks right it's not it's not that big of a deal he starts screaming yelling that rain evil should never have listened to Randy he would have got this on tape if it wasn't for Randy and he looks down and he's got a wet spot on the front of his pants and he looks down and he says I just had a demonic ejaculation like literally and he's having his mental breakdown I go and I have to spend the night which was not a bad thing she was quite pleasant to look at his his assistant I had to spend the night with her in her room because Randy was calling her I'm not Randy I mean Tony editors were calling her the producer was calling her consistently screaming and yelling about Randy and this kid fuck up you can't just gloss over the fact that guy just nut it in his pants as he was yelling you had a mess it's a mental breakdown you should document that that's I said yeah that's my psychic ability working right yeah that doesn't make any sense so he he in front of everybody he says it's a demonic ejaculation he straight-up says I had an erotic ejaculation was a producer for I think it was BBC if I'm not mistaken he's doing a documentary for themselves yeah well he's fucking crazy huh somebody finished a documentary so oh it wasn't crazy that well he believed in psychic phenomena and he also believed a demon made him come in his pants that is true how are we gonna do this cowboy what are we gonna do filled RBC up when I run out of air I'm now thinking in my mind how

looks at me he says so we're not diving together ever again are we I said no that was it that was it and I text my girl love you baby and today was fucking scary moment but daddy's coming home what does it like to have Jordan Peterson as a dad is it weird you have to check yourself constantly make sure you're on unsteady ground and I said anything ridiculous no not at all not at all I didn't realize it was weird until I went away to university and then kind of saw like just what was away for a while and then when I came back to the house especially because the house was full of like paintings and masks and statues and like 32 different paint colors and they came back and was like oh maybe he's a bit eccentric no he's definitely eccentric we were talking off air about what it was like to watch your dad become famous and become famous and in his 50s right like yeah I hope 54 55 that's when he became famous before that relatively unknown respected professor one issue with this one transgender bill the the preferred pronouns bill and then BOOM off to the races yeah strange it was yeah I was super weird especially how the media was portraying him and how what was actually happening at the events wasn't what was being portrayed in the media so that was weird to watch and then people recognizing him on the street is strange it's yes when you say what what happened in real life was not was what was being portrayed like what was different um mostly what he was saying so most of what he said is on film anyway so you can go to youtube and see what he's been saying like not there's not like some secret that's going around but what's been portrayed has been so much more negative than what he's actually said or they'll take like sound bites and just weave a story that isn't quite true which I didn't treat for some reason I now it looks silly but for some reason I just thought that what the media was portraying was honest always yeah yeah - yeah yeah and it's not they're trapped in there and they can't write get out they they didn't have an option to say I don't want to see him it's really interesting all the different spins though all the different women spins you know and what one one really bizarre spin that I saw was this woman was saying that this is indicative of the problem of all comedy clubs an aggressive male audience and women sitting there feeling threatened not being able to use their voice I'm like user boy what do you know heckle yeah they're saying like you like you would be more empowered if there were more women so you could heckle yeah that's not cool like you're not supposed to do that at a comedy club if you don't like someone just don't laugh you know but like I mean this one here's the thing it's not your job or it's not your place to say that you don't like someone when the other people do like it you know if you're right if you can see them and walk out yeah just like you're gonna see a movie yeah like you're an audience member right the deal is you're not there to perform the audience is there to just sit there and laugh or not laugh right but don't be rude to the other people that are enjoying it so as soon as you bright your sensibilities above the rest of the audience well you're a problem right you've made if you decide like hey I didn't like this I'm gonna go home and write about it that's totally your prerogative that spine get up and walk out that's fine go somewhere else and talk about it on stage yourself yeah nothing wrong with any of those things yeah but this this one woman's take was like women don't feel like they have a they can they have the ability to speak out about it like speak out like so you're saying like to heckle hey I don't want you on stage I know everything about you and your story and it's up to me want you to perform in front of me even those other people are laughing right and that these aggressive men were yelling good to see you back Louis aggressive men like well okay that's like there's a framing of this and this is one of its becomes this male versus female framing that sort of represents aggressive men sexual men doing things to women they don't want the women are sitting there in silence they don't want to be there and they don't have a voice because they feel overwhelmed and out over populated or outnumbered [Applause]
