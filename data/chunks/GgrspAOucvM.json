if you listen to this an audio version you were denied the beauty of my salmon covered colored t-shirt beautiful Tristar you look good and I look very good in your shirt thanks for coming your brother pleasure glad to be here pleasure to have you man I used one of your expressions all the time the touch of death and there is no better example than what we saw Saturday night with Deontay Wilder Jesus Christ can that guy punch I had him losing all their own yeah me too and I thought one round was really close could go either way but I had it six to none and that right hand my god it's so crazy it doesn't even make sense when you look at that shot it landed it above like kind of like in the forehead this area not only not even on the chin no you usually hear if you're a powerful puncher you could days a guy yeah put him out the way he did yeah Wow and no one's up to knowing that just right from here but that's touch of death crazy like nobody ever think about that guy's record 41 knockouts one decision one draw it's incredible undefeated 41 knockouts in 42 fights I mean that is bonkers and he was getting outbox like he's not the best boxer when I doesn't care to Bach yeah yeah that's just you know yeah yeah like it's such a crazy strategy because out of anyone that has ever fought in the heavyweight division he is the one guy that literally can shut everyone's lights out with one shot everyone's a knockout artist Foreman was a knockout artist Frazier Tyson of course was a knockout ours but not like this guy this guy's got it's like another level of craziness I would agree I mean he knows himself that's what's so beautiful mmm-hmm if he was less strategic he would have started fighting really early I mean yeah maybe zap that power he has he knows he knows exactly didn't care he lost six rounds ya know he had no qualms about it and he got hurt just before just before he knocked out Lewis he was hurt and he stayed calm he's like oh now you're gonna come for it now you're gonna walk into the right and bang yeah it's incredible well I think he also knew that from the first fight Ortiz started to fade and the first fight was very similar in that the first few rounds there was very little action and then it started to pick up and then ortiz started to fade but artis put it on him in that first fight if you watch that first fight you're like wow this is a crazy rematch for him to take but in this fight he just fought a perfect strategy just waiting and people oh my god I was on Twitter of reading people this guy can't even box like did you not see what happened you say can't box he's undefeated he's the fucking heavyweight champion of the world he has he tied Muhammad Ali for the most title defenses ever did you really just say he can't box in fact he's a professional boxer go in there with him then go in the if I laced you up be ready father you would be like you'd be so petrified you would turn white and faint the way he punches is so strange it's so strange and you know when he fought Tyson Fury he told me week 209 pounds oh really 209 that's it that's it Oh crazy Wow he's a phenom like all humans are not created equal some people just have a beautiful hand of cards yes that guy's got four aces and he puts him right in your face boom he understands what he's good at mm-hm and he fights that way you're just brilliant yes I always tell my students it's fighting these two things it's one is level you got to get to a certain level and then the second thing you have to figure out your style like you have to know everything about what you do like for instance if you look at Ali and Tyson they fought totally differently to equally in my opinion like okay we could split hairs and say who was better let's say they fight it would be very competitive whoever you think would win in that fight it would be very competitive Ali fights the total opposite of Tyson Ali's circles supposedly the wrong way if you look at the book of boxing that I don't circle towards the power side he doesn't care in his style it makes sense he's up on his toes he's jabbing he barely ever throws a body shot he throws he's throwing a handful of body shots in his entire career whereas Tyson is the total opposite he marches forward he has that peekaboo style he has that you know he's got the gloves tied up to his chin and a totally different style if Tyson tried to fight like Ali he would lose you know but they're at the same level but they figured out hey what am I good at what what advantages do I have physically what disadvantages do i physically and that's why at one point you have to figure out your style and I feel that's where most fighters fall apart they never figure out their style they're trying to do with some trainer told them they're trying to do with the guy they the most admire and the ring does they never find out exactly how they what's best for them mmm that's such a good point because it's such a creative art form in that way and I do believe that martial arts are an art form I really do because to me it's so beautiful like even that right hand that Deonte landed that to me was gorgeous there's never been a prettier sunset or a more beautiful mountain just black what's that's spray that's the the way you see the spray the sweat come off his head and then Ortiz crumbles and Deonte walks away like this chest up like motherfucker you're not getting up he knew he wasn't new he knew he knew when he dropped them he walked off right away like he knew he was called the way he walked off - yeah it's like he knows you know god damn that guy's got crazy power but that but what you said is so important because it's a creative endeavor you're trying to figure out how to land shots and you're also trying to disguise what your ideas are what your tactics are and you've got to figure out what works best for your body type and that's so open-ended like martial arts are so it's so open-ended once the referee says fight there's all this creativity involved and that's something that I think a lot of people don't really appreciate 100% sometimes you have a trainer who kill that creativity because he tells you look this is how you fight right and if you go outside of that mold no no you're reprimanded yeah so me me if a fighter wants to drop his head should you drop your hands and a fighter should you hold them up well it depends what kind of guy you were if you got incredible eyes and you see shots coming from a mile away and you're you you're successful with your hands down or one hand down per se let's say then keep doing it but you gotta that's why I think sparring is so important because wanna be spar we actually try it now we're testing we're testing hey does this airplane fly or is it gonna crash and burn well we better test it in the gym before we take that out in the arena and find out it doesn't fly and I always tell guys look if you're happy if you're fighting with your hands down show me in practice that you're successful then I won't say anything negative I won't say I won't change your style I'll let it be but first we have to see that you're successful because theories is one thing but then when you get in there and tried it's a whole other hmm well Wonder Boy Thompson is an excellent example of that exactly he fights so well with his hands down and he is to me the consummate karate style fighter that has made the perfect transition to MMA because he fights so well with his hands down you don't know where stuff's coming you don't know whether it's coming up whether it's coming around whether it's going straight at you and you don't see it until you're looking at his body and these things are coming up from his hands being down like this and he's standing sideways you can take him to the wrong trainer and ruin him let's say he was really young and he was forbidden that style hmm because some trainers do that they forbade a certain style they forbid a certain type of maneuver or or or style out altogether like for instance in the 70s most trainers would not train a right hand left hand a boxer they'd switch you around no no I don't train left-handed you got to be right you got to convert you but that's a that's a dex dextra meant to the fighter because your trainer is limited and when I only understands fighting in one way now I'm gonna limit my fighter it's it's it's totally wrong in my opinion what do you think about fighters who say that even if you're a right-handed person there's an advantage to fighting as a southpaw because you have your most dexterous hand the hand that you have the most control of is your lead hand and you're also fighting in this unusual stance that is only like what is southpaw is like maybe two out of ten people something like right right here in the West yeah yeah if you go to Asia it's a lot more but is it really yeah the Asians are more ozawa I think you know they the wheel of the cars on the other side and there's stick shift I don't know if like a left-handed world almost a lot of things are the other way around huh yeah like the driving at the side of the road the the the drivers on the other side of the car so I don't know maybe maybe it affects the way you're developed but I agree like I think I always tell fighters try both sides and see which one you like better I can't tell you which one you're more comfortable with maybe one of your eyes is a stronger so you're like this it's kind of killing you so you need to be like that you never know until you test so I like to let the guys figure it so when top people tell me do I grab it like this or like that in some instances there's a right way in a wrong way for as far as we know one way is right one way is wrong and sometimes it doesn't make a difference I tell guys grab like you're comfortable because I do it the way I like to do it I don't do it the way my trainer showed me so in this particular instance I say it's a question of comfort like people freak out if you grab a key more like this with your thumb mm-hmm I don't in some instances I grab the kymaro with my thumb and some instances I don't mmm so I just show people both and I say look at that part it's up to you you certainly can't finish it by using the Thunder and and some of this is stronger with a thumb in some instances yeah because you have better hand control sure yeah you know just clamping down on it you're actually isolating it I mean some people have just ridiculous grip with their hands too and that should play a factor in there as well do you remember Semmy Schilt yes so he Scheldt the head hands they're as big as his table and he'd grab ahold of guys wrists and they just fucked like if you were in his guard he just grabbed your wrist yeah he did that with faith oh I was like then and Paige did that with the lima yes remember that yes mm-hmm crazy yeah well that's a great fight too huh Lima that's that's an argument from me that Lima is one of the arguments from me where I feel like there's got to be as a fan I want to see Lima fight the best 170 pounders in the world so a co-promotion I know the UFC never wants to see a co-promotion because that promotes up pumps up Bellator but right now Lima especially after he just decisioned Rory you know and the way he knocked out Michael Page I mean nobody nobody's done that to Paige before and the way he did it like that guy can put anyone to sleep can I ask you who did you give around the 1/2 page versus Lima I thought it was 50 felt like I was right on in the middle I'd have to watch it again cuz all remember was Lima starching him in Rome well no no I mean when when did it end around 2 rounds just yeah but he got hurt right before he knocked him out he got he got a little wobbled and then he kind of got his base again I was low kick boom yeah yeah yeah vicious yo he's he's so dangerous he's so dangerous and his low kicks are some of the best I never seems fight with Rory yeah Jesus Christ that swelling on his leg did he say that took like six months before he could his legs still not the same I realize it's like it tore some fascist so if you look at it that's this legs a little bit like there's like some hanging soft tissue yeah oh that's like Pedro his own remember Pedro his own when he's fighting heavy weight yeah he would kick guys in the leg and they'd have this look on their face like what in the fuck is that yeah yeah yeah there's levels that's when this the rematch want to make sure we got to take that off the table you know yes I look forward to it to a trilogy match so it's one-on-one now you know Rory's Roy's had some conversations where he's talked about like not fighting yeah you know what I think he's had some mixed emotions but I think he's clear he wants to fight now like there's no question about I think it was just that moment in the ring and he was emotional but once his head clears up but he wants to fight again like I don't think you could stop him from fighting like he loves to fight well he's so good he's so good he'll be like and well what did you think when he went up to fight Mousasi I was worried about that fight I didn't like that fight I didn't like that fight either but you know you want to win double gold you got to take that risk but personally I'll be I'll be honest with you I don't think you should fight a champion in his prime when you're away class below like when they were asking for BJ Penn versus George I was like yeah let's do it George is in his prime right now right you want to bring a champion and they got another belt and but I think it was a bad decision for for BJ like if I was be just trainer I wouldn't let him do that like for instance when George when they want to put him with Anderson Silva I said look give me a game plan that was I'm really confident in and then we'll do it but maybe not when he's at his prime like it's just so dangerous or not and I'll tell you why you can win but then be shorten your career yes because at that level yeah 15 pounds more is 15 tons more well there's fights that people win and even if they want like my position on steep a versus Francis and Ghana was very similar I mean I know steep they won that fight but Jesus Christ Francis and Ghana he scares the shit out of me man he hits people so hard when he knocked out Alistair I mean literally like he saw his soul leave his body and then steep a survives that fight but then gets kayoed by DC with one punch and shortly afterwards and I mean that's something that I don't want to take anything away from DC because he clearly landed that punch it was clearly a strategy of working in the clinch and is a beautiful punch and who knows maybe he lands that beautiful punch in the rematch and he knocks him out again maybe it could have happened but it didn't you know and I wondered how much of that punch having such a dramatic effect on steep a who's had an amazing chin most of his career how much of that was because of that incredible war that he had with Francis because the first round of that was terrifying it was tariff and the thing is if in Ghana loses he's gonna lose in a way that's not so bad but if you lose to in Ghana it could be the end of your career yes like you may never be the cents so did he help DC well for sure you know it's all cumulative yeah excuse me but other fighters I mean John Jones helped music as well but I get what you're saying and like in Ghana's got the touch of death like if I was this trainer I put him in boxing as well like I'd be looking at boxing fights well you know he's talking about that well he should be he has a few fights left on his UFC deal and apparently his ideas to one day make his way into boxing which is just a fantastic guy he's so big he's lifting weights again apparently just randomly I ran into his agent at this place called dreamscape you know a dreamscape no dreamscape is this cool virtual reality thing in LA you put on these goggles no he's a venture and his family in my family did it together just randomly just happened to be teamed up together and we were talking about Francis and he was saying that Francis wants to eventually fight as a boxer as a heavyweight boxer that's his dream and that right now he's been lifting weights and he's like well over 270 he's apparently like to 75 to 79 somewhere in that range he's but he's got to be careful with weights cuz weights could actually make you weaker like if you if you if you balloon yourself up too far I can guess you out and later on like you don't sustain the ability of your power right there's a right amount of muscle for each athlete i mean ii just i don't know i don't agree that bigger is always better more power it's not necessarily the case but he has to stay within his natural limits for optimal power also he has to make sure that look at a guy that big at 279 pounds he's probably not really accustomed to cutting weight areas while bowling in it because his thighs all the power that guy has though just ridiculous so he's yeah he's at the USC Performance Institute so he gets a chance to use all day of an amazing facility there have you trained down there and all yes I have I've been in there a few times it's incredible I was actually supposed to work with an gun but we had a little trouble connecting but like getting him in the country and all that I'm supposed to work with - montreux yeah yeah but ya know I mean I would definitely put him in boxing so I would do both I would do MMA in boxing but like it's a second Thailand you know in Thailand if you've got good hands like if you do a couple of Thai fights Muay Thai fights and you're not a couple guys out with your hands they take you right away into boxing like they see the potential yeah this is more money in boxing if you roll champion Muay Thai it's not the same with being world champion in boxing how much you think Deontay Wilder won this weekend I don't know but the way he's winning he's gotta be it's gotta be something special I hope it's gotta be he's heavyweight world champion yes I would I would hope but well the interesting thing too is the this tournament that's involves unofficial tournament right because what do we have are we a week or so away from the rematch between Andy Ruiz and Anthony Joshua it's got to be coming up somewhat I think it's about a week I think it's next weekend mmm looks so good in training and Andy Ruiz man you can't judge that guy on his belly you don't know nothing if you think that's what it is you think that's what fighting is you guys have a tissue somewhere sorry man it was like his thank you his hands are spectacular the fluidity of his combinations it's gorgeous man it's been Rocky oh he's so good I love watching that guy throw combinations and when he fought Joshua that was the thing was he if he hit him once he's gonna hit him 13 14 15 times after that bang bang and the hands are like a middleweights hands I mean he's so fast he moves he moves beautifully takes a shot great - and he's such a like a sweet unassuming guy like he wins the title and you're like fuck yeah are you happy for him he's such a nice guy man but do you think yeah Joshua underestimated him well the word is and this is from people that that really know what's going on this is I mean I can't give specifics but apparently Joshua got knocked out in training oh really yes like a couple weeks out like bang and that's one of the reasons why they say his father was so furious at the promoter after Ruiz knocked him out and it's also one of the reasons they said that he had some sort of a panic attack in the locker room leading up to the fight mm-hmm so if he was compromised any news compromised you know and you know as well as anybody there's certain knock out so you can get in the gym that can fuck a fighter up for months oh yeah of course yeah I've seen it that's why in the practice room I don't like rough training I don't like rough training like certain fighters who are coming up to a fight I'll let it go further I get it we need the intensities but I don't like to go in the gym and see this guy knocked out this guy then this guy knocked out this guy and that what happens you go in the practice room there's nobody there the next week for sparring we're sparring has to be practiced not fighting right so if I had a world champion any sparring and I felt one of his sparring partners was out of control I would definitely vote auch with him are not use them anymore like when George when George spars I pick all his rounds but they have to be they have to be reasonable rounds not not and I mean not touch sparring but not also being malicious and trying to injure each other but George told me that you told certain guys to try to knock him out yes yeah that's true also I put a bounty on him as well because the guys at one point he was too famous nobody wanted to touch him no more it was too low Oh put him on the ground I'm gonna Twitter it for you your tinder is gonna explode you're gonna become famous you're gonna be the number one man on to it tinder everybody swiping right for you yes be done I got pumped them up because they're to the hots GSP right right you know that so there's a balance there's not there's too little and then there's too much you know so I mean if you're trying to like throw vicious knees when you know like if you if I see you're trying to be rough overly rough cuz this is a control you know if I touch you I'm gonna back off if I hurt you but if I touch it now I'm trying to knee you and kick you and I'm trying to like right that's like hey this guy's and the thing is with George sometimes I'll keep a guy fresh so he'll be he'll be two rounds in then I put in a fresh guy that first guy has to have some control as well because you're just tired now you know he's fatigued and etc so I mean there's a balance there's too little and there's too much so if you if you get knocked out in practice before a title fight it could be an accidental but it cause to be negligent so guys are just too rough cuz sometimes you do go in boxing gyms and it's like kill or be killed yes that's the attitude yeah well it's a lot of MMA gyms as well I agree it's um it's very unfortunate because Allah people they ruin their career inside the gym because their sparring not just once a week but twice three times a week and they're going in they might get concussed they might get concussed on Tuesday and spar again on Thursday and that's very very common absolutely there's no regulation no one's stopping you from sparring if you got head kick tomorrow no one's stopping you from showing up on Saturday and put your mouthpiece in and going into class it's just it's nuts it's not say it's nuts and I think most people don't think about those sparring sessions as being cumulative like that adding on to the the number I always tell people to look at their brain like a punch ticket like let's say you have a hundred spots and then punch ticket don't use them up sparring with some guy where you just decide to bite down your mouthpiece and go to war with this guy for no reason that's you've got a if you want to be a professional fighter you have to act like a professional you have to treat your profession with respect and think that you only have a certain amount of time in the game and that's what I mean this thing that you teach and this thing that I love this mixed martial arts it must be treated with respect because when done perfectly and when done and when someone wins a title and someone has an amazing run like George did when he was the multi-way champion I mean it's a truly spectacular thing but it can also go terribly wrong and you you have to like it's one of the reasons why I asked you is Rory wanna fight and he said yes he wants to fight nothing it's not that's beautiful I want to hear that and the worst thing you could see is someone who maybe doesn't really want to fight anymore and they keep fighting and they keep getting knocked out and no one tells them hey you got to stop I was I was talking to Freddie once upon a time Freddie Roach mm-hmm and he was telling me about you know different guys how they trained and one boxer I don't want to say his name but he was telling me that guys that guys routine was 12 rounds of sparring every day is that James Toney you know you know you know it's kind of him he's one of the greatest counter punchers of all time oh yeah but when he when he was fighting the new UFC Wow yeah yeah yeah I know it's me but they had to put subtitles he's speaking English right they had to put subtitles yeah you know what price yes how what price you can do 12 rounds a day so there has to be like look at the Cuban boxers they're not rough in practice look at the Thais they're not rough they're technical the times especially ties especially they play I love Sancho Sancho is one of the greatest Instagram pages too because you see all his training and you know he's sparring with no gloves on no shin pads they're just tapping each other and slapping each other and when he's not doing that hitting pads MMA fights I know fight bare-knuckle smiling ear do you know a bare-knuckle fight they brought him a foreigner he's never seen before the foreigners 20 pounds heavy he's got 80 fights he doesn't care he doesn't even care and it's bare-knuckle and he's there walking now that's like he smite I'll be petrified listen I'd be like okay this isn't it like I got a killer beat up the guy so relax incredible I love how light he is on his feet like it's perfect example of what you're saying even though he's fighting in this discipline Muay Thai he fights his own way I mean if you saw silhouette of sunshine fighting you'd say well that Sancho and he's got his way light on the feet switching stances all the time like really interesting style hmm that he developed this yeah yeah he there's so many ways to do it and you don't know which one is right till you try it on let's always tell guys when I showed him a new technique I say do it for two weeks if you don't like it after two weeks I won't ask you to do it again but you gotta have that grace period sometimes you teach something to somebody and I've done this too I learned I'm moving I'm like no I don't do good thing like that and then a year later I'm like that's my favorite way to do guilty and I got changed my mind about us why because I tried it out I actually figured out the nuances after exploring it a little bit more and all of a sudden I like this guillotine above this one do you ever fuck with this pretzel grip yes sometimes that feels so weird when you do it in the air but goddamn when you do it on a person it feels amazing it feels like one of the best grips when I do this I've tried to sweep so that's hard like if I like this is I'm gonna sweep you well because you have more leverage ah yeah my formal my form is inclined so I'm like this my elbows down if my time like this my elbows up no it's easier for me to tilt you and then you got like Marcelo who grabs the hand on the outside he grabs like the blade of the hand and that's his grip and his thought is that he's sliding this in better and also for the rear naked which is his specialty so if you're rolling if he goes through that and he's rolling he gets your back again he's always sliding under the chin he's got a vicious guillotine like it's kind of vicious everyone I felt it you're topping right away yes no compromise that's yeah it's some that it's a blade of the bone against the esophagus to his his style so unique to because everything was based on no no big man moves right like he didn't believe in Kimora's this doesn't do Kimora's no Kimura cuz it's like you know you if you're doing a Kimura against a big giant guy you're not gonna be able to get it because you're not gonna be able to he's gonna wrestle out of it so everything he did was all neck based do you ever see a smaller guy Kimura a bigger guy very very very rarely yes be exhausted right so he use as a grip yes but not as a finish right because this philosophy is if the finish doesn't finish everybody mm-hmm it's not good enough well there's a lot of guys who teach a system based on Kimura traps like using the Kimura to get to the back using the Kimura to set up an armbar and I think that's a that's a I mean like I'm a fan of a Kimura and jaakko who just left is he'll rip your fucking shoulders off he's a Kimura Master but he's also a gorilla yeah you know I mean Jacko's 511 240 and he's fucking he's a tank yeah he's all about ripping shoulders apart Manette cranks I if if he grabbed the Kimura me I'd be freaking out like I know that's that's really bad yes you know I when I'm rolling with a bigger guy I know that I have to do everything not to give them that grip yes you know it's it's like you have to know the pros and cons of every hold I believe in Kimura I trained my students kymaro because if you don't do Kimura you're gonna get caught in Kimura right it's such an effective way to get out of certain situations sure yeah if you don't know Kimura it's like if you don't know Darce like when when darts came on the scene everybody was getting Darst by the guys who knew doors right when when anaconda came out on the scene everybody was getting caught in anaconda leglocks came out on the scene it was a leglock fire everybody if you don't know the linen like a hot game you don't know the new leglock game you're done so every time there's something new I like to learn it whether I like it or not long-term we'll know it so if you try it like I know what you're up to you know it's kind of like a magic trick you know if you show it to me again I'm not so surprised right what are your feelings on guys like Gary tonin who's doing fantastic now in MMA but he hasn't really faced the upper level of competition we're not seeing anybody with that style winning I mean since Paul Harris who was a similar sort of modified sort of severe but similar leg lock attack look I think ultimately the most important martial art is jujitsu and I'll tell you why because to beat you Jitsu you need to mix with something else boxing wrestling Taekwondo whatever but you gotta have some jujitsu because if you have zero digits when you're going into the fight you're gonna get you're gonna get beat styles like jujitsu need a lot of time so if your foundation is jujitsu because how was jujitsu developed in Valle tudo the Brazilians had no time limit when they were fighting in Brazil it was a two hour fight a three hour fights so what you took me down you held me down for three minutes nobody cares in Brazil Holly - don't nobody cares the fight will go on - somebody taps so takedowns are not as important the fights gonna last 3-4 hours if it has to last whatever it is why wrestling is being so successful MMA when it's a great sport for sure but it's it's time-sensitive if I take you down in the middle of the round you got two and a half minutes to sub me or get back up to your feet all I gotta do is hold you down and I won the round I have to do minimal work now I'm down I'm up around you're down around you you gotta get you got to come after me now so it there's a time-sensitive issue however if I take you down and there's no time limit I'm gonna behave very differently then if I know I can bank in this round if there's just two minutes left I'm gonna spend that energy to hold you down I'm gonna spend that energy to kind of like shut you down to kind of like give you little punches they're not fight Enders but they're round winning mmm so because we have these rules that's why I love pride it was a ten minute round grappling needs more breathing room and needs more time for it at work yeah like you look at who's man versus Demian Maia and round one Demian Maia had a partial back take against the fence and whose man was like almost giving his body got fucked by the referee the referee the state should never interfere it's not a real fight you got out of my control because of the state because of the referee because of the the whistle because of the bell whatever it is we have to start in this position again if I take you down on the ground and the bell rings I should start again on the ground there should be some basic positions that the referees gonna choose we're starting in this position because that was the closest to what you guys had when you we when we ended the fight I like that yeah how many fights would change how much behavior would change fighters would chain they've chain differently fight differently or make it one 15-minute round I'd like that too that's that now you're gonna see jujitsu you know what else I like no cage no kids no cake what's it gonna be how come they can play basketball in a giant court how about it's a big place today basketball it is but okay because you think there should be no interference with about a football field put them in the middle what are the odds they're ever gonna get to the edges but okay let's say we're to get into a fight okay right here well shit in here exactly but this is this is an unnatural environment we get sure you can't move is moves you should be able to protect yourself at any environment side control wheel kick in an elevator we can't but the wheel kicks a valid move absolutely but how about this we don't know if it's gonna be a cage an office a podcast and you should find that I'll fight night veer it'll be crazy it's just they roll the dice before the show's like a giant wheel maybe yeah right yeah like a wheel is like five or six different things in the wheel exactly anything football feel bad cause I don't know yeah do you remember they did I think well world combat Club a world combat league where Wonder Boy came up Chuck Norris yeah they had like a ramp bolt yeah yeah yeah and you would fight on that so they knew when they got to the elevated edges but at least you could move you're not restricted but of course there was no grappling in that it was just drinking that was kickboxing pka style right like above the waist wasn't it or like cakes they were like any but they wore pants right pants yeah and you're a lot to me but now look at this yeah this is beautiful Oh wonderful I was a master on this too it's so interesting that seeing it in that bowl look when you see it like that there's no there's no restriction as far as like there's a there's no boundary to push up against this is wonderboy in his actual kickboxing style he was so good at like leaning away and then firing back and then also that right high kick that he would throw over the shoulder where you didn't see it coming until it was too late moneymaker yeah boy so slippery ask for that fighting on without the cage you want to have cage techniques anymore that's true that's true but I feel like there's a lot of wrestling that gets done against the cage that sort of assisted its assisted wrestling assisted takedowns and even takedown defense right it's if you're in the middle of the cage and you get up that you earn that that's legit but if you're up against the cage you can kind of press your back up against the cage you can wall walk you can get back to your feet it's an added element there is if that sneaky right high kicking man but this you know I don't know if this work with takedowns because of course someone would fire up and keep driving over the top that takes takedowns change everything yeah they do they take down they take downs change everything so do elbows and the clinch so the head head butts head butts change everything - you know I had David leduc in here from that way yeah watch his fights watch some of those left lay fights you realize like that's legit man Rory once he was like he was between contracts and he's like look me a fighter let way I'm like why do you want to fight let way it's like because now's the time or else I'll never get to fight with headbutts before I resign he wanted me to take him down to the jungles of let me fight for $10 against some guy we don't know no medical test you know you're the foreigner they want you know like it's just he's nuts I was like no that's a very bad idea psych come on I'll never get to fight with headbutts or else I'm like okay I hope you never fight with him I hope that day never comes well I mean you remember the old days yes Mark Coleman Mark Coleman used to take guys down and smash their face with his head you would hold on to their biceps and boom headbutt you and punch in the face me a very dangerous attack boo kids especially from a giant dude like that very thing ya did it's it's also effective I mean the argument is look if you could punch me in the head why can't I use my head to hit you alright if you can kick me in the head it what is so much more dangerous about me using my forehead to hit you with long-term long-term repercussion don't you think I don't know would it increase the level of concussions or decrease the level of concussion it's a good questions for me that's the major sin of our sport the concussion the concussion I wish I could take that away if we could take that away I think would be better because these fighters would be healthier long-term I'm hoping that medical science somehow steps in and comes up with a solution that's legitimate similar to solutions for repairing ligaments right like if you have we're not gonna outlaw heel hooks right and they're there they're a real legitimate part of the game but if you get someone in an inverted heel hook and you crank on that fucker you might rip that guy's knee a part so that guy might have to go and get everything replaced and get you know cadaver ligaments and the fake ACL and all that jazz we're not gonna stop that though it's a legitimate technique the sidekick to the knee that we see a lot of guys use on the upper thigh with it hyperextends the knee there's gonna be someone who's get to gets their knee blown out I'm sure it's happened in other organizations I don't think we've had it in the UFC if they have I haven't heard about a Whitaker no yeah I definitely heard it but I don't know yet if it blew out and then he went and did it in the rematch yes right away and also Jorge Maz Vidale did that too wonderful oh no dare until did it - wonderboy oh yes yes same truth that side kick to the thigh so if there was a way that they could repair brain damage the same way they could repair ligament damage I'd be so happy you know I mean sulfinate Lee IV stem cell you know some some way I mean they're experimenting with things and I know they're having some positive effects but you know nothing is like hey you tore this go to the doctor he'll fix that you know we're not there yet because the thing is like with with the headbutts the fighters are going to go and train headbutts after right they're going to be hitting the bag me doing on this thing and what is the training gonna do to their head well have you seen whether LaDuke does no he does head butts on the pads so he'll do like accommodation on the pads okay yeah but let's see when he's 50 like 28 yeah exactly give him a call when he's 50 let's see you know like I don't even know what I found I think health first health first for sure we're taking we're not living in a bubble is telling me like some some guy wrote me an email recently like tell me he was in tears he's trying to stop his kids from doing MMA and to give him something to convince him not to do MMA because you know there was the boxer had died and you know what the thing is we don't want to live in a bubble I don't want to live in a bubble everything I do I take a risk in life I calculate look I'm petrified of airplanes I'm petrified but when I take a flight mike is this an acceptable risk in my life yeah so it's it's safe it's just psychological I'm being irrational here and I get on that on that flight statistically it's MMA safe it is people don't die in MMA it's like in any sport people will die like you if you look at football there's gonna be deaths if you look at running there's gonna be death so it's death however it's a safe statistically it's safe they take every measure and the referee is there they do your medical tests before after I mean it's as safe as it can be and look what it gives us it gives us proof of what real martial arts is because before MMA we didn't know what fighting was like we had many theories but it's not what we have today and if you look what we were doing before UFC oh it's totally different yeah it's crazy what happened in 26 years yeah 26 years the world has just been flipped on the 10th I've said many times that we have had more advancement and innovation and more growth in martial arts over the last 26 years then we have over the last 2,000 years and that's a fact there's no getting around that it's just an instantaneous burst of knowledge and understanding of what works and what doesn't work and the Gracie family is a huge part of that gigantic gigantic it probably no not probably the most important family in the history of martial arts I agree yeah there's nothing I don't think there's close to that's influential maybe most influential yes yes definitely which reminds me of Chrome Gracie's fight what are you think about against cups awesome well it's a big jump up you know yes cups wants a massive amount of experience I mean against elite world-class competition you know fought Josie I'll go back in the WEC days I mean Cub Swanson is stud he's been there done that he could be champion yes he could be Jess he could be champion and he's also a legitimate black belt in jujitsu too so he's not not easy to submit and for chrome to go from Alex casseras right into Cub Swanson this is a giant leap and look Chrome's Jiu Jitsu is top of the food chain I mean he is an absolute legitimate world champion caliber Jiu Jitsu talent from the best DNA the world's ever known right he's the fuckin son of the king like can I ask you a very tough question please if there was no time limit cap Swanson versus Crone who wins I saw him no I wish we could watch round 3 I saw no evidence that chrome was taking cub down no the technology we're not gonna come just yet I think it would take a while yeah but do you think chrome was gonna was gonna go away no it wasn't going away he's an animal he's got a heart of a lion he's got a heart of a lion takes takes a tremendous shot both to the face into the body no fear no fear no fear no fear real warrior if there was no time limit I'm tell you I don't know who wins a fight yeah I mean he won a decision right you could always use that argument if someone wins a decision and kraan never stop coming right no he wouldn't even look like he was he was remotely gonna start thinking of slowing down but I mean there's the other question is how much does he endure if that fight goes 30 rounds I mean how many more shots to the head does he take and does eventually his brain give it I don't know that question yes maybe he catches cup I mean he can punch I mean that was the one of the reasons why it was so competitive and interesting basically was a kickboxing fight right mm-hmm and in that kickboxing fight the jiu-jitsu master landed good shots I mean cubs face was cut up at the end of the fly was not like he was untouched so I think I mean I think what a guy like Crone needs is a guy like you I mean that's what it needs I would love to work with Crone I mean that's what he needs I don't know who I don't I know he does a lot of work with the Diaz brothers I know he does a lot he has his own gym mm-hmm he's a very successful jiu-jitsu school of his own but I think a guy like that needs to just put together the overall game so that he could see the best expression of his jiu-jitsu which is which is ultimately going to be his strength but it's I think that has to be expressed in a more confusing and harder to solve puzzle and so right now here's the puzzle walk towards you throw punches once I get you I'm gonna strangle you but but if I don't get you maybe I don't strangle you and a guy like cub knows he's coming so he the thing about a guy who comes forward all the time is it's so much easier to counter than it is to attack it it's ways this Anderson Silva's whole game you remember that the fights were interesting Silva had boring fights like tile 8s and the guy's not coming forward yeah hung back yeah guys who just hang back you know Patrick Cote same thing he just hung back on when you're finding a counter Blanchard doesn't don't give him anything to count hang back yeah yeah make him attack I remember when you had Hickson on your podcast and you had asked him like what do you do if you can't take a guy down and he was telling you I pull guard yes but then he was telling also when I pull guard I have to open the guard and it was like okay well then I'll just back out of your guard yes if you if you pull guard on me and you keep your guard closed of all okay we're on the ground if you open your guard I can just get up yeah and it seemed like and then you were like okay if he gets up well I got a pull guard again but it was like a circular type of strategy we don't even know with Hickson right because we never did see him against the cream of the crop you know Funaki was the best fighter you fought Moonachie was the arguably towards the end of his career when he fought Hickson and you know he did some damage broke Hickson's orbital member yeah that really fucked up swelling yeah yeah I was all fucked up as well enough I have to go watch it and he also fucked Hickson's Nia or he'd Hickson fuck his knee up oh no no he Hickson fucked his knee I'm sorry he was standing up over Hickson and Hickson kicked his knee like he extended his knee when Hicks was on his back but now at the end of the fight Hickson's I say go to Coliseum mm Hicks and Gracie mm I had a I had the honor of going to Hickson's house one night I really had dinner with him and Crone chrome was a young kid man he was like 15 16 years old and then we went to Hickson's house and then we watch fights and Hickson was breaking down fights breaking down what other guys were doing wrong breaking down space like you hated space like jiu-jitsu guys got people on the ground and you know he's just talking about various positions and different things that were happening in the fights and then we watched that fight we watched it Funaki fight which was that was his final fight so this was Hickson basically you know in his prime and backed I mean he was muscular too man Hickson was a big guy back then well over hundred pounds was hundred ball yeah he was about 200 pounds like but solid as a rock man and musics incredible yeah and he fought I mean Funaki was a real world-class fighter this was probably the guy who was the most dangerous guy that he fought me when he fought in Japan Valley to toe those guys just really had nothing for him the one guy I got him in a guillotine remember and held on to him for a long time but he eventually got out of it and submitted him that guy was a Japanese pro wrestler right mm-hmm but but that's what they had also at that time mm-hmm yeah like he well Takata Takata yeah yeah I remember he was the first the first Pride people forget was Hicks and Gracie Vince and Gracie fought Takata in the first Pride so eventually this fight goes to the ground scoot ahead real quick eventually this fight goes to the ground and Funaki landed a big shot I see Hickson's I was all fucked up you could see it well I don't if you could see it there no you got to see it after the fight after the fight he gets him on the ground and he reversed his position and then he eventually chokes him completely to sleep back a little bit it was pretty radical so here he is he gets see if we could see right before this go right before this Jaime right before this oh you could see the setup see he's punching his gift wrapped in them he's got his hand wrapped across his neck punching him in the face oh he's got knock his hand across his own face and he's punching him in the face and then foon Aki's forced to try to move to better his position and Hickson eventually sneaks his body behind me cease using his left knee and sliding and now he turns him and he gets his back shitty camera worked there they should have showed that transition but he got his back and then when he chokes a mouthful knock his eyes are wide open and he's completely asleep and Hickson gets off of him and kicks him aside it's so nasty look he gets him and he and look Funaki like kind of knew he was getting put to sleep too so he's out cold and Hickson just climbs off and kicks him off get off me get off me bitch but you see his eye like when they close if you see if there's a close-up on him Hickson's I like after the fight yeah Hickson not not Funaki after the fight his eye was pretty fucked up right there right there you see it say I don't remember them yeah his left eye was completely swollen what did he get hit with I don't remember him getting hit lunch that was a punch I believe so yeah I believe got hit with a big punch from Funaki you know Hickson was never a guy who was trying to kickbox you you know he wasn't trying to do what his son did at all Hickson was always just trying to figure out a way to be defensive just enough to impose his game and get you on the ground all the black belts that ever work with Hickson they always say the same thing we got killed you hack world champion black belt to go train with him they go roll with him like oh he killed us all yeah so there was you know like 20 years ago the Gracie's used to get together like once every year every two years to train and the Eric Paulsen was invited and he said in an article I remember reading this article when I was really young he was saying that look we don't say what happens in that practice obviously it's a family thing so I was am I gonna be saying what happens but one thing I tell you all nobody came near Hicks late nobody could touch Hicks and Nixon was the you know head and shoulders above everybody and the reason why they could say that is because everybody admits to it and it's like an open secret you know everybody knows Hickson's way better than everybody else and just hearing those stories growing up and you're like man this guy how good is he you know can we see him actually fight you know and then you have these clips where I look it's one-sided but that was a different time and place but then again that's if it was training today you probably be kickboxing too yes I'm sure I think it'd be crazy not to I'm sure but then so he wouldn't I mean he hadn't had any fights in a cage no all of his fights were in the ring in the range there's there's a lot more you can do in terms of movement you can slide through the ropes a little to avoid things it's also harder to take someone down there's a lot of weird things that happen inside of a ring that you could argue that a ring is better for the view because you could see straight through to the fighters but it's also more dangerous because you fall through the ring you know the ropes you know I mean even in boxing you occasionally see that with Bernard Hopkins last fight when he fought Joe Smith he got Kayode by going through the rules when I hit his head he fell like right on his fucking head on the concrete floor at like 50 years old you know my god yeah you know Rosie's Kabir yes there's one guy who died in Thailand many years ago he ran forward charging and he did a kick went over the guy's head flew out of the ring hit the table and died oh geez that's why in Thailand now you know how to run anymore if I catch a kick I'm allowed one step forward not three steps charging across the ring like they used to before you could run across the ring so I catch you like I run across the ring flying elbow flying knee whatever I want well now it's like your loved one or three steps I can't remember so it's like traveling a basketball hey you can't just charge through because the ring can contain yeah that makes sense you could fly right through the room I like what Bellator did what Bellator did for the kickboxing events when they had kick boxing and MMA in the same weekend they put the kick boxing ring inside the gigantic circular pad so even if you fell through the ropes you just landed on the outside pad which is so much superior it's so much better I just I feel like we haven't really found the perfect fighting surface no I like our idea the podcast elevator I know this has been a weally might be a moat you know well now we know if you really I can adapt to anything yeah that's a great idea right you take a guy who's like a Mighty Mouse guy like a phenomenal mover and now he's got a fight an elevator Zac now what happens yeah exactly yeah this there's no I mean there's no there's no what I don't see like I see fights that happen overseas in with like one FC allows fights in a cage but with soccer kicks and the argument against that I think would be that you can't get your head out of the way like if you're trapped up against the cage like at least in in Pride or in k1 when they had fought in the ring if you're on the ground you can move your head through the ropes you can you've got a little bit of motion but if your head is stuck and someone's soccer kicks you or stomps you it's too dangerous my opinion I think that's when one maneuver and look we got to draw a line somewhere you know we have to decide what's what like what are we gonna do next poke each other in the eye did you ever see Roger Huerta scale and when you get knocked out in one Fc it was a brutal man he fought the series that big guy from Brazil he was fighting at 170 you know Roger fought at 155 yes I trained Roger for a little bit not not the biggest guy in the world and he fought this guy who was much much bigger than him and he got caught he got hurt and then when he went down the guys soccer kicked it off and not just the soccer kick a soccer kick where he hits him in that he's already hurt he hits him in the neck and his head his whole body moves from the kick where it's just like full power to the head on the ground and there's something about soccer kicks it's just there's too much leverage yes like if I ask you to break a baseball bat you can do it if I hold it low Brian if I hold it high you better be an incredible kicker because you're not as much leverage no so if somebody falls down and I kick him in the head as he's down I could really put him out like I'm a cup I could send him to the morgue even so I think it's one technique we have to be very careful about yeah because I think a wheel kick has more power but it's so hard to land exactly where's a soccer kicks gonna happen often yes I remember watching Wanderlei his first fight with with Benson Henderson and not Benson Dan Henderson excuse me hey I thought I was like that was just almost a murder like if she's not fight like hopping on to soccer oh my goodness what are they gonna do to stop this stop this fight well that was the old days man though right days of pride mmm where why and that was Vandelay with like one eye completely swollen shut and he remember that I mean any reasonable organization would have stopped that fight they were to look at his eye like you can't see a goddamn thing out too scared of it to stop the photo well van dough that was Vanderley when he was van and you know I mean I want to talk about a guy whose face just from sheer impacts made his face changed like radically like it flattened out everything flattened his nose flattened just pull it up would you find the fight yeah here it is boom so that again watch this so he's already hurt watch this but I mean that is horrific I didn't see this one it's horrific man and he was he was hurt before that he was getting me up he's getting beat up and need and punched and look how much bigger that dude is I mean he's he's like really on queer Street before he even goes to the ground he gets rag doll to the ground and then look at this boom I mean horrific horrific yeah tough tough well I mean Brandon Vera's one fights like that in one as a heavyweight with soccer kicks - which is even more scary he looked at the ref before kicking him yeah because they give you a clear or not clear because apparently sometimes you can head kick a guy on the ground soccer kick him sometimes you can't oh yeah that should have been immobile stop that fight I mean it looked like he was just so badly hurt it's happening so fast it's so hard to tell - because he got guys like Frankie Edgar when he fought Gray Maynard he's like look looks like he's out on the fighters around and he comes back and wins the fight yeah yeah if it's a title fight I understand it let it go a little further cuz that's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity yes but if there's no title on the line which I think that fight there wasn't right I would have stopped it after you fell down like looking drunk you know yes yeah well also you got to take into consideration the size difference the fact that one guys just pummeling him and he's almost too tough for his own good mhm and Rogers not going to quit he's just he's gonna go out in a shield mm-hmm but yeah so soccer kicks that's a that's a tough one right what about soccer kicks in a football field no still no in that situation if you're rolling the wheel like in that situation really doesn't matter if that's a ring or a cage that's just the soccer kick and that's a horrific technique they're all dangerous you know yeah that deccan in your life yeah exactly that's why I mean I would draw the line there yeah I would I would I want I want us to find a balance of rules that take away concussions as much possible because some guys are too tough for their own good and then they're gonna go out there and practice it right so they're gonna be like oh we should talk with each other in practice it's not just that fight night you know they're gonna do it in practice right of course yeah well wheel kicks I mean I remember in Taekwondo training guy even guys would try to pull a kick mmm walk into that need to accidentally hit them and people would go to sleep and but all the time it's just there's too much power in the leg there's too much weight too much in the leverage of a remember when Edson Barboza fought Terry Adam yeah which was the first ever wheel kick ko was it the first one yes yes yes first-ever ko in Brazil yeah and he connected with that wheel kick and Terry went stiff like someone just pulled the power cord yeah and just fell back yeah and it was crazy fight because like Terry really didn't have anything for him and I was just saying that he's gonna have to risk getting knocked out in order to do something he's gonna have to and right when I said risk getting knocked out walk he landed that crazy wheel kick but that's one of those kicks where you go okay should I even be legal of course I think it should be yeah yeah I think it you know I it's it's a beautiful technique but man that's a horrible thing to get hit with mmm it's just hard to do it's probably I mean it's among the most powerful kicks in the game mm-hmm like this for sure it's not easy to execute that's why most people don't do it yeah there's not a lot of guys that can throw it with the kind of speed and precision that also have real MMA skills that's what it is exactly yeah I mean wonderboy being one of the example when the mean remember when he fought Jake Ellenberger and he hit him with a wheel kick and that was a crazy fight because Ellenberger was talking shit saying that those things don't work all those boring stuff doesn't work and then of course that's what he hit him he can work if united states Tandy what's also like it say whatever you want that's Wonder Boy okay that's a that's not a regular dude you're fighting you might say spinning shit doesn't work well if it's you know Mike McFaul stick you know Chicago who's never really taken martial arts classes like that and doesn't really doesn't have a background in karate yeah but Wonder Boy can do some wild shit with his legs he's not 67 I know and kickboxing for nothing they didn't give him for 67 wins they weren't they weren't they weren't purchased yeah watch them it watch the fights there online I think somebody's guys say things like I just to pump themselves up because they're of course they're scared that were either yeah of course yeah yeah it's interesting that we're starting to see the level of female MMA really elevate now and like of course Amanda you know Amanda Nunez who fights she fights in December right right which is a really good fight man that a lot of people aren't talking about Germaine Duran to me is a beast she's really good man super super technical you know she'd beat a man she beat a fighter man right yeah she's a man yeah she brought a guy beat him I think she stopped him I think she owed him would it surprise me I wouldn't surprise me either man she's super super technical yeah yeah but Amanda and Valentina Shevchenko they represent the highest level right now and in a way Li Zhong right it's John Whaley as is she I mean when she won the title like that I was like holy shit like that's another one I mean that woman being from China but martial arts is so gigantic over there and representing like that whoa she must be a megastar there no oh my god must be a megastar oh my god and to win that way with such a spectacular knockout like that Wow yeah and there's a shortage of women and not only a shortage of women she's a champion world champion I know UFC and she knocks people up she's got to be like ultra star there oh she's got to be gigantic - yeah just gigantic huge star yeah yeah I mean and then you know as the UFC is making its way through China to have someone like that as a champs oh my god I heard they build a pie they're three times bigger than the one in Vegas yeah it's huge yeah I haven't seen it but I've seen it online yeah the only one I've seen in person is the one here but fuck the one of the it's so impressive the one in Vegas all the different state of the art techniques for recovery and those little paws you take naps in that I haven't seen that if I lived in Vegas man that would be a spot you know if you're a fighter and you were living in Vegas that's the spot - yeah yeah I've been there a few times is over there really good yeah um listen man Kevin Lee coming up - you worked out thank you by the way my pleasure shit I knew it he set us up together I knew it though when I was talking to him I knew he was like a little bit lost and trying to figure out his way and I said man you need a head coach and I'm like who fights like you George George st. Pierre I mean not saying is the same level as George but it's George fights like that with wrestling and great striking and submissions he mixes it all up he's unpredictable in his attacks like it's very similar they're neither one of them are particularly long both guys are very physically strong I might come on man I guess this is the guy he has a great training team already he doesn't have somebody kind of put it all together yes and you know we're talking about styles and never he's a bit of like his personality is a wildcat like he's you know he's a he's a commando and me I'm the opposite I'm like calculated I'm a scalpel yeah he's a chainsaw musket together it makes a great blend yes you need you need both a little bit of discipline a little bit of yes yeah there's a time and place for both yes so like his last fight of happy he stayed discipline very so very much so very much so and he could become a world champion if he's disciplined because George was very disciplined yes he didn't veer off the game plan at all and he got the job Diamond that chaos I also told him all that shit that he does or he's getting moving up to the cage he's dancing around and going crazy I'm like a bandit hat shit I go come out like a fucking samurai man some serious work to do mm-hmm now that stuff is complicating your mind because then you have to think all I did if I could lose right now I'm gonna look stupid all that dancing and and there's all this pretending that you're not feeling the feeling that you're feeling right now you're feeling this incredible moment because you six months of preparation getting ready for this one moment here it is embraces what that is go Zen man being be empty and he was like that the whole training Kelby who was very focused for this one you could tell yes you know I was really hot because I like guys would come in the gym and work they don't skip practice and like if guys tell me on I'm I'm I'm not in today for whatever reason I'll let them okay you don't wanna be and you don't wanna be in like I'll tell them look I think you should be in but you don't want to come in what could I do right but he was very disciplined he came to all the practices and it worked out beautifully exact old is he now uh maybe late 20s no I'm not even sure I think he I want to say he's 26 it tunnels is Kevin moody 27 27 what's his birthday September okay so he just turned 27 yeah yeah he's fucking not even in his prime you know and he's also experienced failure that experience fights where he didn't live up to his potential and I think that ultimately will be a motivating force because we see what he can do when he's really focused that gregor Gillespie is a dangerous fight man you know I mean people see that spectacular head kick knockout and they don't understand how good gregor Gillespie is that kid is a savage and so when I found out that Kevin was gonna fight Gregor in his fight back to 155 not a good comeback fight dangerous comeback fine yeah very high-risk a very high-risk and also getting down to 155 what did you guys do differently to get him down to 155 easily this time we kind of put our heads together you know do we Cooper his trainer is really great fantastic amazing I mean I love working with him brilliant guy his brother Keith we kind of like got our heads together and were like look we got to keep losing weight at this rate no matter what it takes and if you if you protest like you know if he wants to like ease up we'll listen to it but we he's got he's gotta bite the bullet at one point like we can't go fall behind this rate of losing weight we have to lose on a pound an hour every hour we have to lose one pound and like at a certain point now it's a pound an hour you talking about for the weight cut weight cut yeah we can right but what is he coming in like what it's like when he the week of the fight on Monday morning what is he waiting and I had it on your phone yeah I heard here so look a little smaller but healthy yes didn't look sucked in he didn't look like he depleted himself did he do anything different in terms of like weight lifting or running extra running I wouldn't lift weights if I was him I I don't want him to lift any weights because he's naturally like I like I like bulking and then cutting mm-hmm I don't like cutting cutting cutting but when he came to me it was six weeks before so we were in a cutting phase I don't want him to block up because in six weeks you can't bulk and then cut he's already very naturally muscular he's very naturally strong naturally already so I had him doing road work road work not too much plyometric not like a little bit but I don't want to put any size on him because he's got enough size right so first thing is evaluation does he need muscle no he's plenty of muscle right does he need power plenty of power we need to we need to create endurance and discipline in him that's why I think was making the big difference and some technical issues and we cut the 24 hours before he was 174 M hmm 174 so 20 pounds that's a lot it's a lot so there was a point where we had to hit after losing a preliminary wait we have to hit one pound an hour and he was good about it actually wasn't that hard of a wicket he did it really well we're very disciplined I was with him the last 48 hours making sure he was doing everything the last few steps really well the rehydration process I was with him the whole time though did he wake up at Friday morning Friday morning I'll tell you right now it weighs it's not great I mean okay so so one o'clock in the morning he was 160 for one o'clock in the morning nine pounds ago five o'clock in the morning he was 163 that's when we start so I let him sleep for a couple hours four hours four hours of sleep wake up so you woke him up at 5:00 yeah the day of the weigh-ins a day with a win Wow wake up wake up wake up trying to make weight at 10 o clock he was 155 oh wow so he went through from 5 a.m. all the way to 10 yes and what is he doing during that time a bath bath bath and then wrap them up in the towels let him sweat in the towels Jesus Christ and then no sauna no no sauna for this one how come some guys prefer baths it's direct heat what do you like I like both I think I'll talk guys if you're not used to so now let's do bath like I always tell guys before your fight go once a week to the sauna like six weeks out because sauna takes practice some people sit in the Sun of 45 minutes and it's nothing like they have sauna World Championship so I don't know if you know that but like in like Finland they have the World Championships of sauna like some people stay in there for hours like you build a tolerance is it for time or for testing sure yeah I know it's time time you know Laird Hamilton the guy makes this amazing coffee this one the toric yeah I love it turmeric is incredible Laird is a world champion surfer he's a stud yeah fucking Aquaman he's an animal but this guy gets in the sauna cranks it up to 220 degrees and rides an air bike so he's got like one of those airdyne bikes why he's a fucking animal he's wearing oven mitts because the the bars so hot Oh being in the Samet you can't grip it with your hands so he's in there like I'm one of the rogue echo bikes anyway fucking burn it out he's not a maniac man but he does all kinds of crazy shit like you know especially like hot sauna work and then jump in that what do you got Jamie what's up this is not the last one but right most famous when they were at 230 degrees Fahrenheit which is 110 Celsius oh and at six minutes they I think the guy on the left in this picture passed out and ended up dying no he died yeah I cook my steak at 110 Celsius Jesus holy shit that's incredible huh oh oh my god Russian competitor dies in sauna World Championship yeah fuck that how long were they in there six minutes or so I think what it says lasts for six minutes and they took them out oh so it's a temperature sixty-year-old over 60 oh my God look how ready is Nicolas I cook my steak at 110 no joke this is an e in 110 Celsius is what Fahrenheit 230 2/3 very dangerous yeah I was doing 220 you know he had me doing 220 for a little bit but you know what I feel like it was burning my lungs I feel like I was burning the inside of my mouth was dry yeah I felt terrible I stopped doing it I did a few times but afterwards I'd lay down after I did it and I was doing it for fucking like 15-20 minutes - what was the purpose mark me I was just I wanted to experiment but what does he do it I don't dude first of all he's built different mmm this guy has an ankle that's like three of these Yeti cooler mugs because he broke it and just kept working out on and after he broke it so it's all calcified he pulled it up put it up on the table it's like what the fuck man he just broke his ankle and just kept working out and kept doing stuff on it and then it just sort of fused together and this like look at his ankle ooh look at that oh my god that's his ankle man that's just from breaking and never stopping to do anything with it yeah it's like it's like the root of a tree it's real weird man he's a crazy person but he's also you know like one of the greatest surfers that ever lived and I think sometimes you have to be that - boy that they're all crazy yeah everybody's that the best of their game they're all crazy they're all crazy I always matter what you do they're all they're all they're all this is a touch of genius and there's a touch of madness I see that madness and genius our next-door neighbors and they borrow each other's sugar you have to be like literally fucking up almost every other part of your life to achieve real greatness yep because you got a band in personal relationships you got to be totally unbalanced and completely obsessed and focused upon your goal this is true but the beautiful thing for a fighter is fighters can do that in camp and then break and then take a little break so much don't not too much not too much space how much time do you like after a fighter like Kevin wins how much time do you recommend to just fuck off I think two weeks is good two weeks a fuck off yeah I just go chill for two weeks but I feel like everybody wants take a month and six weeks I think that's too much there's too much to learn Mme there's too much right you know you know one position that can win you the fight so in that six weeks how many positions did you did you miss out on that you don't know about there's so many positions there's so many scenarios to go over yeah there's too much material to cover you know I know this is only his first victory back at 155 pounds but he said something and I believe him he thinks he has the style to beat khabib he thinks khabib style which is so wrestling heavy but not really kick heavy you know and Kevin throw some nasty kicks he missed Gregor with a crazy head kick before he landed the one that put him out I was like Oh mm-hmm like whizzing by the top of his head mm-hmm yeah speed to speed explosion yeah it just needs to be any control the center beautifully mm-hmm he got hit he stayed disciplined and freaked out right he didn't start brawling you know he just needs more more more these sort of fights more experience with the guard like you in his corner more grooming is he gonna move to Montreal or is he gonna stay down in Vegas I'm not sure I'm not sure actually tummy's gonna be back in January so we got I told him to move yeah he should move for a while yeah I'm like first of all yeah Vegas as great as it is that nightlife is always but in my cell it's different first of all that winter teaches you something about life mm-hmm that winter up there my first December in Montreal was like 1992 I did the Montreal Comedy Festival yeah and I was up there and the winter I was like oh and I grew up in Boston I thought I knew what a winter was oh it's something the air it hurts it hurts it hurts your lungs and you breathe it in you realize you could die out here you know you don't have a certain amount of time to get to where you need to go and if you're walking yeah I think was next was 93 now that I think about it but that you guys are a good style at 10 to 15 degrees colder than Boston and I just thought that was just we're near the water - yeah the windchill yes it's the moisture that cold air whoa the windchill factor the cold wet air but it's just there's something also I think about cold weather people like people that live in cold weather and they do there's more resilience I think it's a character builder and I really do I mean I've often thought I don't want to move to a cold weather area but if I did it'd probably be good for me it's actually a beautiful winter I find winter beautiful like I don't know what it is about it but there's a it's a special time of the year and then when summer comes it's like summer is like the most incredible thing you've ever lived because you just went through winter yes so the summer is just like every year you get hit with that we're like weather trust-fund babies ah yeah we're just so used to everything being perfect it's fine if it rains at all like oh my god the world's over it's raining yeah yeah when you go through a brutal winter and then it breaks it's like explain it matter I don't know how to explain it yeah well it's the passing the seasons is also symbolic of life the cycle of life there's a real cycle to this and you only have a certain number of those fall winter spring summer events movie zones there's not that many of it man you hear the howling wind of the freezing cold and you're in there you're in your hole maybe it's like when I come home and I see my house buried in some oh yeah I love it I take pictures of it I'll tell ya yeah because I don't know what it is about it but when you get inside it's like I kind of miss it I miss it now mmm Denver shout out to Denver they're fuckin frozen in right now although all the highways are getting shut down right now as we speak giant storm just hit yeah I think I think it makes better people I think it's it also makes people that appreciate nature because in California we don't even know what the fuck nature is you know I mean you do if you go outside like trees but we don't know the force of it yeah because it's so we're so immune to it out yeah essentially yeah you're nothing to nature yeah you don't think you're spec of this you're it doesn't care yeah freeze you out yeah it's rough well you've also it's also that one another another good choice about moving to Montreal's you've accumulated a culture of there a Tristar and that that's that is as important to success as almost anything is to bid go into an environment and feeling the the culture that environment and knowing like this is a place where real assassins go to train this is a real world-class facility with some of the best competitors on earth are going to hone their edge this is this is where they go this is the place you check your ego at the door everybody's the same it's all about improvement ex there's only one question what are we doing today is whatever's gonna make us better period there's no this guy's in the practice room we got a cater to his needs and we got to move things around no no and there's no that like I've had some big stars come in it and I tell them look you can come in with your entourage but you have to do it this way and you have to come in and do the workout like this and you have to be like everybody else oh yes if it's a no you can't come in that's it just don't come in like I can't stop the world for a guy you know to massage is ego right that's why I like Kevin and he was very humble and he works with everybody and he's he's a great fit he's a great guy he's really great he's got potential outside of the sport to you know is he's a fun guys an interesting personality and not even just outside of the sport meaning after he's done I mean if if he does make big strides in the sport and becomes a champion he could transcend he really can he has that kind of personality it's just a matter of doing what he did for that Gregor let's be fight over and over and over again yeah and that is maddening but especially if you ever fight if he fights Kb but when he fights could be yeah you think he's gonna fight could be I think so could be be said he's only gonna find a couple more times I think he wants fight George that would be great 165 can George make that yeah 165 yeah I think so yeah and it'd be probably nice for him to yeah but do we need a title on the line I don't think we need a title - what do you do super-lightweight bad motherfucker over the north whatever they want I mean look at the must be dog deal I love that thing I love it you could do anything you want with the title yeah and you can make one you know you could put 20 Ferguson Missouri doll 165 BMF yeah you have control of everything now right the official thing is interesting very smart yeah it's not gonna go away and no one complained I loved it no I was like what is that no no we all watched that's why I tell people the people who are about nothing I'm like you're still gonna watch you don't want to see it that's the whole point it's fun it is never a belt says bad motherfucker we're living in a good time I was listen I was just happy to see that fight and I'm happy to see George get the shine that he deserves and I'm happy to see Nate get the shine that he so for me the title was great nice fantastic whatever five-round fight with two of the very best 175 70 pounders in the world that's what was intriguing to me and whether or not Diaz could handle the overall skill set of Moz Vidale because his his skill set so comprehensive the wrestling is excellent his creativity his instincts killer instincts his knockout power the fact that he's a great kicker as well as a great punch like people forget you know he knocked out Evette words with a head kick in BO dog back when Eve was a fucking man and back when Eve was arguably the best hundred fifty five pounder in the world and the body punch yes you don't see that often oh man buddy show everything yeah body shot that's a lost art of body punching there's a lot of people punch kind of like this but he was an uppercut to the body yes I was driving through it he could tell I heard the SDS changed side yeah buddy I kicked him there before it was really and strike like really beautiful shot selection yeah I mean no he's got one of the highest fight IQs in the sport yeah he's and he doesn't have any weaknesses like he doesn't have a weak chin he takes a tremendous shot his heart is incredible now that he's in he's in far better shape he's ever been any and there's any other time in his career he's more disciplined I mean I'm very excited about him right now because from his resurgence from the the knockouts that you know knocking out cowboy Cerrone knock it out dare until the knockout of aspirin which is just like fucking insane man insane that one was insane and then just really putting it on Diaz and see how fucking tough Nate Diaz is goddamn oh my god so tough yeah but kid he beat and it was man or Kobe that's a good question I think if you had a lot of rounds to do it or let's say there was no there was no rounds was yeah I'll pick him yeah really yeah because he could finish yeah but the problem is he could also get out out wrestled they eat up the rounds eat up the time but I don't see them finishing them it must be dull mm but I could see mas with all turning it around later on and finishing he's a great finisher yes well you smell good crack you know we saw that in the Woodley fight we've seen he's won by nine before he's got quite a manpower one go but he you see it when he landed I'm he's got at least one not got yeah I think well let you see he's got that kind of power he don't know when he hurt tyrunt tyrunt takes a good shot and he had tyrant and real real bad trouble yes he's dangerous with his strikes Kobe is a guy who's very wise in his true he's to me one of the most intriguing characters in the sport because he gets you tricked into thinking that he's a bum cuz he's got the fucking Donald Trump jr. book and he has a cheap suit on in a maggot hat and the old belt but meanwhile that motherfucker puts it on you and he doesn't get tired and he's got this brilliant strategy of everything he throws very Nick Diaz like 50 60 percent he's not throwing haymakers 50 60 percent just keeps it on you keeps it on you keeps it on you keeps it on you keeps it on you and you keep thinking you're gonna get this break where you're gonna be able to fire back like Robbie Lawler he kept trying to find an opening to fire back those openings aren't coming 541 strikes that's a grubby people fires and in how insane that is go hit the back 500 times like your next workout yeah let's just hit the back 5 yeah just I have someone to stand there with a clear eye just click and throw 540 movin throw at full blast no just throw at 50% plus he's wrestling how many takedown scrambles how am i God yeah his endurance is incredible it's and you know he created that character because he thought the UFC was gonna cut him right he was fighting in Brazil they told him was basically his last fight and yeah man they were they were ready to get rid of him they thought whose style is fuckin boring oh look the UFC is jr. got a little issue here with this thing's falling down oh it tightens up there um alright they were basically ready to cut him and so he said you know what I'm just gonna fucking go for broke I'm gonna call these Brazilians a bunch of shitty games call them dirty animals and all this crazy shit and he basically just created this pro-wrestling heel persona have you ever talked to him real-life no no no very nice guy yeah I'm very smart guy I'm very sure I'm sure of it really friendly like real nice to talk to he's not that guy that's a fucking he needs a goddamn Academy Award it's crazy because every they think he's a piece of shit he's there posing with Trump and everything other kids it's fun giving them what they want he's giving him when the fans don't want that no more he won't give it to them but he can also fight his ass which is what's so crazy it's like people get twisted they get it twisted in their head that he can't really fight listen he beat Robbie Lawler he beat him bad like he dominated that's a big win that's a massive win ha failed us on Joe same thing beat the shit out of that's a colossal just keeps it on you he doesn't give you any air there's no air no one gets air and he could take a shot he's fearless it's dude he's got everything going for him if he was just a high-level contender he'd be like fuck keep an eye on that guy something special about him but all this craziness he does has got everybody confused with the mag had that suit cost $3 he's got a 3-2 heart blue suit on the whole thing is so nuts I mean it's he's a fucking character man if it's a crowd it's really smart and he really gets a rise out of people because people would try to fight him outside the ring oh my god yeah oh yeah well Moz when I was friends with him too yeah but with almost to kill him though but does he might both be in on that could be yeah I don't know you're right all right let him talk yeah your pro wrestlers like each other they still throw ya through tables yeah that's true that's true I'm I'm interested to see that fight you he got Trump to come to the fights man do Donald Trump came to the out you know I almost missed the Kevin Lee fight really because all the security I went to the green room to get a coffee and a little bit a little bite to eat and then I like this area is closed I'm not okay I just got a no so you can't move around am i okay the whole build the whole the whole section here is locked down yeah Mike for how long you we don't know so Secret Service now yeah we don't know well I got a contact UFC we don't care about UFC well I'm like who talks to UFC who who's who from UFC is talking to Secret Service we don't care we don't know yeah I had to wait a whole hour and a half before I could leave really yeah everything was locked down they had a wait till Trump's entourage or whatever the that's do I still yeah the the all the bulletproof fucking tanks that take him through the city do I almost missed the fight one flight goes by qu fight with five fights have gone by my guys like I know it was hard to get in it was hard to get yeah yeah the whole thing was locked down we were going through a different entrance we had to get everything checked they checked my fanny pack did you get the dogs yeah Chuck the dogs had a walk around the truck and sniffed the truck did you see the soldiers how give it up they were yeah all right yeah goggles night-vision machine yeah oh yeah the place crazy well you got to think I mean if someone was a terrorist they wanted to create create a gigantic you think you'd kill Trump at the UFC mmm I was shocked he's in the stands so he's in the crowd I thought it was gonna be up in the booth right no he was right on the goddamn floor that's right there yeah fans are there though yeah it was funny to men because everybody was like torn over whether or not he got booed or cheered you got brought in here I was in the back when they put him on the big screen yeah but here's the thing if you're standing or if you're seated in a place where there was Trump fans you heard shears you're a lot of fucking noise first but there's a difference right okay like say if if he like there's certain people that walk in and you hear cheers right like if Deontay Wilder was there the place would go apeshit right they go yeah that's jeah when Trump was there like but there was cheers mixed in with the boos Tony hits Cove had a good point he's like well if you were sitting in the cheap seats where the people with Trump fans you'd hear a lot of cheers it's it's entirely dependent upon who's around you and whether or not they're supporting him or not supporting you but the idea that they all cheered him that's fucking nonsense there was a lot of booing all booing but also just a lot of craziness like holy shit the President of the United States is here for the UFC he's my friend was what Maz Vidal versus Diaz yeah that's nuts man for that BMF title I don't know if he's knows I don't know if he's even a fan I mean I don't know if he really enjoys the fights who's not a fan of fighting I wonder if he's gonna come to Vegas Colby's fight imagine if he's like Colby's a little little fucking dog who follows him to all the fights he's like he's number four tie-in we definitely have the time to tweet he's doing that shit all day long that's true I mean all he needs is one Saturday come on president the world's most powerful man I'm sure he probably has something that day and I'm moving around hilarious if he made it like that him I can't the Kobe I'd like to get him in here if but I don't know if you got it I don't know if you'd stick to stick to who he's like I'm telling you I hung out with him in the Comedy Store and I talked to him he's a fucking good guy man he's people sure he is they think he's this character I'm sure they all are they're all good guys there are a lot of them a lot of a lot of there's a few there's always a few but well most of them are good this is a thing I was I was just getting into with a friend of mine we're talking about people and their motivation for getting into fights and I was like or forgetting into fighting and I was like I go some of it is not good man some of the motivation it's just but what happens once you become a fighter like you can you can sort of transcend what your initial motivation was like a lot of people they got motivated into fighting because of abuse they're picked on they were bullied or maybe even abuse at home or you know father beat them or something like that and then they became this angry mean person want to get back in the world but through martial arts you could transcend that and find peace and this is something that I think is it's it's needs to be discussed more it needs to be talked more because people don't they don't hear it too much from the fighters perspective because fighters don't really express these ideas that much they just try to win and you know and kick ass and do their best but you can find peace through combat you really can you can find a better version of yourself by getting through things that are even more difficult than the childhood that you mm-hmm and you're gonna eat a lot of humble pie yeah especially when you start yes and it's a bitter taste yeah I always tell people you think George and Pierre didn't get killed in practice when he was a white belt he thinks he started black belt no right like everybody he got killed we all got killed everyone our way to black belt now you see a black belt he rarely ever gets put in a bad position but what you think he started like this he's suffering but you know I ever hear of a Lyra Berg Lyra Berg he's with the world's greatest dog trainer oh yeah that dog trainer yeah you know shits in yeah yeah yeah if we wanted the Moe Legend I don't know if he's still relevant today but when I was a kid my my older brother was obsessed with dogs and used to watching dirt Briggs videos oh really yeah as a library of videos how to train a dog the first thing that he tells you how to pick a dog from the litter and he says he walks up to the litter and he takes each puppy and he pinches the puppy till the puppy cries so the puppy will whimper you know like like he'll cry and then he tries to make up with the puppy if the puppy makes up with him and then when he walks off the puppy follows him he's like that's a good dog I can train that dog if the dog doesn't make up with him and his bitter about the experience and he's walking away from Leaburg he won't take that dog that dog when I'm gonna train him later he's gonna be so bitter from the corrections I'm gonna give him and and the you know I'm gonna have to training him I have to polish him polish his dog he's gonna become so bitter his attitude his characters no good like attitude is the most important thing matter took is the first and I feel like the new generation today they're like this you know their heart harder to train the last generation because yes because they're more proud I'm more proud like when you they're always trying to make a reason why they're not doing well as opposed to saying look I need to get better they kind of find excuses for what went wrong what do you think is the cause of that I think it's you know because we're I think we have a privileged privileged life you know the first generation of any any pioneers of any country they're always we have nothing they claw their way to the top you know Socrates talked about this the the first generation claws are way to the top the second generation saw that heart hard work so you came in here you had nothing you you could barely put food on the table but you did everything to make it your kids saw that he saw a food got on the table but you're handing him down all this sources a business inheritance education like for instance my parents pushed me to be educated my parents are not educated people but when they came to Canada they pushed me to become educated and now with your education these new assets this new business you're ahead the third generation is where generally things go wrong because now they're getting things but they didn't see how it was made they just have this iPhone but I didn't see how they built this Empire you know it's not necessarily three generations it could be more obviously this is just like a in a nutshell but there's one generation they just got stuff but didn't go out and though in the while to go get it yeah and those are the ones we're gonna tell you hey you sinned with that food on the table you know you kill that animal you put them on the table what a sin on you shame on you but you're like hey you know you ate from this table this whole world we built is from you know this met this manner you know so that generation they don't know what it takes to survive like for instance me my kids I don't give them anything unless they earn it I feel like if I give my son something for free i cripple them psychologically take take a take a tiger from the zoo and take a tiger from the wild is it the same animal one of them one of them can hunt and kill the other one can't do nothing the one from the zoo you took something from him what did you take his instinct to survive to fend for himself once I feed you I weaken you if I feed you oh I made you weak me I teach you how to hunt you know you have to teach my son how to hunt so it one day I stopped my kids what he can do when I'm dead what are you gonna do and that who's gonna feed you who's gonna take care of you I think about these things you know like I I like them to earn because if you put your if you put some I should give somebody a lot of lot of nice things they become very egotistical and I'll tell you why because they're so insecure you could tell that insecure martial artists from a secure martial artist insecure martial artists doesn't want to roll with this person doesn't want to train here he's very selective of how he how each other like he's so and it's because like he doesn't want he doesn't want eat humble pie you could tell that's what how much of that we have in martial arts we have tons of that guys with super black dolls but never fought and never trained and they never know but every saw them in action so I feel like that's what happens at one point success breeds you know what Nietzsche calls the last man you know your fat cat on a pillow you fight so hard to give your kids a great life but that great life kind of ruins them it could also ruin them so I feel like this generation of martial artists not the hardcore guys and you have seen not that but I'm talking about the everyday guy coming in it's because now in jiu-jitsu you have clubs giving away belts with membership well yeah so if you show up we count how many times you come to practice and then you have a stripe every so often it's all scheduled we tell you when you're gonna get your purple belt it's a right way man yeah there's clubs now he's doing that I don't want to say because you don't have to say but that's real so they give you a song so if you train for 50 days yes you're a stripe yes another 50 days yes yes already started it happened karate yeah in the 70s people don't know this Matsuyama I've sent three black belt karate experts to Thailand to fight Thais three ties two of the karate guys won really do that today today not all karate schools but most of them are watered-down why they start ok karate karate is popular let's take out the sparring let's take on all the hard training and guarantee this guy a black belt in four years three years hmm we're supposed to taking ten years the guy down the street is gonna go out of business why he's charging a thief to train you hard and it's gonna take you ten years and you're gonna have pain and suffering whereas this guy your neighbor your competitor down the street he's giving it to you in three years and not much pain and suffering involved you know so you get the prestige of a black belt without the hard training it's gonna happen jiu-jitsu now you're gonna see it's coming it's already here it's been here for a while it seems like one of the rare meritocracies martial earns me if you don't spar and you don't tap people you don't get a black belt I agree you don't spar you don't tell people you don't make it thank God but it's one of the rare ones because yes karate there's a lot of like bullshit sparring within touching each other you put all sorts of rules and the sparring knows later yeah so you never get really backed into a corner that's why it backfires a lot a lot of those guys who went to those other kind of schools they end up in other academies like they give up I have I've had a purple belt come up to me and say I want to give back my probe about that I got oh I got a perp buff from a certain school and he went to the bassist course in my gym basics he says I want to start back basics wipeout no yes he was a probable right and went back to wipeout yeah but when I roll with him I was like who the hell like no it's not his fault what do you think he was maybe a blue blue buff like a bigger no bla bla blue belt the definition of blue belt according to le Oh Gracie is you can beat a bigger stronger opponent that's untrained so blue belts not a huge like mega step right but purple belt is that advanced belt you're advanced yes like it's you're almost a black belt you just need to keep training that's the hardest belt to get to go from a blue to purple is the most painful transition in my opinion in my opinion because most people stop at blue for me brown belt was the scariest yeah cuz I was like fuck I'm almost there it's like oh man I was a brown belt for like eight years mmm good let's get injured to them yeah that's okay take your time I always tell guys I rather you'd be a purple belt that tops out black belts yeah then be a black belt that getting killed by blue belts right right right you harm your student when you give him a belt he can't carry yes you armed my guess like you said jiu-jitsu people walk in from out of town they jump into your class oh yeah and the blue balls killing your brown dog it's embarrassing for him yes leave him blue yeah at least he's a blue belt getting beat by a blue belt right what he is yeah all right but they want to hook you Oh belt seminar or belt test now there's tests we didn't do test I didn't do tests no John Donham or if you say John we're gonna do tests you laugh at you right you know jean-jacques didn't do any tests you know there's no test Eddie Bravo didn't do any tests I think there's there's also a situation where these people are realizing that hey if you have you know X hundred students and they're paying a hundred and fifty dollars a month you can get this amount of money in mathematics and they start doing the thing they're doing the thing in their head and they realize like look I am only making X amount of money I can make triple that if I just lighten up on people but you have to sell the jiu-jitsu you have to change you didn't you didn't learn it like this if you didn't race like this yes but you just here's one of the it's it's one of the rare martial arts will you go full blast you know and you could tap you know if you get caught an armbar even though the guy's not yanking on it past the point where it's gonna snap there they're showing some control they catch in an armbar and they know they have and you have to tap you just go again mmm I mean you can go right again infinity of lives if you kick someone in the head they're not going again for a long time yeah especially if you actually do it the way you would do it in a fight just like that that difference of striking training versus grappling training is one of the things that really separates jiu-jitsu from the other martial arts is that you you can learn in a real situation so like if you're in a street fight with jiu-jitsu and you grab a hold of a guy it's so normal the guy's going full blast but can everybody go full blast yeah everybody goes full blast but if you're in a street fight with someone you've only been point sparring and someone swinging haymakers out your like yikes and you're scared because you're not accustomed to that because the the actual consequences of getting hit like that in training are so high that you don't do that you don't he's very different it's very very very different there's a lot of people that have black belts in karate they would get fucked up in street fight by a guy who's quick who can shoot hard who just knows how to just hit you a mean person that's been in a lot of street fights and we always had a punch in the face there's also real karate instructors out there they have a real good karate student oh yeah but the vast majority of them are sold out again if they train two people for real yes they'll lose their customer too I think it's the opposite in jiu-jitsu I think most jiu-jitsu is legit oh yeah yes karate is not legit yeah it's not it's not susceptible as much right so because you have to roll right or like eventually you couldn't have gone to pro but without rolling but they have their ways right they have their ways like if they have a good kid like a kid who's like they know he's gonna compete to hold them back if they have a guy who's a lawyer you know though though though boost them up faster you know and I understand that you know it's not the same thing a young kid who's competing and a guy who's older and I get that but there has to be a still a purity to the game you know the exam I hope they don't try to water it out because I think it's gonna backfire in the end because it has like so many guys come from other schools to my gym and like I don't want to tell you what belt I am I'm like really what they're embarrassed to tell me what belt they are so that Canada thing or is that happening all world I think it's happening around the world yeah that's so disappointed to hear because when I started in 96 it was grimy man it was fucking no one was doing it oh yeah when I did it you were getting fine it was a bunch of people that had seen the UFC and were like holy shit it was me it was like I realized that I was so vulnerable cuz I had these ideas well I know how to kickbox I've know Taekwondo you know I know how to handle myself and then I do jujitsu and just get mauled I mean just just meant by people my size just manhandling me I got killed my first day and I loved it though because I realize like wow so much to learn what is that movie did yeah what is this thing yeah I was so enthusiastic about like you're gonna get I'm gonna get to see it might even get to try and they would show me what they did and I was like mind blow little mind blow yeah it's interesting how vulnerable you really are like when you when you first learn your first few days of classes it's different than almost anything else because you feel like there's nothing you could do to get out of it you know what I mean like I felt like sparring when I was spar went kickbox bar with people that were better than me I'm like at least I can move mmm least I could avoid this guy and you know maybe survive a few rounds if I fight defensively don't extend myself you know don't leave anything hanging out there just play tight to my chest like keep keeps fight spar smart I know this person is better than me but I can get through this round yeah that would do Jiu Jitsu against guys who were black belts when I was a white belt or a blue belt I'll be like there's nothing there's not a thing I can do this is a hundred percent positive he's gonna tap me it's about her what he's practicing on me it's fun though if the guy on top of you is not being a an asshole yeah he's really if he's cool yes because you could teach somebody to do to an in a nice way yes it could be a gentle it is a gentle heart it can be yeah it can be yeah when I saw the first commercial for UFC 2 I saw them hoist up the champion I saw them pick up the Chairman hoist Gracie I was shocked that a small guy is martial arts real I thought it was like this guy won no way I begged my parents to buy UFC 2 I showed it to my brothers I should ever be like we have to watch this and then they showed the lineup of guys he's gonna fight I thought okay now he's gonna get killed like I didn't see part one but this guy this Brazilian guy is gonna get killed he weighs 160 77 76 pounds this guy's 250 pounds I was like this guy's gonna get killed is he crazy and he won and if the new generation hasn't watched that they have to go back and watch it they have to because that's the genesis of like they said they said martial arts on fire everybody want to do jiu-jitsu I couldn't find the digits of school in Montreal I was like dying I got if you ask me cut your arm off we'll teach Jesus oh I would I would do it like that's how badly I wanted to learn it I met a purple belt from Hensel Gracie Angela like siroccos and I was like religious with my lessons he would teach twice a week but I would train all week I made my own mat I invite my neighbors over like it was such a like I was a mind-boggling experience to learn jujitsu it actually worked a martial art that really works I was remember hens oh and Craig Kukoc had like the first attraction of videos Red Planet this is VHS - yes yeah yes I got those yeah yeah those were like the first instructional mm-hmm because before you would have to go somewhere to learn they were the first guys to actually put it down in an instructional form I would buy although I bought all that I used one of the Mount escapes once in class against the guy was tea I was like a maybe else Bluebell not even others a white belt but I secured this guy's arm and I bucked and kicked him over towards where I'd taken away his bacon roll holy shit it worked because I watched it in the video and then I wanted of doing it in the class I was like this is crazy it's like where'd you learn that and I was like I got this video and so Gracie Craig cook cook and I let me ask you this my neck spearmint imagine you have no martial arts training none take everything you've learned throw it away okay take away all your physical training okay you walk into a room full of people how do you feel psychologically a little insecure insecure and secure yeah that's how regular people feel most people I should say most they never training their their life they're unskilled to deal with the situation that might occur or occur at any moment you know yeah it's it's such a gift to Trina like I trained all my students my my kids mandatory training to a certain level is mandatory it's like mathematics is mandatory to a certain level you can in Canada you can't say oh I won't drop out of high school not illegal no if I remember illegal drawbars I'm not sure I think it is now or they're gonna pass it but it's like you need a certain level of education and I'm not sure enough high schools like let's say elementary school okay you can't you can't drop out of elementary school high school though I'm not sure a double check but I'm pretty sure it's illegal now at this point well I think that would stop a lot of bullying and I've said this before I think it's counterintuitive to people they think that bullying is a mean person and if you taught them how to fight they become meaner hmm but that's I don't think that's the case I think bullies are insecure yes I think if you took away that and they got to really establish through training that they have character and that they're worth something and they don't have to be insecure and they build up this confidence you wouldn't see them going out and picking on people I've had so many parents tell me I don't recognize my son when he's with you he's so disciplined and he's so kind he saw spoken-- he's like at home he's an animal he's a he's a like he he acts up he's yeah I'm like really well here if he did that it would be a problem you know like it's like people respect right the dojo they respect the environment they're in because there are other guys out there that put you in line yes and that's the real world and some people they don't know that like I remember one time I was an airplane and a guy punched the back of my seat I swear to god I leaned back he had a laptop on his tree yeah when I leaned back it crushes the laptop I don't know that guy has a laptop I'm allowed to leave my seat back and lean it back I think I pushed his like he palmed it hard like poo and I was like excuse me sir there's a problem he's like don't lean your chair back I'm like whoa I'm like this is like I was never gotten a beating in his life the way he talked to me was so rude I was like - I would never talk like that somebody never why because you learned through martial arts you know you like respect everyone and respect is huge one day or the the hunted want the other day you're the hunter and it's just like the way life works you know like have respect why should like this guy's instigating a fight now we know what violence is it could be something it could be really bad for one of us here like why would you want to go there just say a laptop yeah you just say I would have been like sorry sir my fault my apologies I had I would about the guy bottom whatever he wants like a nice tan I would I would have took care of it like I would have been nice to him about it because we know the realities of violence like some people don't know the realities of violence like I've seen people like on video they like they're in a certain situation and act all crazy this might spark some violent event here yeah like you don't want this you don't know what violence is you've seen it on TV you seen in a movie you think what you think you know what it is to be punched and kicked and like this could end really bad for you like would you want to play with that if you know what it was like sometimes I see people starting a fight I'm like this person has no idea what they're talking about like they've never been in a fight they're instigating a fight a fight might occur and they might regret it like they don't know what it is to be hit to be attacked to be to be in a fight so like I just find I find I always like jaw dropping when somebody's gonna instigate a fight over something so small and they don't even know how to fine which is even crazier I told that guy off so bad did you oh you know I told them all so bad I scare the hell out of him and I was like yo what he can do no and he was like he turned white I'm like dude like I could have been an old lady here yeah you could have hit an old lady she pulling her chair back I told them off like I'm her Werner airplane too so I told him off like I didn't yell or anything but I told him office I told me is a real you know I told what I think of him the guy shut his mouth but it's like dude you want to fight over this laptop like seriously like that's no one can possibly know that you have a laptop open no but in fact you palm someone's chair me a man when I'm in public the last thing I want to do is fight yeah of course that last thing I got out of my system well isn't it funny like when was the last time you saw a fight at the gym never never maybe occasionally some guys get mad if some guy doesn't let go absolutely thing a little thing yeah anything but it's it's rare yeah but a bar Jesus Christ yes every weekend I go fight towards place to be its you understand what it is and I think most people don't and I think most people are scared of it and I think that's why the posture that's where they puff your chest up that's why they pretend but most people have zero idea most people that haven't had any sort of a physical altercation they have zero idea of how vulnerable they truly are I just don't know how this is there's this left turn I take to the gym that people think it's illegal like my wife when I did it once she's like I said this illegal turn I'm like no it's not I videotaped the light there's two green lights going left I sent it to her and she like oh okay you're right I think that left turn twice a day every day to go to the gym one day I take that left turn and this guy races this car towards me like he's gonna plow through my door honks at me starts telling me off I'm like I open my car door Mike let's go you want to go the guy is he got scared I'm like good you you you're like talking to me like you're my father here you want to go and it was like turning what he didn't want to come out of his car woman shut your mouth it's not an illegal light I get in my car and I leave but that guy was mr. tough guys never been in a fight in his life now that it's you know he's in this car he's safe and I hate stuff like this like the cars are so weird to know weird people are crazy when they're behind the wheel it's also someone explain it to me psychologically what happens is when you're driving you understand that you have to make these split-second decisions because you're moving fast right so everything's accelerated so you're on edge so if someone does something wrong with your fucking it's like people blow up at a level that they would never blow up if you were just one like how many times you've been in a crowded Street like Manhattan or something that people accidentally bump into people it's almost never an issue it's like oh sorry sorry you know you don't you don't have that heightened sense of worry because you're not moving very fast where you have to make these split-second decisions so your brain is geared up to the speed that you're moving at and somewhere in the highway people go fucking nuts because their brain is already at like seven or eight before anything ever happens you think it has a lot to do like on the internet you're behind your keyboard oh yeah there's nothing you could do to me right I'm a distance away there's a little bit of that but the guy's greatest I'm going to drive away you know a little bit of that there's a little bit there's a lot of factors but the but there is a psychological aspect to driving a car because your brain is ramped up to make quick decisions you know I think that the the society that we live in with people behind keyboards and with anonymous names that that's a coward's way of existing it really is it is a coward's way the worst of the worst it's the worst you saying mean things to people while no one can see your face that's not your real name you're pretending to be something you're not and when you see it happen with fighters to me it's fucking crazy I'll go to people's Twitter pages one of the fighter wins or something like that and they see all the assholes talking shit oh my god you guys are out of your fucking mind I wish they all had to use their name well a face and it showed the city where they live that's what I wish I wish like if you wanted to have a more civilized version of social media you should be able to see your face and your name and where you live you know it's Facebook it's probably a little I don't use Facebook but I guess it's probably a little cool the only way I use Facebook it's connected to my Instagram so if I post an Instagram it goes to Facebook I read it a few times like the crazy shit that people write I'm like I don't want any part of you it's it's the worst side of human beings it's well it's also the thing about Facebook that tries to be crazy is there's no limit to how much you can write so you write these long fucking asshole's things they also write it but this something about that at least with Facebook you it's your name its ferocity see your name you know you mean I guess you could have a fake name on Facebook yeah you can make a fake account I don't think you should be able to I think I think the only problem against that would be like say if you were a woman and you're working at an office and your boss was abusing you or sexually harassing you and you couldn't say anything anonymously you know I mean like you should be able to anonymous anonymously say something or maybe even there's something going on at your job where it's illegal where people's lives are even putting damage you should be a little leak yes whistle blows yes yes you should be able to say certain things anonymously but other than the talk and shit as soon as you talk shit all those prints are revoked well why do people do this you think again the same thing as like what we're talking about earlier they're insecure you've never been checked it's also when people are when people are constantly criticizing people and constantly judging people and constant insulting people that is a way to avoid self-analysis and it's a way you're comparing yourself whether you like it or not to that person and you instead of self-reflection you're just shitting on that person when you see guys are talking shit to John Jones you know they're it's like you're giving the finger to the lion you know you see the lion in the cage it's like it's like they can't do anything because he can't get out of that cage because he doesn't know you are because you have a fake twitter name and you're hiding behind one of those little those eggs you know you know you're not a real person and you can say all this crazy shit to him more to you know fill in the blank any any UFC fighter and I see it all the time I see it all the time it's crazy it's weird let me put you in there with John oh my god with 16-ounce gloves you're gonna freak out oh my god it's not even a real 20 ounce gloves you're freaking baby you're not even gonna make it in your legs are gonna yeah from like you're gonna you're gonna collapse it just staring down at the referees reading instructions just wetting your pants he's an interesting guy man he's such an interesting guy he is I work with him in the past yeah yeah but before he was a megastar oh no kidding he was up in New York yeah yeah he used to come to Tristar and like yeah I was the one who told him how to get out of New York yeah yeah yeah we were smoking weed in the hotel room really you know it's one thing about being an observer like being on the outside but but caring about those guys I like John lot and I knew he was a super talented and this is in the early days you know he was like he's beating up Stephan Bonnar nothing listen man I go you got something like you got oh you got to go to a real camp because he was just so talented and you know he would train and you know he had such a strong wrestling background but also so creative he would just do spitting elbows and shit like practice stuff I'm like dude you got to go somewhere you know you're gonna you got to find a place and even eventually wound up going to Jackson's but he could have gone anywhere I mean he could have gone to you he could have gone to a lot of different places he's just that what a unique talent that guy is when you're 23 years old you open up your first title fight with a flying knee against a legend Shogun opens up with a flying knee yeah I'm like what the fuck yeah certain guys just that's the interesting thing about the UFC style of of sort of throwing fighters to the Wolves because the UFC unlike boxing in boxing they take a guy you know and they'll slowly work him through the ranks oh yes journeyman and they give him different looks this guy likes to fight inside let's see how he handles that and then they eventually get him to the point where he's 15 and oh 16 you know they get them in there with a contender and they calculate risk versus reward with the UFC man you could have you know you could have like two fights and you know Oman needs a fight and they'll throw you in there I find that I like what boxing does they build up a guy because the thing is if you take two studs and you put them together the crowd doesn't know that they're two studs they look they nullify each other so they look like average fighters right but they're not average fighters right if you give them a 500 fighter he'll eat them up right and you're showing to the fans look this is a 500 fighter we're gonna give that guy a chance to prove himself you know the 500 fighter thinks he's improved that's why took the fight mm-hmm and this fighter is a young stud we think he's going to be a star these are these are fights to demonstrate that this guy's in a different league and then you have this other guy you had built up and when you put them together there's an anticipation you sell out the crowd like that's what boxing does and they're very intelligent in a way yeah because if you put Mayweather in De La Hoya early on nobody knows how good they are exactly exact normal right right yeah you can you can certainly make an argument for that but then again there's the argument of the outlier like John Jones who fights into his UFC career it comes a youngest champion of all time but he also has three hundred-plus wrestling matches he has a lot of experience very true very true and very important the p-n don't think about that as fights but their competitions at a high level with physicality yeah it's there's definitely an argument for that I think there's something about having the ability to stuff takedowns and then execute takedowns which is such a it's a such a it evens things out and many different ways because you can always dictate where the fights take place and his reach yeah okay so many things the greatest reach in history of you have seen there's no longer reach ever not just the greatest wow I don't think so I think Semmy Schilt probably have a longer reach you're right yeah yeah but also today well what about Stefan Struve he have a long did he is seven feet tall his truths reach longer I'm not sure truths fucking ridiculous bro oh you know what no no I think I think John's longest reports how could John know what it was I I had read an article they were talking about the reach and they were saying that the reach is the deficit of your height and length so how much longer is your reached compared to your height oh I see so that's reach they call it reach apex or something there's the same Whaley a four and a half inch who's that Wow softens truest friend John Jones have the same that's crazy there you go it's true his seven feet oh my god well John is the very best at utilizing that reach and and and just keeping guys in the outside he's our intelligence oh yeah he's very creative and intelligent he knows what's going on in the fight all the way and he shifts he shifts his strategy as if I goes on yeah he's very intelligent yeah I'm really curious to see if Dominic Reyes can hang with him very curious very John Jones shows up I think he's very motivated for that fight he should be well I think he also realized it's like look he lost a lot of time fucking off and getting suspended and all the dumb shit that he did he has a chance he's still right now the number one pound-for-pound fighter in the world he's still the light heavyweight champion and if he moved up to heavyweight he would be the number one contender I mean he should fight heavyweight I think so too why would why isn't he fought heavyweight I think he wants to clean out the division I think he has a couple fights at light heavyweight and I think now there's a real possibility that he might stick I think you've got Corey Anderson who looked fantastic in his last fight you know Johnny Walker they were thinking was gonna be the next guy from the title Cory Stark to Sam he's a guy I'd like to work with general or Johnny Walker yeah yeah I think he needs more polishing yes oh for sure he's got great talent silly power yes his powers crazy but he needs to oh yeah he no he's a very big prospect yes no I agree he's a wild man - but you know Cory found holes in his game exactly figured it out and Cory is clearly one of the top contenders like there's just two guys that really stand out it's Corey Anderson and there's Dominic gray isn't Dominic with that knockout over Chris Weidman yeah that's hard to watch for me I didn't like that fight for Chris and I don't like him move it I think he's at 185 pounds lighter I think you should stay there then that I think there's too few division not a man not a good fight to go through two or five for the first Oh terribly bad idea terrible I liked him versus Rockhold at 205 no stirring I don't know what happened there there was a I think was scheduled once upon a time was it think so - they have to scare if they're gonna fight those two that's the fight to make yeah well Brock holes done he doesn't want to do you never Jitsu match though who's going against um is it a warden all right well he I think he's talked to talk shit about Gordon I don't know if there's anything actually scheduled won't go well for him legs legs could be in real trouble I've trained him Gordon a lot you know he may never walk again like you should be careful like that would have talked shit to him you know yeah like all those Danaher leglock specially scare the fuck out of me man listen if you're talking if you're talking a lot it might take a second or two longer to let go of the leg lock yeah you know you got to be careful with that hear the crack you know he commenced a meniscus like it my favourite grappling match of all time is Paul Harris versus Gary tonin that was a great fight I think Paul Harris was probably 25 pounds heavier than him more how much much heavier was he I don't know but he came in overweight did he he's just you know you got tested positive already oh for sure now he's out of UFC he's not he's not very tested positive from being in the same room as me that's how positive is [Music] what point he takes Gary and throws Gary like literally just yeah and it's like Gary just kind of rolls yeah I was a beaut that's what you Jitsu is yeah you know just going with the flow of it all and you farm to a draw and I thought well he got the better of him but the rules is there's no sub right it's a draw but Gary if there was no time limit Gary's gonna stop him he was gassing out you know he was slowing down and and Gary was just picking it up picking it up on him and Terry he was gonna be was gonna catch him yeah well another great one is cyborg versus Gordon Ryan or so I was a multiple time jujitsu champion a veteran of the game Gordon Ryan had only been doing just like five years yeah times of change and crazy like that John danaher's found a way to teach you jujitsu in a nutshell like he's just now the most efficient trainer in history of jujitsu yes he's Gordon one double gold again yeah and in stunning fashion - and after knee surgery yes yeah John has created a new way the best judge took place in the world today is New York hands of Gracie Academy the way that I'm talking there the purple belts today are scary as hell like if you roll with their purple belt it's like he's a super seasoned black belt like I had I had one of my students I promoted him to brown belt and I got in a lot of trouble from John because I took him from purple belt to brown belt and the guy had sub my students up like five black belts a year and I was like okay time for brown Bob and John's like no he's not good enough yet I'm like okay but he said five black belts in competition like real good black belts and it's like so what you know you just have a new standard now mmm there are purple belts today at hands look at hensel's John it's a new standard these guys are so good it's scary man you better know the leg lock like I like I learned like blocks from them it's crazy to the Manhattan where the price for rent is so goddamn high and they still have like a thousand students it's crazy it's like it's if you go there and you're a stud if you're a stud and you go in that practice room you're a regular jewel like I don't care if you're GSP I don't care for it you are like this is gonna be a hard day and you better be nice you know they give it early hum but when you come in here you know like I've I just sent Kevin Lee there you know like Anthony there's so this generation like the generation under me and George they're so good they got so good so fast and Eddie Cummings opened up his own place right um I think is that another club I think you should not presume place he was John student like I stroll with Eddie back in the day it wasn't that great like you could seize but he's very intelligent guy very and then all of a sudden he got super good like I'm telling you night and day and I got roll with him once and he was okay you know then I came back like six months later a year later and he was like freaking he was unbelievable and John had just been in developing these new John's in there in hours a day man figuring out little things sleeping on the map and teaching Eddie this teaching it and he's not a freakishly athletic guy he's a good athlete but not like it's not as athleticism is it's the technique the skill think like he's catching me in things I don't even know what they are and that's what it is that's that's Jiu Jitsu once they innovate something you don't know what it is it's like you're getting caught in that and that's what John does innovating all sorts of things and in the game that now his student who's a pearl belt is better than that black belt over there they had one blue belt they promoted him at Abu Dhabi purple belt he's a blue belt at Abu Dhabi he got on the podium and they gave him his purple belt I'm forgetting his name now it's Nick and Nick something The Geysers is it I can remember he's new he's brand new on the circuit happy big yeah I haven't even trained with him once yet like I haven't gone to New York in a little bit I didn't go to it I didn't go to New York last time oh I didn't go to Enzo's not some house in your Google Nick Rodriguez hands Oh Gracie he's like a heavyweight right yeah he's big yeah didn't he beat cyborg he's not he didn't beat him by decision yeah he beat him I'm not sure he did I think he was the one now that I'm thinking of it who they said was going to have a grappling match against oh yes yes yes that's what it is yeah yeah I think UB struggled Wow yeah yeah I'm telling you they're good man they're good they're getting good so fast it's crazy look at Nicky Ryan yeah listen I love that kid when he was like 15 and came to my gym like now he's like 16 17 yeah room is it true meet the guy who won third ADCC trials after just six months of training also freakishly strong yeah yeah yeah yes yes for sure very good athlete yeah Nick Rodriguez there it is six months that it's just fucking work yeah they're getting good so far how does someone come in third place in Abu Dhabi with six months of training like what in the fuck man Jonna has a system now like it's so he was a model and then he started doing this it says that make money being on fitness model or something crazy what does that mean these days like you could have an Instagram page where you stick your ass out dude how old is he he's like 19 I think he's really young does it say I think he's young something like maybe he's 21 or something like that but I feel like he's pretty young I got to roll with Nicki right and I've been doing you shit so longer than he's been alive you know I'm just so good dude yeah 23 Oh Cameron he's so good it's ridiculous yeah man he's a really interesting guy too because his brother so big and he's like what is he like 150 pounds or something no a little morality 116 he's not huge but yeah his brothers goddamn gorilla though yeah that's a big fella and they're smart kids I mean John like schools them like to be smart it's incredible and they did they start out with him with John yes well actually no I think they were in a neighboring school but like that this is John's curriculum like a you know like I don't have to be honest like I I've been in the practice room with them many times like everything they do is this is John man I'm telling you like there's no there's not a movement in there that's not him he he's incredibly an incredible tree it is incredible and how ironic is it what's going on here hilarious 12 103 kilogram catch weight what is that - what is added weight to 2022 ten sound what it is but it's 2.2 4 that's soon yeah 4.3 times 2 is about 9 10 so 105 times just not okay because so Rockhold when he fought at light heavyweight and wonder how much weight he cut to get to 205 that's interesting though 30th of November okay that's real fucking soon Apple days a few days yeah oh it's on you go see if I pass oh shit this son oh shit you gotta watch it I'm gay I'm deaf watch it I'm gonna be in Hawaii oh yeah man cool um there's gotta be a competitor like is there is there anybody that's like close to putting out that kind of talent that quickly it seems like usually that's great it seems like usually when someone comes along like that and others rise as well you know other people right it would happen it'll happy people will go down see what he's doing try to figure out you know it's crazy that is also a guy look at these guys Jesus Christ Kevin this is a famous fella but what's crazy is it like John Danaher has his fucked-up knee fucked-up hip and he's teaching people out of fuck people's knees up it's incredible ironic ironic it's poetic but it is in case it's weird so back to John McCrae as in John Jones what do you think about that fight it depends which John Jones shows up like he's he motivated to train because if you underestimate Reyes you're gonna lose because not he's human John you know I guess last fight we saw his human you know everybody obviously is but he's gotta take this guy seriously because the thing is you're undefeated you have this lower to you can be beaten and all of a sudden somebody beats you how many times have we seen that like the Ronda Rousey fight like one day it's gonna happen to you and you know that's sort of one thing I think that made George great cuz George was always scared of that day a nice to always put it in his ear look at this chap everybody thought it was an undefeated then he'll or like we'd always talked about these things and that day is always around the corner you gotta get up before that day comes like this it's gonna happen everybody has expiry date and I feel like you know racism is a serious contender he really is yeah and he's got lightning-fast hands that that counter punched that he knocked out wiping with like holy shit and finishes him on the ground with hammer fists like what I was saying that I just think there should be more weight classes I really do I think that jump between 85 and 205 is just two giant 20 pounds I would love to see lightweight super lightweight not the weight super well - yeah let's give us there's gonna be so many interesting fights yes yeah I think it should be every 10 pounds yeah I mean I don't think that's unreasonable at all Bob saying it varies sometimes for seven it depends on the weight class but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a 35 45 55 65 75 and do it like that yeah and let guys fight in different divisions yeah I can fight two divisions I can sign for two division why not why there's gonna be so many great fights to make I think they have this idea that there'll be too many champions but I just so what slightly disagree so it's made of belt for the best motherfucking leader the United another title fight for that card you can't get these two champions to agree they both have a title yeah because originally it was supposed to be losing mine and Colby yeah if I remember correct yeah you can't get them to agree for whatever reason oh we're gonna have this other title fight you have to have a title fight in New York yes it has to be a good one Trump is coming you know you gotta have something really amazing you do you can't have like a regular three-round fight yeah true Trump is gotta happen yeah have a something you know yeah Trump is coming it's New York City but it's New York City that's the thing it's like New York you're in Madison Square Garden it's not just the fights it's where you are history yeah you've got to bring your a-game you know you got to make it something legendary you got to make it something historical that's true yeah you're in the most iconic arena in combat sports history and that's the spot that plates been around forever it feels different when you're in there too it really does it's so for Kevin to win that fight by headkick ko and come back and do it in Madison Square how happy were you man oh man I was super happy everybody thought he's gonna miss wait every thought he's gonna lose and everybody picked the greatest fine it's a very dangerous fight and it was undefeated and lemon haze a model wrestler during that camp the last two weeks he Kevin pops his ankle did he really yeah really badly so I was like oh man the fights might be off you know like was really bad then the next day comes in limping in he's like I'm gonna keep training I'm like wall man like he was really limping that Friday he sparred again back told him like you got to put on a ankle brace because it was really bad then he hurts himself again Friday same angle same ankle same injury like it was so tight it was so then the injury was still really really bad like he shouldn't been sparring but I couldn't stop him like you really wanted to keep training I was like maybe you should take Friday off no no coach I'm okay tell me I don't worry I don't feel anything I see him limping around ways I I'll warm up I'll be okay it's a very tough kid I look this is what it takes sometimes you know you want to win a big fight you have to work through these kind of things and he hurts himself a second time I'm like you know this is tough and P I the the performances would help them a lot they checked it they said it's still you know it's it's it's mechanically sound it's just kind of like no no no key ligaments are broken and anything like that and he ended up winning with a head kick with that bad ankle oh wow yeah that was his bad ankle but it was it was a scary injury we had in practice you know how it is in practice like sometimes you could be as safe as you want to be no but I mean Oh fighter fighters when they get in there a lot of times they're already injured oh yeah you're not a hundred percent when you're in there you got a wrist you got a neck you got something but this is one this one was really bad this was this was really bad I was like he's like no listen I made the decision I'm gonna go through with it I'm like okay so what was your Anamika of the fight he was a lot better by then but still I was worried about it since it's not as stable as it should be Wow did you tape it up or anything no I don't think we're allowed to ask that we're not a lot to tape why can you not tape I don't know but you could tape your wrists the gauze and all that yeah yeah why does it how come you can't tape your ankle I don't know why you never when soccer Robbie used to fight yeah what's neat its his knees were like mummify yeah yeah they were covered on halfway up his thigh all the way down his calf he's to have the most crazy knee wraps ever I mean and Sakuraba was a leglock specialist who he probably mangled his knees and training you know and all the fights and all the training I heard looks and drinks before smokes and drinks before practice yes didn't give a fuck cigarettes do you remember when he fought Conan Silveira and they made yet again he fought twice in the same day they fought they fought John McCarthy stopped the fight Coney and hit him with an uppercut and Sakuraba drum chopping down grabbed ahold of an angle was fighting for a takedown and John a dirty got the fight because he thought yeah he thought of talking around went out so there in Japan everybody goes crazy right they this was the same year this is the same fight where Frank Shamrock submitted Kevin Jackson remember oh yeah that dog armbar with shoes on the fastest armbar in history of lumbars was it I don't know it looks like one of them as soon as he took him down arm boom arm bar yeah so he fights again and then MIT's Conan come out of the locker room what then they fought again like one fight later and so when they fight again Sakuraba gets him in an armbar and makes him tap one like what a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt tapped like no one thought that Conan would tap like this is crazy Sakuraba was so special oh my god this generation that didn't get to watch him fight has to go back and look at those fights oh they have to go back there was something so special about him yeah I don't know what it was and look I love the Gracie's and he was beating the Gracie's and I couldn't help but like him do you call him the Gracie hunter remember yeah everybody broke hanzo's arm yes yes the Kimura yep hence it was winning that fight yeah just came down to the last little exchange well in that scramble Enzo's arm just look at that oh my god oh my God look at that yeah it's fucking nasty hens will beat him after in metamoris and grappling match oh that's right how like beat him in the MMA how the Gracie well that's right that was very gutsy of Holly that's right so you know I'm gonna go fight this greasy hunter you know who dismantled him Oh mayhem Miller really mayhem Miller he was in his prime when mayhem Miller went over and fought in he fought in Pride when he was in his prime hmm and when he was really a contender and he systematically broke sakarov a down beat the shit out of and submitted him he's a very tough guy he was fucked in a good man for a while look at him they're throwing a peace sign up it was those crazy gay wow there's always crazy guy and then you know like legit problems after that I imagine eyes and then after the Bisping fight you know then he had even more legit problems but in that fight man he was on point he beat the fuck out of Sakuraba the scariest loss though that Sakuraba ever had well there's three scary losses the two two Vandelay they're both terrifying he got really fucked up by Mandalay but then Melvin Manhoef Melvin Manhoef beat the fuck out of him with soccer kicks on the ground and all that crazy shit back when Melvin was Melvin just Melvin remember when that guy was built like oh my goodness like fucking like a superhero didn't look like a real person I've seen him fight light Eggman that guy's a savage woo he's fast the committee knocked out mark hunt with one punch did you know oh yes he was a hundred and eighty-five pounds you know I got mark hunt with one key boxing fight though right was it no was MMA no look at Melvin Jesus Christ he was he's a gladiator shorts on those uh those the gladiator frill shorts he formed him up that's not a Sakuraba though no that's someone else he's fighting the greatest fight one of the greatest the the greatest comeback fight I've ever seen in my life was k1 hero's Sakuraba he's getting beat up by this Luther winning guy I don't even know the guys name and weren't wearing Japan we're watching some main event put this ahead to the actual fight here but back it up a little back it up back it up back it's a real quick fight man it happens in life no no go like where the K is seize it no see where it says 2 point 3 point 7 X 3 point 7 K with a thumb up the first thumb up go to that part right there BAM right there click there click there yeah look well it's right before it gets fighting they're right about the dog collar on you bring him out on Alicia's coat yeah Colorado he was at Mike's gym like it yeah scoot up right there good right there's good we see them so they're they're fighting off and so mark hunt charges at him and when Mark Hart charges at him Melvin just catches him while he's coming in so they exchanged a little bit here on the feet just a little bit of moving around mark on so much bigger than him man mark hunt might be a hundred pounds bigger than him no bullshit he easily could be 290 easily and the tank look at this boo one shot I mean come on son who the fuck narcs knocks out mark hunt with one punch it's crazy that's crazy he was so fucking fast man so fucking fast there's a there's a key when heroes fight Sakuraba fights like a Lithuanian guy an unknown guy and this guy is beating the hell out of Sakuraba oh I thought I fight he is beating I'm like stop here stop this fight right here he's between the rows and doing guys our God and that Japanese people just believe in him so much they know he's gonna make it out of there and he comes up comes back to life so we're like what the and then the arm versus Lithuanian guy and then they throw up the confetti and everybody the Japanese people just believe this is a bomb like stop this fight ma'am I mean I'm live here I'm in the stance I mean I gotta fight punch the Vice at everything um I can stop the fight no no no not gonna stop the fight no I just have to fight crazy wait a second although they want to bring him back in the ring yep ah he's out of bounds okay yeah he's punched him while the reports before even said good go hammer fist at him this is one of the greatest comebacks I've ever seen in my life yeah it make you think there's no way sakarov was gonna survive here there's no way and he keeps moving and this guy keeps punching him yeah this is crazy and he's standing up - he was no damn her up and he's hammer in the back of his head Sakuraba was just he had no quit in him you know like none and sometimes that was horrible to watch because he would wind up getting beat up hmm look at his leg like look at that fucking right leg how much is taped up it's crazy this guy's holding the fence - yep yeah so yeah actually gets him down scoot up a little bit there Jeremy yeah this is a PD this is a beating and the leading gave up standing - yeah he blues what hey he got too tired here and eventually soccer I'll catch so look at these uppercuts sorry was berserk that crowd was losing it at this point yeah they believe in him so much when he lost the first time he was like look I'm happy now that the weight is off my shoulders you know the Japanese people now they know I can lose and like I had too much pressure on him they always expect them to win scoot ahead oh there it is you see mount some credit they said that's how you finish Conan - same you say move yeah incredible yeah um there's another great come-from-behind with Melvin when Melvin fought Robbie Lawler you remember that fight oh my god that's oh that's one of the greatest fights fucking Robbie Lawler's legs up and then yeah below I hit him with a hay maker this is one of the most legendary and Cyborg when he fought cyborg no yeah yeah yes yes yes yes yeah that was horrendous too I think the craziest not gonna ever saw was Michael venom page vs. cyborg my god that was terrific yeah and all the years I've seen fights I've never seen a guy get his head literally caved in from a knee you know what when you're knocking out like that you don't dance like right I feel like like after Kevin knocked out Gillespie I don't think any right-thinking like right this kids still down down for a long in technique see you have to respect the guy we don't know like if the guy is revived okay I understand you want to celebrate that get it but yeah sometimes you know like this guy's injured I don't think anybody thought that he was gonna be injured like that though we I've never seen a guy's forehead and crotch like when he went down it wasn't he wasn't right obviously like you could tell this well the other thing was cyborg was saying like he's once a fight again in three months and they're like hey dude he doesn't know where he is yeah this isn't the way no like a couple weeks later yep see ya it's probably still right he's he's got so many demons in his mind after that he doesn't know what's going on yeah right I mean you might remember the x-ray oh it's like you see and you go oh no oh man it's hard when your face gets but you know when your face gets broken like that when all your your bolt like there's got to be some like sage sage fought Cosmo Alexander which is another ridiculous fight that was hard for me to watch very hard very hard very hard because I like the kid he's a real good kid sage yeah but doesn't belong in a ring with Cosmo no no that's that's honest truth yeah not yet especially in a ring like a like a tight like I like karate and a big 30-foot octagon I like karate and got the room to breathe here in a small ring it's harder to do crud it's just harder well also cosmos a world oh my goodness the guy's a killer yeah killer season striker and he's quite a bit bigger too much experience too too fast too soon yeah too fast too soon what's the harm of going a little bit lower than like I'm a much lower than I like I rather I rather have gone to a fight that I could have done more like I could have been a better guy they go into a fight where this guy was way too much for me like let me just go up slowly you know and and see how far I can go and and then kind of like challenge myself where it makes sense that fight to me doesn't make sense yeah but that's another one like his face was broken in so many different places now they gotta put his face back together yeah it was that could be a fight in like your career could be over like fighting career yes right again he's gonna go back to him 155 said I learned my lesson okay but you know what I I don't like injuries like that like he wasn't surgery for like 18 hours or something I like I mean this is too much like you gotta be you gotta you miscalculated here it can happen to anybody but at least if I had done it in my weight class against somebody you know my level and it just happened okay fine but that was asking not that's a that's a horrific one what do you think about one FC's desire to stop weight cutting I love this idea I do as well what sweet cutting what does that mean it's cheating what is it sanctioned cheating we have to weigh the same and we fight each other why do we have to go through a wicket right it should be ending the e weigh less than you weigh yeah you weigh 170 for 15 minutes exactly yeah the weigh-in is about we want two guys at the same size to fight each other yeah and now guys found a way around the rules I know everybody has to do it because otherwise nuts yeah it's nuts but when Kevin went up to 170 it just didn't seem right for him em those guys know they're naturally bigger yeah and they're doing the same thing that he was doing to get to 155 but now he's not doing that thing anymore and it'll also seem like he got tired quit but also he wasn't with you that you need I really believe this and this one of things I said to him you need a maestro you need a conductor you need someone and yet someone that can that's an honest Assessor someone who can look at your overall game figure out what you're doing find the flaws be honest with you and then tell you when to ramp it up and when to slow it down and just have a and as someone who's been there yeah if you don't have that man so this is so hard to do all that shit by herself so many things to think about there's a so much to think about too much almost right yeah and everybody has an opinion so I always tell people okay show me just get in the ring and show me your opinion is correct I'll change my opinion if you could show me so that's why I like sometimes I work with trainers and have these crazy ideas I just um okay train some young kid I have these young kids train them show me your philosophy I get I get trainers all the time they want to show me something and I always always entertain them always come show me do a demonstration but it can't be theoretical like what I'm I had this guy who had this way of making me stronger like through like a physical therapy so I I said okay let's do it let me do my max set up pull-ups and we did either like 15 or something and then we did his treatment and I went back to the pull-up bar and I did 15 I wasn't stronger like I wanted to test this theory like in it there was nothing maybe didn't make me strong I'm just as strong as I was after before the there's a lot of those physical are because like I'm doing some nerve activation I'm don't you're I'm gonna dig in your scapula with my knuckle that's going but listen I like to detain them who knows maybe the guy maybe think I might know something well what's interesting is sometimes the placebo effect catches on and then we're in with one fighter and the fight oh go do the guy fix my neck yes I know the sudden next you know this guy's got a business going yeah and he's you know standing on people's backs no good doing voodoo trust me I've seen this tool man I've seen that I want to say names laughs I don't say names either but I've seen a lot of it and I there's one guy that was going through a bunch of different fire yeah went and did it with him and I was like what are you doing yeah and this is it 15 20 minutes of questioning right so I'm asking all these questions he basically said well you know how the placebo effect works right and I said well it works as you think it works right he was yes he was the same thing I go so it doesn't work you'll know it does work if you believe in it I go so you're saying that you're bullshitting they believe your bullshit then it's real is that what you're saying like we have this lawyer I trapped him mmm where this long conversation about this I wouldn't let it go yes I want to know what you're doing yeah you tell me what you're doing mmm like you just fucking pushing on people's back and pretending you're fixing their eyesight yeah is fucking crazy it's nuts but there's a lot of that out there because fighters want any kind of edge whether it's copying or acupuncture bro once a once I got started doing Thai massage my game changed and if you believe your game changes and sometimes your game does change you know you got a test measure retest there's no measuring yes it's like you know that that game changer is documentary mm-hmm the guys doing the battle ropes now one hour right we ate carrots yeah you went from eight minutes to an hour you know why people stopped after eight minutes because they're bored of doing battle rope for longer than eight minutes I who does battle rope for for more than eight minutes is crazy if I give you something if I'm or if I tell you Joe you got to do battle rope for an hour and I'll give you a million bucks I guarantee you can do battle rope for an hour like it's it's you could slow down the pace and it's not measured it's not measured if I'm trying to treadmill you tell me look I can do 12 miles an hour for one hour I'm like Bobby like on an incline no I'll be like wow that's that's measurable right right right batter up you can slow down you can you can kind of like you know you can you can relax your muscles you're not putting as much wattage out the reason why you went for an hour's because we're not measuring how much output you did yes you know you can you can't like there's a reward for going an hour you know you're doing a documentary like there's all these things that are not controlled yes and there's so much training there's just so much of that everything there's a voodoo thing out there and you're playing with your career too you know you got to be careful with the voodoo stuff you have to be very very careful like but the thing is also you got to be open-minded cuz sometimes people do find real things that actually work not I'm not talking about like massage and stuff like I haven't seen it but imitation yeah a visualization I believe these things can make a difference but there's also a lot of concrete evidence on these yeah a lot of concrete evidence especially meditation and visualization visualization there's actually evidence that sometimes it's as effective or more effective than actual training in certain sports like they've they think about one specific type of motion like throwing a baseball or something like that and you could argue that if you just really visualize throwing that baseball over and over again and then get motivated and maybe even allow your muscles to heal so you're not throwing the ball as much but you understand the motion better because there's also like the there's a point of diminishing returns where you're training too much she breaks down but yet you still think about it you want to do it and then you go overboard and then your tissue doesn't recover in time and then you train again and you're within a compromised state whereas if you trained less but visualized the extra time have you ever heard of Laney Basham mm I don't know sound familiar he's a he's a what do you call that skeet shooting champion okay old medallist silver and gold and his son is also a world champion and he has a whole system on how to train and he does a lot he's super heavy on visualization like mega help heavy and he used to train six hours a day visually well yeah like an extreme experiment and he went from silver to gold like it's a very fascinating guy as a whole system he wrote a great book called with the winning in mind one of the best books in the game yes absolutely this is his journey in like he basically he talks about how everybody has a self-image and you live up to your self-image so he has this thing where I got say he does something good in practice let's say you did a you landed a good throw in practice or a submission he would tell himself he'll give him a cue that's me that's me if he did something wrong in practice he would visualize it him doing it right any be like that's me so he's building his self-image so then he says because he says like guys when they're under the the lights this the guys who screw up the guys who choke is because they couldn't visualize himself as a winner hmm they couldn't but he's not talking about visualizing yourself raising your hand he's talking about visualizing the process of winning like actually doing every step so that you're telling your subconscious mind this is where you're going like he's leading like he has a very interesting system and I think it makes a lot of sense because guys who relive the bad in practice those are the guys are gonna screw up again how I suppose name laney Basham it's be a seh an OS hsm hm SSS H am yeah and how he spells first name Lenny Lainey Lainey Lainey yeah this guy's awesome LA and NY wow what a crazy name yeah Lanny bass ham I don't remember and why all right man you know what I like on vacation I might get that book and put it on the Kindle yeah you can get the audio - oh it's got audio that's interesting yeah I like that man I like because visualization particularly have you visualized in the isolation tank before yeah yeah that's my favorite mmm that's like visualization squared hmm because you can you can imagine yourself going through movements you could see them you know and without when your body's just floating around in there you have more access to resources your brain sort of works better you can you can lose things better you lose what's real what's dream what's Thun yeah it's all real now yeah six hours a day pretending you're shooting shit yeah ding ding and what why I believe the system works is because not only was he champion his son also went through his curriculum and he became a champion and shooting is a hard sport oh yeah yeah yeah and it's a lot about getting everything lined up perfectly squeezing the trigger at the right time don't jerk the gun you know follow the the clay pigeon stone knowing when to pull yeah it's very mental so many things are man mmm how much when you're training young fighters how much time do you spend with them talking to them about how to think I always tell fighters that far from the fight it's 99% physical we have to go through the routine we have to drill we have to make these skills instinctual closer we are to the fight like the week of the fight now it's 99% mental I can't train you no more I can't make you go back into recovery the fights coming this week so as that we get closer to the fight it becomes more and more mental do you tell them to stay off social media that week of the fight ah some of them that that's how they let their energy go it's so nuts yeah she fires three days out fight Twitter like that's how the event yeah I mean I'm not like that Mia like you don't see me I have a youtube channel but everything else I don't do too much social media smart but some people the events some people they feel like it's how they connect like I don't know if it's gonna help them or hurt them but I like to I like them to be surrounded with the training partners before the fight just training partner is like least amount of public as possible that's how I like to do it but if the guy feels comfortable with his wife and daughter in there that's up to him but I feel like when you're going to war I wouldn't bring my family to war right that's how like me and George used to look at it we're going to war don't bring your family your kids like yeah who wants miss kid like I know some fighters do but I wouldn't want my child in the arena when I'm fighting because I'll be thinking about them well I remember watching the fight this weekend with Luis Ortiz and Wilder and you know when you see Luis Ortiz his family sitting there watching hmm and then while their starches I'm like yeah it makes you think yeah we can handle it their family maybe they can't you know maybe that kid now right he's scarred right I've seen a guy walk his son to the fight like walk like infants like a five-year-old yeah bring him to the this is like a local fight bring him to the corner like VIP seating he gets knocked out really bad this cuz five result watching is that like totally out people are cheering it it's like yeah why did you bring your son here like we're not here to you know the games it's also distraction yeah it's a distraction and you like it or not you have to think about that kid you're holding the kid's hand it's everything you know and by the way the universe doesn't give a fuck hole in your kid's hand if you didn't practice correctly and if you're not skilled enough you're gonna get hit yeah yeah and if you're not if you're not as good as the person you're fighting your kids gonna watch you get starched mmm I think is this is a very bad strategy like it could be a child abuse to like just leaving another arena it's not for them it can fuck your kid's head up me I don't let my kids watch fights where they know the people fighting anyway not live unless okay if it went well let's it's about let them watch but I don't let them watch live I don't know what's happening I don't know what's gonna happen like they know that person they see that person regularly you know I tell my wife don't don't when the fights are going on let them go play put them in another room Mike don't let them watch these fights you know because you never know yeah my kids started coming into the room to watch when I was watching fights on TV when they're like six six or seven and I have to tell him I don't know if you're ready to watch this this is not good yeah and I'm like these people are hurting each other smite I heard each other as a fight they're fighting hmm and she's like why do you tell these people do you do the commentator so you tell the people what's happening I go I explain I explain what's happening she goes do you like it when they beat each other like it's complicated if the this company the hardest thing is if I really know someone I like them wants them get fucked up and then also being excited about the guy who fucked them up it's really hard that's that's really hard to do I remember when the machine knocked out Marconi forgetting his name though the the founder of rain Mme Munoz oh and how he treated him after he picked mouths about to him he hugged them yeah like this is a Thai kick yeah this made me feel better and I was like you know what we're not trying to hurt people here right this is just was just immense - that was a weird one that was weird yeah yeah but there was a respect and I gonna hurt you more than I have to win this was a beautiful yes yeah well Machida had some great moments like that man yeah now is Jorge done like what is he doing how often is he trained time all the time she do it I'm telling you I believe matter Kobe gets injured like really I don't know I don't want to talk for Jorge but man he can he can kill anybody he can kill anybody this man he's the world's greatest martial artist really I think so tell me he's a monster like I was training with him Saturday the guy's an animal well you know what when he came back and fought Bisping I was like man this is gonna be interesting to say and he came back and he looked fucking better than ever mmm his hands look great his kicks look perfect and everything and that rear naked choke was one of the best rune a kid chokes to win a title I've ever seen in my life yes it wasn't this one with the paw on the back of the head it was cinch yeah it was hmm rock solid in his jujitsu looks so fucking sharp man yeah it's like he clearly showed that he had been training the whole time that even though he hadn't fought in those years he had been training hard he looked better he loves to Train like Saturday he trained he finished all his rounds then he was coaching some blue belts and purple belts and just kind of hanging out with them talking technique the guy loves this stuff man he's just but that's why I tell people is she would love something with him you'll do a lot of thinking now uh you know he's such a nutcase George he's great he always tells me like so many crazy characters in MMA I'm like yeah bro you're the crazy one of oh no I'm not most aliens who steal my god dude I assure room with him many times he puts a foam roller against the door like this why did you do that my George white like I moved it you know I put her legs right no bro leave it there like for what in case the aliens get us he'll know the next day he'll know because the foam roller was moved oh Jesus Christ does he think aliens can come through walls how they taking him out they just take him through the hole in his hand because they wipe his memory after but he'll know because they don't know he put the foam roller there so when they move it when they move it he'll remember it's a cue for him to remember not what if he's right what if they are experimenting what if they really come down they said this is their world's greatest martial artist we are going to run tests on him he's awesome but let's say about he's a mind and he's got to be like 37 now right he's older is he 38 38 1938 does he have like a thought in mind of like when he's gonna definitely like throw it in or just it has to be in my opinion is gonna have to be on wanna talk for him okay but I think the thing that's gonna motivate him is a mega fight right like he doesn't want to be champion again and fight every 3-4 months like that's done right that's not gonna happen no more yeah but one mega fight invite him back for a mega fight see if you could entice him because he's a competitor man he's still training he stolen ripped shredded fighting he could do five rounds I mean like maybe nine to five rounds right away but he needs a few weeks then he's doing five rounds like he's close to being like he can get in fights eight he's there you know he's just a monster man I'm talking like he's he's a very young 38 year old like I would say whew I would tell you he's 20 years old really yeah he's a guy could've shit oh my god are you kidding me he's a monster that's crazy that he kept the dis a lot of the guys they stopped fighting and they just lose that discipline they just don't want to train anymore he loves well that's what's important about Jorge is that he's a martial artist he's always been a martial artist you know and that that desire to learn and that the enjoying the training and the struggle mm-hmm yeah you know it to him it's it's happening for me too when I go just in the UFC taunt him well they say Josh we got all right for you but need yeah well listen that would be well first of all I'm gonna see Tony Ferguson versus yes yes I know white UFC targeting khabib nurmagomedov Tony verson for April Oh must happen must Barclays Center in Brooklyn oh shit Brooklyn that means I'm going back to Peter Luger steakhouse April 18th that's that's a good fight I like that fight I like that fight a lot please Tony don't fall down and hurt please baby Jesus make this is a fifth time they booked them is it that many times if time oh my god five four times doesn't happen I gotta get one fucking bad-ass it just some bad voodoo on this one if this one doesn't happen because they both pulled out twice on each side that's injury business one of them was the day before though they of the wind I think there was a play Pro yes make it happen that's gotta happen fuck you whoever wins that is the greatest lightweight of all time it's a good argument can you argue against no I mean Tony's had an incredible streak incredible I mean look they never lost his title no and the only fight he lost he broke his arm he lost to Michael Johnson long time ago broke his arm and then finish the fight lost a decision and I think he blocked a kick snapped his forearm that guy has freakish cardio amazing freakish amazing he goes back to the corner not even breathing heavy his opponents exhausted the opponent's face looks like has gone through a fucking meat grinder I mean what is in his fucking knuckles man that guy punches people and just breaks her face apart it's crazy never gets tired tremendous tremendous submission game tremendous striking game and very awkward his strike is extremely awkward yes very hard to read what he's doing he's unpredictable yeah elbows knees spinning every shooting rolling on the ground super create not the way he beat Donald was extremely impressive yeah because Donald's a really good strike Arnold and he battered him on the feet I mean doll's face was a wrong one was close yeah Rahman was close well he's feeling hey on the Mount yes but round two was like what happened all this is just another dimension like he just he just jumped ahead yeah he just ramped it up and when he beat up Pettis like that I was like Jesus Christ yeah you know he's something special man he's something special and I got to see him fight for the title you know I mean and also I was it really disagree with them stripping his interim title because he hurt his knee like come on man the guys doing fucking all this press for you guys and he falls down a freak accident and hurts his knee knee take away the interim title injury man yeah injury and an MMA it's always knees or shoulders you have to protect of course spine but knees and shoulders you have to go into the knife now I could really alter your career yep ACL PCL these things you should never you should never like you should do everything in your power to avoid these like I think George's career would have been a lot longer obviously would have been if you didn't have those ACL injuries what we know today we could have avoided it yeah but the way we were training we're doing certain things that were you know a little bit crazy and now to the end things like like every you had Kelly started on the show sure this guy is a genius man like we send George there he's amazing he's amazing like how becoming a supple leper oh my god sent a this is the always stop people is the greatest training book in the game - oh my god that's exaggeration no it's not because form is everything if you don't have great form you're gonna get injured like as I get older I realize how important form is like form is everything and yes he has these rules in the book that protect your knee and George was doing this the vulgus fault all his career and I never noticed it until I read his mind doing one they call it the vulgus what isn't it's when you when you jump in your knees bow in oh I've seen to a thousand backflips he's always landing like that yeah his knees bowing in yeah and I was reading the book and I was like George had a ACL injury already I was reading the book and I was like holy moly I do this fault George was we all do this he's like oh this will tear your ACL I'm like what really so I called him up like hey would you work with George George went there he corrected him and we haven't any injury since and it's so important because everybody hurts their knee in the game everybody just sue guys and I'm always like telling you guys read the book guys won't even read the book it's a picture book it's super simple he says there's two things that there's two rules to live by one is alignment and the other one avoid over tension in the muscle mmm that's why I bought the the the DMS every DMS deep muscle stimulator okay that's why I started that thing that machine really did mm-hmm it loosens up the mostly never happened I said let's tell everybody about the Tim Tam because I'm a bit of fan of that Tim Tam since you brought it in here we have one right behind ya but now there's a new one that's fuckin 10 times better with heat 10/10 with heat is inaudible yeah bring it out because here's the thing about this - it sounds like a commercial but it's just for you this is for you this has nothing to do with selling things hear how loud this is the new one is way quieter sounds like I'm doing a Tim Tam commercial I think I am but listen listen how much quieter that is right next to it same thing that's one I here's the other one ready here's the other one see dude much quieter this thing save your career how does it keeps going yeah you got click the trigger finger now you gonna write yes three speeds Oh most powerful machine in the game oh I like it stays on yes click it one more time you know you that's 2800 rpm 32 millimeters travel nice girls gonna use this for right they don't need boyfriend's anymore no now you know it would be nice to this could sit in a vice-like clamp it or it's coming up against like like a rack like it's come in the monster rack and like yes coming out 22 yeah yeah I have you can you can climb it on anything absolutely like that that's what I need that we have a lot of trigger heat Jamie heat do sucking warm if you have a tight muscle in your body you gotta kill it yeah like if your hamstring is tight you're gonna blow your ACL yes if you're having if you're if you're like yesterday I thought I was seeing an airplane he knows what Kelly started says he says I'm tiny this guy changed my career he says look if you sit an airplane or in a chair he has a great book on sitting like sitting is the new smoking don't sit all that like especially you said all day yeah you bet you got to know how to sit because you crippled your back and it's like it's like you make you're making this muscle tight you know and then what happens when you go and do athletics your hips are tight right when you're sitting for prolonged hours you're you're you're you creating over tension certain parts of your body there are rules to sitting like I used to sit wrong my back I stopped sciatica a horrible static ax this guy fixed me up and I'm that I wouldn't be able to train as much as I do if it wasn't for him well I'll tell you what helped me is these fucking chairs this yeah they're called fully yeah this is good oh my god it's called the capisco rather from a company called fully actually I think they changed the name of the company again final cuz I saw it on Instagram I was like that's the chair I have but I don't know but anyway these I bought these from my house I'm not these these are fucking phenomenal because they force you to sit erect yeah yeah notice yeah you can't like spoon if you slump like this I mean I used to have like regular office chairs the way my ass would sit in tome slumping by the end of a podcast and middle of my back hair but you know what's the best in my opinion is sitting Lotus you know like when you cross your legs and they have chairs that are there it is fully yeah it is fully it's called the capisco bio hag h AG capisco by hag that's a h with like a weird little thing on top of it what is that is that a actual h a the a rather what is that the fuck is that a it's not a new way what is that well that a as in lower-case huh it's Swedish okay so that's their version of an a cut it out cut it out you fucking extra a but anyway the chair is amazing yeah yeah I used to so Lotus a load across your legs like there's a chair is just a bigger platform on where you're sitting the cushion is wider and you can cross your legs like you're in the lotus position that keeps your spine stable that's what he says like you see people who meditate they sit in a particular way and your spine has to be neutral so for me my the ultimate way to sit for me personally like you see the Japanese they sit on the floor they crossed or like they're in a lotus position and of course a white stance yeah kind of like that but yeah there you go now you can relax hey are you flexible ah you're very fucking me right from yoga class did you yeah yeah I tried yoga at least twice a week mmm so anyway see this book he talks about all the various faults people do like how to create torque in your body how to put a man the guy is brilliant yeah he is I had him on the podcast many many years ago back back in the early days I have to have mine again this would be good to sit like this but be annoying after a while you'd have to have a wider platform like a wider cushion and I can get comfortable and kind of chill yeah yeah but even then I don't know if I could do that for a whole podcast maybe barefoot there's a variety of ways he sits he has a book on just sitting yeah yeah because people get injured because of prolonged sitting what do you think about those standing desks those are the best you recommends them highly there's some that have like weird platforms to it the platform's like moving seem like they wiggle and go back and forth so you always standing kind of funky this is the ultimate he made it bar bar yeah for standing desks yeah this is it this is what you got to do like also what is he doing there just sitting you can move your leg back and forth the second swing almost okay but like think of a barstool you know you have a you have a place to put your foot you have a place to sit and you can get up you're almost seated sitting and standing every every so often so there's always this motion this movement and you need this mobility because when I'm still a muscle there's just not moving for hours and hours that gets super tight so is that just the bar or does he sell the desk - that's a standing that looks like a rigid solid standing desk who scrolled down Jamie see that bar scroll down so I could see that so that is just something that someone made to their specific height what do you call that bar and when you're at a bar the bar you can put your foot on it you know that this is the bar and then you can put your foot on the bar on the bottom or think it's the put your foot on it bar this is what this is what it mimics yeah that's what you got to do when you're sitting that makes sense says like the bar is the best way to sit like so a bar under here would be good if you had a bar or I need one of them under my chair these chairs have it now they didn't yours might be the older one but new ones is so oh what the fuck just grab the other one well what the fuck a bar here my feet have this I think this table they did three inches too low yeah a little too low yeah it's gotta be higher banging into mine but it's perfect for elbows sit that's actually not bad to sit like that oh yeah you'll get real comfortable I kind of like that yeah me when I and when I sit it's always like this at home I can't sit any other way my back's finished this is actually better - I've never sat this is actually for me in wedges my knees underneath this table this might be perfect I'm telling you me when I when I when I eat at home I have my did this how I said I can't sit any other way my back is finished I'm talking like my back is healthy now but if like when I fly I have to take care of my back as soon as I get the hotel I gotta keep away all the tension in my hips I my glutes like I have to make sure what is your issues with your back just from training I have it here you know right here this whole area I do mm-hmm whenever I fly because I'm sitting down at my my muscles super tight super super because your back itself the spine itself get tense or just the lower part you got your glutes I had a bulging disc l4 l5 mmm gone really gone how did you get that to go away natural natural decompression so basically uh it's an it's an kelly stars book you lie down on your back imagine like knowing back and your and you raise your legs and you put them on a platform like let's say I was on the floor and I put my feet up on the our say can you put one of those twin lacrosse balls or one lacrosse ball and you kind of you put it on your back and you just kind of wedge because your cuz you're lying down you're naturally decompressing the spine anyways in his book he shows you how to take care of your back I just did those exercises religiously the problem was it took time that's why I started this thing this thing I do it instead of going through the gym and rolling up and down and for 45 minutes I get to get it done in five minutes super fast I'm done you know and that you have to do it like what the manager at my gym just popped his his heel cord just by doing a roundoff that guy he's a next gymnast he's always doing round offs in the gym he's always fooling around you mean his Achilles tendon yeah heel cord popped oh he was warmed up yeah it was training for an hours I gonna let me do a roundoff like he does it's like routine perhaps his heel cord I might do it I can't I can't afford that to happen to me yeah that's okay he's out for a month like he's it's a crazy surgery he just did it and it's a lot of physiotherapy and like if I did that probably destroy my business like I gotta be in the gym you know I got fighters to train I got people to write I got I'm too busy to have a heel cord injury you know like these these kind of things gonna ruin a career if you get one ACL tear it's very bad for your career if you have two could ruin your career like George wouldn't happened the second time okay he had the finances and the name he was already built he could take a year off right but if he was on the way if that happened in the first second or first or second year of his career his career would have been over like I've had fighters have to a CL tears early in the career careers over why the gods been up for a year so now he's gonna do it again and then two years later is other because you know typically your other ACL pops two years later mmm yeah you know if you pop your ACL on the right you're very - you're a candidate now for the left right two years later pop I hope you're rich and famous so ready I hope you built your name I hope you put enough money in the bank because that's a long time to be on the sidelines now imagine you have three ACL injuries you're pretty much done yeah you know it's a lot to come back from and like like when George fought Condit he'd come back from an ACL injury man that was a horrific training camp because it was such a small window look are you ok enough to do the training camp some boxers are saying yes not sure well it was such a stressful time because that fight was happening a particular date and George was making us come back I would have liked a few more months to get him ready like it was a small window to fit in that big fight and luckily it worked out but ACL injuries is something very serious yeah I've had both of them done yeah yeah what was that what was the recovery like not good no this one was wave hard though this left one was a patellar tendon graft where they cut your own intelligent and drill it in and open you up like a fish and screw in place this one was a cadaver this was way easier this one was six months I was done how long was the graph more than a year before more than a year more than a year much more than a year before it felt right I could do stuff but it just always hurt and I couldn't get on my knees and luck if I was it falls on my knees I was gonna like start from a kneeling position it would hurt like hell yeah just like kneeling to pick something up because they take a chunkier bone out you know and that that takes a long time it feel right thank God yeah I know I'm gonna break my cell numbers it was next week no I never pop my seal and I and I think about it all the time like I'm very careful and I do a lot of leg locks and my students are like lockers but in the gym were very controlled I don't like guys to crank the leg lock hold right hold three seconds yeah that's it yeah in the champ quick yes and I taught me I don't care if somebody grabs me the leg lock tap yes we do leg lock situation it's very safe if you if you have a good culture in the gym but some guys are just you know sometimes it's passes and those guys don't let them do leg locks or off the mat well you know dr. rowdy Magee out of Vegas he does a lot of work with the UFC fighters as a lot of his orthopedic surgeon there they have some new technique where they can reattach ACLs where they don't have to get a cadaver graft anymore really yeah they had no no they reattach your own torn ACL they put it back together again Wow and they had one one athlete I forget what sport it was but he did it and then four months after the surgery competed in the Olympics really yes that's amazing yeah he showed me videos to this guy and they showed he also showed me it's like they take the cord like say as the ACL snaps so the ligament snaps they put it back together again they have this crazy intricate method of stitching it all back together again and then it heals up much faster much faster that way and I think they do it in conjunction with stem cells use stem cells as well hmm ever heard of that it's a very new thing I'll connect you to him you know love him he's he's a great he's been on the podcast for it okay great guy and he's on the cutting edge he's always like going to all these different conferences and finding out about these new research projects that have been done on new healing methods and surgery methods stuff like that he's always on time guy marine very on top of it but he's worked with a lot of UFC fighters last time I saw Francis in his office or other Francis and Ghana was in there getting some stem cell shots in his arm injuries is the worst man fuck you got to stay away from injuries there's no way when you come to Tristar the gym is jam-packed and I had one friend of mine an instructor from another province and he's like he came to the gym he couldn't he was shocked how much students have and I was like yeah because here when you come to Train nobody gets injured like that's my that's one of my key secrets like when you come in here if I see any guy going out of control like it depends you know the more experienced you are the more I let you guys go hard but if you're if you're a beginner like if I see two beginners killing each other like I put a stop to it I put him with a blue belt the blue belts gonna he's gonna like teach him take him under his wing but he's not gonna brutalize him because what happens you're losing that student one of those two is gonna get brutalized he's not coming back right and then that's one less guy in the practice room that guy could have developed him given me a year or two he's a good training partner for my other guys it's a it's like a pyramid give me five years with him now all of a sudden he's a key training partner Oh seven years now he's a winner he's a champion he's going pro that guy you lost him on day one because you you smart you smacked him around you didn't think he's anybody mm-hmm you know like give me time with like I'm gonna mold him yeah let me season him so that's why I like to train up my gym because I know everybody has that kanata to it I always tell my students if you your partner gets injured it's your fault like going without mentality when you get good I like my students there have some students in the knuckleheads they are like you know the Cowboys you know I tell them by the time you're good you're gonna be crippled again your shoulder like you you got to black belt with you or you got a retire in our you got to stop training I'm very big on technique physical conditioning but rough sparring has to be like controlled or done very rarely or in a smart way because so many talented kids get busted up you so many like it's crazy so MMA it's the injuries is ridiculous yeah MMA just sue even more time it's just all martial arts I mean I think that's so important that treat it like your training partner is someone who you're you're in partnership with here you're helping each other yeah and you need them if you don't have good training partners you're never gonna be good this is something I learned from George because I'll tell you the one guy who never hurts anybody in practice is George he's the safest guy to train with I'm sorry I've heard I've seen him hurt like three people in practice all the years I've seen him fight a training I could tell you three times you heard a guy like bad and it was always accidental obviously and one case was a guy got out of control and just kind of like we're just kind of lit him up but that's very rare because George will just like finished around not spar with that guy if he's that guys like you know he's gonna hurt himself if he continues but he's very controlled when he trains but that's why everybody wants to train with George it's crazy like if I would say who wants to go dry everybody's gonna raise their hand because it's crazy because it's gonna be a great experience that's the kind of guy there's some students I have that nobody wants to train with because they're crazy yeah and I always tell them straight like sometimes I roll with people and they scratch my hand that's one thing I hate when they scratch like you're rolling like a dig their nails yeah they're digging their nails cuz they're nervous I won't roll with that guy for a while because every time I wash my hands my hands are stinging era you know like it's such an annoyance to have scratched like it was painful yeah every time you wash your hands and then I roll somebody grabs my hand it's like ah you know like a paper cut and it's like or guy who kicks you in the groin is too nervous he's spazzing it's you can't stand how one guy poked me in the eye I was blind for two hours Joe really I got to the hospital my vision was still not there I'm sorry two hours just because any the guy was a seasoned wrestler or wrestling and he physically people are nervous azar rolling with me I'm the instructor did some people some guys are just nervous because I I gotta show him I'm good and he he kind of did this ridiculous reaction like a totally absurd reaction and he poked me in the eye so bad tell you my vision was gone for two hours by the time I got to the hospitai still wasn't seeing I thought I thought I lost my eye I was freaking out I was like dude I'm gonna be I've won I am have a glass I was like but luckily it was just like a swelling I had such swelling inside my eye when it went down I was my vision came back but I still see a light show like when I'm driving I see lights yeah they told me if when do you see like black polka dots you have two days to get a surgery or else you're gonna lose your IRS oh my god like so now if I'm one day my vision goes polkadot black like I said seeing black spots I have to rush the eye doctor but luckily now it's been over a year some eye is fine when you say you see blight shows like what is it is a realist here percolate I guess I'll be like no I likes like I just isn't that's what Bisping said that caused him to retire he started seeing lights in his right eye on his left eye rather he's right I know his right eye was all fucked up yes died he started seeing lights in - oh really and that's what he said I'm done yeah it's too dangerous because he realized he's already mean he's basically blind oh yeah you see how he wears a he wears a glass eye or a cap you can see when he got my hit by Kelvin he didn't see that shot no he didn't actually I took him like when you don't see the shot it's worse we said is effectively fighting blind in one arm you know since the vitor fine essentially you know yeah you can't see the depth but yeah I see lights here in there and I sometimes I turn my head because I think they're outside well I think the light is outside but it's - it's it's the alien they've moved the roller I'm much better now though but for like a year I was like like like I'll see lights everywhere and did you get an MRI on it do they know what social medicine jewel social social medicine what does that mean you ate eight hours in line and then they give you the minimum social socialize you eight hours in line you or some lion yeah and then they give you the minimum amount of treatment you're here in Los Angeles won't you just stop and have some real doctors true yeah I would like you to get it checked out though if you're still seeing all right I hate doctors man really I love them really oh yeah they put me back together again I rather just like I don't know I really even nutrition and exercise I feel like I'm in a little even doctor yeah yeah I know I know I just get everything good yeah yeah I just have a fear of luck I believe in water I believe a lot of good stuff yeah but you know what it is in Canada you want to see a doctor have to wait a long time yeah and I'm lucky to have friends that are doctors so I just called them up and I go see but man to go do the tests and all this and waiting out takes forever yeah I hear you man but yeah and I mean you know Winkeljohn story yeah and that's the craziest one holdin pass for someone the guy misses a kick on the pad and hits toe into his eye I mean just crazy one more time you can't have one more accident yeah you have one eye that's missing now and the guy had a nice long fight career - never had any problems with his eyes and loses an eye that way it's crazy when I hold pads I hold a small the most dangerous pad to hold is a small one why because this is a smaller target so and plus you feel the kick there's less between me and the kick yeah and the knee this is a very dangerous path to hold and I hold sometimes for seven fighters one night seven fighters oh I always work up but I have nothing on my eyes well one time I got a kick in the head I never had concussion in my life except for this this time the guy he missed the pad he just kicked wrong eye trying to move it boom hit me off the head I'm telling you I was seeing stars for like an hour and a half finish the whole training and didn't say a word to nobody I was seeing like lights and I was like I was concussed for sure acted normal finished practice went home well not feeling well I kind of like it took it took it easy from them but first time I get kicked in the head wow it's very dangerous to be a holder yeah one mistake it is one thing though I wear for sure is a cup when I hold I always work oh yeah I've been kicked in the groin holding like the pads were up here that guy keeps you down there what are you know but I'm always holding in a way to protect myself but if I get a little bit sloppy which can happen you know you're tired boom the holder can get hit really hard it really hurt you get hit I've been hitting the rib Giggy your organs bad thank you very hurt and there's a lot of guys who let people kick him when they have those body shields on yes it's real full power the body yeah Freddie Roach she got knocked out by Tyson he was telling me the story Tyson knocked him out hold he was holding past vert eyes enticing Octomom oh my god because sometimes the guys in his head yeah he's in his head he doesn't like he's you're holding for three punches and he throws a fourth one but just because it flowed right I don't think their malicious like my guys were very you know they're quick they're good kids they're just in the flow and sometimes they try sometimes they hit you so it's very dangerous that's why I mean when I hold pads I'm always like on a guard always always always it's very dangerous a paddle deck is not easy very dangerous no it's an art - yeah there's something that's really it's there's some people that do it really well and those people are cherished and then there's some people that just you know basic shit you might hit the bag yeah but wink wink he's a grateful I've been in a practice room with he's a great trainer but he has won like nah he has to wear the glasses I'm sure the Huey I've seen him wear glasses huh this is so dangerous man they can't lose you can't get hit we can have not he cannot afford one more accent right chorus and there's nothing I can do about it right no he's a glass eye it is a glass huh yeah as one eye this glass oh yeah as glass eye I thought they he's gone unless you get to organ transport maybe I don't know if they can ever do that but yeah I don't know fuck kind of operation with that being I don't know I don't know if the OP like if they can maybe get him a donor one day I don't know but man how would I want to lose my vision yeah Shh for us we just did three hours a week 25
