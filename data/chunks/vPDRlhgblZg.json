- hello dong Gavin hello Joe Rogan good to see you sir it's good to see you it's been a long time yeah it's a pleasure to get you on here man I'm a thrilled to be here we've talked about you I don't know how many times many times I've heard that my son he says you mentioned my name glowingly is them yeah well hey man you were a giant inspiration to me when I was coming up that's good yeah well you know I've talked about this so many many times but that era of Boston comedy when I started in 88 and you guys had already been through the ding ho and all that's been gone and it was the heyday of comedy it was an amazing time and you know I was very fortunate to be able to see guys like you and and Sweeney and you know and all those guys Mike Donovan and Kevin Knox and I mean go down the list over and over and over again Lenny Clarke and just some amazing time for for stand-up back then yeah that was certainly the heyday I came in started at around 79 and it's been going on for one or two years but going on meaning not much going on you know and then it built and built and built and to the point that that explosion has just said wow it and and I always like to think people take her to a Boston style there wasn't a Boston stew other than being very aggressive maybe yeah there were but everybody had different ways you don't because we didn't know it wasn't like an LA style or New York style there was just all different approaches coming out to the same man yeah you started 79 so that was really like the beginning of comedy clubs right yeah well what they weren't even coming cuz here mixing the dingoo thing I used to be a like a saloon and the guys they were sitting at the bottom we first went in there they refused to leave so they stayed at the boat and all they would do is when we put someone in on them or hop understand you know they'd turn around and shut the fuck up we're trying to drink here we couldn't get we couldn't get remember so finally we will without because they get so tired hearing the microphone but that was that was just a little drink that's all you can say you know and became a Chinese restaurant yeah yeah so it wasn't a Chinese restaurant with us alone I think you know and then suddenly this guy came in it was approached to put comedy in there and Barry Crimmins to one of the guys originally Lenny myself Sweeney as you mentioned yeah TJ has it people like that a comedian tingle yeah it was a bunch of us that came in at that time and once again no particular one style other than the fact that we kind of created that the headliner would be the host yeah that was a weird Boston style like when you have the Don Gavin show yes you would go out there and host and you do a few minutes in between each comic right yeah any well we didn't know it was weird because I wanted to be in charge and if Joe were going on and flip to the 15 and you do great great now Bill Johnson comes on your blows I'm gonna go up and take the mic after about six minutes yeah that was go on to the next guy yeah and then at the end that headliner would close the show yeah yeah that much but when he started doing more and more shows like I started Knicks in Boston initially it was a joke it was supposed to be a tax write-off and they try to sabotage it that used to be a steak joint really yeah next stage and when we did it one week the stage was collapse next week did we no no sound next week no writing the doors would be locked and then eventually more more people coming in then they got upset because we were getting in the way of the people going to this distinct pod and then they said maybe we can make money on this well go upstairs there was an upstairs there and that was used only on one night of the week for Greek belly dances well where they were paid $200 the next was 200 off fact they barely did say the production crew but they brought in their own liquor so they only made $200 for the wicked so once we're gonna fit on one show then sure and eventually and around the time when you came here we were doing five shows my are my night on Saturday night five shows in the same place upstairs and downstairs yeah I remember that that was before I was getting paid so I was really an amateur but I remember watching there was a show in the upstairs room right and then there was a smaller downstairs room and then there was another time where they did in the disco right which is a it is a disco now if it is very sad disco well was sad then - yes but it was strange that everyone was cycling from room to room right and you go from upstairs to dance this and again if the first one week we tried that with the first show you were trying to host and was it possible to go fall apart yeah I mean the guy on the side of stage would go you're supposed to be on downstairs and go every just I just started up here and it was so confusing that you get on stage and you say good evening ladies and gentlemen how are you I've already said that it gets to the point and also with a few drinks involved by the fifth show yeah with some repetition sometimes well that was the thing that was also about that was interesting about Boston comedy was that the partying like they you guys are a bunch of fucking savages I mean that's what I remember yeah it was pretty widespread but again we didn't know and almost all of us get in trouble with the IRS but yeah you get paid in cash right and then you just kind of forgot that's what I said told when I get called in I hadn't paid taxes in seven years and I got called in and I said to the guy I thought it was numerous they said well I forgot and he didn't think that was that you Marcelo yeah so that didn't that way no no no no no no no no no to finally get that cleared up how did they catch you on something like that how because I was like cover of a calendar magazine in the Boston Globe there was a group shot of up till about 80 cannabis and there was my picture and this guy had the picture and you know when he confronted me because how come we don't know anything about this you know do they pay for this what do you do for me you know used to be a teacher where's that money you know so yeah so that was how I got caught so the little bit of infamy a frame I guess today it is what Darrell yeah everybody got done in with the IRL I know Donovan he got done in all the whole crew how do you clear that up like how do they decide how much you owe oh that's certainly that's a give-and-take type of situation they have there an appeasement thing I think I mean I you guys nothing on my on my door at seven o'clock in the morning and then you'd have to meet with this guy and then that guy would get fried and would start all over again and lawyers yeah it wasn't it wasn't pretty but it finally got cleared up you know they they took extra money they do know that they weren't going to get the whole thing so I took some of them how many years did it take to clear it up for me it was what four or five years Wow yeah yeah Jesus Christ how much they hit you for overall at one point I was a little behind I think it was a hundred twenty-eight thousand and that was the figure that they came up and but ninety eighty percent that was in interest on the you know the fact that I didn't pay in the for Louis left Florida finally would go up to fifteen hundred or so so that's how the the deal was but somebody somebody thought was a gold mine to attack the entertainer's and that was us once they got one they get another another and the dominoes kept flow Oh did anybody skate did anybody wind up actually paying their taxes Oh almost all but Cisco nobody but did anybody like not get in trouble oh yeah there was some fuel it was intelligent people otherwise the ones I had families and yeah it can put the normal ones I guess that actually paid yeah the ones that were not at those parties yeah there was a thing about you guys though like it was for us young guys coming up like you guys were like Peter Pan's like you were you were living this life as well you know Boston's very blue-collar place right very hardworking place all of New England and we stumbled in as amateurs as open-mike errs to this environment that you know where you guys were the kings and you guys were fucking wild man like there's we heard those stories Knicks of pay and coke and just everybody was drinking all the time and it was like everyone was laughing and yelling and I was like how is this possible how do these men get to live this life and when I was doing I first thought I was a high school teacher yeah I was I was teaching and doing this that getting out of the clubs at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and then attempting to be a teacher three or four hours later when did you quit I got out of teaching in 84 I think so I did maybe crossed over the two together and that was was a rough patch there because I knew something that he give yeah and I tell the story that I was coming home from teaching and not from the clubs at night but it can teaching and I fell asleep at the wheel and this was a highway and I was hitting the stanchion in the side of the highway bank remember and I meant she has him going down this gully you know see all they fast in front of you know what press in front of me was how am I gonna make it to the show tonight and my head went through the windshield how do I came up climbed up out of the gully I'm I'm trying to stump to get home I've got blood running down his face ain't no idea how bad it was then he had to go to the hospital so I go my friend we go back to I was gonna get the car out of the going the car was totaled you know I mean Bianco and his hair and blood in the oh I better pick one drove the other so the comedy comedy worn out did they have open mic nights and seven join oh no and 79 I know when you first started knows it like well the first day there was only one place in existence and that was the comedy connection and a little one the one on Warrington's - yeah yeah yeah probably yeah yeah hundred fifty seats a - yeah and two guys ran that yeah I think they were Sean Morey was the guys had been on The Tonight Show so that's in a daze that was like oh my god you know so he ran a comedy class and two guys took the class Billy downs and Paul Bartolotta Buckley and they decided to you know maybe we'll do this comedy thing but again people didn't know what a comedy club was when you mention that like when Jenna was for way before us there wasn't there's no comedy clubs he'd worked or maybe strip joints or like go and in an auto place so this is that there was there was no place to go I mean even people say well what's the comedian you know other than watching TV you didn't know really what stand-up comedy was even so so the beginning of it started off slow and I remember my first paycheck once I get paid $8 all right those are first $8 yeah and I still have that I have then the copy of the checks are you really are a copy of it I actually cashed it I needed to date cause of course yeah but so that was what Billy Danson and broccoli today and in those days you are audition instead of a open mic night it was just the two of them and I had to go in front of them and I looked at the to him I said I don't I don't I don't really like this because I said no at least one of the you two are not gonna understand what I'm doing and I because you really don't look like a brain trust yet and and I got hired and I immediately was really good and the next show that I did was really good I'm doing the same ten minutes because there was a bartender and had some patter right and the third one they called me like a night before and said you know somebody fell out can you come in and what I had done I had written 15 minutes of comedy that day sure yeah you know but in my mind that's right that and it was the worst death of the world I got about two minutes in and people always say you know what happens when you bomb well you know you don't really don't you don't really mom and after you've been doing this for but that's two or three minutes seems like an eternity you know it seemed like hours and then I just went back into some of the old stuff and I get out and I actually got into a fistfight with Lenny Clarke about it because he was he kept pressing me do you work in New York been on a stage before my life you know and so we were not friends at all at the beginning and we didn't we get into a little to go ahead and say well he said yeah he said oh that was a great set he was shitting on me and his friend sobbing it was witness to the fight and broke it up when he says to any he goes he said he said you just said he had a good show he sucked he knows it led me and you're being an asshole to go come on you know call him out and when they may became fast friends after that that's hilarious yeah Lenny was the second guy I ever got paid to open for really yeah the first guy was um goddammit Warren MacDonald MacDonald yes Wow right bill MacDonald's brother it was a judgement don't yeah wasn't that Bill McDonald no it was Jim George MacDonald was the host of the open mic night he could have been yeah yeah wasn't there a bill McDonald to didn't have another brother named Bill uh no no I'm fucking it up no Kevin you kept there was a fighter Kevin McDonald that's right Kevin wind up going away for a little bit yeah we visited a couple places yeah that's right yeah that's right okay I fucked it up right so but I opened up for Warren well open up for Warren and normal ofoh gig in western Massachusetts very good memory yeah well yeah well was one of the original way back yeah and then another normal folk gig was when I opened up for Lenny wow that was Jay's in Pittsfield do you ever do that one I don't remember that no that was a good one really yeah it was a good one three and a half hours away and well worth it yes what well was for me because I got to know Lenny and Mike and just to get on just Steve time yeah yeah yeah because it was so few places that were in effect doing comedy but but during the time when I was an open mic or things exploded I was very fortunate that was when there was three clubs on Warrenton street alone right right there was Nick's there was the connection and then there was a comedy club at the Charles above the connection yeah that Duck Soup that was across the street yeah remember when Mike had the comedy club at the Charles above the comedy connection for a brief period yeah yeah so there was three and then there was Duck Soup that was on the other side so it was four oh it didn't like I had to get crazy and they were all packed yeah and their lines would be out on the street the middle of winter I remember going out at my show on the sandy there's people there were two inches of snow in their head and I'm going you're actually waiting to see me there's nothing wrong with you people yeah I was something magical about those times because comedy clubs just overall were only a couple decades old in the whole country I mean you had the earliest ones were like comedy magic club comedy connection catch rising star in New York like he had a couple of clubs that were open before you know before the the Boston explosion but this is all real recently so like imagines an art form that takes over the entire country and it really only started in the year 2000 yeah and that's what would be working from the inception to the explosion yeah it was not a mature ad format they'd done it maybe 10 years 12 years right you got Lenny Bruce in the 50s George Carlin and the 60s Pryor you know and then all of a sudden you're in the 1980s this is it's a couple of decades and these clubs we're fucking packed I mean I really wish somebody had done a documentary on it back then because it was such a strange time if you could get real footage with I know France Allah me to have that one dub stood out but I would like to have just shown like how crazy it was people were scalping tickets yeah oh my god this but it wasn't anywhere else like that Chicago never had an explosion like that Boston had the weirdest explosion and there was a multitude of people that were tempted yes one just you know a few there was because I used to get out of New York and you actually had a scene in the NL they had a scene but not nothing as expensive as that and while I started after those two it already been don't you know yeah the Boston scene was a different animal because you could work everywhere the thing is you could work in town and you can get paid in town you could do you know although it's all the different places say it again played against analyst right stick your stitches all those different clubs but then there was all these satellite rooms all the dick Dority rooms and although the connection at rooms in Boston comedy had rooms there were everywhere there's hundreds of rooms and they were good rooms and then I think that the demise at least like from the railroad apex I think came when the comedians were no longer running the clubs that you know his owners came in and agreed factor and every every corner store you know if a tire company would go out of business it's a comedy club now the gas station a bowling alley how many bowling alleys to be working in in those days mm-hmm so why often either and I think what happened was it gets so diluted that people would go to a show and say I don't know what all this is all about this firm because it's this is they didn't get to see the good community right well there was a there was about 12 of you you know there was like 12 murderers who would just run around and it to this day I swear I tell everybody I think they're the best comments I've ever seen in my life to this day there was moments at the cut the Knicks comedy stop and it stitches where I'm like that is about as good as Stan economy ever gets and some of those moments like the the comedy stop next comment stop used to do a dirty trick when a famous comedian would come into town now excited some poor bastard like you know like you know fill in the blank you don't even need a name it just someone who doesn't didn't do comedy that often Richard Lewis let's say him and he would be the headliner right but before him would be you and Sweeney okay Roger Roger sin and Donovan and it would just be a murderer's row of fucking savages yeah Mike McDonald and this these poor bastards I saw I came to Nick's comedy stopped right after Billy Crystal had bombed I like he came up the stairs and they were talking about it like you guys had set him up and you know people were saying like you never seen nothing like in your life this poor guy's a movie star and he went on stage just eight plates of shit yeah after yeah after five people had just been destroyed he's just trying for an hour right like so you got like each guys doing 15 minutes and you've got all these guys going up there just and it wasn't unintentional it was oh why is this guy in our town yes that was the thing about Boston like when a guy came in his head like if you do stand-up in any like you do stand-up in Philadelphia like if you showed up at Phillip people who go oh let's go see Tom Gavin they would want to go see you you do stand-up in Boston you from out of Boston everybody's like fuck this guy they just just set him up and the club would set him up that was what was so crazy for the reason what the reason they would bring these out this outside and they would get plugs possibly for on The Tonight Show with him like that none of us were on the arms on the scene are on the you know on the radar so they would bring in like George Miller was a guy remember yeah nice sweetheart of a guy but no he was just yeah running the gauntlet before you know before he got on what did those guys think when they watched that they must have been fucking terrified Richard Lewis one on TV almost in tears complaining but I only put on the skirt and I know where they got all these guys and and I get it the first night then they did it Chuck and I don't understand but what's they have against me I think she said maybe they're funnier you know I was one of those comments yeah well it was it was a dog-eat-dog world you how to be able to survive in Boston and the the tension span like the way the the stand-up was it's like they didn't let you guys like I should say they you didn't let anybody breathe there's a Boston style of comedy it's like here's a fucking punchline there's another bunch of another punchline take a breath boom there's another one and these other guys that would come in from out of town were not accustomed to that style forming more laconic and yeah like this and I I was told that I took 70 words a minute gusts to 100 I have you know videos of VHS tapes where and I play some of those one time recently I'm gone I have no idea oh I know I this people laughing but I have no idea what I was saying well you had sneaky punchlines you would sneak punch lines in we're done and the sides would come in and boom our tag here yeah did you just develop that style on your own yeah I didn't again why don't I know about style I just that's just the way it was I was always a fast talker you know you come from big Irish families and if you don't Chuck frets you're not gonna get the bread or you're not gonna give the food soon yeah so I had three brothers and and downstairs my cousins lived there were six years so forth so there was always bang bang bang bang bang to that and was all her everybody was an Irish Catholic basically they busted on the comedy scene you know yeah we certainly not homogenized by anyway well that's also interesting too because it was in a lot of places it was more of a Jewish thing sure sure but Boston it wasn't Boston it was like a lot of and a big guys too that was the other thing everybody was like six foot three everybody's a big-ass fucking gorilla yeah and they were all doing coke and drinking it was like whoa this is a crazy place it was almost like well you better be funny and also if a fight breaks out you'd be ready better be good at that yeah I just spit be sort of good at because certainly you're not backing down but that was this thing about it's like comedy and a lot of people's eyes is thought to be something that like nebbishy you know sort of insecure people get involved and you guys were all fucking savages so it was weird for me because like people would say oh I always felt like comedians hated themselves they're all real insecure my I didn't really see that like not not where I started I can remember battle at the ding Hall I mean it was a pretty good brouhaha at the end it's excited I think it started outside the club as they were coming in and it emanated that it was inside and outside of the same time and at the end we don't we ran in foot finish doing the show and at the end a lot of people were talking but nothing about the show would you spot a man that can go really held his own didn't eat you don't know him see so it's got to headlocks and this and it going what about the show oh yeah that was good but there was a lot of brawls I remember brawls I remember a lot of brawls breaking out of clubs but it was just to me I didn't realize how lucky I was to start there in 1988 I really did when you came in anyway I always thought when you came in and saying wow this guy has get something but I thought it was a little too dirty I thought I thought that wasn't gonna work fair but you all right but you knew kind of you hadn't in your head what you had to do you knew that you had to measure up oh yeah you could be pushed to the side yeah when you came in don't you agree with that well there was not much room you know you had a you gotta be good and even if you wanted to go from being an open mic or to hosting or to getting a gig you know on the road you had to be good Boston didn't leave you any room for for scrubs there was I was too many all right too many good comics yeah that was definitely dirty but I was that's all I was interested in you know I mean like when I was 21 I was a fucking Savage all I cared about was sex yeah sex I know it came from fighting yeah so like that's all I didn't know anything like so it fit in that one yeah what I thought was funny was you know just it was kind of fun and I was talked into doing comedy by guys that I trained with right so I didn't think that I was funny I didn't think I was gonna be funny I made them laugh but I thought well you guys are fucking psychos of course I'm making me laugh my my sense of humor is wrong it's all fucked up they're gonna think I'm an asshole so I was talked into doing it and the first comedy show that I ever saw I went to stitches open mic night cool and I went and watched and I remember seeing going sitting there watching all these guys go up on stage and seeing people do it for the first time and I realized Oh a lot of people suck like you'd do this like I'm better than that guy probably better than some of these people at least yeah when I first came in that audition thing I talked about I went in a number of those people were talking about were on stage and I improved prepared to do this addition I was with this girl at then and she goes what about the audition I go nah I don't think so so I just I just left buttocks planet and I went back the next week and them again real good guys by the world one guy I won't mention his name you wouldn't know the name but I'm going Oh finally someone I know that I'm better than this guy and that's when I edition that night but he got me in the show business I could weldment his name Jean Franz was this name he may still be alive I don't know but he has no idea that he got me in the company well that's Richard Jeni said that once that would that's the purpose that really bad comedian served they inspire people to try it Butler it's something real to that but I remember my first open mic night when when I went up you know I it was very funny but I got to see Teddy Bergeron Teddy Bergeron formed that night any fucking lit that place on Jonathan Katz was the host Wow yeah Jonathan Katz was the host and I didn't think I you talked about that was kind of you know different from stock smooth yeah and so slow too easygoing yes and yet he was a fan favorite yes hilarious great comic yeah and then went on to do that cartoon dr. cat yeah which I did that yeah that was fun yeah but watching Teddy go onstage this was Teddy was in his prime it made me want to quit I was like oh Jesus Christ he had been not he had already been on like The Tonight Show and then I got gold diggers with Dean Martin and stuff so when he was you know when he was sober yeah on his game Wow oh my god yeah to this day he one of the best I've ever seen he was so smooth yes yeah I'm a polished where a lot of the other guys were roughing yes it was different and he had more pauses and he was slowly based well yeah he's almost stood I would just because of that but he kind of classy you know he looked like he could do no wrong so when he would have a problem with drugs and alcohol I was so confused I was like how that yeah I was like that guys the smooth as ever yeah cuz you know when I saw him he's like in his 30s he was he was young and just fuckin on top of it right I got it I got a chance to work with him a bunch of times yeah weird gigs like the Mattapoisett in and but do you remember all these names I don't know it's my curse there's a bunch of strange names for places well we got all the play set down the Cape and the one that is yes yes those were great though I mean boy you talk about seasoning you would get a lifetime's worth of seasoning on the road just traveling all these different places and seeing all these different weird bar crowds and standing on a fucking milk crate doing stand-up into a shitty microphone all those gigs and yeah and once I get into it full time you know that encompassed that was your whole life did you and you were working like six nights maybe seven nights a week and probably five or six different venues yeah sometimes three or four venues in the same evening yeah and he get in the car I go over here and go over there go over there I mean I don't know how many years it was before I realize you could date someone that was not a waitress yeah that was a weird ecosystem right comics of waitresses hand in hand yeah you know we're just so fortunate that we're from that we started our comedy in Boston because it was it was a magic time and when I would talk to people that are from like Arizona like how'd you start out like well I had to drive two hours to songs like fuck yeah there was nothing I was told that when I moved out here for a brief period of time I looked into DC I was told that I would be driving sometimes two hours to make $100 I cook yeah right right and four months later I'm driving me two and a half hours to make $75 I'm going wow that was somebody knew already what was going on here yeah when when I thought it was coming out and signed with an agency spotlight was an image oh I remember everybody what suppose these folks does able to ripped everybody else first II they promised everything and never delivered on the word and so I was one of the few that owed them money because I heard something was going south so one day when they finally called me in the butt to get noise and well and I sent them a note back saying dear so-and-so I know that I owe you three different though just take it off with you one o'clock and who'll be all set you know they hold him like 80 grand or hundred if they owed him a lot more than me more than a yeah but I said just take it out from that never heard from again and they I think they beat Milano for me no yes they beat Seinfeld they beat everybody felt yeah they beat everybody yeah there was one agent that was a dirty agent that was pocketing all the money yeah there was a bunch of those situations like that though right Bob that uh Williams we're still in the business no yeah I out of breath yeah real Oh Branson that's right Lennie told me about this that's right yeah fucking Jesus hope he changes his name or whatever change the entry buddy he's in Branson's apparently she's doing quite well and everybody back no no no how does that it's clean CL Mike if somebody owed me a million dollars yeah but they just they have this thing you know do you like money you only want to say with this we'll give you a few make this sickness and it was contractually written how old we back then oh I didn't start comedy two hours 33 Wow I was much later I had been a teacher and a coach and and I had two kids and so I get into this much later than most people what brought you into it I think because I was usually reasonably funny in life and then as a bad sign there was a wiseguy bartender you know and like for instance people would sit I donated 22 seats four guys would sit and said what's your cheapest beer I say root beer get the fuck up screw those seats I said if you tip me $20 before you order then you can sit there and that people were doing then so that kind of that kind of mushroomed that way there but yeah we love it ever again the same aggressive bullshit thing so that was easy to carry that on into the origin of stage but I had never gone on a stage I thought it was kind of like you would work yeah phoebus take people doing stage stuff you know yeah I like how you danced around the words I think I made a word up people okay yes yeah it was effeminate well yes it was not for manly men yeah no no it's a basketball in college and I was waiting either he had picked up to go to the D llama whatever and there was a play going on in you know rehearsals at this College and I'm watching them going and it really pissed me off that two of the actors didn't really didn't seem to be put in there like I fit into it and I don't know why but I'm going I could do better than that so that was one of the things in the back of my head I bought being there but I had never been I didn't ever had a mic in my hand and I used to wear loose pants because I thought they could see my leg shaking and that's why you know my AK I sit on the stool most of time so I so that way they wouldn't see me you know in effect being you know for the first year or so being says you shook that much I think so yeah that in the truck and but the same thing with taking the mic out of the mic stand I thought the rap wing in it there's nothing worse than seeing it come Indian update you and you know this thing bang bang with them was it drugs there from the beginning um let me think yeah pretty much yeah yeah pretty much me it's like in the old it's like in the old days you know this you know the story about your mother says don't you know if somebody got a few drugs don't take him I said well they don't offer you you have to buy them but initially you didn't have to buy them that was the thing everybody everybody was doing it you know it's life smoking when I was growing it for your kid 95% of people smoked and why because other barely ever smoked you know I stopped smoking yeah mm Mike Clark and I had a bet and none of us we were having at a cigarette since so apparently it wasn't addictive but everybody smoked so the same thing in those days everybody was either a drinker Oh doing that doing the blow or smoke on the bone the same yeah you had at least two or three vices Laura a lot of dead get cheers to throw off you know did you have any of those vices before you got into stand-up uh no I think it grew it's pretty much blossomed once I get in it now they think of it yeah I used to smoke there was a brother but nothing no nothing else drinking not heavily at all honey not every and I covered up firm I made up a lot of ground I can - I mean now all the guys are ready I'm like the only one left drinking and I notice it's much more liquor everywhere I go this oh we look up now yeah everybody cleaned up yeah yeah they're looking at you look dear the last Mohican yeah it's like Bobby nickman a comedian and the writer and he said that he first got into a because he needed the stage time you know take it up and talk in front of right crowd but he was one of the first guys that kind of cleaned up and then this guy and then this guy and this very few now well a lot of guys came from AAA and that's how they got their start you remember Dave Fitzgerald well sure funny guy yeah he got in the comedy from alcohol come on yes cuz he would go up in stage and tell these crazy old drinking stories and people would laugh and then he polished those stories up sure made him tighter and then started doing stand-up yeah but it it when you in the will say in the mid 80s the early eighties if if you weren't a drinker you were the exception in the rule again Wow so you weren't a drink it before not really you just started hanging out with these guys and wasn't that blaming anything no no hey look I'm not even but was it right away like just each of what you walked into this lion's den of people doing drew was the fucking whose patient zero like who because it was wasn't that many of you right well I think that I think that it it came to a culmination at the dig hole because we basically ran and owned the place and we'd stay there until I came over walking on there many times going oh beautiful not even laid out yet dirty in the morning right but we were serving drinks and and half the people they'd be ten twelve comedian sitting around and and four or five other guys and the other guys are cooks they're in there drinking with us too so we weren't gonna get Buster anything I mean we Kenny rising first got there he walked in the door there he got there I don't know how but he got there around 2:00 in the morning and there's six or seven of us you know smoking joints doing doing some wine drinking and more up on the stage playing cards you know for money any good because what is this place hey good someone who was the tequila drinkers and your biggest nobody you are so excelent he's getting the other stuff so and he he made up for lost time too that was what we do we'd always heard about the ding ho like it was like some legendary place you know when we've starting out it closing like 84 or something maybe yeah right around this time later I started in 88 and we had heard about the ding homes like it was spoken in hushed tones yeah it was like you know that's where it started well closed in a heartbeat because the the owner lost lost the club and playing Chinese Domino's no that's two hundred forty thousand dollars in one night mmm and it was my night then I had my show there on Fridays might come in and I never saw chains of padlocks bigger than that and the front and back door never to be reopened as a comedy club it became a Indian restaurant does up there but it just went in Chinese Donny what Chinese denials are that's good probably God I mean it's it's crazy how something like that can happen where there is just this one place and one core group of people and then the comedy club scene branches out from that like Houston used to have this place called the laugh stop did you ever yeah that was the same thing for Houston Houston had a great used to miss a little crazy yeah it was wild yeah yeah and when I first went there it was when it was at its wildest it was after Kinnison had gone yeah Bill Hicks had left and all those guys were gone and yeah Calibos yeah yeah yeah Jimmy pineapple Jimmy worked with me the first time I ever did a week in there and the first time I was ever there I was like wow this place is like a lot like Boston like early like seed a bunch of wild fucks they had an open they had a show going on in the main room and then in the bar area they had another stage and the open mic night started 8 went until 2 o'clock in the morning so you get done with your show the show be over at 10:00 and you go out to the bar and you'd be fucking hanging out there for another four hours because the show still going on yeah it was it was crazy because I had a good story they always we used to walk from the hotel through the venue and I'm and it was all that you know cowboy space to sit down there and so I get I'm walking I get hit in the back with the water balloon but you would have thought it was Shep with by a rhino gun you know bang the thing I was soaking wet when I get there I had to put them one of their t-shirts and I'm going I can't believe how how this guy hit me that could so Brian I get to the club I see the car it was recognizable I go they are they coming to see me so I went inside got a hammer and went out during the show in the open air and broke every window in their car including the directions the side thing and I Karma's understandable I still ever did it nobody took climb I said what what a great name yet and but I didn't mention it about their car that's hilarious did you go out watch oh yeah check their what they did I mean I thought I bought those little tiny you know directions on the side of the car I mean in every window if anybody can flatten it yes if you break every single window that's that's an accomplishment that is an accomplishment and that's a lot of work to get that place yeah what especially with no lookouts and I change a tire pretty good yeah yeah no look outside but that seemed the Houston scene was similar and that there was a lot of drugs involved a lot of really funny comics by an aggressive - yeah very aggressive yeah well taxes you know wild fuckers down there but when that club closed dock scene died out for a long time it's apparently it's got a resurgence now but scenes coming back there's some real good comics coming out of there right now but that scene was dead for a long time it wasn't wasn't much going on down there and like I was like that's interesting how a scene like a place is as good as Houston could close down with one club one club goes under and the whole thing just throws I believe that happen in Chicago Chicago used to be a terrific city was my favorite city to traveled it's a fall comedy they had an improv they had a catch they had the Laugh Factory they had you know not just a second city because that's different but and that was the same thing saying is is I think is there anyone that's still in existence there yeah and and that went off the cliff right away - and again I blame owners you know me and not paying people and things of that type well they start treating like any other business yes call me clubs became that my business it's a Cylon that needs to be run by the inmates yeah exactly and when we ran it when I booked that all the shells at the first yeah didn't seem to be any problem we and again we weren't making much money but if we didn't seem to care you know whatever you made you spent right so I feel if you had 800 bucks in your pocket Wow that's it I got any loss you know yeah not not thinking about you know I guess I might want to eat next week next week is next yeah that's the way the Comedy Store works is essentially that way I mean Mitzi obviously ran it but she let the comedian's run it for the most part right you know she let everybody work out their own issues and solve their own problems and she just booked you I just tell you what I go up and there was just a man house yeah and to this day it's still very simple to say no it's packed every fucking night now now it's crazy because the internet now people hear about it and they know about it and got people flying in from Australia in England and Ireland just to come and see comedy all the time all the time always meeting people there that are they basically have comedy tourism from Europe they fly in to the Comedy Store like any night of the week because the Comedy Store on Monday they'll post this the schedule for the week yeah and so people read the schedule and they go alright let's fly in on Tuesday so they'll fly from fucking England 11 hour flight and come and see see comedy well because there's no comedy club like there they have a comic store over there in London but it's not affiliated they just stole the name and they skirted into my international law by you know it's like they've made their own 7-eleven we're 7-eleven too like it's not the same thing I don't know what the comedy is like over there in terms of the comic store but you know they when they want to come here they fly and so on any given night you run into people that are from all over the world Wow yeah it's crazy you should come you know it's not you can't wait to see it you know years ago yeah way back but I haven't been around it's different now it's fucking madness yeah lines around the block I mean it's like in a lot of ways it's like Nick's in the heyday three rooms there's the original room the belly room in the main room all three of them are going at the same time multiple shows a night fucking madness well yeah it's it's it's nuts but without the coke there's no Coke no fights it's pretty time yeah it used to be a pretty pretty scary adenosine yes it used to be yeah it's it's much more common a lot of marijuana that's about it okay a lot of wheat sometimes mushrooms but that's about it yeah so nothing nothing too crazy yeah but it's funny that wasn't we were doing it even though we were doing program for let me it was seemed like it wasn't a business yeah like that say I'm promoting this album that I have and I had this album done before and it was great but I never had anybody produce it you know just made some copies of it and it's called Don John Gavin live with the Manhattan well I have with them in end and I always almost like a bootleg I sell them you know maybe you have a few after-show at the back of my trunk but finally we're releasing it that's one of the reasons about it when did you record it I recorded it in 2011 whoa ten years uh but my material hopefully doesn't get stale what's because I don't do a lot of kind of current advances and I don't know politics so it's still I mean I have some jokes that although some of the people that come to see me now did you like when you when you put that out is that the first thing that you've ever put out yeah that's the only thing and I and I owned it but I didn't do anything with it so now when I get to add virtual comedy network with Joe server Jimmy Serpico he uh we did another album compilation of guys in Boston and he saw somebody says above me my album II I know you know and he got a copy of the parts oh my god this is something like discovering something so he kind of came into my life for the tailbone see if we can produce this thing and now it's on Sirius XM now and Pandora and then it's going on all the streaming devices starting next week but right now it's a I think they have the what do you got the rights just for those so someone who wants to get it how they get it right now they can get in a Sirius XM up Endor and as of I think next Thursday it's on streaming live okay because if it's on a serious you have to wait for it to air right you can't just it's a serious doesn't stream right I got to be honest I'm I'm not good about any of this stuff I don't think so do they stream Jamie you price airship yeah downloadable stuff and whatnot okay so on the app is opposed to on the actual thing that you in your car okay yeah I am so anything mechanical well I'm proud that I think you sent me your first text ever which took me almost an hour and a half because I got okay as the T is an H over here you know that's how slow I wasn't doing that but you used to teach you know time no no I had girlfriends I went to a bunch of them because I got a great a lot of papers and so yeah no I never kept one that's legitimately the first text message you ever sent oh my god and you thought it was a joke Oh Mike Clark was telling me yeah it was my friend and then I sent that next one I realized you could use the microphone thing and it came out in some foreign land access yeah I know bones probably what the fuck is he saying that's probably it yeah eventually they'll get used to your voice apparently not no it's never gonna figure out your voice no that's for regular voices oh yeah - crazy I still have an accent oh yeah a little bit yeah but the thing about like all those guys from that day is very few guys put things out you know Barry put out a couple specials and Louie CK produced one of Barry's specials Lani of course had a few things he was on the Dangerfield special he did some stuff but a lot of like Donovan like how do you go find Donovan's best stuff you're like you got to go see him yes yes that's that's the craziest thing about Boston it's like these guys are world-class stand-ups were the best that I've ever done it and there's no recordings well you know special I think they were I was not unique in in the fact that I was not a businessman well yeah we're just we did it father not just for the love we enjoyed the money and that is spending money or love yeah but they've really never entered my mind like Jimmy was asking about you know today how did I release this thing I'd never I don't know any released it I just made the thousand copies a night so a few after-show and never did anything with you know you never thought once no I'm an idiot but you must have seen all these HBO specials and all these different things yeah yeah yes we never like I should do one of those yeah maybe yeah maybe I'll get discovered IPA give 106 so now that you've done this and now that you're releasing this do you think you'll put out more oh I planted this hoping hope they hoping this is gonna make a difference no because for years I was called the best kept secret in Boston and in comedy and I'm going you know what I'm kind of tired of that term I'd rather not have a secret anymore I like to maybe maybe get out well you can still get out there I plan on a percent nice plan does the whole thing about the Internet is just content just keep keep putting content out you what you have your hilarious comic so I'm sure your album is awesome people get a hold of it and then let go hey where's the next one right put out another one next thing you know you could tour nationally yeah I really firmly believe that I hope you're right no I guarantee I'm right it's it's just a crazy thing about that scene is that no one did that everybody stayed in both cuz the money was so good there's so much work and he didn't have to yeah you're basically didn't have to go to him because you had worked there yeah so it in a way it spurred you burn away it spoiled you rotten you know the other right you never really attempted to make it you know some guys did get their gumption to go up to ya know to New York and some came out to LA but as a rule a lot of us just stayin in Boston how long did you stay out here when you came out here oh just over nine months people said what you like about I said the weather and that was about hot that was my only answer what was it like going back to feel like home like I felt like I really hadn't left you know I just moved to Florida a couple weeks ago so there's it that's the first time I've ever what are you doing in Florida getting warm it's good time to move the floor middle of January yeah well it's gonna be yeah I hopefully once I get things unpacked I'll enjoy it there but the you know there's a lot of clubs down there and there's a lot of corporate stuff and then I do a lot of the golf things and that can stuff and make I do a lot of cruise ships and their most don't go out of this so it's about time I moved in and the weather primary it's the permit the weather yeah it's a big difference but I would think that after all these years you're gonna miss headlining the Boston clubs I will I will yeah but I've been working less and less in the Boston or because of I do a whole lot of these cruise ships things you know and the cruise ships that industry has become bigger and bigger and bigger I mean I just got off the ship the Royal Caribbean 6100 passengers on it whoa yeah that's a big boat yeah I live in accounting a Hampton I remember that near Marblehead yeah 3,000 people live in the whole town let's double that on the on this ship that's insane yeah yeah do you like doing those cruise ships I enjoy it a lot of a lot of downtime you can read write and like you said maybe a second home yeah I've got material so we'll see if we get that first one roaring how do you write you just sit down do you just sit down with an idea or do you have an idea ahead of time you jot them down like a little notes now to flesh it out like this just great to go whatever you know that type of thing well I'd like it simple this is not a whole joke but just the other day I'm thinking I both stone is you know why can't we why can't we just all get a bomb so I thought that was that's that good I didn't say it was good you're right stuff you throw it away throw it away it's only these ideas pop in your head and you write them down and then do you flush them out on stage do you flush them out on paper on stage you know but you read you know that if some new thing you don't have to know poor figure where am I gonna incorporate you're not gonna put it first you know how to close with it right you got to weave it in somehow sometimes I'll open what the thing really yeah because I want to dig a hole once really yeah because I sometimes I feel like I know I got some good jokes that I could do after this let me just say you've got the notoriety and fame so you feel that that is a strike against you the thief they're gonna be acceptable to everything that way you're it's a strike against you if you eat shit you're not sure yeah well I've I gotta know there's something there yeah all right do that but I like to do that sometimes because maybe four out of four out of ten times a punch line will fucking pop in my head out of nowhere and it'll be good like I one of my best bets from my last special about Harvey Weinstein came the day he got arrested the day old shit went down I went on stage that day and I had had a couple drinks in me I was feeling good and I just went on this rant about it and it's not something he had already written out no no I had a couple sort of ideas about where I was gonna take it and the basically the gist of it was that if you like all of you if Harvey Weinstein did this to my daughter I'd want to fuck him up like all of you I go but if Harvey Weinstein was a woman if Harvey know Weinstein came to my son with a solid contract I'd be like dude you're gonna be Batman this is the this is the gist of the bit and I'm telling you that dude you're gonna be Batman came out Wow just came out on stage and the day he was arrested everybody's going fucking crazy and then I was saying like nobody nobody gives a fuck it was an ugly old lady that was fucking handsome young men nobody would be mad right nobody we met and it just became this giant chunk of it I'm like I'm mad that guy he's disgusting fuck him lock him up forever but if Harvey know Weinstein and then I saw this in the audience believe that you just didn't know I did they know they came up with well they knew that it couldn't be old because the thing just happened yeah but sometimes like four out of ten times that'll work right and then the other six out of ten times you well so much for that yeah but it's like the only way new jokes get made his chances get taken and the biggest chances to go up first with it well I'll just open with it I'm gonna have to attempt that I don't do it all the time but I feel like the first couple of lines anywhere more like just saying hi and getting to know everybody and every now and then you throw one out there and it sticks and go oh I got something there I record all my sets I'll listen Sadie yeah would you have trouble remembering aid well if you get a particular thing yeah because especially if you have a couple drinks in you and you just riff in you don't remember exactly what you said cuz you're in the moment you can't go oh I gotta remember that because then you'll break the spell my son Chris does that to me all the time saying dad is that something no ago no I just said it again well he gotta write this shit down well Donovan is the guy who convinced me to record all my sets yeah god Donovan told me get a tape recorder he had all this fuckin this brick that he would bring onstage with him I never know he goes you'll have a line just one line and that line will make your bit ten times better and if you fucking forget it you it's gone forever it's like what you have won money when you're in bed and you think of something if you don't get up and write it down or if you don't just record it that next morning you try to remember that good luck yeah when I'm with my family I well if I get an idea in my head I just say to my wife got an idea I just run away I run away I'll run like a block away and just start talking into my phone because if I don't it'll go away yeah because I've had so many times like oh that's a good idea and then my dog is like Jack stop touching me and they fight with each other my wife of it what are we doing and I'm like a whole idea stops up so now when I get this idea I just got good idea just go and then I come back I got a good idea this is a good idea this is solid okay I'm back I like that I'll put my phone in my pocket because having a phone is the best because you got a notebook you got a fucking recording device it's all that I used to keep a real notebook yeah it takes too long to write shit down you lose it sometimes but you if you were say it into the voice notes you actually say the idea then you can keep it you have to that means you have to carry a phone with you yes you don't carry phone I'm an idiot again I don't carry phone at all I do now but now that I'm trying to be aware of what's going on I mean up until 82 years ago I had a real deluxe flip phone you know there's something to be said for those two though yeah the flip phones are nice yeah you can certainly avoid people yes next one yeah avoid taxman ari Ari Shaffir he has a flip phone he isn't actually doesn't now he actually went back to an iPhone but he put a timer on it so you'd always use his phone for an hour well yeah because otherwise he starts playing with his phone and go on the internet yeah going to social media apps you don't have any social media do you ah we will soon that's it that's the deal 2020 yeah it moves up a kind of a slow mover like a turtle racer to buy me are you gonna do it all yourself are you gonna post tweets and all that shit yourself oh yeah I don't know about that I just found about an Instagram today I thought there was a pill that you took but so the I'm on Instagram now as of like yesterday Oh what is it just dog Gavin ah comedian done Gavin how many pictures you got up there Oh at least for now is there a regular dawn Gavin other than comedian Don Gavin mean to reach me no a different person that has the regular dawn Gavin yes a different guy well somebody yes somebody to and get the old days people by your names and again and Ike wanted the guy he wanted $7,500 for my name really and I'm going my name's not work that so so I might have it paid himself oh yeah so is that how that works yet if someone yeah yeah I had to pay for mine yeah bought mine somebody had mine but you make money yeah it's the whole thing about the Instagram is like everything else on the internet it's just continual contact we keep putting out content I'll keep putting things out that's the whole thing it's just you got to just be consistent and it'll build I hope wasn't coming off this podcast I guarantee it'll help I know you want Fitzsimmons show earlier today right right and I get a couple with a Mac meirin's another one okay right and Billy Billy Berg oh nice beautiful you did the trifecta and trifecta plus one um there it is look at you that uh Don Gavin comedy that's what it is folks godfather of Boston commie don't tell us the dick Doherty he'll get mad at you hi kid it did try to keep that title back and I said me I actually help people he's tell me one time are you actually a Godfather when someone came to you and said can you give me advice can you help me right can you help me work out this material I spent time doing that I said you never did in your life don't ever start call yourself the Godfather again and he hasn't whoa he stopped calling himself that yeah well yeah to you I don't think he called up there anyway really yeah yeah not anymore but that was always his thing hmm well this thing is gone he he gave me a lot of gigs I have nothing but love for that guy well start now yeah he gave me a lot of gigs I read many times well he had a lot of little clothes yeah but like you settle a clothes but yeah the huts karley huts yeah aku aku yeah at one time was when he was his musician yeah way back to predict already the majority yeah he was like the highest-paid entertainer on Cape Cod that's Crystal Palace he had and I mean he was big yeah and then things went south and now he's big but physically he's still alive everything's good yeah he's a big fat yeah 36 inch sleeve but I can't get it out there I did all of his gigs I did all those comedy Hut's yeah the dick Doherty Comedy had digged already comedy vault members of yes yeah there was another one the vault was right down the street from Warrenton Street not far at all right across state there yeah yeah he had a ton of rooms yes he did and and he uh yeah that's true I mean he would he did work a lot more comedians than the killer otherwise didn't have that many avenues yeah well he would headline you early to like where I'm really probably shouldn't have been headlining really didn't really have a solid 45 was repatched up but uh Fitzsimmons and I started out together we were like a week apart we started a week apart from each other open mic nights yeah he mentioned that yeah we did and you didn't know each other previous no no no we met each other like at open mic night that's funny yeah both the same age it was it was fun times but we both have the same feeling like we were talked about you guys you know like you and all the guys that are from that era it's just like it was a we were very very fortunate to be able to because there was no hacks like hacks were not tolerated and Alliston no yeah but and even the audience I always at the Youngs were great but they weren't patient either no you hadn't you ain't produced and produced quickly they had high standards - yeah because you guys were so good like the standards of comedy the level of comedy was very high in the town and I remember I had a friend of mine who came to visit me from New York and he was shocked he was like there's so many good comics here that nobody knows and I was like dude they know him in town they know my boss these guys are selling out every fucking night and he's like this is crazy and I was like yeah these are like the best comics in the world and people don't know who they are it's funny Colin Quinn was one of yeah he came into Boston and they can't with the people but when they introduced him he's from New York I mean he was getting boob before we say the world and then he's gone oh my gosh you know and the crowds did eventually like him yeah but when he first worked there was a sound booth to the side of Nicks and he hid it got offstage and hidden the sound booth until the show was over because he didn't want to have to walk through the crowd he was in there for over two hours that's hilarious well the first time I saw Dahmer era was at the Knicks comedy stop and he went through the gauntlet and survived Oh a that the people loved them he thought they loved him what he's lovable yeah well he's a great guy but he was the only like national headliner that I ever saw that went through there and made it through yeah yeah and and and with flying colors yeah so he killed yeah and even at the end of it he was you know like he said he goes ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming tonight I was amazing you guys are pretty good and like he just is a sarcastic silly way of doing comedy he was the best fits in me anyway oh yeah but he'd fit in Boston like a glove I mean that's where for so he's a Philly guy yeah and I came kind of thing he was a pretty good jock good was a basketball player yeah yeah so I saw you it's like kind of the same type of mentality is some of them some of the pin he's still fucking great he's still fucking great he still kills the Comedy Store all the time yeah he's and he's always on the road to go he's fantastic he's he's a real comic you know there's a few of those guys it doesn't matter where you put them you can put a show on the moon and yeah I think I like rocking the pool yeah that just just hey how you doing yeah yeah yeah it's I mean when you think back on your life could you imagine yourself ever I mean I know you were a teacher at one point time but do you imagine never having found comedy ah I'm very grateful that he did find it I think if I was teaching it in a different venue where I was taking more advanced kids I was in a location or school where they didn't want to do you know one week they'd be in show up the next week they'd be with me and they didn't want to be with me you know I'm coaching was different I caused bass one track and that was terrific and I spent most of my energy in that but so I think if I was in the right surroundings as a teacher I would have stayed in teaching you know and probably have a lot less of the evil thanks to my body and but maybe I wouldn't have found common well you've held up well you intellectually you're still there I mean I haven't seen you do stand-up in a long time but I know everybody says you're still fucking killing it smell it still working yeah and you're the one guy that's still drinking that I'm aware of yeah but I don't really look around that much nobody else did you ever think about quitting no not really no when I was in the hospital I had a hairy reparation but then Rogerson smuggled some booze into the hospital Sarah yeah he put a fight he brought in the thing of vodka and a claw and a magnet so he's kind of he's gonna pull up the the staples that I have you know the steel stay put in when you get stitched up he thought that was funny when he went in stole a big magnet funny but he didn't bring booze in those both how long me in the hospital for so you're almost quit for four or five days oh yeah almost yeah do you never like what you see all these guys going in the a and cleaning up you never went huh maybe uh maybe that's for me no no never never get I mean said we stopped the blow and all that stuff right yeah but nine I mean never was much of a smoke smoke work the grass but the drinking you know that's pretty consistent with that you find something you like sticking with it when did you stop the blow oh yeah yeah but I've done mmm eighties night you don't see any people doing that I don't know I don't even know is they've still have seen it where people do not comedy no no not a comedy scene with blow not that I know and remember like we took the common stuff you know you could oh no don't sense it dip and you know because a big summer headlines yeah wherever you went you know well they would offer to pay you in yeah and you can get the giggles in Tampa Florida they honestly said do you want all your money and blow or do you want some cash I go I want it all in cash and then if I wanted to get Paul I could do that I mean you can't go into a grocery store and say you know I got these three items is this lime berry enough doesn't work is that play still around that giggles I don't know I don't Mike that's where you guys the name you know my cloud spy yeah the dealers in Saugus but Deb I don't know but that was another one all those real successful clubs at one time as you know there were great clubs you know a lot of places and sadly most of them are going down yeah I mentioned the Comedy Works in Denver it's a still one it's still great oh it's still great that was such a successful and still is but yeah I always thought that was one of the best running clubs in the well Wendy the lady who runs it she's fucking awesome she's been around from way back I go to see her every time I'm in town and sometimes I still even worked that Club really yeah I worked that Club - I'll alternate between the big theaters and I'll go back to her Club a lot of place was electric yes and she's got another one rebuilt another one I mean yeah she's got a second one yeah there's you know the Z knees in Nashville still really good right there's a bunch of real good clubs still on the road well maybe I'll rediscover these let's not go floating too much maybe I'll come back yeah you'd enjoy it now if you did do that would you take some on the road with you like how do you do it when you do the ships this is just you yeah bring somebody with you just mean yeah how much time do you do ah varies you know usually you do like a headlining spot you do like a 50 55 you know and dude two of those butts like you can do the same girl you know that type of thing so you say you only need you need like an hour and a half stuff total right I guess is what it was but it is kind of a lazy two-man job you can do the same sets you know that's right I just found an interesting talking you about incorporating something new at the beginning that's that's gonna be challenging I'm gonna try that it's not the best idea I think is probably to sandwich him between established jokes so you have a joke that you know is gonna work you get their confidence and then you slip in a new one yeah and then but every now and then I like to open with a new home just to see what the fuck is up I like it just a fucking test it take that little cult and see how it can run on those legs giddy up yeah you know yeah no Fiat yellow I think I got some fear believe me but sometimes that fear is what makes the punchline comes out yeah you know the punch lines that come out and no you know how it is like sometimes you ad-lib and it'll just come out of nowhere like where is that what is that coming from when you have an idea and it just pop your head and makes its way on the stand and then it gets a big laugh and then you know it's the right thing to say right there right you know it and just out of nowhere no in your thing you travel everywhere is there one particular area that yeah doesn't seem to I clicked as much Connecticut Connecticut can eat just

so much Boston comedy right yeah I don't yeah you don't I was gonna say that like Sweeney has a hole yes yes like Sweeney in Boston is a goddamn murderer sure but some of that stuff he can't do in other places he has to kind of rearrange his act yes yeah yeah mine is much it's always been more Universal yeah more observational than yeah and I don't really have many Boston performer say Boston jokes yeah other than something about the accent but that's it that's about it but now I can ask you one into the other where's the other end where's-where's like a favorite yeah I love Texas thanks it's probably my favorite place to go yeah I love Austin I love Dallas I love Houston I love going there really yeah they're wild fucking people I mean they're the remnants of the Wild West right that's what it's like I mean they're the wagon trains have made it all the way to California and a bunch of people made it detects it and they went we're good okay it's gonna stop right here and there's just wild is this a different kind of piece of real friendly will real nice folks there's one of my favorite places to go cool I love it now what about the fallen country thing anyway you mentioning I love England I've been england a bunch of times doing stand-up that's great they're fun they like to drink whoo yeah I did it I did it too earlier they did like me especially the drinking part other route I mean I'm not a violent anybody doing the short I said I wanted some ice and the guy said oh and everybody drinking just shots in and beer and I'm drinking liquor and I said I wanted some ice and the guy goes well the ice machine is broken I said well when I was a bartender I went back I said well our tent if you hit it some ice will follow to you or broke over a year ago just not interested in ice yeah if you buy a soda over there sometimes so you get a glass of soda it comes with no ice like what is this where's the and then when I did Australia Australia was fun that's kind of a rowdy place - oh I love it over there they get in and they get it they're just willing to when it's just show stuff out to you yeah not necessarily but just certain tax things what do you mean by that [Laughter] they like to drink there too yeah I need a whole set over there about Halloween any but absolutely nowhere and I kind of rewrote next night nowhere and I'm saying why is this thing not working and it's like guy said to me what is this Halloween that they didn't those days didn't celebrate Halloween there Wow he said you send your kids to strangers houses to beg for candy why not for food why wouldn't I go get food or money I got Halloween he didn't know what it was that now they have Halloween but hasn't like 20 years ago they didn't have Halloween Halloween is only 20 years old in Australia yes yeah that's hilarious yeah but you would think there would be a universal thing but it was not they have a lot of comedy over there now yeah I mean they they have really funny comics now especially Melbourne they have yeah I loved number that was great that was the comics lounge I performed with Tony Hinchcliffe there was their back lot comics from LA fly over there and do that place yeah you mentioned it Richie generally I work with him over there at the Hilton which was right across from in the Tennis Center where they play the big dad Australian in Australia yeah Richard Jeni was one of my favorites goddamn he was good terrific he was so good he's like probably in my opinion one of the most underrated guys ever yeah yeah in other words to this day like people forget how goddamn good he was and he's prolific - OH so prolific yeah you know you remember East Side comedy club in Long Island yes yes he worked at Eastside Connolly Club in Long Island I remember it was me and a couple of the other guys that were were there were were stunned because the host said I go hey how was Jenny's weekend he goes not only did he murder Melissa it not only did Jenny murder every show but he did four different hours well he did a different hour two shows two different hours Friday two different hours on Saturday he was he did four different hours he was he didn't repeat a joke and he goes and he was on top of his fucking game on fire and we're in like that was like a II I guess was 91 92 yeah he was if he wasn't the best in the world he was right right he was so honest about that I said yeah yo you're something bout your life he says two things in my life comedy and porn and he spent a lot of time on both of it it's a quote well that's why I was so good he was obsessed yeah I mean he was an interesting cat it was a real bummer when he killed himself yeah he was for sure one of my favorites I got to see him live a bunch of times and what I got loved about that guy is he would take a subject like save the subject with cigarettes yeah he would beat that subject in the ground he would find every fucking angle he would cover every piece of every possible way you could talk about that bit kind of like when George Colin would take a bit that I would have you know an idea or a premise Wilson right I could get three enough minutes in it gives 15 minutes yeah and up gold yeah yeah but Jenny would be like punchline punchline punchline like goddamn he was good then we've seen a lot of great comics in our day yes we have and I feel more hopefully
