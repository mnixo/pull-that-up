boom and we're live what's up brother how are you man Joe Rogan I am so happy to be here I'm so happy to see you fuck you've gone through a journey oh man since the last time I see is - yesterday was one year from your heart transplant anniversary exactly one year and Joe if I told you it was easy I'd be lying but man it was so worth the journey ain't even funny what does it feel like right now like have another person's heart in your body what does that feel like well a lot of times it feels like I actually did die and this is just a dream you know man right now yep Wow this is I think this this would be my heaven you look great you're still jacked no no losing any weight oh yeah yeah yeah but I mean you still you're still jacked you still got muscles you know this is such a fall from where I was you know I really appreciate that though but that I you know I look at myself now and it's just you know fragmented what I used to be but you know I'm still here that's what's so important to me well the ridiculous thing you were doing you're making videos of your working out like getting ready and after your heart a heart operation just you have a heart transplant and you're running in a parking lot you trip and fall okay I'm like Jesus man slow down yeah yeah you just decided that you were just gonna start pushing from the beginning well actually my brain was ready but my body was did they warn you about doing that did they say it was okay told me that you know the game yes and walk and you know me I'm like that walks yeah I can run at least my mind should I could run right what does it feel like though like when you like what is the difference between the way your heart feels now it's night and day you know before I got the transplant it got really bad you know really bad flatline two more times you know before the actual transplant it was I couldn't go through one another flatline I mean that would have been it but the difference now I mean it feels I only see a flatline like your heart stops yes uh-huh whoa and what did they do to start it back up again okay after had this last heart attack they asked me to say mr. Fosse do you want us to put in a pacemaker and I mean I thought about it a lot because my brother my older brother Walt had a pacemaker installed before he passed away and his pacemaker was actually going off when he when he died so I'm like man I didn't really do any good for him so I was like going back and forth from and then you know this something the voice said yeah go and get it and so I told me I put it in and pacemaker saved me Wow so it went flat like so your heart gave up and then the what does the pacemaker do exactly it's like a defibrillator you know I think they have the paddles to give you electric shock you know that's that's what the pacemaker does just give you a little notes on the inside you know inside is connected directly to your heart why on that sucker flatlines it give you a jolt Wow yeah did you feel it no no I was I was dead oh you did you don't feel nothing so you'd blocked out - oh it's not a blackout or like you're those offering you're sleepy death is totally different totally different and you I knew that I was dead before I died before a flatline I was just being my wife and at home and I was talking her just like I'm talking to you and the next thing all the lights went out it was like one of those old-fashioned TVs I don't know if you're old enough to remember these black and white tegu yeah yeah that's exactly how it was just a tiny tiny pinprick of light and you know that that's it it's no you know you you absolutely know that this is it and it's not you know this is the irreversible and you know that it's this is death and not just you not just doze it off yeah you know did you have a near-death experience I everything the only thing you have to only thing I had time to say was I had time to call my wife's name but I mean when they say things rush you know everything is like this is it this is it you know not gonna be able to do this anymore not gonna get this is it this is it the final finalization of everything hits you like you know this is it you know this is the final thing this is your last moment on earth and you know it it's clear and I'm like what do you do be hard to do was say my wife's name that was it that was it so the pacemaker kicks in and then yeah and it was so that's a damn good description I mean it was like I thought I felt like that I had been asleep for hours it was the best most peaceful restful time of my entire life Wow and in just a short moment it felt like I had been asleep you know for a time so rested so well rested so in my wife told me it was just a short period of telling but it felt like I had been asleep for eight hours so this happened twice yes the second time was in the hospital oh yeah Wow so they tell you okay mr. Fletcher we have a heart for you yeah they call me like 240 in the morning I think so you have to get in there right now no no I had hours before I had to actually be at the hospital I said baby at the hospital thing like six or seven oh boy I was happy and sad when I got the call I was happy for myself because I didn't think I could go through another flatline but I was sad for the door and Don's family yeah I knew somebody had to pass away in order for me to get that heart so I felt real bad about that so they put it in you you wake up what does that feel like it felt like being born again a rebirth another try another go at life Wow yeah I get another start another chance at it I said ain't over Wow so from the moment this they have to open you up oh yeah they do that chest spreader thing and what is all that like well of course I you out yeah but when you wake up you look down you're covered with stitches right I mean it must be a giant scar right no it's they are so good now that you know I have a scar but consider didn't it's my second time being split open you know the first time in five when they put a metal valve him I flatlined during that operation three times on you know on the table during the the operation itself so I mean flatline you know five flatlines I think I'm at my limit man so I seen the scars they had to take the pace the pacemaker out they took the metal valve out of the well they took the old heart had two metal Favell and it took the heart out they put in a new heart and it's just and it's unbelievable it's before a shower would kill me if I took a shower I'd be done for the rest of the day a shower yeah I shall we kill me for the rest of the day and I had a seat in the shower you know hold it how would a shower kill you oh man it was that that amount of physical activity and you know how you know you people take taking a child for granted but that amount of physical activity would kill not be white oh just for Washington yes for the rest of the day man it was so you were hanging by well yeah definitely death well it was you know kill me you know and my wife was opening jars for me yeah Here I am former bench press world champion and I got my wife hey baby cuz you open this jelly jar for me Wow yeah it's humbling humbling very big big time how long did you have to stay in the hospital for um we went in the hospital not very long I mean we got out of we went straight to in intensive care they keep you there for like three days but I think I was probably released within two weeks total Wow yeah and then are you using a walker or you walking fine like well I would say I was walking fine but I was walking just walking slowly Oh big-time big-time slowly yeah I was crawling alone Wow and how long did it take to you for you to get to where you're at like now like now I'd have no idea that you had a heart transplant really well I appreciate that you know when I saw you me you look very happy oh I am happy you look like go ahead I'm extremely happy just to be alive when you come that close to dying I mean every day is just a blessing many people ask me are you doing CT I'm blessed man I'm so I got no complaint with gently plus oh yes no complaints whatsoever I think I would hug Joe I'm so happy because we you know that I was on we talked about me needing a transplant and I needed to transplant it now back I had it the first six months were rough yeah the first six months after it was like how soft the jelly jar opening a jelly jar just not being able to do you know normal things the first thing I tried to do was walk so they had me walk around I guess a city block and then a city block so when I first tried to walk around a city block I'd have to stop probably 12 13 times and take a seat and get up and try to walk and it was it was killing me and my wife would slow down she slowed down and walked with me and I flew it was such a struggle I'm like you know what I don't give a damn I longer take me I'm gonna make you go ahead I'm gonna make it keep keep going and what kind of activity are you out they will do now a year later I am lifting again but very lightly I'm able to do you know the machines and stuff women 10 I think I've been able to do that for the last two months so when you say lightly is this by doctor's orders oh yeah that that I can't do anything you know without them approving it first yeah I accept the run in the park about getting approved my mom was like okay you can do it my body was like leave me out this month yeah so what what holds you back in terms of like lifting weights like why do you have to go light and my strength is just nowhere near what it used to be the strength is still you know I can tell that you know I have a long way to go but you know just to be able to do anything so I get I kidding me I do it I do what I can that's why I tell people all the time if you can't you know do what you want to do at least get in and do what you can do yeah it's better than doing nothing yeah so now do they have you on medication to make sure that the heart doesn't get rejected by your body most definitely and people are out there who've had transplants I know that they're like oh man yeah I take about twenty one different medications and yeah 21 different Medicare and with the side effects of the stuff they used to be worse but now you know my feet are swollen pretty much every day something and make it kind of kick smart our varieties I have our fliers to kind of kicks in with tolls are stiff you know pretty much every day but when I compare the side effects to the what could possibly happen which is deaf the side effects ain't shit I'll take them now will you have to take this medication forever it gets less less and less when I go back this month back up to Palo Alto where they did the transplant they're gonna take off about four or five different medications so I'm a year out now they're glass and then further you get out the less medication they're thinking eventually we'll get down to two or three well you'll always have to take something oh yeah definitely and is this because your body doesn't understand why it has someone's heart in it um for a while that's that in the beginning that's why I'm taking 21 now it's because you know to keep the chances that rejection down why do I bother ejected understand yeah well it wasn't the one that she was born with right that's a foreign you know a foreign heart and I really want to talk to you about that heart what I know about it it's a woman's heart right yeah so you know you know I was gonna drop a bomb very good yeah woman it but I tell you that that threw me for a loop yeah and I was you know you know I'm always talking about how strong my faith is and you know I'm faith faith faith faith and a Superman of faith and I could have so much faith - nothing can faze me you know I went into the operation hey I'll see you guys on the other side of this because you know I got I know I'm gonna be oh I got so much faith that you know I'm gonna get through this so I'm gonna see you guys but when the doctor came in and told me that I had a woman's heart that sucked the shit out of my phone because I had to understudy you know I've looked at you know studied on this that the survival rate of male to female and it wasn't good the states I had read it wasn't good when they do female to me I'm sorry female to male the chance not kid and I was like everything I read said it's not a good thing comes in and says yep you got a woman's heart and she wasn't that much younger than you are well uh dad that you know sod man yeah testing my faith big time how did she die I have no idea I have no idea but the thing I have feelings and I haven't talked to the family I would love to I don't know anything about it but I have these feelings and I really would like to know if what I'm feeling is right you know I really want to meet the family and let them you know let them know that I'm out here doing everything I can to raise donor awareness and that their mother or their wife or her sister or the I didn't die in vain and then I'm doing my absolute best to carry on and let people know that you know she was a donor and that is so utterly important for people to donate did you give the gift of life what are these feelings are you having I have feelings that for some reason I can see that I feel like she was the oriental lady and I you know I don't know why but I really have feelings like that and I feel like I can see this woman telling her husband you know I see we get home from work and making plans with her kids for the weekend and I had no idea if this is right or not why I just had those feelings are they recurring yes and you do like do you remember it like a memory it it's like I get to look into her you know her existence or her life and I and you know I have no I I could be totally wrong she could be a Jamaican lady but I have no idea if I'm in the ballpark or not I just had this feeling I just have a feeling wow do you have any unusual cravings or anything like I don't think no I don't think I have anything that I do talk to her and I feel like that you know when when like when I was walking around and I'm trying to make it around their block I would often ask her for help to help me make it around the apply you know I talked to her a lot Wow come on Lady I need to he'll give a name for I just can't wait Wow wow that's crazy Superman thing captain has a lady's heart now when you say that the it's not the results aren't good for lady hearts in male bodies yeah what did you say that's a doctor yeah I'm a doctor so um it's so funny I don't even know if the doctor supposed because it was his one doctor he would come in am young guy and you come in every day how you doing mr. Fletcher and I obviously I'm blessed I don't care when I woke up from the transplant I consider every second after that a blessing it's borrowed time I mean I wasn't supposed to be here so I my answers always I'm blessed so you mean you are you know sir I'm blessed him but he said you know what you're gonna change that and I go no doc it's nothing you could say it's gonna make me change my answer I'm gonna always be blessed no matter what you say he said you think you're doing really good don't you yeah I think I'm alive yeah I think I'm doing good I walked around this hospital corridor I think I'm doing really good he said you're not you're doing about what you're supposed to be doing and you have a woman's heart and it's too small for you and she was almost your age it's too small yeah he told me that the heart was too small and his lady was I was fifty eight or nine and fifty nine cuz I'll be sixty on June 8th so he says too small and you're not you know you're not doing anything extraordinary just doing average and she's you're a colonel a man for the rest of the day I was fucked I was fucking my man I was you know God why did you do this to me why did you kill me a woman sir and I old woman attack why could you give me a tea well I mean why God I was questioning why did you do this to me did you ask him what you mean the doctor or God the doctor very nasty doctor but my doctor did come in and I didn't you know I'm sorry I did ask the doctor I asked her I said God why why can't be now I am dude I had tears in my eyes because this was you know I might fuck I got another her but I go last long right I'm gonna be out of here so it was you know it was fucking with me and the doctor um I asked her died of why I mean why and she looked me in the eye balls door and she said mr. Fetzer we didn't want you to die it's just that simple we didn't want you to die you know that was what was available that was what was available it was a healthy heart and I needed one bad you know well that heart grow to match your body it already has really it is the proper size that it's it did yes and the doctor that told me was too small is the one who told me that he had grown to the proper size Wow so why does it grow cuz it recognized it was in a bigger body Joe I you know that's on the physical if you look at it physically and probably you know what a rational mind that would probably it realized that it had to adapt to it largely but I'm gonna look credit to God because that's just me so cuz he came back too fast I mean it was like a week later and said it's already the size you should be a week later a week after later before I left the hospital he was telling me that it's already decided should be Jesus and I said see doc I told you I'm blessed man I thought doesn't make any sense I know what did he say did the doctor say it doesn't make any sense to your own that's a normal thing yeah III have no idea why I have no idea if it's a normal thing and not but you know I mean I'm getting crab Wow another miracle thank I just say that question guy and I my answer was what did I I got back was was simple he said if I gave you a 18 year old Olympic athletes heart CT and you recovered was doing well then people are gonna say that that's why they got an 18 year old Olympic gold medal his heart and you're able to recover him stuff because of this mm-hmm but if I take the old lady's heart that's too small and that not you're not supposed to be able to come back and do these things with this heart then they're gonna have to give me a little credit he said I have a habit of taking the least of the least and lowest of the low and making something out of it and I see you know let me share it wouldn't be that impressive right it would be a miracle if I eat no fools it's a wonderful heart but because I'm God I'm gonna take this heart and give it to you and you don't still do all those things so shut up CT that's okay that's good now when you're exercising now and you just are you pushing or you just get into a point where you just feel a little tired and you back off no so Rosie I can't help but push - I know that's what I'm asking like yeah you know I give I give her I give everything I got yeah I can't help any matter do you feel weird when your heart starts beating heavy or should I say her start her heart yeah her heart starts beating pretty fast and you know I don't feel weird I feel like it's something I've done my whole life and I'm just glad to be back able to do you know some of what I used to do is just I feel good you know I still talk to it oh come on baby I'm sure through this sadly and now you feel a building up like you feel like every month or so you get stronger definitely yeah definitely I feel that longer that it's in the lungs that the heart is anything more it feels like you know it's that's where it should be you know my body adapts and how long does a heart transplant usually survive in a person well I think they're the longest at this point it's close to 40 years 40 years Wow you don't know why not I wanna you know I never expected I said On June 8th I'll be 60 I never expected to make it to 40 so go really really yeah I never I never expected to me I expected to die young so I'm Way past where I thought I would make it anyway this is a book why'd you think you're gonna die young oh man I never had I wanted to be my always always my and I wanted to be the the skyrocket man she's brilliant like this shoot brilliant burst and then I thought that would be the perfect ending just go for it go for it go for it go for it and explode a dead motherfucker but he he was something else when he was alive happy with that's what you thought yeah Wow yeah now you gotta settle in to be alive right now and every day is a blessing yeah yeah so why isn't 40 years a blessing it would be a blessing but I mean you know I would be I don't want to be around where um I don't want be a burden on anybody and I think 100 man you know somebody else got to take care of you wipe your ass yeah you gotta wear diapers and shit I don't know if I wouldn't want to be around to be a burden on somebody yeah yeah yeah I know what you mean but right now you're not a burden I hope Matt no I think my wife might disagree oh but you're moving around man I mean like I said if I didn't know I would have no idea well I appreciate and even though I know you must have lost some muscle you still if I just met you I believe this is a Jacke dude really yeah you still got the size your arms man there's still huge I don't think so prepared to what they used to be that's why I don't I don't think that's kind of stuff don't even matter that much to me anymore right I'm sure you have a new lease on life oh yeah big time what matters you know that the end really important things are cause my family I'm and spreading donor awareness is so important there's so many people died just waiting to get a heart you know them on the list they're 21 I think 21 people with date passed away just waiting trying to get in I was so fortunate so blessed to be able to get one that I want to try to make sure that other people get one too so whatever I can do to try to raise awareness what is the problem by people putting that they'll donate their organs oh yeah it's so simple it's you can do it online now only I was like the California you can't I don't know about other states but in California you can do it all online you know and through the DMV and get your diet on driver's license and I want to be a donor and I mean you can't take the stuff with you no way no people get paranoid - I've heard people say I'm worried about doing that because what if they don't resuscitate me because they need someone to get a heart or a liver or something like I really don't think that's what doctors weren't no no it's it's uh you know I had a i hunger you know when I first got my driver I was sixteen years old and actually didn't want to be a donor I'm like no oh I'm taking everything that guy gave me Whitney uh-uh no ain't don't make nothing but he know time brings about a change man get a little older with more wisdom and if I can got something somebody else can use definitely most definitely take it my mother and all nine of her brothers and sisters all passed away from heart yeah so it's just something that's in your family oh yeah as forgiving my older brother walk passed away just a couple years ago from congestive heart failure another complication so heart problems are run big time in the foot your friend that's a crazy one right that does run in families yeah it is crazy yeah but it's reality yeah so now um do you what kind of diet do they have you on a very clean and I guess I had my my kids crack up at us I'm a presbyterian but actually that's that's pescetarian a fish a fish you know vegetables and it's no bullshit yeah no bullshit no time for bullshit no time for Bulls it's exactly right niggas trying coffee time is precious no I used to but the caffeine and doctors don't like beer and caffeine yeah the magic yeah so rest must be very important for you too yeah yeah I think I get plenty of it yeah it is what other things that make sure that you do the diet has to be on point have to take my medication they don't want me to you know do too much strenuous activities they had limited me I wouldn't I was not able to travel out of the country until yesterday so yes so at one-year anniversary that's when they give you the green light yeah man I can go all over what did they say when they saw you run in the parking lot and fall down all my doctors and you know the offset CT what we think except one except one my cardiologist and he said you know what CT I'm not gonna lecture you like everybody else did you already know that they should have done that but man I am so proud of you they say you have inspired me to start working out again wow that was dr. Salam dr. Stromm if you listening thank you he was the only one who didn't condemn me how far out was that for the surgery when he fell down three months mine was like gold yeah well that's that mentality that you have you know I would imagine that's very hard to adjust yeah his big time I am from being neighborly it would be the same for you you're active guy kicking the shit out of bags of stuff old lightening foot over it and then you know and you think it is not being able to raise your leg yeah or throw a punch man I'll be walking around and Grocery something like man with my wife I'm like nobody fucks with ya how would you feel if some eye you thinking man so my fuckin you can't even punch so anything you can't do nothing you'd be helpless that's man that is hard too I swear little old ladies have - oh yeah super hard now just gonna get beat up got no defense that's a terrible thing that's a terrible thing but awfully humbling mmm yeah and you really realize you know just how and your whole life you live for strength you know I've been a strong name my whole life and then all of a sudden all of that is taken away and you just you know fucking invalidity and you're just week is it's very hard mentally to deal with but you passed that now yes now you're just in what what how would you categorize like how you feel right now I categorize my my emotional feelings as being probably better than ever really yes I see things in such a different light after coming that close to time the things that I thought were important just don't even matter like what I used to I give you one example you know people I used to tell Paul King you asked me about this last time I was on the show and I tell people and they say was about the steroids steroids and I'll see takers I tell them the same thing that I've been saying for fucking 25 years and magazine articles and stuff I tried them yes I tried them when I was young and then work for me I stopped taking many many years with nobody nobody like people don't believe they don't believe that and they'll tell me all your foolish shit CT you're lying and I realize out of that and so that used to bother the fuck out of me why I'd be arguing with people online it said fuck out take your goddamn test any time any 24 hours day you can test me I'm fucking I'll tell you what I'll give you 10,000 bucks if I fail your drug test all you got to do is get off fucking social media nobody ever took that bro but I don't give a fuck if people say I take steroids now who cares right I don't care just now it's a fucking compliment do you you don't still go back and forth and argue with people online oh no no not anymore you know I sure did oh shit I would die with jump on them in a minute I used to see you doing it oh shit oh man Joe because that was my mentality yeah attack attack bettan hit me I'm gonna hit you back buddy it's your heart that's best all the apps oh yeah well you know I do too all caps you talk to me but you're yelling you're yelling Susie but I can't have seat so I make it all cap so I can read what I'm right I said can you actually hear that can actually hear that these those work your fucking mouth it's you got spidey sense me one of the most humbling things about getting older is the vision going oh yeah I've known it like from when I was like 42 I started to notice it and by the time I was 46 it's like god damn and I think I need glasses yeah yeah cuz I would just try to like read the computer and I'd be doing this with my eyes like bulging my eyes and squinting and trying to look at it sideways and try to see what the fuck I was rates a weird thing it's like oh boy my ability to see the world is fading it happens yeah it was do the best things but it's a warning sign like hey man this is you know this is a finite existence yep Oh get some shit done right yeah now right now don't wait tell me waiting time is such a precious commodity billionaires you cannot buy one second no one second of life yeah can't do it no it's oppressive anything that you're thinking about doing you've been putting off my advice is to get the step and get the to an exit right now get after it don't put it off any longer get it done so do you feel like you're like Ct Fletcher 2.0 definitely a new dude a new dude with a new attitude yeah no money or again I tell the guys I used to argue it online hey I love you did you hate me all you want to I love ya I ain't got time for hate yeah racism a big guy got time under that it's all foolishness it's so much bullshit in just a waste of time it ain't even funny yeah I might look if the in the transplant experience enhanced my view I've always said we're all the same under the bar my mom taught me love everybody but look they took I have no idea the nationality or race of the donor it don't matter I hope you're right if you're right it's an Asian woman I think that would be fantastic and you could feel that that you would know that and you could feel it man we might be something be amazing I gotta find out how can you find out i I don't I have no idea I want that hopefully they're listening to the door open okay well why don't you give him some details like when what day did it happen and what like where did the they tell you where the donor came from no part of the country you know I I know that the heart was flown in mmm and I actually you know my wife baby how crazy is that it's something that took a heart out of someone's body and they put it on ice and ice and we actually she has video the ice just you know me going into the room and then dice just come following right afterwards yeah that's so crazy it is crazy it's I mean it's when I was a kid it would be like dr. Frankenstein yeah you know yeah they didn't start doing it to 68 I was born 59 so you know why they did heart transplants in 68 Wow yeah 1960 they've done a long time but when I like say when I was a kid would have been like dr. Frank's died he told me something like that was possible I was at all hell you're crazy you're just making you have the science fiction but it most it most certainly is possible do you think they're gonna be able to grow your own heart yeah they're working on that right now I mean growing your own heart with stem cells yeah and I you know it's gonna happen which is just crazy yeah it is going to happen I have no doubt yeah they've already grew a woman's bladder the woman had bladder cancer and they grew her a new bladder yeah replaced her bladder yep so the hearts coming yeah it's coming man yeah they're already working on I think they're 3d see if you can find Jamie they're 3d printing a human heart and they think that they're going to be able to get to a point where they have a working model of a human heart like wow yeah and and put your heart in your body of freshy which is just so crazy that yeah he's crazy and how about for people who are amputees and things along those lines so limbs with your own limb actually grow you a limb yeah here it is the first 3d printed heart made up of living human cells yeah yeah man let's thank God is people smarter than us oh yeah that that is a heart made by universities Tel Aviv University a heart the size of a rabbit marks the first time an entire heart has been 3d printed so that's a tiny one right now but complete with living cells blood vessels ventricles and chambers intact that is incredible mini heart can contract but it can't yet pump out blood so they're working on all those different variables I guess but man in that incredible look at that doing it with 3d printing machine like 3d printing machines freak me the fuck out like there that's the future they're gonna be able to make things yeah look at that look how that works if you folks who haven't seen this this is what the future it's on CNET comm you can google it and just watch the video of them actually creating this it is unbelievably fascinating so did you look at the heart before they put it in you did you get a chance to see it no no I know I was out yeah I was out by that time Wow nope then look at it and so you wake up you lights come back on yep and doctors area wife's there yep doctors there my wife's there and it was you know a new day and I was like I want I kind of wanted I kind of wanted to say and I told you so yeah that was a that's hilarious told you so it was a funny thing to say when you come back from a heart transplant I mean because you would be you would be surprised it how would be so funny though if you did say soldiers oh it was so many I got so many people and I it was overwhelming support but I got quite a few well too many for me messages at the ends and I hope you don't make and I hope you die and yeah I wish we did already know stuff like that do you feel um sorry for those people no oh yeah most definitely now yeah I do you know stead of being angry yeah yeah I choked the shit out of them but you know now I mean you gotta be what what is your in your existence must be pretty pitiful for you to you know feel that much hate for somebody that you don't even know never met I just can't stand so Rogan I hate him I've never met him I never said - yeah there's no happy people that are doing that no it's so transparent you gotta be pretty you know unbelievably miserable is miserable i'ma follow Joe Rogan says so I can talk shit about him I don't get I wish children was off the air but I'm following every word he says because I don't want to miss nothing the Joe Rogan has to say but I hate them yeah makes no sense meaning well it doesn't make sense but a lot of people don't make sense best people live their lives in just very counterproductive ways and they feel like as long as they've got something they're excited about that that's they're doing something even if it's excited about hating you for no reason I just I don't get it time is too precious to waste don't hate it's just foolish it's just there it's a foolish way to yeah need to activate they can take livers and hearts and different organs from any may Samaritan and switch them around we're interchangeable Joe we're interchangeable well we're all one thing yeah the only thing that separates us is the climate that we came from that's it that's it so it it makes racism so stupid tribalism is stupid it's probably the conservative versus liberal that's the southern versus northern that's due it's you know Asian versus black Pakistani stupid stupid if we are interchangeable do we means that we are that that they're right this that you know we are one yeah we wouldn't be interchangeable no it's this outer shit that's on top this epidermis the skin this stuff that you know defines this is also what makes us interesting it's what so foolish about it it's like what's fascinating to me is that human beings came from every single spot on the earth yeah at one time they originated in Africa and spread out all over the land and adapt it to individual environment when you meet someone from Island they're white like paper yeah that's just because there's no Sun exam their body developed it's like a solar panel for vitamin D they're like we got to figure out I get fucking vitamin D this black skinny cut yeah we don't need this melanin because we're not protecting herself from the Sun anymore so they turned white just this did the same exact thing Thanks they can take that guy from island guy from African and this guy needs a part and hey sweetie this gentleman here and Graham Hancock was on my podcast last week and he's a brilliant brilliant guy but he studies ancient civilizations and people and one of the things that they're studying now is the various civilizations that we didn't even know existed that existed in South America are like huge multi-million size of population civilizations in the Amazon like 20 million people living in the Amazon one point I'm and they think they were wiped out by Spanish explorers and European explorers that came over games smallpox like the way that wiped out 90% of the Native Americans they think the same thing happened down there in the Amazon it just they had huge cities down there that European settlers had reported on they were just wiped out but the point is that we were everywhere yeah it's all one thing it's all human it is human race and the funny thing about white people that are racist is that especially like I have Neanderthal DNA that's more primitive than Homo Sapien DNA and it's only in white people yeah like it's kind of funny that way you know because white white racists like they have to deal with the fact that only white people carry that in the and earth all shedding them yeah when do you think I don't think that they would find that a bad thing neanderthal yeah no I think they'd be here yes all right yeah well they weren't smart enough to stick around for whatever reason I don't even know why you know they don't know if we out bred them or we interbred with them or if we wiped them out we don't even know they're also finding new humans that there's a human they found in Russia called a Dennis I think it's called Denisovan as I said and they just found more bones of them in Tibet so they know that these Russian people that was totally distinct subspecies of human traveled and traveled to Tibet yeah and Neanderthals lived for half a million years so they were around way longer than Weaver we've only been around I think for a couple hundred thousand years right sapiens yeah so they were around longer than us like by a factor of like somewhere around 300 thousand years yeah all over the world man just what a crazy animal we are we just travel everywhere and find a spot and adapt and that's right we make it work yeah stay in a community so you could help each other and live off each other and adapt and unfortunately that's where all tribalism comes from to that we have this tight-knit group and everybody else fuck everybody else it's us versus them and that's inside of us you know wouldn't it wouldn't it be great and this was I don't think that it's wrong if you're a Italian guy I don't think it's wrong to be very proud of being Italian and if you're a Polish guy I don't think it's wrong to be very proud of being posed why can't I be proud or why can't you be proud of being whatever race you are you can be proud of that but does that mean that I have to hate another guy because he's not know the race that I am you could be proud of what you are and not hate another guy for being different than what you are how I would give dad a try well I think the feeling that you got from the second chance on life this beautiful feeling of appreciation and celebration of this existence that's what we need to try to foster in people you know when you try to like let people know this is this is a temporary thing man if you are lucky like we were talking about a hundred years if you're lucky you get 200 years I'm 51 I'm halfway there right if I'm lucky if everything works out perfect and it probably isn't let's be honest I beat the shit out of my body right so it's probably not gonna do you want to make it to be a hundred I'm I'm a science nerd I'm fascinated by all these 3d printed hearts and all this shit I won't see what the fuck they can do I really think and talking to guys like David Sinclair and all these anti-aging specialists I think they're on the verge of being able to reverse aging that they're treating aging like it's a disease like it's a disease at the cellular level instead of accepting it and that like well you get older hey you're gonna have to accept you can't do as much body's not gonna work as well why maybe that's not the case maybe if they can correct certain things about the human body maybe they can correct that I think it's very likely that in the future I don't think that's an insurmountable this situation I think they're gonna be able to correct what happens to your body when it ages the deterioration that's caused by the aging process your body produces less hormones your body starts to slow down Alzheimer's all these different things I think they're going to be able to correct those things Wow the problem with that is then what we gonna live forever you're gonna be happy living forever like what if when you die it's amazing what if when you die there really is a heaven you really do really do go to some spectacular dimension filled with love and peace and and happiness and there's no emotions like we think about here there's no fear there's not none of the things that hold people back none of the anxiety and the angst it's just consciousness and love and then you're wasting time you're just trying to stay alive taking pills to live to be a million boy you open up big ask and Warner's right well I will tell you Joe without a shadow of a doubt none whatsoever death is not the end you don't think so I know I know - how do you know because I've been dead right yes I've been dead what what about that experience cemented in your head when I was like I said it was the most peaceful and and I don't feel like there's the most peace most restful most I was I woke up laughing I was yeah yeah I was overjoyed you woke up laughs yeah I was overjoyed do you remember anything about what happened when you blacked out extra the the the time I was extremely peaceful extreme I didn't have a worried extreme and I was not sad at all you know I was overjoyed very happy very peaceful and it erased any fear that I might have had and any fear of dying is gone I don't feel good at all and so I maybe that's why I don't want to live to be a hundred because it let me I wouldn't my vision in that place again man it was so much peace so much and it wasn't like you know this is you know I'm just in the ground and I'm not a plant just dirt mmm you know I know that I'm in a very comfortable place and and you know I wouldn't mind there's a Teaneck and it's all different I hold no fear that so when I say that it's it's definitely not the end you're I believe that your soul you know so people have a different name for consciousness of whatever it's definitely eternal and it has how else could you have these feelings or emotions or you know have that that's sort of comforting the feeling of comfort and being in the right place if something didn't continue cuz my life my life was gone the essence of life my my bindings you know gone it was gone flatline dead with him I told my doctor that time he said no you actually it's called some kind of pause or some shit like that and I'm saying look if I if the pause lasted doc I wouldn't be talking so I got you covered up all over the world during that pause I was dead so it's it was a wonderful feeling job well I think with a guy like you that's so physical and you've been so physical your whole life the big fear is to not be able to take care of yourself or move like that's what we were talking about when you guys talked about being a hundred like having someone wipe your ass and take care of you like that's the big fear it's not death death is just peaceful it's the end but the big fear is the deterioration of the physical body to the point where it's just painful everything is painful you can't go anywhere you can't count on yourself yeah it's it's very peaceful but I definitely don't think it's the end I think it's the beginning yeah yeah and that's it's an overwhelming feeling like I had I was able to peek over to the other side and that it's definite assurance that it's not the ends and that there is something else on the other side I have that assurance it's able to peek it just peek into it well I think we all have this feeling that we are something other than our body most definitely I mean III have that feeling like I feel like there's like a little ball of energy in there that moves this thing around you're right that's what it feels like yeah that's what I always rejected their label atheist like people say are you religious I'm like I was when I was a little kid I had to go to Catholic school and I you know it did all that jazz but my parents when I grew up were hippies after that my mom split up for my dad my mom shacked up with my stepfather who's he's a hippie and there was no no church after that but I'm not an atheist I'm not I don't know like I don't believe anybody that says they know what life is or what life means or what happens when you die I want to hear your opinions I want to hear your thoughts but you don't know and anybody that says they know what happens when they die I know what happens when I die it'll be black and and cold and that is the end and just like there was nothing before there'll be nothing at the end and like you don't know that now you're just saying that there is no God how do you say that how do you say that well one day what if you stand in front of God or in in God's presence in some non-physical form and then you're weeping and in your arrogance and say stating that there's no higher power like it might be the the universe itself might be God I mean we don't know anything you we are strange little monkey people living on this fucking planet making things that alter our environment moving around driving fly-in talking to each other talking shit but at the end of the day you're only aware of what you've experienced right and when you don't know that's like when people have talked to several friends I've had near-death experiences a very good friend of mine she she was in a car accident and she had a very similar thing where she said it was so peaceful yeah she said you know they got I think they got rear-ended and like really banged up and when it felt like she was gonna die she felt so peaceful it's so true yeah I think a lot of people that have come that close to dying or a lot of them are gonna say the same thing that they have no fear of death and yeah it's it's erased and you but you also have the feeling that you know that this existence on earth your physical body dies it's definitely not the end the way she describes it is exactly the way you do it she's my manager and you know I talk to her all the time the way she describes things is essentially exactly how you did that it's just so peaceful I just felt just felt peaceful yeah but not you know like like people who don't believe that go yeah by the way anything I said I'm not religious either yeah I was raised super religious in a super religious home by a Pentecostal heaven and hell' brimstone fire and brimstone preacher yeah they do the tongues oh yes oh that's my favorite and speaking of times everything everything Wow everything was a sin awesome Oh dancing dancing listen to rock and roll music oh yeah oh yeah everything was a sin so I think that's really what drove me away from being a religious person yeah I'm definitely not I always say I'm a man of faith I have a tremendous amount of faith but faith and religion into different things a lot of people confuse them yeah they talk about them as being the same that they are definitely not religious man mates and you know a set of rules and men say okay we're going to be this and and if you want to be this religion then you're gonna have to go by these rules yeah and it's it's all man-made but faith is not me and me and so I'm a tremendous man of faith but not really yeah some would say that like you're a spiritual person that's like a thing that gets thrown around today like I'm not religious but I'm spiritual people say that a lot like what does that mean no one really knows it's a strange sort of definition but I feel what you're saying like that there's something more to this there's something more to this than just tissue and bone and blood moving on this rock that's traveling through the universe there's something more there's something there's something there's some and maybe it's just something more for us but the the beauty of friendship and love and family like those things are intense beautiful emotional experiences that I don't I don't know they seem to transcend just regular life itself they seem to have there's a higher power to them a higher beauty to them I think that's one of the things that we like when we see people doing something really great we love seeing people accomplish things because we love we like seeing people succeed we like seeing people like that have doubts and and and something almost insurmountable and incredibly difficult in front of them and then they they overcome and it gives us all hope and it gives us all like this inspiration that's feeling we're connected in some sort of very very strange way but I think you could just chalk it up oh that's just camaraderie we needed that because of evolution that's how we stayed alive like maybe maybe but maybe there's something else maybe that whatever this consciousness is that's totally not no one has ever defined consciousness and there's certain people to think that it occurs only in the brain and the neurons and the synapses and it might or that might just be an antenna I mean consciousness might very well be you are using your physical tissue to tune in to whatever this this thing that we share is this life force that we all seem to share and when when there's other things like looking in someone's eyes man like when when you know someone's like there for you and you know you're there for them like that camaraderie that intense camaraderie it's like that that expression the windows to the soul that the eyes are the windows to the soul it really does seem like it's right like you see people you see them you know like the avatar lady says I see you yeah and you can it's [Music] looking at being able to look into somebody's eyes you can tell a lot you tell if they're bullshit yes theater than that or if they feel weird about something yeah maybe this isn't a smart thing or maybe maybe maybe I should have done better by you or yeah yeah and I am i I took the first first time I had the open-heart surgery and flatlined three times during that surgery I also had an experience that also strengthens when I believe in there being something after the body dies i season or whatever you wanna call it okay I see us I was able to see my mother who had passed away the year before and you know I say I see my mother I last see her face I just heard a voice and I know it was her and she was you know pleading to I say God a lot of people may say you know what whatever they look up to and I ain't got no problem with that I don't think that because people don't believe exactly like I believe that they're doomed and they're going to hell although that was the way I was raised off you don't believe like this and all Catholics when I want to quote through my dad all Catholics were just lost mmm they're not gonna make it because they don't you know fuck bleed right yeah if this little course they're not gonna what about juice you don't believe like this Muslims fucked up just lost me Oh Scientologist phone oh yeah you're especially lost yeah that's how they felt that's how I was talking this way and I just you know I don't believe that you got you got this my dad was some people they found my dad thought that he could walk on water he could do no wrong and it's the same guy too you know so you know break my nose and send me to the fucking emergency room and my mom was a slave and that was perfectly fine with him and in also this was a guy who was fucking women in the church but you don't believe like I believe you're going to hell yeah people have a remarkable ability to be hypocrites yeah there's soup sauce and icing that so much from super religious people that it just turned me off yeah from being a religious person well I think a lot of what it is is controlled people want to control the people they want to be able to tell people what to do and want to do it and that gives them some power in their own life by doing so yeah yeah man I thought I just you know it destroyed my faith and just super you know people that are in church every Sunday every time we went to church three times a week three times three times we every Tuesday every private every Sunday in church in church during the the Watts Riots I'm little kid we went to church Wow yeah and with it the guy that soldiers National Guard on the streets they put my dad over I'm a little kid in the backseat what are you going I'm going to church and I might fuck these guys this tanks on the street this guy's got fuck em 660 and asked him and my dad's like we're going to church I'm like fuck I want to be at home looking at fucking HECO with cartoons we went to church man so he was super dedicated you know to you know part of him was super dedicated to what he believed and then you know you go over sisters Sally's house to give her a consultation and I'm looking in the room her bedroom door is open and there's my dad with his fucking t-shirt on sister Sally's in her slip and shit and I guess me and my brother were there to be is a scapegoat or you know he's excuse my mom you know if I take them and I you know nothing could be going on wrong remember that's it like fuck what kind of Castle tasting is either like I think right now we're experiencing some of the most insidious aspects of religion in the people attacking people while they're worshiping yeah attacking Christians and Christians attacking Muslims and it's like in synagogues and Christians attacking Jews I mean if the whole thing is so insane attacking people while they're worshiping it is insane it's the sign of how fucked up things are right now that this is something that's happening on a regular basis now in the name of religion I mean doesn't I mean what kind of religion would you know say this is okay I mean aren't we supposed to love my neighbor as myself I mean the the Christ Church one you could not you get it's hard to even say that that was about religion that's more about bigotry and racism Yeah right and then the response to that is what you're seeing in Sri Lanka and you know people blowing people up and in churches and synagogues and it's just it's insane it's it's just we've reached this very critical moment in our society and just civilization in general where people are attacking people for things that they believe in yeah which is just it's one of the most insane things to attack people on you're not attacking people because they're aggressive because they're coming towards you they're trying to take away your your resources or harm your family no no no they believe the wrong shit yeah which I'm not kill them yeah they don't be like I've killed hundreds of them yeah I'm gonna kill em since Saturday I mean it doesn't I don't know how to fix it we I thought the overriding principle of most every religion is love yeah we're supposed to be loved I thought all of them taught love isn't that the overriding principle of religion your religion doesn't it teach to love people if your religion teach you to hate people to go out and you people then something's fucked up yeah yeah that's supposed to be reinforcing this idea of of community all together working towards a goal it's wrong yeah it's uh I mean it's so mean there's so many issues right there's so many issues with with poverty with crime with all these different things in this world today but the the religion issue and the hatred hatred of other people's religions has got to be one of them one of the strangest aspects of our community our culture's it's so crazy my mana I just want to do everything that I possibly can possibly can do and I know I'm just a little guy from Compton nobody knows me no way who the fuck is safety fucker ain't nobody but whatever I can possibly do to try to bring people together man let it just come together I had it's the same we're all the same under the bar that's my equivalent of trying to you know right bring people in a weight lifter just says a similar thing all the same we're all brothers and sisters on the mats exactly that's exactly what it is yeah that's that's a thing that sometimes you know when someone has like this common struggle like like you find out a lot about someone when you lift with them right oh yeah when you know that they can do 10 and they got to start bitching out at 7:00 yeah like come on bro that's right mysteriously come on I mean that's that's similar in I mean marathon runners have that sort of camaraderie that feeling like if someone can can actually complete marathons and then ultra marathons alone do you have the girl doesn't know what no one gives a fuck of you're Chinese or black no girl or a boy you're a bad motherfucker or you are not yes you are not you should work towards becoming yeah same with MMA right yeah that's martial arts in general it's it's all about a vehicle for developing your human potential I've always said that one of the best ways to stop bullying and stop all this aggression it sounds counterproductive and counterintuitive but they'd stop bullying teach kids how to fight they won't fight they won't do that man I mean and the ones who are the strongest they won't it won't have this need to impose on people don't that doesn't exist in jiu-jitsu the way it exists in in in kids yeah because kids are insecure and they have this weapon being bigger or being mean or being more aggressive and scaring kids and they they see some intimidating and they can't help themselves they don't have any guidance yeah they don't have they don't no one's taught them the proper way to behave and think and then no one's taught them the consequences of that shitty behavior and thinking they just get away with it they do it and they don't think that it's hurting anybody or they don't they don't care they don't feel it yet right numb to it they're not they're not they haven't been taught no they have not been taught this is this is the way that I can stand out a lot of it is because like they need a real cause they need a real cause something real to work towards instead of like looking for conflict and some fucking kid is looking at you at the bus stop weird yeah look for find real conflict find something that you could really work towards and you'll feel better about yourself and you'll feel better about the way you communicate with other people it's one of the reasons why a lot of people talk about jiu-jitsu like it's a religion and in some ways I think it kind of is because you learn and not in the bad ways but in the good ways that you learn this sense of community through struggle right I think the same thing can be said for weight lifters - yeah ya know it's a bond you guys oh man and so and it's it translate it's so many MMA guys that you know have come to him when I trained worked out and it's so relatable the the weightlifting world the fighting world except not getting bust upside to here with you but that struggled yeah this last thought when you train tyron woodley oh man sort of struggle yeah yeah and he's another dude that looks like he's on steroids yeah he's not actually just got that fucking beautiful roll of the dice yeah roll the dice that's exactly right and by the way Tyrone if you're listening you have not been back and I would like for you to come back to do the type of fighting that he does though you can't lift the way you had them left all the tone oh no no no no no no it would just be a incorporation most most files tissues weightlifting as a tool yeah and just when they come they want to test themselves when they come and train with me let's see if I can take it you know the fucking set yeah no matter what no matter what you know those guys do really well because it's so much mental chore involved in it you know and they did the mines are tough guys mines it's tough for me they do real will no you don't get tougher it just you just kind of yeah you just get different yeah you know I mean like I said about ultra marathon runners or anybody who does anything that's extremely grueling and brutal you don't you don't get tougher you just find a different different path exactly for that sort of tough and it always leads through the mind it always leads through mine and yeah that whole expression that idle hands are the devil's playthings that's so true that's goddamn true yeah and it will need they need something they need a cause they need a struggle they need they need something hard they need something difficult to define themselves through if they don't they just they get scattered and insecure and crazy but through that struggle you you gain confidence and character you you know who you are you could you could pull off a workout with Ct Fletcher at the end of that fucking workout you sitting there on that bench drinking water people need to know that they did it people need that they need I did it you need I did it all the time you need I did it like five days a week it's true if I take a couple days off I feel like man I gotta go do something yeah you feel bad yeah I still won't do it a certain attic kick the good thing is the best way to learn is slow oh well I'm ready yeah real slow yeah the people to prove real problem with strong people is that they want to put their strength into it you know and you know you wanna like really just fucking grunt yeah that's it's hard for strong dudes to learn how to kick properly really is was it's it's a perfect time for Peter because they put so much grunt into everything often times they're not pivoting so they put too much pressure on their leg they want to pop in their knee yeah I mean just watch it I seen you kick in man Joe's got some of the meanest kicks I have ever seen from anybody it's a fight thing there's a guy named John Danaher who's a jujitsu genius and he came to me once and it turned out he actually knew but he was playing it off like you didn't know he was telling me that he wanted George st. Pierre who's the champion they wanted him to get some coaching on his spinning back-kick there was like he's he thinks the fundamentals are a little bit off do you know anybody and I was like all right this is good sound crazy I know I'm a comedian I don't know I'm just a commentator but I have a really good spinning back-kick I'm like I could show you how to do it and I could show you as good as any human being that's ever lived oh my god could she do that that was my shit I mean but when I was a kid man I you know it's hard for me to even talk about it now because it seems like a different life like a different person for from the time I was 15 till I was 21 I was obsessed I like trained all day every day I mean that's what I did I basically lived there and so that's why I developed all that obsession they say it's a bad word yeah I don't think no to find my life yeah if it's a bad life you know I mean I've had a good life I've got a good life through obsession eggs yeah coin net fries I've also had a good rifle I'm careful with that shit yeah like a bad dog I keep that motherfucker on a leash and I keep it away from the wrong people yeah I met Jose got some good things you have to be careful like Jamie knows we've been having problems with this goddamn quake game we play play this video games first-person shooter called quake and I have a real problem I get obsessed with things well I want to play all day long I want to play fucking 810 hours a day I can't I don't allow myself to but that's its name today it's the same thing that got me into martial arts when I was a kid I have a fucked up brain but it's fucked up in a good it's it as long as I know how to guide it has the the managers in the building the manager is me right now going to hey settle the fuck down all right you got shit to do you got a family got stuff to do you can't just go run off and decide you're gonna be a professional dis or a professional dad because that's what my brain wants to do my brain wants to find something and go what's this thing okay what's be the best in the world we're gonna be the best in the world at this this is every day you gonna wake up hey I gotta pay taxes you know I fuckin loved it because you are not alone no there's a bunch of me yeah but in a whole lot of more in the UFC yeah there's a whole lot of them out there in jobs right yeah crazy yeah going crazy like wait to get after what the fuck they want to do when they get off work ain't that something that's like fucking 28 years the post office you know go do what I really yeah yeah it's a lot of people out there listening that have that same feeling oh man point-five gave me pain they fucking hate it you know you're not alone yeah I hated it whenever I had a job whatever job I had I fucking hated it and I had a bunch of part-time bullshit jobs cuz I wouldn't take a real job on because I was so scared that if I had like a real 9:00 to 5:00 and then started getting a career and then how a family got married they trapped yeah trapped I was the best that was me I was definitely their kids at home they had eat so yeah nothing you gotta mean and then you you take that time when you get off and that's your obsession time then yeah and there's a lot of people that live that life you know and but I've always tell people is before you have all those other things a mortgage and family and all that other stuff damn to funnel that energy into you into what you like you could live up a wonderful existence and they're charmed life if you could do what I mean whatever it is well you like making knives or fucking painting whatever the fuck you like - yeah if that's your thing and you think about it all the time goddamn you gotta find a way to do that yeah that is your call most definitely excellent advice from Joe Rogan he is so so right and before you get you know the wife the keys Detroit is in your trap yeah but the mind everyone's mind is so different you know there's some people that they don't have that obsessed mind their mind is like they're better off like you know running a country store somewhere you're just being real friendly to people to come in being a baker making good food for folks yeah that's their thing they're called and that you know that's perfectly fine it's the people you know people did annoy the fuck out of me I love you with a noite ooh fuck out of me it's people to have no ambition no Drive whatsoever I'm just happy not doing shit I always wonder about that dammit but I was always wonder like what if I got them when they were little what if I got a hold of them when they were little and and and just introduced him to exciting things and rewarded them when they did well high-five them and hug them you know what I mean like it possibly changed yeah reinforcement of positive goals and reinforcement of positive experiences I think there's some people that just they never got any of that and everything was just work and just drudgery and they'd rather just lay around because that is the alternative to work and drudgery Wow I mean I gave a speech and I'm talking about obsession and being driven and all and you know one of the questions Africa's guys ask me so what if you know you what if you don't want to do anything you don't have any goals or obsessing could you tell me how to get one and I was like fuck how do I tell this motherfucker his he wanted one he said he wanted one I want to find a gold or some but I don't know you I don't know yeah I don't know I with this first time I ever met you and you ask me how to give you an obsession or make it give you an IKE I don't think I can tell you is find something do you have anything that you love is there anything that you love anything that you like to do then you know start there dude yes if you but if if the person looks back at you said no not really alright they're not my fucking the fuck I know some people that have nothing yeah some people it is nothing there's nothing absolutely you know you keep I love you guys but you bug the fuck out just you don't have a calls or go or nothing that really you know excites you that you really wanna make a difference you just you're happy being blah fray and fucking average I just want to be a cog man I just won't be a fucking god do you think that the world needs cogs do you think that some people like he's a thought like not everybody but could be a fucking psychopath right not everybody could be obsessed by things the world will be too insane and regular stuff would never get done right right you and I are getting regular shit done you know you know what how about being the best fucking time there is I'm a support the fuck out of your oh oh man oh no what people I don't I would like to and I think one day we're gonna probably be able to experience this through technology I would like to know how people think like I would like I would like to know like what is going on in someone's head when experience like some sometimes things that happen to you in life and you're just in the worst possible state of mind when it happens and sometimes it's the best possible state of mind and sometimes when it's the best possible state of mind something that should be like catastrophic like yeah it'll be all right you know if the person who did it to you like look man I know you didn't mean to do it's all right don't worry about it take it easy and then you just drop it and you like feel good about it and then other times like fuck that guy I can't kill that guy and it's all like it's all in like how are you wired that day like what what's how are you coming into it you coming into this with a lot of stress you got a lot of other bullshit piling up in your life or you coming into this fresh off a heart transplant yeah yeah well you feel love for the world and you and you have like a newfound enlightenment where you realize that this is all bullshit all this nonsense and fighting and arguing for nothing like why why you do you enjoy relax appreciate don't matter just think that's have passion for your existence and and what you enjoy what you truly love and and your friends and camaraderie and and fellowship that's what it's all about yeah and I think you know they got a whole field of psychologists and psychiatrists that's their field and some of the worse some of the most mentally challenged people I've ever met were psychiatrist I have a theory about that I've theory about that that's very similar in my theory about cops you know I have a deep respect for cops me too and I think it's insanely difficult job just say my same feeling I have four soldiers like you cannot expect someone to just do that with no guidance and no no you you have to have an appreciation for the stress they go through every time a cop pulled somebody over this might be the last moment of their life every time they come to that window and it's tinted and they don't know who the fuck is in there and what kind of warrant that guy might have they don't have any idea and we've all seen videos online of cops getting shot and people getting killed it fucking happens and their everyone they're dealing with is lying to them everyone they're dealing with this if you're a psychiatrist every day you're dealing with people who are fucked every day everyone's fucked up everyone's in some some of they're fucked up is nonsense and you just want to grab them and shake him by the collar get your fucking shit together man yeah the fuck is wrong with you come on you know there's something wrong stop doing what you're doing stupid but you can't even say that don't so you have to go so Mike you know uh uh you're still getting tied up by that woman and she still kicks in the balls shit the people are into like imagine every day you shown up and everyone's nuts yeah when you work with yep you know I'm very fortunate I show up here I get to talk to nice people like you I hang out with great people like Jamie and every everyone's fun here it's all nice my experiences on a daily basis over mostly positive I go to the comic store hang out with comedians I do jujitsu hang out would you do to guys it's a fun experience is it good experiences psychiatrists are just dealing with crazy vibe all day long that's their chosen five yeah to deal with next yeah when I was um when I was briefly in college one of the things that I was concentrating on I'm psychology because I was trying to find out what like I knew there was times when I fought and I was very confident and I knew there was times and I fathered I was a nervous wreck and I was like why what is that that feeling of nerves where you're scared is very compromising it fucks my performance oh my god yeah I mean look you might get hit you might lose you could happen but to dwell on that is crippling you got to be able to accept those consequences but you also have to not dwell so if to be Zen and so I was reading a lot of psychology books and philosophy books a lot of samurai books and but one thing I realized in talking to people that were like psychologists or psychology majors like you're dealing with fucked up people yeah all the time especially psychiatrists drug buddies like I was crazy he was crazy very nice I think you get crazy yeah I think you get crazy with all those people all the time - man yeah I mean if your day is blocked off you have your secretary and then you got patients all day long they're out of their fucking mind yeah very good point it's a terrible diet yeah you know but the you know I don't know if you knew but I used to do tournament fighting karate stuff yeah yeah yeah and the reason the what discouraged me or made me know that I didn't want to be a fighter just what you described thanks Artie oh yeah if a pet was paralyzed I was paralyzed yeah I mean I'd be frozen with it's it's so crazy I mean last time I was at Parker's in NASA Karate Championships in Long Beach California and I'm in fight until my feet were stuck and I was a Taekwondo black belt but my feet were frozen to the fuckin man I couldn't lift them my next weighed a thousand pounds each to me and I was so pale because all these people it was loans people were around and I was so afraid that I was gonna do something to embarrass myself and yeah I'm supportive matches going on at the same time yeah but it felt like everybody's looking at me I'm like man they're gonna watch me through something my tech needs gonna be wrong or it's got I'm just gonna fuck up in front end of the fear was paralyzing I'm like you know I can't fucking do this I'm not cut out to be a fighter man I just can't the pressure just kicked my and it's uh it's a hard thing to overcome oh it's it's hard to sort your way through it into what's really hard for a lot of fighters is coming back from a loss they get beat up and smashed and then then they have to come back and figure out a way through you know and especially a devastating loss of course you season yet but a devastating loss no Raymond Daniels is of course they don't did you see his fight this patient 720 degree punch I mean go go - Bella Tori find that clip man we won't be able to show it right yeah just show us so for folks who don't know what one of the reasons I brought up Raymond Daniel says Raymond he's a belt or kickboxing champion now he lost in devastating fashion - Nicky holtz-eakin who's another world champion and also - Joseph all Shalini who's another world champion so when he was making the transition from karate champion to kickboxing champion he had some stumbling yeah didn't didn't go 100% smooth right but that guy's got an iron will man stunt coordinators in movies watch this look at Raymond Raymond Daniel's he went for a 60 roundhouse kick dude wasn't there and then he continued to spin further boom I mean that is insane that is such an incident land a punch at the end of that so bananas and he landed a spinning back kick to the body right before their yeah yeah I mean he did a thing find the thing he did in in in glory he did a jumping side kick spinning back kick combination where he touched him he touched him with the front leg and then spun in the air and spinning back-kick areas right here yeah I mean this is crazy yeah watch how he does let let this go here it goes watch he touches a world-class kickboxer I mean the movie star qualities are looking at his high life to come up with you know fight free yeah just eat that stuff that they don't even do in the movies in a real fight yeah yeah he's hard to handle here I gave a pep talk or speech them to a group of fighters he was in the group they came out I mean I got a Frank I got to meet alright man I don't always fan a fanboy big tunnel motherfucker oh I love watching those guys in like guys like Michael venom page there's another one who has those karate skills but then they're learning all the the skills of MMA yeah and then you see look man if you don't know that karate style and he knows MMA like your kind of fuck cuz they do shit that's like outlandish yeah you know venom page and shit is ridiculous and he's he's so long too and his timing and movement is so unpredictable and he can sprint at you and you don't even all of a sudden bang you saw that knockout when he knocked out cyborg and caved his head in with that knee the cave that man's head in yes I've seen thousands of fights but I never saw a man get his head caved in ever Hey look at his skull his head is pushed in I mean that was he's not the video above it does that show the actual knocker no it's not it yeah but look how he fights to he I mean that is like that I remember his fight with it was one of the best MMA fights every real muscular guy he's real muscular cyborgs ya know your cyborgs had a fight with this this another oh he's he's kind of on the down hill now but at one time he was like the Mike Tyson of MMA he's built I know you know what I'm talking about Melvin Manhoef yes I did see that fight yeah Melvin is a motherfucker man there's another one man man yeah came from that he comes from Mike's gym in Holland which is a famous kickboxing gym for savages just yeah just war yeah the young a young man was up and Melvin is built like a fucking he was another one unbelievable power and speed when he was in his prime yep but he's not the same anymore you run so many wars but man that dude super bit and it was one of those gladiators yes - yeah he's at least one of moms aged but that showed you how tough cyborg was yeah there was a war that was in cage warriors I think that was man there was a war yeah Yemen I've had the privilege watching so many great fighters fight it's interesting to watch all the different styles and all that but the thing that they all have all the great ones have they have this unstoppable belief in themselves and if they lose they just they learn they lose they learn to come back they get better I'm one of my favorite interviews was voice crazy and man his mentality mmm he says you know I make no plans for after the fight he's not saying hey sexy guys now talking about the after-party and meet me over here say no no no I am prepared to die because I was prepared to die on the weightlifting platform the doc says hey if you go CT you're able to draft get burst right there on stage and dying for all those people good good that's the way out if you want to you want real greatness you have to be able to give it all away but define somebody else does that great did you see the middleweight championship fight between Kelvin Gastelum and Ezreal Adesanya a style bender did you see that fire of course right before the fifth round it means a close fight and style bender came out and just destroyed in the fifth round but right before that he said I'm ready to die yes he goes I'm ready to die yeah lievable moment I love great he was also at the top in the speech that I gave him a tardy coat Kevin was there he's a young guy yeah he's still really should be finding 170 honestly he's yeah yeah I mean he fought at 170 he just he likes to eat you know it's just hell of a lot of heart okay Kevin if you listen to me Calvin's a beast yeah he's he's not even near his full potential yet no no thanks style Bender is either oh yeah I mean style benders better now that he was in his first fight in the UFC which is only about 16 months ago yeah he's better now he's troubled from uni biting me he's an assassin he that guy has he's probably the most technical striker that's ever fought in the OCA iso technical but okay let me ask about this I heard a rumor of him and John Jones know each other yeah John was talking shit about him and he was talking shit about John you know that maybe they'll fight John is way bigger John's a big man yes yeah and he's bad motherfucker well so style bender man I mean maybe one day they could fight but John I think John's futures in heavyweight I really do I think John is gonna clean out the light heavyweight division and then move up and I think he's probably gonna try to catch DC before DC steps out because DC is gonna fight against IPE Miocic they're gonna have a rematch and then I think DC vs. John Jones yeah a heavyweight I think John wants go out there and take that heavyweight title you know but I think DC has a better chance against him at heavyweight I don't think DC likes cutting weight and I don't think it's good for his performance or his durability or anything you know I think I mean judging by his fights with Derrick Lewis it was a fucking huge guy yes and knocking out steep a Miocic who's nobody's ever been able to do it like that before the way DC did it I mean DC says that heavy weight is just way more power four hits harder takes a punch better you know he's not tall guy he's only 511 but he's as wide as his fucking table yeah DC's a tank of a man and his wrestling ability is well that's why it's John so goddamn impressive at John Deere yeah John went right Adam with wrestling's like motherfucker I'm gonna take you down and scare you Dan Jones is my favorite faggot dude if he's not the greatest of all time he's in a conversation a conversation it's like me my opinion is that Mighty Mouse Johnson's the greatest of all time but the caveat is that Mighty Mouse never really fought the Carib caliber of competition that John Jones did John Jones first fight in the UFC for a title he's fighting Mauricio Shogun hooah who is a legend yeah that's John's first fight John opens up with a flying knee yeah fly me the legend yeah no chokes lyoto machida completely unconscious you know chokes out rampage chokes I just smashed everybody John smashed everybody he's only lost one time that's a bullshit loss qualification that's right that he was dominated yeah he's a freak man he's a real freak it most definitely is my favorite especially since he told me listens to my ass before I fight always listen to a year I am the one speaking yes he's something special it really is he's something special and I think um you know he's had some troubles in his life and in troubles but I think he's got that shit behind him I really do I think he's you know I mean he hasn't had a near-death experience but I think he's had so many like near career experiences that he appreciates it now and I also think to be that good you gotta be fuckin crazy and I think John Jones is fuckin crazy and he's just getting his crazy online he's just getting his crazy in order yeah like it's my crazy and under wraps just keep my crazy together yeah baby the girl isn't gonna be that good you got to be a blonde motherfucker oh yeah Wow that's that's what he is he's smart too though he's got like the perfect combination of things like smart and wild yeah you know and physically talented like men fuck for the weight class and he's very strong time tones into the belly of the beast wrong maybe after the fight with Thiago Santos I'll have some time off but he is interesting his coaches thought that his powerlifting was a bad idea for us apparently mad coaches think that he got really into that before the OSP fight remember we had a big stretch of time off and then the OSP fight he didn't look as good but I credit that to OSP I just think that OSP fought a real hard fight he's a real big strong guy and it's fucking dangerous yeah I think that it's just one of those things where stylistically you know ovince fought a really good fight and me no fans had a broken arm for I think the last round you know you had that round with a fucking shattered arm never let anybody know didn't say a goddamn worried about his forearm snapped yeah it's the hardest game in the world next to being a cop or a firefighter or a soldier MMA fighters the hardest game in the world yeah I totally agree I'm glad you brought up soldiers because as I'm a veteran at manufacturing myself and I you know have a lot of PTSD I was hoping that during the conversation we could get a PTSD any or some kind of way because my dad suffered from PTSD big time he went in the Korean War at age 16 he got a guy yeah he had a guy assigned for him and said he was his dad and he was able to to get in for a while like that and that was I that was I give him a pass on a lot of the crazy shit he did because of that right you know he never sit down and had a conversation with me about it I never talked to my dad for more than five minutes at a time you know when I talked to him I gonna never be more than five minutes at a time in you know whole life my whole life and he died when he's 86 and I'm 50 suddenly I was 15 7/8 and go around there before we had it maybe 10-minute conversation that was just me apologizing to him for you know hating them but when they call it shell shock back then so I explained to me it was an explanation for a lot of his over-the-top behavior I can't imagine myself at 16 being you know gunfire playing dead dead guys all around me unarmed I would have been a mental mess also so I gave him a lot of uh and it's such a problem now PTSD with soldiers now they had the 21 push-ups for the 21 veterans who kill themselves every day from PTSD so it's a big cause for me I want to you know do everything I can to try to bring an awareness for the my fellow veterans out there that are suffering from that too so I'm with you guys I'm with you vets yeah it's uh what we're talking about before to ask someone to be able to get through that yeah it's a it's a incredible ask I want to ask your opinion about something how do you think a police chief or ever guy can be do you think a guy can possibly rise to police chief without ever having been an officer himself it doesn't seem like you should be okay do you think a guy can be a fire chief without ever having been a fireman himself doesn't seem like you should be do you think a guy can be the commander in chief of our armed forces without ever having been a soldier himself doesn't seem like you [Music] thank you that's it I think it's way too easy to be commander-in-chief yeah like how many how many people would if that was like a prerequisite you had to serve like like in the Israeli army if you're in the Israeli army everyone has to serve there's a certain amount of time everyone has to put in South Korean army same thing you have to serve you know Chan Sung Jung who's a top-level UFC fighter took two years off his career because that was the requirement with the South Korean army they had him serve I think that if you are going to be able to tell people where they go and that they have to risk their life on a campaign that many people might think is fruitless war even worse many people might think it's financially motivated and not necessary and you're asking some someone's son to go over there and die for that Preet yes you you should have some understanding about what you're saying you should you should have served I think it's impossible for you to have a good understanding a grasp of what you're asking if you haven't experienced it yourself but now let's go back and look at all the presidents how many of them served Barack Obama never served yet george w bush didn't serve but George Herbert Walker Bush served and you know he's actually shot down in World War two right um Clinton never served Nixon never served and I think that none of them should have been able to be commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces that's that's my feeling if you didn't serve you should they got plenty of generals that could fill that spot yeah I think that they should change whatever they need to change whatever law whatever it is to change that the commander in chief of the armed forces has to be has to be us have been a soldier they have a lot of five-star generals a lot of guys at the top that have been in the military that didn't know what their experience let them be the commander-in-chief of the armed force these are the twelve presidents who did not serve in the military so wait wait a minute Nixon did Nixon served he's a commander Naval Reserve it says oh okay um but Clinton didn't know Rock FDR Hoover Coolidge Hart hmm interesting but george w w bush didn't serve did he think he was a reserve for a small period of time or something oh that's right yeah there was some shenanigans for they they got him out oh I think Trump had like eight deferments like feet hurt on sort of shit foam Spurs how do you get bone spurs by never working out ever how does that happen he's kind of funny though man the not working out thing he thinks his bodies am like a battery and things like if you you work out you use up your your juice who that is got a finite number of heartbeats or something like that it's always said yeah there's other people that believe that - I've looked it up - well that is but they do believe that that's the case but here's the thing when you train you it lowers your heart rate that's what we understand most like like Michael Bisping as a 34 beats per minute resting heart rate yeah most fat fucks out there have like 78 80 you know that they're they're wasting their electron yeah look yeah and then when you take in speed right pills he just described me as a fat fuck no no no no you ain't a fat fuck fuck but if even if that is true I mean there's no real evidence that that's man but it is true yeah I think yeah I think anybody that is going to tell people you have to fight for our country should have had to fight most or at least should have had to serve serve you have to have you don't have to necessarily have had military I mean it's not your fault if you didn't see a right right yeah I agree with that you know don't be a comeback but it just been have been willing that when you were called yes to accept the call yeah and it step up and you know I'm went because by doing that you're saying and when I sign this piece of paper that I don't know if there's gonna be a conflict there's gonna be a war not but I'm signing up if there is I'm available I'm here man so we're always hoping for the best right with with presidents but it always disappoints us like no no one no one's been the most amazing pretty no one is ever like the one person where you look back and go man that motherfucker nailed everything they got it right they got it right with whistleblowers they got it right with human rights they got it right with freedom of speech they got it right with everything they got it right with military intervention they got it right with regime change wars they got it right with everything they do didn't do anything wrong and man everybody should be like them like a lot of goofy people look back to like Ronald Reagan like this Ronald Reagan he was our guy like just that's just because it's a long time ago and you remember sucks I remember I remember when people fucking hated Ronald Reagan man I remember when they were trying to get him out of office like that wasn't that one didn't work either no one no one's good at the job yeah they're gonna poison you don't get a lot of comments on me it's an impossible job to please everybody's always an impostor it's an impossibility no I don't know anybody who not just use everybody but the idea that one person is gonna oversee every wrench of government the military the economy your social issues censorship big tech yeah problems with the environment like what the fuck were you crate how could one do all that it's not possible no it's not possible and do a wonderful job at at all - exactly that's right I mean I I don't understand how it's even humanly possible I don't think a human I think that job should be there should be a council of wise people decide things yeah and we should be able to decide whether or not they're wise you know I mean there should be I guess I guess that's what the election in Congress yes in its supposedly what that that gasps yes that's what's supposed to be it's also like it's too easy to vote I mean it's too easy to just say that guy you know okay you should be able to tell me why that guy like what's your reasoning does it make sense did you think just through you just like that guy's a Republican I'm a Republican fuck it what are you doing like you making these choices you you're throwing your mark on this piece of paper and that could affect the way the world swings like what's the thought process behind it it's crazy people should have to explain their books I don't because I don't think that I think the right to vote should not be anything that's infringed upon in any way shape or form but it would be a lot better if people knew what the fuck they were voting on it would help would help if they had a real understanding of it of the time that's the other problem in you know we're talking about people slaving away all day if someone's working all day 8 hours a day how much time they really have to research foreign policy how much time they have to research what's going wrong with the economy subject you know subprime interest rate loans and all that shit how much time to people yeah yeah good you know they're concerned about what's going on in their families and eat and they want to get to the game and stay awake stay awake good enough to keep me awake that's that's uh that's saying something from that I go to sleep off with it from the heart transplant are you sleep here now no no I want to sleep all the time before it all right no I get comfortable fuck and it's over me yeah well that's that's right sorrow that's the thing two people trained already fucking with ya and trained a lot though you're always ready to take a nap oh yeah your body's always like recover yeah no problem or overtraining is bullshit training is bullshit oh I know you don't I think I bet you think that it's not bullshit and overtraining is very real don't you yes I do yes you would say that you know what rhabdo my losses is no I have no ideas when you're overtraining you're literally your muscles start breaking down to pollute your kidneys people die from it wow that's a big ass long words and if you look in a dictionary it'll say bullshit no I think it is under resting under recuperation that's true but overtraining now if you get enough rest and enough recuperation I think overtraining spools right but if you have to work out hard and then you have to work out again the next day and you work out hard the next day that's that's rhabdo Milos's piss when you get robbed oh you're pissed comes out looking like iced tea yeah and I don't mean the rapper yeah more than a rapper though right it's hard to say he's a rapper actor he's a cool dude yeah I mean he has body count that's a metal band so he is that - yeah yeah cool but yeah it looks like diet coke let's say that yeah that's what this looks like yeah that's um that's what happens you know train every time work fucking eight hours a day eight ten twelve hours a day at the post office went to the gym put in another four to six hours of fucking twenty five years and my piss never looked like yeah I think that's more endurance athletes and particularly CrossFit a lot of CrossFit people get robbed oh yeah there's a competing it's other people and they get real wrapped up in it and I gotta ask Jason Khalifa about this good friend of mine see if he's pissed if it was like root beer it's a real real issue for CrossFitters and like ultra endurance athletes yeah yeah he's one of the top CrossFitters guys I think yeah he's like world champion two or three that those guys are ridiculously full and ridiculously fit a demon in mind to him and I put him through my training it was one of the he did the shit play yeah yeah he's fucking that guy CrossFit me and you know we're gonna wait with this kind of laugh at CrossFit reason why I let that's you know you know girly shit man it's both CrossFit in this bullshit but that motherfuckers in extremely good shape yeah CrossFitting is definitely not yeah it's definitely not bullshit no it's very hard yep what those guys do is very very very very hard the real question is whether or not it's good for your body and that's where that's where I'm not qualified just to judge but there's a lot of people that are professional strength and conditioning coaches that frown upon it because they think that those kind of movements like powerlifting movements like clean press that can yeah yeah that should not be done for the maximum amount of repetitions they think that should be done for power then you should you know you should whole east up your maximum or 85% of your maximum for X amount of times and that's it but what they're trying to do is just you know if Mike does 10 I want to do 12 right Mike does 12 on one do 15 mm-hmm you know and they think that there's like Steve Maxwell who's a pretty famous strength conditioning coach he frowns ballin and he just thinks it's just those movements are not designed for endurance so those movements are designed for power he thinks ultimately it's detrimental for your body and that if you want to have a long career in fitness and constantly be able to work out like deep into your 50s and 60s he just thinks it's very detrimental for your body mmm again I'm not the guy to tell right you are not true I need to get one of those top level CrossFit guys I've gone back and forth with rich Froning yeah online but never got him on oh yeah again I'm sure Jason would die to be on here but he is exceptionally fit you know the long term I don't know cuz it's still a pretty young guy but I have a a real bad habit of looking at the people that say those things about you know athletes like that I always look at them and that bad habit I can't help all the people that give all the advice to weightlifting advice online I always go and look at their page and see how the fuck they look and assaults the overwhelming majority of Instagram coaches are fat fucks yep is how the fuck can you give advice and look like that exactly alright how can you i tell people how can i I can't tell you or anybody how did to get through anything if I never been through anything myself I'll tell you how to overcome an obstacle if I never overcame any fucking thing right and I can't tell you how to be in shape if I look like a fat fuck I just can't do it I have a bad habit of looking at that person and and you know examining them first if you're gonna give me this kind of advice then I have to you know I gotta look at your page Joe I've never seen pictures and since you've been posting me if now if I want to know that's why I'm asking Joe Rogan is showing I had a kid cuz I seen this motherfucker kick and he kicks like a fucking mule man I want to learn how to kick from dad guy I wanna see some like kicking through walls and shit if you have not seen your own kick look it up that is one kickin sob to kick your face all yeah I think you got a good point about the people that criticize like some people criticize people that work too hard means they don't want to work that hard like you don't need to work that hard yeah yeah I don't trust trainers that look like shit oh fuck some of them are pretty popular yeah and I see him I'm like what kind of body is that fucking cunt yeah weird I think they gotta be great talkers yeah great well they must have good degrees in physiology and this now they must man and I mean look at them they look doughy they're like what the chin looks like am I too skinny I can't lie the first guy on you that I'm fucking talking shit about them thighs I couldn't get a job as a personal trainer I had always fucking World Championship certificates and sitting they told me you're not certified but it's not 35 right that we can't use it oh my fuck this guy look like he had never seen the inside never even drove by a fucking chair and he's a fucking ear to head personal trainer here I wonder if someone could be a good trainer without ever really working on hard themselves isn't that so dissimilar to someone saying that someone shouldn't be the commander-in-chief without a Howard yeah I'm gonna work out I want to work out with someone who's built like you I want to work out with someone who's built like oh this one the fuckers lifted some weights I understand yeah you know what it takes to get big you know what it takes to get strong it's it's like not just in theory yeah it's like would you hire a boxing coach they'd never be in a box there's never been in the ranges no doesn't seem wise you know I couldn't do it but I think some pieces some trainers are just really good martial artists and they never have competed I don't understand how that works though doesn't make sense to me and then they would say that you know their their skills and teaching things it's not in fighting itself but I think some of the best best fighters are the best coaches where there have been fighters yeah some of the best yeah I totally agree because they know what the fighters going through hmm and that that's part it was not just the skill you know the techniques that the kicks the plan it's not just they know everything because they've been there we know what you know they know everything from the ring walk to what what it's like when it gets hard when you're down on the cards yes they know that you know and a guy had never been through that you'd be lost in Essex we don't know what the fuck to tell you yeah yeah I mean I think that's what most things in life right yeah someone's gonna give you advice on something they better have some actual real world experience yeah I think so I think isn't this necessity but what the fuck go on you know a lot ma'am well hang a kid justice the old guy from County yeah a lot of good stuff comes out of County man dr. Dre came from County a lot of good stuff comes out of pressure yeah for sure Compton's pressure yep that is definitely pressure bad things come out of it as well oh yeah you know it's not ideal yeah but damn if you can make it through oh man that's a crazy thing like you don't want your children to suffer but the people who do suffer goddamn they come through with some incredible character it's a conundrum Wow it yes it's such a I think that you know people tell me a joke people tell I get letters and DM do stuff for people from oh the planet and there's so many different races mess Russian Ethiopian people from Sri Lanka everywhere hey CT it was something about your store if it was a childhood your health problems how you went through that and overcame gave me inspiration to go through my problems that is the best feeling in the world Joe and when I hear that I'm like everything I had to go through or everything I went through I I didn't volunteer to die I read or it wasn't my choice if I had a choice I'd have been perfectly fucking else but but going through it if it could help that guy in Sri Lanka that guy Russia the guy in Prague the guy and I if it could help them then it was so worth it it ain't even funny I'd do it all over again tomorrow hmm just because this guy says that it helped me get through something inspiration inspirations very very very valuable very valuable and really hard to I mean it's hard to quantify if you don't explain inspiration as someone who's never experienced it like someone else doing something good makes you feel like you can do something good seems like it shouldn't I shouldn't have anything to do with you but it does I'm my first one of the we had a we gotta do these expose these expose a certain people come and something wait in line two or three hours to shake my hand and I think that's so crazy so I mean who the fuck am i oh my fuck I am nobody I'm nobody nothing well stop and think about this many of your videos have like more than a million views so you're not nobody it's crazy but that's not nobody like everybody somebody right I mean that's an old saying yeah the reality is you have reached out with your videos and touched and if you saw a million people in front of you you'd freak the fuck out right well that's more than that you've touched many more than that millions and millions of people here is absolutely crazy I just came out because the first freshener I get on YouTube I go hey look I don't give a fuck if you listen to me a million people right now it's just it's just so crazy so cuz I like I said I can sit him myself at least at least at Lord said Lord's the bottom of the barrel and I'm just you know black people say el sitio you're the greatest you're King you're a gun I ain't none of that stuff I'm nothing ma'am I'm absolutely nothing well that's not true either what you are as an exceptional person the thing about exceptional people is that our self-critical and they're one of the reasons why you got to be so good at what you chose to be obsessed by is that you you worked hard to constantly improve so when you're constantly working hard to improve you're not thinking I'm the best I'm the best look god damn I gotta go to work I gotta get this in I got to get this done and so when people tell you you great you like party I'm over here working there trying to get better great man that's inspiring to people though the thing about what inspiration does to people it's almost like a type of intangible fuel it's I can change lives so people come to me in in the lining we got tell me yeah a grown man he starts crying rope gets down on his knees stay away from that guy this guy's crying he get down on his knees and telling oct you changed my life you kept me from committing suicide I've heard that story that I that because of me they didn't take their own life at least a hundred times yeah Joe Rogan what I have gone through just to save if these people are the same that I saved their life because I didn't give up because I didn't give in because I kept the faith and kept going I was gonna do that anyway Joe that's just right but it change their life for them to tell me something like that I might fuck how I do to shit all over again tomorrow well you know it's like what we're saying earlier about people that don't have anything that they're in hired by and you I was saying maybe I wish I would saw them when they were young like maybe if you got a hold them when they were young you could teach them the value of expressing themselves and competing or doing something where you get like positive feedback from your effort and I think that some people they just they don't they don't ever get that and so when someone gets that from someone like you when they they they get that that fuel that intangible fuel that you get when you get inspired by somebody they it's so emotional because it's it really is like you gave them a gift and that gift we model ourselves after other successful people we do it all the time either hopefully if everything goes great you model yourself after your parents or you model yourself after your uncle your brothers and sisters or whoever it is that surround you that seems to be exceptional and that that fuels people it helps people it means a lot to people sometimes people don't have that so they got to look inward they got a you know it's like that old Whitney Houston song you know everybody search it for a hero oh yeah song yeah it was like on the Muhammad Ali life story that was a that was that was the song that they said the original version of that song was on a it was like a docudrama on Muhammad Ali's life but that sometimes you don't find someone for a long time and then when you do it changes your whole life you find someone maybe it's just a YouTube video and it's you saying it's still your mother-fucking set and it's you just pushing people and telling people to go get after it and people see that and all the sudden it's like thinking goosebumps their heart starts racing it's like you gave them a drug look you gave them fuel and then then they want to change their life then they want to watch you tomorrow then they want to watch you when they're at lunch break they don't want you they're taking a shit watch you on their phone that's this fuel and you literally can change a person's life through that because we need each other I mean this is it's one more piece of evidence that we need each other that we have this sort of a very strange loose fitted community of all human beings together when someone like you does something that's exceptional and says something that's exceptional and has these inspirational words it can change a person's whole life changed their whole path change who they are I've gotten so many messages from people that say I lost 130 pounds you know I did this I got off sugar I'm doing I'm fucking running every day I hit the gym five days a week now I'm a different person I'm drinking water I'm exercising I take vitamins I'm eating healthy I've got more juice I got more energy my whole life is different now you can't feel you can't because man got all these people yeah looking up to you yeah I don't want that I definitely know anybody looking up to me but I do like people being inspired and if people get inspired by me I'm happy but you know they think I don't know but I don't look at me and I'm looking at talk about a higher power look at the I don't look at me we fucking need each other yeah we all need each other we really do there's something beautiful about that though like you can't just go it alone you really do need each other and like if you accomplish everything you ever want to accomplish but nobody's there for it with you nobody cares nobody likes you okay don't mean shit yeah it's useless absolutely like love is the most important thing and that sounds so cliche but without love it's all useless it's all useless there's no personal satisfaction and accomplishments if nobody loves you you're not gonna enjoy it yeah at least your family everybody and the the more you can spread positive energy the more people will love you the more you'll have that community of love you know that's that's all it's just like I told you I never expected even you know their Passport people tell you I always think about I'm I'm the little kid that used to hide in the closet when I I would hear my dad's keys rattling the door or police car pull up and I hide in the closet I try to hide me I just want to see man I just I'm that kid dude I'm so mmm and my dad would always tell me that you know you're never gonna be nothing and so I'm back here so let's still fucks with you owe it to come from know it I'm reminded of it I think about that when people tell me all your great Caesar you know I come from I'm you man III wash dishes I cut grass I pop gasps I'm those people yeah you know I bussed tables as a kid I watched the people are saying that I'm great I'm well ma'am you yeah yeah yeah I'm you yeah I'm at anything other than you that's so important you know yeah they are you but that they can be someone like you too if they put in the kind of time and effort that you put in that's the real message the real message is we all started from no twin I mean we all had bullshit jobs we all felt like losers but through time and effort you build a stronger human you build a stronger body you build a stronger mind you build accomplishments and we'll and momentum and then you look back and you go hey man I'm not washing tables anymore you know I'm not I'm not washing dishes I'm not cutting lawns I'm not digging ditches yeah I'm a different person now but I used to be into these desire not to be their person actors that's that's what that's the hardest part right to get out of that rut when you ain't got shit and there's nothing going on to have faith then is so difficult to have faith when you're successful it's like yeah yeah listen bitch you've been successful for a while don't you got faith yeah just keep doing what yeah it's absolutely right it's like you already got up the hill now you just coasted yeah you know you're just rolling down the hill everything's great it's these all smooth sailin yep the hard part is getting up that fucking hill especially if you got a dad you're hiding from especially if you feel like you're a loser you never really had anything in your life that you could look back on and say hey I was really good at that you know and there's a lot of people out there listening to this there's so many people that are in that's that starting point like the people that come up to you and say what do I don't know what to do what should I do how do I do it yeah how do I get going well you're gonna have to figure it out one foot in front of the other you're gonna have to you know to find a thing and keep working at it and get better at it that's one of the things that I like so much about martial arts don't let anybody in yeah anybody in and then from that from learning how to do that you get better and then you realize they might get better at anything yeah cuz it's so the first time I ever did you just say I remember just being manhandled so bad going man I'll never be good at this this is terrible I'm fucking awful with this and this had already been a black belt in Taekwondo and already kickboxer I did a bunch of shit and I was like I can't believe I'm starting from scratch again yeah but that at least I knew then that I already done that before I already started from scratch so I had some experience it started from scratch like all I have to do is just put in the time and the effort here they desire to get better yeah that's for everybody just fine and everything and if you find a thing like particularly martial arts because you get belts and ranks and then you can see how you're doing with opponents especially jujitsu I like that when the pulse cuz you don't get in hit and I think there's so many people that in the especially if you go to a bad gym in the early days people are gonna tune tune you up you're gonna beat you up yeah yeah you can get some damage here discords a lot of people yeah but if you could just find a thing and work hard at that thing you realize through that thing that you can get good at anything yeah with time and effort don't have anything on that I mean you pick the thing what everything calls to you whatever calls to you yeah they decide to change the night to change those circumstances whatever they might be as long as you have you have to have that desire to will to change their circumstances yeah that's that's you start right there man you know how bleak it makes me but if you have the will to be tired to change it there's your starting point since you started doing these videos on YouTube - now how much of a difference is it made in the types of people that come to your gym and then the numbers of people that come in the I have Joe Rogan's phone number I have Terry Crews phone number I have dr. Trey's phone number yeah saw you you took a lot of pictures with dr. Dre man you've been with him a lot dr. Dre I know you guys look at the news might you might see hey it don't say no bad about doctor in front of me well this is incredible individual and incredible dr. Dre I called him Trey now Trey is an incredible individual his heart is huge huge Joe I can't tell you how you cannot - but yes with you yes that is an incredible individual he was jacked at one time he still looks great he told me he's in very good shape right now he's a lot of cardio eats really well matter of fact he's got this trail he wants me to he challenged me to turn a hiking up a hill and I'm not ready for a job but dr. Dre if you're listening I'm gonna make it a bit fucking's real I might have to roll down but he's in great shape but he's a great human being he's a a very good human being that's awesome here I love him yeah just down the earth so he shifted his training from like just he got a big yeah his goal yeah I saw what the comic storm one night and he was like the rock yeah huge exactly you know he's he's more you know health oriented in in cardio and he wants to he said his goals to get down to 200 pounds of just lean low body fat percentage muscle what does he weigh now 210 I think he said and with me and him saying around the same weight and I my goal is also to get down to 200 pounds I want to be 200 pounds which I haven't been a long time but I want to beat you on your pants well this pictures of you when you were power lifter yeah were you we had 325 325 oh my god Wow I think the call this month are gonna work out so you're as wide as a building that I was god damn 325 so you were

one-pound stakes just and I didn't care we're gonna pay I'd almost pass out tied my shoes on get out of breath walking through the front fucking door I'm like oh fuck it's the over witness at the door

card as a bodybuilder but my it looks a little daddies up we were talking about people to come to your gym though man I mean let's talk to you now flag but it's kind of cool though because you you have sort of you've taken on this role as a guru I mean that's one of the things that a lot of people have gotten from your videos and these mean there's motivation from you know a lot of people can give you motivation some of that motivation seems stale and then there's some people that give you motivation like wow that's live that's it's alive your motivation is live it's real you can tell it's not scripted yeah from the heart yeah yeah definitely everything is right off the top of the head and I think when a doo Roo that's a lever tighter I think I'm definitely not worthy I may be you know fetus leo he's an old G okay that's that's more closer to I've been around long enough well you're also like people turn because of the fact you've been around you've done so much the people will turn to you and say hey you this is a person with real life experience you you really have done things yeah it done some stuff when you start talking about pushing you start talking about pushing yourself people understand this is coming from life experience this is real and that's the different that's why it's it resonates with people it resonates with people because it's all santak oh man that's a high compliment I appreciate that thanks it definitely is raise a lot of people they're listening to this that know you that are not in their head right now and appreciation and understanding they
