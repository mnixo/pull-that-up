Joe let's ladies and gentlemen Joe lisped oh I'm already going to do it like one of the morning DJ guys I appreciate Hey Joe I hear you're in town for the funny fuck I am doing the funny fuck this weekend tonight through Sunday excellent actually you are working with me tonight yeah two sold-out shows at the Hollywood improv I appreciate it I'm excited it's gonna be fun it's gonna be the Machine Bert Kreischer love Bert and cheeto Santino Andrew Santino you know Andrew I know I know and I don't know if I don't know him personally just no one knows me hilarious yeah yeah should be a good old fucking time yeah thanks for having my pleasure my putting you down for I leave tomorrow morning right here on Sunday I got here Saturday actually I stayed down Manhattan Beach what are you doing the posh hanging out with the people by the beach that was night was down the airport my wife is here and I said let's go down in Manhattan Beach for lunch and we were enjoying ourselves so we got a hotel and made love and walked on the way went to a party once in Manhattan Beach and the guy collected toasters huh and I was like what is this and he was like oh I just collect toasters I'm like okay from all different time periods like he had a luncheon toaster from like the 50's with all this patina on it and then he had modern toasters but he I think he was trying too hard you know though some dudes just wear bowling shoes and shit they just try too hard to be whacking yeah it was he like a hipster was an old it was a girl he was a guy who's trying to fuck my girlfriend oh and she wanted to go to this party all right Wow I think she was an actress and I think he was in the movie business imagine getting cooked by a toaster yeah collector yeah almost did well it wasn't it was one of them squirrely deals where she was like say I'm so not interested in him I just want to go this party for Network thing I was a young lad I had just moved to Hollywood it did not know the ways of this goofy fucking town yet yeah I hadn't uh I hadn't exercised myself from Hollywood in protect you know right I was still doing the thing acting going on auditions and shit mm-hmm so it was like you when you first get here you're like what is this especially in the 90s it super squirrely because everybody was trying to get a development deal and everybody was trying to get a sitcom and they kind of like let you think that that was the only way right I have to get a sitcom I want to be like Roseanne why don't you want to be like Tim Allen what about Seinfeld he got a sitcom you should get a sitcom damn when I get a sitcom and so everybody was out here just trying to do the acting thing I did it for a while and after a while you like these people are not worth it but you did get a sitcom right yeah yeah yeah I got a couple of them and I was on a couple of them it seems like fun it's fun stand-ups more fun yeah it's not something I'd be interested in doing but if you could do a sitcom with all stand-ups that would be the shit that would be the shit like if you if you could do a sitcom with really good writers who are cool and all the people on the show were stand-ups that would be fucking monstrous it's not usually like that no and it seems very what do you call it corporate and you're gonna do this in this and a lot of rules and stuff it seems like podcasts are well they're trying to make money you know and they can't make money if people do things and get people in trouble they say things get people angry or someone calls up human resources and Joe list was talking about his dick yeah the craft service lady heard it and now there's a lawsuit I think with podcasts now most of us comedians with podcasts have no chance of getting any corporate job I don't think that's true really I could offer shit all the time I think that we don't need it though right I think it's it actually will get in the way have you ever written on a sitcom no written on anything when you write it there's a trap that comics falling into that are good writers they get this sitcom writing gig and it's a sweet gig you get paid thousands of dollars a week you build your bills are covered so you feel good but you're never going on the road you're you're in town all the time you're just doing sets around town so you're pretending that you're still a comic right but you're really a sitcom writer who kind of like has a hobby doing stand-up and you never develop on the road and there's a bunch of guys do you know Owen Smith I that's another guy I don't know I've met amok amok in hilarious yeah one of the best comics in the world and he's just been spending so many years doing these sitcoms like I saw him one night at the comic storm like how the fuck is this guy not gigantic like how does he not have a Netflix our that everyone's talking about how is it everybody not trying to book in places that's just because he's been doing this this sitcom writer thing he's trying to break out of that now though Tommy John against another guy you know Tommy John I've heard of him he's one of the best comedians I think there is he's a writer but he's been writing on a TV show but he's happy he likes he's got two kids and it keeps him off the road but to me it's a bummer as a comedy phantom like I want to see a new hour but he still I think he still works a little bit yeah Mitch Hedberg had a really funny bit about that about how comedy look when your convenience the only job or someone asks you to do another job yeah yeah yeah it was somebody I first moved to New York there was a guy that was like do you do any writing and I was like well I did all that writing I wrote a whole that but that's why I never liked writing other than stand-up could stand up I can write all day and then go do it that night where I'm writing like a movie or a TV show I'm wasting my time gonna get made which is not my therapist says that's not the way that's not what you inspired it right right because it's a way to express yourself you therapist is right but then again if you are writing something and nothing happens how fucking stupid it feels it feels wasteful jokes that I do on stage yeah you you just get into that sort of thing where you just like what am I doing here and then it steals your thunder yeah I feel that way all the time unrelated you right right you sit down and write a little bit yeah I try to but a lot of times a lot of times I'll start writing and then I end up just jerking off jerking off yeah well Louie said that he had he kept his he had one laptop that could not connect to the Internet yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he still doesn't but if you do that like what if you want to Google something while you're writing well I do that a lot and I'll use this excuse I'll be writing and then I'm like what's the origin let me google that for research and then before you know what I'm just going through exactly yeah you discipline that's all I give myself an hour I have one hour that I have to write and then if I enjoy it I keep going but one out for one hour there is nothing going on but writing see that's ambitious I have to go literally I'm not even joking like ten minutes let me do ten minutes and usually I'll go a little longer because I'm like alright alright well now I'll do like 30 minutes and I'm like then you can treat yourself about a child I've I am too but I found that I mean obviously we came in here we were me and Jeff we're embroiled in a quake deathmatch yeah and we wouldn't stop to say hi so that's it hi briefly I appreciate I feel like I walked into you fucking well I got here early and I was gonna I'm always compulsively early everywhere I spend a lot of time just doing laps around places and because I have so much anxiety but I parked I was like I'll just sit in my car for ten minutes and then a big guy came out and was just looking at me and so then I was like I think I'd this must mean I have to get out of the car yeah he's armed so I got out oh I'm terrified uhm but yeah so I got here early I was on camera but I would have showed up right it no it doesn't matter all right we shouldn't have snuck in that extra game it's just we get the problem is you play one game and then it gets got like we play for a half hour play to a hundred points mm-hmm a hundred deaths and then it gets intense and then if one guy beats the other guy gives them a drubbing then the other guy wants revenge and then you have to play that second right yeah it's addictive then you start off your day with two ass-kickings it's like jerking off hundred deaths yeah start off your day with two jerk-off sessions like math I have a lot of catching up to do if I want to make this a productive day are you still jerking off a lot of course I feel like I don't jerk off that much advanced well I have a wife and we have sex but here when that she's not a Widow's when she's away denne jerk off I'll jerk off a little bit but I have less less than I used to there's something wrong with me I can still get my vagina hard but I just I just thought I'm not as interested nothing wrong with that man why would she I when I'm with her I'm very yes yes yes I get it but your free time you've got other shit on your mind yes you're focused I am focused on about 5,000 things at me - yeah the world of being a comedian yeah that's a lot yeah it's Louie's idea is a good idea on paper so like not not having anything connected to the Internet well here's this I think about doing this now he has two phones like a flip phone that like 12 people have the number and then he's like a smart phone that he'll leave behind so like his kids can call him mmm or is you know mother or whatever I'm one of the 12 but like you someone can get in touch with him and you can call nine-one-one away but there's no Twitter Instagram whatever so that's like a decent idea as to phones cuz I'm fucked up with but then you know obviously you're friends with Ari he is the flip phone that's Louie as if the phone but what sucks is when you're hanging out with these people they still need the shit so they end up using your phone exactly like I'll go hiking with Ari whatever a trip and he's like pull up your Google math can I use your phone and they just hands my phone how about have some discipline Ari yeah and a real phone I don't want anyone to have my fight it's not like I don't have crazy porn or whatever touching my phone I don't like people holding my phone that's like someone wearing your underwear yes it's worse hey can I borrow your underwear what you can you can take a raw dog just put pants on yeah do you have to have underwear it's weird you don't need underwear you do I like I sprinkle a lot of tinkle yeah but if you have a good pair of underwear it's better then like if you weren't jeans and shed and your sticks rub it against your zipper said something yeah that's no good good boy you need to undo I take it back I want to walk back my normal just need some discipline just need some goddamn discipline he's such a child he does but I understand addiction and stuff it's difficult because wait I have it where I'm like just don't look yeah but I'm obsessed with my phone well I am too but I'm not as bad as I used to be but Ari he realizes it he's like yeah it's not a loser he's a winner like he figure shit out he's aware he's like all right I have a fucking problem and I'm not getting better at this so I'm just gonna get rid of it yeah and get this fucking stupid flip phone that I could barely text on like whenever he texts me it's like a miracle I'm like what are you doing here with this caveman phone yeah a text message for the stupid fucking phone and then you have to keep it short because you can't send like a long thing because it comes in like three pages and out of order so it's like anyways I'm gay now and then it's like hey I just met it's all fucked up yeah it sucks but baby I'm thinking about doing it myself well they're getting crazier now they're having these folding phones that blow out too like 10 inches have you seen these goddamn things no well Samsung released it but then they took it back cuz it started breaking but it's it's a it looks like a regular smartphone okay but it's fat and the reason why it's fat is you can open it up and it becomes a giant smartphone oh that seems kind of nice it's pretty nice if you need an iPad everywhere you go alright but do you know I don't is my phone also as like a computer I barely use my computer I just write emails and shit on my phone yeah I write very few emails on my phone I tried I'm trying to limit my hour on the phone to one hour one hour for the whole day one hour of screen time yeah that's a stool pressive yeah why I forced it on my kid so I'm like okay if she gets an hour of screen time I should get an hour screen time right but you're also running a business like sure you have a team but I'm also responsible right yeah yeah other people that pick up the slack it's a full-on addiction though it's fucked up like I'll go on a plane I'll fly across the country I'm on airplane mode if you can't even use it and I'll find myself just looking at photos just cuz I want the dopamine when the fuckin is of just holding and moving my phone yeah it's really a problem it is a problem and I'm actually I've been doing a bit about it about the real problem is what's next the real problem is where does it go from here because it's got you hooked just looking at photos and texts well I mean I walked in you couldn't say hello and you were crying playing quake so that might be the next step there's something about staring at that screen when you get really intense er I start watering I swear to God I wasn't emotional no I thought your parents passed away as I pulled in guys leave here I feel like a freak first of all sometimes we leave well we'll have these battles that'll go like two hours and then when I leave my fucking hearts pound and my Adrenaline's rush and I'm like see you later man bye and we leave and we're like what the fucking I'm driving home Malta it's like literally like you just had a fight like going that fight with somebody well I don't have that yet it's it's a very very bad addiction but it's really fun too so part of me is like I'm enjoying the shit out of this it's really fun to play I think that's the kids just enjoy it you got to enjoy whatever decision you're making this is good my therapist therapist okay yeah well I'm dealing I have like a horrible diet my whole life fillet you eat well now I've chained I'm going through a bit of a medical situation right now I have AIDS no I came here to slit cards the fun you lose a little weight whatever but it makes you whimsical yeah I feel good I can play basketball now like The Flintstones it's like gay old time did they have AIDS yeah that's why they're not here anymore what was I gonna say oh so I have this thing called silent reflux have you ever heard of this no it's acid reflux but they call it silent cuz there's no heartburn it's different than GERD it just goes straight up into your like vocal cords into your throat so it's like fucking up my my shit oh no and I wake up like a cough and it's like into my they're calling it respiratory reflux now weird like it's almost like asthma sinus shit and style-related yeah well I ate exclusively I drink coke clotting like three or four cokes a day exclusively like a large pizza extra marinara chicken parm extra marinara Chipotle extra hot sauce mmm chocolate chip cookies garbage like a garbage child I'm a garbage child yeah so I just ate exclusively that I was in therapy enough but I knew I was like I'm getting fucking myself up I'm gonna die I'm gonna get cancer and die and my therapist is like just at least accept your decision enjoy eating shit yeah he's like you're eating shitting not even enjoying it so what's the point and he's like accepting it would actually probably help you to eat healthier and I was like good point I'll just start enjoying it and that lasted ten days and that's when the reflux started and I had to completely change my diet mm-hmm so I should have had that conversation 25 years earlier so now I just ate like shit without enjoying it and now I'm refluxing mm-hmm and I can't eat any of that so I had to cut out everything so what did they tell you to eat now you have to cut out dairy woody cut now while going back to the doctor on Thursday then I'm seeing a specialist who like coined the phrase it's like a thousand bucks for a consultation but at this point I'm like Christ I'm losing my mind so crazy is that the doctor could charge a thousand dollars just talked to you well the other the first doctor I went to was an ENT and they do a thing which I think is fucked up they're like I'm like I'm paying kay I don't have insurance I'm paying out of pocket and you're like oh it's a 20% discount if you're paying on a pot like like I'm at a record store like they're like we give you a discount if you pay up fresh and I'm like all right that seems bizarre it's like my well being that seems like something someone who deals with drug dealers guys come in with bullet wounds cash and set off it's a little tray up well I rolled up my money and put a rubber band around it and handed it to him we always like to think that's good we always like to think that doctors are there there's something special about them you know they're beyond reproach they're above and beyond but I was reading this book called dead doctors don't lie by this guy Joel Wallach and it's all about mineral deficiencies and how many people have mineral deficiencies and how little doctors actually know about nutrition and how so many doctors are not only unhealthy but have at least back when he wrote this book have easy access to prescription medicine and they're just overdosing right and they're just fucking cooking themselves a coke right yeah I'm trying to do like an organic he thinks I started eating all these salads and oatmeal and salmon said helping no I feel better wait I'm thin I'm taking huge like green baby leg shits like in st. like the s with it's good right yeah yeah roughage amazing comes flying out and I feel light and I'm a little more to find that's good but my throat still all fucked up but I've heard it takes months and I'm like maybe my body's repairing and it just doesn't take mine too whatever so what specifically they tell you to get off of well first then when I first went there it was like the end of the day like I started having like a fucking panic attack is this like white shit coming down my throat not the first time that's happened folks come alright I wet I ran in there I was like can I gotta see a doctor today I'm losing my mind and they were like we can squeeze in an appointment and I think when you show up right before they close with no health insurance the guy kind of looked and went oh yeah that's silent reflux and then they print out a piece of paper from like WebMD which is amazing to me hmm they just print shit out that I could have googled and he's like try to cut out the spicy foods take prilosec and whatever so he made it seem like it was no big deal spicy foods yeah that's interesting that they would tell you to cut that out like like what what what is Coe do they say what is actually causing like what is the mechanism like what's what's forcing this reaction well I think what happens is it has something to do with your esophageal sphincter whoa which I didn't know I had what yeah you do it's I guess it's that like I've read so much of this shit just like you're saying like g-spot when you're sucking dicks yeah yeah it gets down there I feel like that would be deep in there so it opens up and there's supposed to be some acid that comes up but I got too much acid I guess it flexes and then it it reflexes hmm but my I think what happens is it gets so fucked up from diet that it becomes compromised so it doesn't matter what I eat it's just open like a like a fucking like a loose oh yeah so and that's from just all the acid hitting it over and over and over again yeah so I got into this there's a woman named dr. Kaufman I forget her first name but she actually is in New York that's what I'm going to see for a thousand bucks but she like coined the phrase and wrote all these books and stuff and says you can fix it through diet but I've been taking like a ton of prilosec and shit and definitely I guess I don't know what's helping like how much worse it would be if I wasn't taking that but then when you get off of that there's a thing called rebound reflex where it just comes back fucking gangbusters Oh No so I'm all like people that take xanax yeah I used to take xanax I've never taken it but they say that when you get off of it then you get super-anxious I don't remember that I only took it if I was like having a panic attack whatever but I took paxil for a lot of time and that I couldn't come on the yeah yeah yeah it's unpleasant you and Mike Tyson in the same photo can he not come couldn't was on the paxil but very similar guys yeah yeah yeah I used to play with pigeons I shouldn't say play with is he listening terrifying about the show he's a good guy he's super friendly he's like a giant bear that's like your friend yeah I'd like to he's like really sweet guy but you are very aware when you around him that he is not you like this is a compass is an elite super athlete yeah from the Hall of Fame he's Mike motherfucking Tyson and even though he doesn't even hardly work out anymore like he when you shake his hand it's like holding on to a brick it's like his whole body it's like he's like five feet wide yeah I imagine if you work I don't know you probably know more about this than I do if you work out enough for long enough and then you stop I imagine you're gonna have a base you definitely have a base like I were like when I was a kid when I was younger I ran I was a distance runner and I stopped running distance but I feel like now I could go run five miles because I used to yeah yeah yeah for sure I feel similarly like Mike Tyson could beat me up probably oh yeah I don't know he might have some skills my friend Ct Fletcher he actually had a heart surgery heart transplant one year ago and he hasn't be able to do much of anything other than like very light exercise like he's just trying to like build his body back up but he's he used to be a world champion power lifter and even though he hasn't worked out like really worked out and probably like a year and he still has giant arms he's still huge yeah I keep a lot of it he could probably beat me up also you think he can't move that much okay cuz of the heart okay you know he's not a bunch of pills and stuff but if he got a hold of it be fucked yes got his arms like double mine oh my arms it's a big oh he was an enormous man at one time was basically my height maybe an inch he's probably five nine maybe an inch taller than me and he weighed three what do you say three twenty at one point 320 pounds Wow is a picture of him it's so ridiculous like you can't believe that a human could stack that much meat on the onto your skeleton yeah I wondered that if I just started really lifting lifting cuz I'm like I can't eat healthy foods I mean I can't eat shitty foods anymore and I don't drink and I don't do drugs they be I could get into exercise like how big can I get can I get fuckin you get big yeah you definitely get bigger it's it's you're an ectomorph which comes at all and you're tall and lean and tall it is one of the reasons why even though you were on that terrible diet not built like Ralphie May right or something like that you know like some people just have bodies that just they can absorb a lot of sugar and a lot of bullshit and your body obviously can do that yeah that's Ct Fletcher when he was three so huge that's what the fuck it was ridiculous do you know anyone remember the fighter Vinny Pazienza sure he's from Rhode Island and I was working the Providence comedy connection years ago and he was at the show we kind of met and then he was he was drinking a little bit and then after the show we were all at the bar and I think he was like kind of fucking around he's like I had a comedian I'm gonna come over there and kick that comedians ass he was kind of like I think he was fucking with me whenever but I was like terrified I'm a terrified human anyways and he's like yeah I come in there and beat his ass and then his girl that he was with was kind of like no and she was like kind of looked nervous where I was like wait is this something is this like a real thing and like everyone there was like ah ah he's fucking with you and then I was like telling the story later to like my fat my uncle and he's like ah he's drugged you fucking you'll be fine but I was like what do you mean he's like as older he's drunk oh my and I'm like at what point of me hitting Vinny Pazienza do you think he'd be like there's no amount of like ah he's a little older he's had a couple cocktails uncle's are terrible for advice but you're not their kid to like yeah you figured it out they give you like really abbreviated shitty advice yeah it's like a nice idea that I'd be like yeah you'll be able to handle I'm like no I think he would I think he would win he's the fucking champion of the world at beating people up yeah he was he's a bad motherfucker yeah it'd be a real problem for you yeah how drunk he was yeah I wouldn't have fared well it's uncles they're terrible with advice the uncles are always buying you beer when you're too young yeah those showing you things you shouldn't see yeah they're it's fun to be one yeah I'm an uncle yeah me too like you plan on shooting loads into the missus and having a real person no I'm gonna plan on shooting the hoods into her but I don't think so Mike my wife's a comedian as well and now we're a little old I mean she's old and I'm 37 she's 41 and someone's career has to be sacrificed quite a bit I think that's right head that's one way to look at it yeah and not like adds up right now which it could change anytime I'm making more money on the road like that's the majority of our money so it'd have to be like I I gotta keep going on the road right so and then we're in New York and you know it's hard to have a child yeah they're very expensive as you never very expensive in New York is a weird place to raise a child it's just weird I have friends who raise their kids in New York and like we love it the kids love it you let them gonna wander around the streets do they have it they go like private school and shit no like no they go to public the idea of like your nine-year-old on the subways terrify again like it was anxiety right yeah every moment I'd like my kid is getting abducted right now well you never know like you could get a subway where everybody's cool or you could get a subway where there's a crazy person you're trapped in a tube with a crazy person yeah it's one of the more interesting things about rolling the dice of the New York City subways that you're you're just entering into a closed environment where you cannot escape for a prolonged period of time with people that you don't know and most people are cool yeah most people just want to get to their job or their house or wherever they're going but every now and then like I I met a dude do you remember there was a knife attack on the subway where a guy had killed a couple of people and caught one guy up and the guy disarmed him from some moves that he learned and the Ultimate Fighting Championship watching it on TV no yeah I'm mad at me it's just giant cuts on his head it was really intense man yeah I would not I would not do well I would just be like yeah just cut me up myself well yeah I guess when you're when you're in that sort of life-or-death situation it just becomes your survival mode kicks in look you don't even you don't even know what you're doing right I've talked to people who have been attacked by animals and they say that it's just you don't you can't even imagine how reptilian your reaction is right you're there's no rational thinking at all it's like 100% just DNA firing the switches for you Wow yeah I was on the subway a couple years ago and I was like it was empty I was in like a back of the Train and there was like it was just me sitting there and then there was like a guy sleeping on the other end like he was passed out or whatever and then there's like six hooligan like young teenager like they were acting all crazy and they got on the train on that end of the train and they were like spitting on the guy and they were like wake up they were screaming but the guy was like he was obviously drunk whatever and they were like hocking loogies on him and stuff and like jumping up and down and so I was just looking at my phone cause it was like a it was a bad situation unpleasant mm-hm and then they kind of turned and focused towards me and they were like hey you fucking faggot look up look up from your phone and then I just didn't I kept ignoring them and then one guy was like I'm gonna kill you if you don't look over here and then the other guy was like I'll kill you if you keep looking at your phone and I was like shitting my pants and this is between Queensboro Plaza and Lexington Avenue which is a pretty long underground station it was like doing the thing where was like delayed so it's probably like realistically it was like four or five minutes but I was like shitting my pants and there's six of them they're probably like early 20s late teens I have no fighting train no weapon where I was like this is a bad situation like six people you're like I'm not gonna I have no six people's a problem six people is a problem I appreciate you said it cuz a lot of people like I would have busted up the biggest guy if we're never the fuck and you're like they're a tangle of arms and legs six people's a real problem the only thing that would save you though is that you're in a subway and what by that is they're not gonna surround you right if you just put your back to the wall right six people as they come towards you they have to kind of come towards you almost single file I suppose so yeah it's not a lot of room they can get like two at a time but you could crack one and if you crack one most of them will start to panicking most people don't know how to fight right smash one guy's face in and he goes unconscious and then the other guys are there and you start moving in on them they have this anxiety attack they start freaking unless they know how to fight and I doubt they do because people don't who know how to fight they don't do things like that right very very rarely do you run into thugs that actually know how to fight but that's the problem is no people know how to fight I'm one of those folks so the smashing in the face I mean I can I know how to throw a punch but I'm saying even for anybody even for a trained fighter if you're in a subway with six guys it's not good yeah yeah even if you really know how to fight if you're like a world champion you got to go god damn it because you could always break your hand with the first punch that shit happens all the time yeah it was unpleasant after that I was like maybe I shouldn't get on the last train at least give yourself a chance to go one it was early I was on my way to this show in the city it was like 8 o'clock 7:30 but Christ I mean I don't think they were leaving sure I think they were just assholes yeah just being wild or whatever while didn't I think is the term were they Italian they were not they were of Latino descent yeah I'm describing what I think a very PC no the way you said it it was clear you're demeaning I think Latino is good or is it his spent I think Hispanic is bad because it's in reference directly to Spanish so that Tino is better that could be in reference to lat tighter than that that's all they can suck my dick I'm tired of it I really oh yeah fuck you I'm trust trying to figure out what your name is all right Joe yeah but I mean that's a chance I mean you can't just decide that something that people used forever is all of a sudden racist like here's a weird one and I don't know why this is you can't say Chinaman but you can say Englishman hmm I think a lot of it has to do with because the Chinese were enslaved is that right they built the railroads yeah something that there probably is something to do with it but you can say Irishman and the Irish were enslaved oh there you go so that defeats that yeah I'm just guessing this is I got money Irish were not enslaved here I mean there's some Irish people that came over there did an indentured servitude I'm sure actually now that I'm I am reading I did read something about Irish slaves there were but in comparison to African slaves it's not even close yeah I don't know much about that Irish thing but I know that black people African American people get upset when you say but the Irish are enslaved yeah all I know is they don't like that shit yeah they're not into that yeah argument yeah it's terrible argument it doesn't seem like a great one there's not a lot of pictures of the Irish slaves that built America yeah I think a lot also came voluntarily or something I don't I don't know yeah my grandparents my grandfather on my father's side came from Maryland my I think my great-grandparents yeah imagine being one of those people from the 1920s it's like fuck it I'm taking a chance I'm gonna get on a fucking boat travel across the ocean like only like 50 years after pictures were made yeah it's insane I think about that I'll tell my watch Godfather Part 2 the whole time I'm like yeah go get a little buddy takes is the most powerful guy in the state so yeah whatever it's just there's no place like that now where people just can go well that's here still isn't it but it's not though it's fucking hard like it's hard if you're Canadian it's gift your cannolis get over here yeah and we're connected like they make it real hard for Canadians to move here yeah sure well I know a lot of Canadian comedians and they have to like Peru it's the whole idea is hilarious of a comedian trying to prove they're necessary in America it's just a comical idea they're like can you guys write me letters that says we need more jokes in New York I think we need more comedians always I think we are there's a finite resource of comedians well we need more quality never know like I knew guys that's sagt man for years and I used to have this thought either you're funny or you're not funny if you find you can get funnier right but I knew guys that used to eat shit well now they're murderers keeps coming back to Ari Ari was always funny he always had something like he was never as funny as he is now but he always had something yeah it was always like this guy's gonna make it yeah it is interesting when people kind of figure it out but I think a lot of those people they're trying to be what they think is supposed to be funny and eventually they figure out to just be themselves and that's how it kind of I think you're right like they're trying to do Seinfeld or something and then after a while somebody along the way it goes hey just tell the thing you said in the car right I got friends like that that never made that flip like friends from Boston that comics that have like the biggest disparity in funny offstage to funny onstage of anybody where it's it's puzzling where I'm like you're the funniest person I've ever met and you've been eating shit with 20 years and it's like why how does that not that used to be is interesting Joey Diaz the funniest guy I've ever seen I've never seen anybody funnier and Joey Diaz when he first started out I didn't meet him when he first started out I met him she's I probably met him four years into his career I met him in 95 I think or 96 and somewhere around then and he just couldn't figure it out on stage and then around 98 I was I used to take him with me on the road around 98 he just caught this wave and I'm time saying with in like six months he went from having rough sets to fucking annihilating Wow he also gained during that time at least eighty pounds maybe that's funny just didn't give a fuck anymore like something clicked where he didn't give a fuck anymore right he started eating whatever he wanted to eat he was partying like a madman and he would go on stage just just didn't give a fuck and he was so funny it's like he figured out the formula he was trying to do the actor thing he got sucked into that thing that we were talking about where you want to get on sitcoms you want to get auditions you're going out for movies and then he after a while he just got fucked over too many times and dealt with too many people and he realized he was like kind of tailoring his act for those assholes yeah I love those moments in any artist with music or whatever it is all as I know it's music and comedy really but when they fucking finally get into that in the rhythm of like figuring out who they are and what they are and then you're like oh wow this is special - yeah it's cool to watch - for like a person who's trying to do it themselves because you really you see all the elements and the qualities that they've sort of embraced that have helped them like the authenticity and the real thoughts and you know and what they they're honest self deprecation and all the things that you see that just sort of fall into place then you can kind of examine your own self right yeah maybe I can I can do that think about comedy I think like we we don't exist in a vacuum we all influence each other right now sometimes too much like people do the italo many guys to do that voice yes and it's ruthless when you see people doing like God you gotta pull them sigh and go hey man and I'm gonna tell fan to which right gotta back off the Attell voice yeah that happened it goes in waves - remember when I was like in the early 2000s it was a lot of Dane people were doing a lot of day and I was just say ad I was my term of another day in impression there'd be all these guys that walk out and they're doing they're holding the mic in an impractical way it works they're kind of low and doing his weird move it's like I think that's kind of his thing cute young guys and then trying to put on baseball hats everywhere they go yeah and they come up with their own way to do a handstand on the stool dan got mad at a guy once cuz he was wearing a Boston hat how interest is like that's my thing oh I'm wearing a Bruin shirt I hope that's okay are you from Boston I'm from Whitman Massachusetts I started there I was there for a year so yeah I'm from Newton oh wow yeah a lot of comics from Newton really well not a lot John fish I don't know if you know John oh he's a new yeah and then Louis that's three but three is a lot that's how I'm a relatively small town Newton's a weird spot it's like it's idyllic if you go there right now it's like aha beautiful little cute little sweet little town yeah when I was growing up there it seemed like a frozen shithole it was I think I could be wrong on this I think Newton was once labeled the safest town in America they had gone the longest distance without a murder or like I think they were basing it off murder or some crime and then shortly after that somebody was killed it was like that jinx did yeah they probably wanted to set the record yeah and this one was either person to break it yeah some was like like that and they hurt hurt but it's a good place yeah it's nice Boston's a great place to grow up but I think it wears on you all my friends who live there when I still I still have a few buddies that live there and I talked him like man how many more than winners I can fucking take yeah I guess win us I got a buddy that just moved to Q he's moving to Key West July 1st and he's like I'm tired of shoveling and it's a hard city people are fucking angry and the traffic and there's like a theory already complexes yeah it's a great place to I think influence you and then you got to get the hell out as a horrible place to date I never I mean I did date there but I love that accent you find a woman with that accent it's just it's a boner-killer it's not a pleasant accent on a woman yeah it's not good dude it's fun I hear a dude with that accent I said I'd be a good guy to drink with yes to him I agree this most definitely a double standard what accent are you turned on but it's southern yeah I suppose taxes yeah that's the best yeah Australian I like Australia I like an Irish Irish Australian women I've only had sex with two Australian women in my life but both stop bragging bro but but but both this is it what's gonna get worse both women individually requested that I come on their face so I don't know if that's an Australian thing let's have to call in an Australian woman must have something to do with the lack of sunscreen out there you know they have a hole in the ozone layer that's she's looking for a coating but a hundred percent of Australian women as far as I've tested like enjoy it in the mug yeah yeah do you think if you were a girl you'd like a guy to come in your face I'd talked about this before I I think if I was a girl I would being a fucking wild animal yeah I would becoming my eyes and yeah cuz I'm a man and I want cum in my face you know yeah yeah I think so I think I'd be a just too just running around yeah camping it out all the dishes everybody some something yeah some kind of disease and I got stuff to give them do this to you got a bunch of them I have I had HPV that goes away like I got me way HPV goes away no you still it does you shoot a dirty load into someone you can give it to him still well I think I believe that could be I could I got bad info from my ent pretty sure you did I had pre she keep that shit up I think HPV does go if you stop having sexual intercourse with different people oh but I think it goes away for you but I think it's still in your blood and I think you still give it to people oh we're interesting well so don't be lying to people when you're shooting now well I only have sex we just put his finger up I knew it just from the quick the quick response in most cases HPV goes away on its own it does not cause any health problems but when HPV does not go away it causes health problems like genital warts and cancer a healthcare provider can usually diagnose warts by looking at the genital area what a fucking a health care provider can usually diagnose warts by looking at them yeah you can also do that comedians can also diagnose warts you go oh that's a dick war interesting yeah I had that I went to play parenthood who do more than abortions they'll take your warts right off they put a little thing on there and boom here it says they're currently no cure for existing HPV infection but for most people would be cleared by their own immune system and there are treatments available for the symptoms it can cause you can get the HPV vaccine oh they have a vaccine that's only for young people that work too old yeah what does it do I don't know what do you don't know I did not get it oh god it just started giving it out recently I think in the last like maybe less than 10 years but you gotta be yeah you got to get it like before you're eight which makes you really horny that'd be ideal right I don't know if it cures it I guess it cures it but I had that but so it does go away did you ever hear about there's a story about a drug called re-equip and it was a medication for Parkinson's disease and galactose SmithKline lost a judgment in court I think it was in the tune of $600,000 American because it turned a guy into a gay sex and gambling addict all he wanted to do was hook up with guys online and gamble then and in but listen I know it sounds crazy but they lost the lawsuit like a pharmaceutical drug company lost a lawsuit and the jury awarded this guy more than a half a million dollars how did he prove that all he wants to do is fuck guys that's a good question but they did they proved it to the point where this guy won money because he never had any problems like this before took his Parkinson's medication and it just once short-circuited his brain he started sucking dick and rolling the dice I'm gonna sue Starbucks I've been drinking that tea and now I want to get came on I don't want to be come down something about their tea it's not organic there's a fucking roundup in their tea yeah something's up but I want some loads well they're starting to pass out lawsuits against glyphosate speaking of that roundup that that fucking that that shit two billion dollars and another guy got five five million well he needs a better lawyer alright cuz he got his lawyer got him five million the other people's lawyers got billions what is what's the drug oh it's not a drug it's roundup it's that weed killer Chateau weed killer oh I see yeah it gives people cancer and they're they're finally passing down these massive judgments against Monsanto Wow yeah the weight of it all C Mon town so jury hits its jury with the hits Monsanto with two billion dollar judgment but there was that one and then there was another one for five plus million that guy's got to be pissed right now fuck that I only get five million now to billion is that exact or are they rounding up count it you should open with that tonight at The Improv I will I'm Hollywood hey folks you hear about this uh this thing called roundup most people don't know what it is you know that's like serious GMO haters they're they're people that are like super organic don't want any pesticides in their food that's a one thing that people need to understand if you're you're buying vegetables and you eat a lot of vegetables it's very good for you but man there is a lot of fucking pesticides out there this is what's bumming me out the more I do Rick cuz I just always just ate garbage or whatever without thinking about it now the more research I do the more I'll read about because I like to read health benefits of the food I'm eating while I'm eating it cuz it makes it feel like all right I'm doing something good but then everyone at the bottom of the page like if you eat too much broccoli you'll shit your blood or whatever it's there's always something or there's pesticides or yeah you really have you heard of a carnivore diet you heard of that I'm sorry I said which is meat it's just me two steak and there's a lot of people to do it and people with autoimmune issues have huge reactions positive reactions really yeah my friend he was having receding gums disorder went away and they say that that shit never goes away he lost 50 pounds Jordan Peterson oh yeah he's on that carnivore diets been on over a year just got his blood work tested a lot of people like you shouldn't even recommend that it's so irresponsible and there's arguments both ways man there's arguments that eating only vegetables is irresponsible because large-scale agriculture is like terrible for the environment it displaces all this wildlife and animals and right they in most cases they're using something to kill the weeds in most cases they're using glyphosate or something like that yeah I mean now fruit to me is always like that's healthy and then people like our sugar and your whatever I burp fruits fine there's nothing wrong with fruit it's like everything else if you eat too much fruit if you like 10 oranges right your body so what the fuck bro but like if you drink orange juice that's not good because your body's like where is all the fiber like what is this what are you doing to me like why are you making me drink this sugar water yeah you drink a like a 12 ounce glass of orange juice how let's let's guess how many grams of sugar do you think is in a 12 ounce glass of orange juice I don't know I'm not good with this I would say can you give me some scale like how much sugar is in a coca-cola I wish I know fuck I'm gonna say hundred no no no okay here's here's a good scale like um like I saw one of those Gatorades but not a Gatorade it was a smart drink that had some fucking flavor to it or something like that you know but it was 27 grams of sugar okay that was like Jesus that's a lot of fucking sugar so I would say orange juice is more than that yeah I would say it's got 35 I'll say 35 okay I'll say 48 damns going crazy what do you say Jamie for some reason this thing won't do the math right but in 1 ounce there's 2.6 so times 12 that's roughly 30 because it's 24 times the 1 plus the 6 yeah some way 30 yeah they're not 48 though no fuck me yeah you're only supposed to look for a healthy diet I think they spot you're supposed to be limited to a hundred grams of sugar a day and that's for an active person like you really shouldn't fuck around with more than that right yeah I feel like I'm finally reaching the age where food becomes a situation you got to start to yeah it's a part of the problem now yeah as you get older body starts to fucking fall apart on you bro yeah my buddy John fish I mentioned earlier he has a story but he went to his doctor and his doctor was like in your 30s your body starts to break down and in your 40s your body starts to die and he was waiting for him to like smile or laugh but he was like just being serious doctors an asshole yes life right now is fucking her personal trainer guys super angry about it that's probably going on there yeah I think it's a bad guy he's a terrible guy telling you that your body's dying listen I'm a live bitch I'll fuck you up right now kill you yeah tell me I'm alive I'm dying good point fuck shut up shut up doctor doctor dickwad what kind of doctor is that I don't know but that's some truth to that though specializes in negativity ya know you're alive does it work as good as it does me you're 20 no does your fucking car work as good when it has a hundred thousand miles on it no but I think what he's saying is that we're on the back at the back end what he should have said is duh everybody knows that all right if you live to be a hundred at 40 you're fuckin half way there basically yeah good point and living 200 is pretty hard yeah if you live to 100 man you get you'd really did something yeah and most people are not gonna make that I'm gonna I'm gonna start trying to make it 100 I wish that there was a thing that showed you when you're dying what tip it over right yeah yeah well they're like yeah you had one too many cokes in 2007 yeah yeah they looked at all the time you jerked off imagine if like here's an accounting of every time you jerk you'd be like no I think about this all the time I wish we could do that cuz everything has all these stats now you know like baseball whatever I wish you could have all the shit's you've taken how many times you've wiped your ass how many times you've jerked off how many times you have sex mmm wouldn't it be fun to have all of those numbers it would why can't your phone do that it should be able to tell you how many steps you go the exact own to track how far run exactly so we should start doing I guess we could type it into our phone yeah you could you could add it up you could have like an app every time you jerk off you have to double tap it I feel like that would be a fun thing I just invented something yeah it could be a good app look how many times you jerk off in a year Jamie how many times Tinky driving eyes that was the Apple watch might know cuz when I'd lost my gun elliptical elliptical within two minutes sorry Lord you want to track this elliptical workout it's like whoa you know that motion of the arm moving is that what it is it's gotta be because they're just uh that's you know that's interesting that my zones heart rate monitor thing that we were wearing force over October that thing syncs up with my elliptical machine and it shows the heart rate without even me even holding on to the heart rate bluetooth though that's pretty right but it did it without me asking it yeah it just did it it's close proximity I know but it's pretty pretty crazy that it did that the fucking government man done done Tom are you worried about your phone being tracked no I have uh I for some reason I've never cared that much I know I should and people talk about it like the government watching us and tracking all the information I don't I'm too busy worried about you know dying and if people like me or not I just assume they are yeah I don't I don't it doesn't mmm I hate to sound like a like some fucking asshole that's like oh I'm not doing anything wrong so spy it like but I just don't it doesn't connect with me to be concerned about that yeah I don't think you sound like an asshole alright people some people were like well I'm not doing anything wrong we want to get the terrorists and blah blah blah yeah those people are assholes though the people that say that what do you care if you're not doing anything wrong that's about tyranny starts you weak bitch right meeting about weak Bonanno that guy I appreciate is fake guy fucking guns yeah like stand up for America Venezuela she was cool off first well bro they don't have any guns it's true actually yeah I mean they're running over people in the street cuz people can't it's it's hard to get guns in mines well that's another thing sometimes things just don't like I'll see that story and be like huh merit and I just you can't register everything there's no way you'll never get any thought done yeah Jim what are you about the story this guy and Holmby Hills which is like the Beverly Hills area oh yeah I heard about that he had guns more than a thousand guns yeah making some of them he was making them not all of them but did he do anything did you just like guns I don't know I said they decided to arrest my tip or something if they decided to arrest me and they said children has five bows and a hundred and fifty arrows like woo the fuck is he planning on killing right they could do that but those are more firearm sales I guess those are less alarming numbers to me though Bo's 150 arrows for a thousand seems like a lot yeah but I think it's one of those things you just get excited and keep buying them acting on a tip regarding illegal firearm sales okay so he's selling guns guns were strewn throughout several of the homes rooms Authority said it took about 30 law enforcement personnel more than 12 hours to remove all the weapons goals gun goals photos and videos from the scene showed stacks of rifles I have a buddy of mine who has so many guns he doesn't know how many guns he has that's impressive because I gots with jerking off yeah exactly same thing he's a jerks off to though he's a real gun nut like a legit gun nut like he does long-range shooting he goes enters into competitions and stuff where they shoot like you know they shoot out like a thousand plus yards I try to understand I try to be a good empathetic person I'm not a gun guy and it's easy to be like what do you need guns you fucking maniac but then I'm like I understand like I had thousands of baseball cards I guess you get they're not killing machines but I guess you get into something and then you're like I want this gun and then I'm gonna try to get another gun and then you get addicted to the purchasing of things yeah there's that but it's also fun to shoot them you go to a range like I went to arrange with Duncan Duncan Trussell who's basically a Buddhist and probably one of the most peaceful people I've ever met in my life and super brilliant guy and he's like this is so fun he's fucking loved it we loved it we shooting pieces of paper you know out a distance and clay pigeons and shit it's fun that seems like fun yes yeah it's also sobering like when you pull the trigger on a rifle boom when you see that bullet hit that paper you know like that is core metal to you hear clink you know when you're shooting at something it's pretty instant right instant yeah yeah I mean the that when you get to longer distances is kind of interesting because you pull the trigger boom and then you hear pink like there's actually a lag time right think what kind of distance we talking I've never shot anything further than like four hundred yards I think was the longest I shot anything at the range that's amazing yeah that's pretty long that's a fuckin huge range mm-hmm yeah it's four football fields you have to set your your scope for that or at the very least you have to understand the drop of your bullet it's all about how fast your bullets going if you had a pencil and a bullet right one in each hand and you drop them both at the same time they're both fall exactly the same speed cuz it's a rate of gravity so it's all a matter of how fast the bullet gets to the target right because it's gonna drop from the moment it comes out of the out of the gun it's dropping right so it's how fast is it going there is gonna tell you how fast how far it's going to drop so if you know that you set that use you can use ballistics an application you take that ballistics information you put it into your phone like 400 yards 115 grains whatever your bullet is you know 300 Win Mag whatever it is you enter all that stuff in and then it'll tell you exactly what to do on your scope and then you turn it and then think it'll go right in the center Wow yeah that's what those long-range dorks they love it they'd love it they love shooting things that are really really really far I think they're called snipers well that's kind of it yeah but they're not really snipers a lot of them are civilians oh they're just like they just have competitions Wow yeah it's crazy they have like a guy will be there with like super high-powered binoculars like you know fucking these big-ass scope binoculars yeah and they're like high left and they calibrate low right no calibrate we're just trying to like figure out like that film jarhead did you see that movie I did not oh it's good isn't that big Jake Gyllenhaal I love Jake Johnny - that's someone I would like to come on my face what did you see when he was in that movie when he played a boxer he got super ripped I did not see that movie but someone next to in the plane was watching it so I saw without did you get hard paring it I didn't know go look up Jake Gyllenhaal it was called southpaw yes yeah he got super shredded yeah he's great look at the actor come on son yeah that's something that is fucking jacked I mean that is about as shredded as a man got suck I worked hard to get that body now he's amazing he's great that mezzo deaq is one of my favorite movies Brokeback Mountain and what's the one with Nightcrawler yeah and then prisoners was great too I love that movie yeah he's been in a bunch of great movies he's an interesting cat he's good yeah there's certain people that like you just want to see them act in that weird yes you know like they just they'd have a thing yeah and then certain people that you like enough of this fucking guy yeah there's some people that are famous actors that you're like how did this guy again I don't understand what up some names decided this this Pacus is too big these people could be listening could be but yeah that's well you got it some people got it sacrificed there's a couple guys whose name I don't know but I just see him and then like my wife will just I'm sorry I didn't know he was in this and I'm like thank you this guy sucks and he's just a guy I don't get it you know but most of them are quite I feel like most people that are doing well are pretty good yeah and acting well that's what we would hope see this is a thing that's I hope comes out of this whole me to movement besides these criminals getting busted is that it changes the whole this like there's a sort of the way thing there's an ecosystem out here and I've seen it with women too like there was a woman casting agent that I knew that fucked all these men and would get them parts and she was gross and she was really aggressive she tried to fuck my buddy should try to fuck two of my buddies oh yeah she sounds nice to me I kind of like her foul all right everything's wrong okay yeah I'll take your word this is a long time ago she's probably dead it's probably at HP v and just died that didn't go away no but I mean I've seen it I've seen aggressive women it's not as many obviously but yeah but that people would be judged on their merits because it's and not just see it's not out here like when you're acting and trying to audition it's not it's just sexual favors it's also political leanings and like they'll ask you questions about things everyone everyone falls in line right with whatever the ideology that you're supposed to adopt in order to be accepted by this community like so they're they're really looking for people to say the right things and do the right things they want you to like it's not a coincidence that everyone in Hollywood is progressive that everyone in Hollywood you know is super liberal and super left-wing it's an act for a lot of them for a good percentage of people out here it's a fucking act right it's a thing that gets you attention and credit but couldn't it be part of it that I mean I don't disagree but I do think a lot of people that are naturally artistic they become open-minded and then they ended up going to places where they're very diverse and part of becoming progressive I think is meeting a lot of these people that are you know gay people and Muslim people and trans people and then you go these people are just like me bla bla bla pressive yeah there's a part of it there's that too but there's such a prevalence of fake humans that you gotta realize it like most these people have no opinions they're not real opinions what they're doing is they're just sort of spouting out this predetermined pattern of behavior that they feel like would be accepted yes oh for sure and I think yeah it's set up that way yeah like you said I mean I'm basically just saying what you just said well they just want it so bad I don't want it so bad yeah well that's the danger of being motivated by Fame and yeah it's so bad that's where I think of what helps a lot of comedians is it starts off the seed is not fame or fortune it's like I want to be as funny as I want to bring as much joy to the audience as I can and so as long as you can keep that you end up being a pretty decent person and a good artist yeah you just want to kill yeah the thing about there's some traps in that too right and this is one of the traps that leads to people stealing material is that you just want to kill you want to kill you want to you want to feel that feeling right so you it's not that you want the audience to have it so you want to kill right in the way you kills they have a great time but you will do that at any cost so you take other people's work and try to pawn it off at your own as your own you pretend to be someone you're not right so they'll like you more so that you'll kill louder I'm afraid someone's going to take this clip where you keep saying you and it's just showing maybe like I'm sorry this is like a calling conch when used to have that old joke he's like no one tells you the story and they use you as he's like you're telling me you sleep with kids and you think that's okay he's like not me I'm not the guy but but yeah that that is a weird thing that people do the desire to tell me you think it's okay to rob old lady yeah and I didn't say that no I know you didn't say that yeah but hear that part these fucking guys who rob old ladies but yeah that that definitely is up there but I try to be in tune with that - like in a meditative way of that like because you get so as a community it's so obsessed with just like the sound of killing wanting to kill it you forget that they're actually a group of human beings right right and then you're like you are the goal is to bring joy to the people that you're actually yes trying to get laughs and trying to feel the joy of providing joy as opposed to just like if I kill I'll get on TV if I get on TV I can pitch my show I try to kind of organically walk it back to the room in the moment of making these people here laughs that's a great attitude but I think New York is better in that regard in that there's not really a lot of industry right it's really just about killing it's just about being funny yeah well it feels like a lot of the motivation in New York is to kill so you'll get more seller spots than next week yes as opposed to I'll kill so I can get in the room with truTV or whatever right right right yeah you don't want that's a I'm hoping that goes away and I think it is that's one thing that's kind of reinvigorated the Los Angeles scene is actually the death of jobs believe it or not like there's no jobs for comedians anymore other than being a comedian right now because and also because of podcasts and the internet because people could put their clips up on YouTube and because people can do things on the Internet there is no longer like the really important stuff for your career is no longer held by these gatekeepers like the network executives that are constantly there they're never there anyway like if you have an if you get a approved by a network executive there's a real good shot that in six months that person won't be there anymore right right real good shot yeah that's like that it feels like in the whole industry so many Booker's you in comedy starting out you try to impress this book or get in with family or like kind of hanging out and like having a beer and then next thing no they're like in accounting they're not even in the business anymore the good thing about today those there's more camaraderie amongst comedians yeah than ever than ever before and there's more support amongst community cuz comedians do each other's podcast right and on the podcast you'll talk about each other and sometimes it's bad like how we're shit on Ari Shaffir cuz I'm fuckin really tired Ari aren't you I'm not you've known him a lot longer you know I loved as a kid but I mean it sometimes it is bad though if someone gets exposed if someone you know like someone does piss you off or someone is doing something unethical and you find out about it through a podcast but for the most part most comedians these podcasts are being like super supportive ya know it's the best I mean I think most things I've gotten in my career are from other comedians yeah yeah at this point yeah I think that's real normal and it's normal East Coast and West Coast and it didn't used to be like that there wasn't this like really super supportive community out there anymore but there wasn't always I think it's the podcast thing I really do because so many people have podcast now yeah well it's also contagious when someone does so much for you and brings you on the road and buys you lunch and tweets your shit you're like I want to do that for somebody and so then it keeps expelling for it's a good feeling it's nice to be nice to the nicest yeah it's a great feeling and you really get to know like our ease podcast one of my favorite podcast because he you get to know him in his podcast like he does these he'll do an intro that's 40 minutes long for a conversation yeah it's him stoned wandering around his apartment cooking salmon and talking about it and like and talking about this and that and something that sucks and this is stupid and that's great and you know it's like you get to hear him yeah no IRA is a special not to sound like a fucking fruitcake but he's a special human being I love that guy yeah I love about him more than anything is well I love a lot of things about him but he figured out who he was and got successful and when he got successful he gave zero fucks yeah once he got successful he's like okay I've got a couple hundred thousand dollars in the bank you can all suck my ass yeah he doesn't he doesn't compromise anything yeah and he takes care of people in a way that I'm like I'm concerned about your finding like he'll do a show and split the door evenly with everybody and I'm like you know you should take the money you sold it out you hosted the show you produced the show like I've done his storytelling show and he's like here's eight hundred and sixty dollars and I told like an eight-minute story and didn't even do great I'm like I'm sorry that sucked he's like whatever here's $900 and you're like okay like you could have paid me a hundred bucks it's like a Tuesday but that's the way he come my face right yeah exactly I'm not gonna swallow that fuel load but I bet I've produced a show with it we did a show together and that's when it fucks you the splitting the money or I'm like I don't want to fucking spy yeah that's true yeah that does fuck you especially if it's your show but now he's a he's a great guy we just went out and hiked in Mount Zion and is that Utah Zion National made the mount part up Zion National Forum yeah yeah I don't know there's a mountain falls at Utah in Utah yeah but he liked Nathan Angeli swear all the fucking has the wild like rock formations and shit yeah yeah it's pretty it's pretty amazing yeah but he got this like air B&B that was like seven bedrooms and a hot tub and he paid for the whole thing and then I got this reflux thing so we made all this special food and thank you guys that's us right there that's Mike Vecchio and my wife Sarah Tala mush and myself did you see any mountain lions or any crazy shit when you're out there we saw nothing crazy I mean it was it was beautiful and amazing but nothing and is beautiful that was the house he got it was like be it's like a retreat for like it did all these crazy drums in there and mm-hmm big fireplace indoor/outdoor it was pretty unbelievable you know the weird thing about Airbnb is you find like little fucking webcams where people are watching you 24/7 Wow that's the backyard that's the back porch yeah ah that view is amazing yeah it and then the next day my wife and I drove to Sunnyvale California we all said goodbye I was gonna do roosterteeth feathers oh and we went to the mall to eat and all of our shit got rough everything I'm wearing everything she's wearing is stolen we're this big like meditative Zion hiking three days together you just feel like man fucking life bro and then we went to the Cheesecake Factory I was starving I'm like I gotta eat something and we came out and a hundred percent of our luggage and computers were stolen out of your car yeah which I guess is an epidemic in the what's that called Silicon Valley really huge for San Jose San Francisco to the point where the cops were like oh yeah all right take care did they break into your car I guess they they went into the trunk but like I thought maybe I didn't lock the door but a bunch people have tweeted at me saying they have like fucking decoder things they can just get into cars Jesus they prey on rental cars because they know you have suitcases and shit they see that little no-smoking thing and that's a thing yeah so that after that happened we noticed every restaurant would go to would see at least like one business guy with a eating with a suitcase next to him we're like you got to bring your shit inside oh it was brutal Silicon Valley's a weird spot because you have all these really rich people and then you have a fucking army of homeless folks yeah I mean that feels like America and getting more and more that was somebody was telling me this Jamie find out this is true because someone was telling me that there's a woman that I know that lives out here and she was saying that they bust people bust them in from other cities they take their homeless people and give them one-way tickets to Los Angeles I heard that was Hawaii is that what you said no oh I heard that happens in Hawaii they fly them to Los Angeles a good move if you're in Hawaii good luck in to take it back you fuck yeah but it's a but if your boss someday can always back yeah they're on the same piece of ground right it's not as effective it's a good place to fly them to Hawaii I should just send him back yeah yeah save a lot of money I think this had a few jumbo jets get one of them a 37 as it tends to crash and make it a I think if she's making a knight like a fucking private like a Air Force one where there's like food and you know foot massager and then they're like oh wow this is gonna be great and then you're like no it ain't yeah fly them into Molokai that's that that Island that these two send the lepers so there's an article I just found that was done by the Guardian in 2017 seems like a pretty long in-depth article it doesn't say they're being busts specifically to Los Angeles but this one the example they're giving is purchase a ticket purchase to this guy by the city of San Francisco and I think this was sending him to Indianapolis so he went why 2,300 miles the other way how weird is that that should be so illegal to not take care of your homeless problem but rather to send them he traveled 2,000 275 miles over three days to reach his destination in Indianapolis and then freeze to death you know how did you go from San Francisco to Indianapolis you don't have the proper footwear that sucks cities have been offering homeless people free bus tickets to relocate elsewhere for at least three decades whites that is gross well if you're just offering them a ticket yeah but it's it's not so bad until now there's never been a systematic nationwide assessment of the consequences where are these people being moved to what is the impact those programs are having on the cities that send and the cities that receive them and what happens to these homeless people after they reach their destination well the best example of that was that wild wild country documentary oh yeah yeah I did I mean they took over a fucking town with homeless folks yeah that was one of those ones every cult thing I watched the first like half hour I'm like this seems pretty nice yeah this sounds kind of Awesome and then slowly you're like wow maybe it's not a poison to people fuck it was Scientology was like that yeah I was watching like a half hour and I was like I kind of am into this religion which one going clear the HBO difference right Alex yeah Alex Gibney I think yeah it's Lawrence Wright's book y'all can't go and clear yeah the book is even more because it gets obviously like way more into depth about how crazy l ron Hubbard was and what he essentially did and how he started this whole thing and he's he was self analyzing he was trying to heal himself because he was fucking crazy right and along the way he got really into psychology and self-help books and then was quoted saying if you want to make real money he started religion and then started a religion yeah well he's not wrong he was right yeah did all right this is right watch this graphic that they used on here I don't have to scroll down and make it activate but it's it shows their data showing all these homeless people getting sent around the country whoa just like a little dot so they're sending them from Los Angeles in New York primarily look at the loads little sperms by year I can't show the whole graphics because it was crazy yeah it's like what is that burst is that burst from was that Southern California it looks like San Francisco this is San Francisco be up here this would be LA like San Diego but Florida seems to have the most started in Florida this graphic starts out in Florida Wow would that make sense it's Marines I think too is around that time period when they got smashed yeah I like the idea I like ones passing each other though like it's two homeless guys passing each other like ships in the night here's where you don't see him land Texas Texas doesn't give a fuck does it shoot you they'll shoot you they have a hole for homeless people why not like Wyoming they don't have enough people up there bears it's fucking it's hard to live up there they're just not interested in taking in your homeless yeah that's a you know when you but by the time you get to be a certain age and you're homeless I guess you just have to accept the fact that this is just life this is the life you've you know yeah it seems unpleasant I enjoy having a home personally me too I like it end it yeah I like going in there I recommend one with a lock yeah that's the best so you could sleep yeah do you like living in New York I love it yeah but I'm on the road so much that it's idea where I'm like I'm never home for really more than like ten days which with New York is ideal you ever think about moving on here not I mean idea the answer is yes but I don't think I will because I'm like a road so la it's tough because you're behind the eight ball with the time like most you're three hours behind most of the market so for flights yeah so you gotta get up at like 6:00 a.m. or leave the day before and I like the Comedy Cellar I like being there I like doing those like quality spots and you can kind of do multiple I'm my family's in New England I like going home to see them do you work when you're in New England as well yeah I do laughs Moss great spot yeah it's cool yeah I'm there at some point no but like Thanksgiving it used to be a hundred fucking comedy clubs in Boston there's to be so many and now there's just laughs Boston and like what else there's the Wilbur yeah the Wilbur economy stop still around NYX is still around yeah that's crazy that that place is still around yeah that's been there forever but I just work there thirty years ago that's amazing I worked there eighteen years ago crazy yeah but yeah the comedy connection was like my home oh he did that one famous all right yeah that was amazing that is that where you started yeah I didn't start I started a place called chops lounge which was like a true open mic where it was like street people and fucking many people that had been bussed in from San Francisco it was like a sign up and go on and there'd be like a mixture of comics and then just weirdos and so I started there and then I went eventually the comedy connection I started working there but that's where I first started opening for people and doing like real comedy work and it kind of spawned from there you know I mean it's weird for us but you know where it's really weird for it's really weird if you try to like do open mics and you're like a singer yeah I don't know how that works doesn't work well it works terrible yeah it was comics that would go to like music open mics I mean there are music open mics right I guess I went to a poetry slam open mic nut once I've been to comedy shows that feel like poetry slam where you're just like what I heard there's a lot of like really ridiculous sort of like woke comedy being performed yeah definitely there's a thing where it's now become oddly hacky they don't realize that you're like well this is now hack right where you're like for white male privilege which I'm like yeah I understand it's an issue whatever but you're like seven other comics started their sentence with that same way let's say that about me saying sex jokes were white male privilege is only a problem because of racism and because of sexism if racism and sexism are out of the picture it's not your fault so your fault you're a white male right the problem is that some people are not white males if you're a black woman and you encounter prejudice everywhere you go and discrimination everywhere you go the problem is the discrimination it's not Joel is being a white male they've fucked the whole thing up right because they've really created resistance where there should be none because you've made people perpetrators when they've done nothing wrong like you just were born a white male you got unlucky the same way or you got lucky I should say depending on your perspective I mean they didn't ask to be born a black woman someone didn't ask to be born a Polynesian man you are well you are you just you are the real problem is people that care the people that look at you and go oh it's a fucking white man great that's what I want the opinion of another white man like that is the real problem the real problem is that sexism that is what racism we're gonna think it is because they think you're white and you have white privilege but you're discriminating based on something and someone has zero control over I agree it's fucking horseshit yeah I feel bad I was like I'm just trying to tell my dick and shit jokes and get my 25 bucks and get out of here yeah but that's like like I said it people can look at my act to be like he's talking about dicks and shit I talk about all kinds of things sometimes dicks and shit too though yeah well those are funny discussed well dicks and shits are funny often yeah I have to like curb myself from having um I got too many shit jokes now this is like 12 minute you got I got a few I got a chunk but it's funny you know but it's sometimes you just get on a run where that's what you're interested in yeah well also once you have a bit that's working you want to extend it and write other things about it so then that's the way it goes I had a time period where I had like four bits about aliens yeah I was like goddamn this is too much you almost once you get to a certain point you start go well can I just go all the way and just do a one-man show about aliens right to the Edinburgh yeah I'll just be the alien guy yeah I bet you could you could be like like have a slideshow behind you yeah SETI research the fucking the big dish that you seen that movie contact Jodie Foster yeah I'm not familiar with that movie well I'm familiar with I never I wasn't into it you didn't see that never been a big alien guy no you know believer I feel like this is the kind of place where you could produce an alien thing comes and rapes me well I could show you the aliens but you're gonna have to not be sober oh are you you're a fully sober guy yeah did you suddenly a not sober guy yeah I was a yeah were you a mess I mentally I felt like a mess I mean I wasn't I never killed anybody or anything but I was a I'm an alcoholic yeah I shit in the girl's shoe and girl shoe what'd she do to you nothing just invited me to stay at her house I don't remember doing it I was in a black yeah I was all fucked up and then I woke up and I had to piss so bad I just woke up in a bed and I was like I got a pen I was like let me I don't know where I am I actually had a flight I had a cross I was going to the Seattle Comedy Competition do you ever do that no it was like it's like a month-long competition why it's and yeah and it's not they call it Seattle but it's like actually all over Washington state it's like a you drive like three hours and night it's pretty crazy really yeah but I had to like be there the next day for a month I'd like a 10:00 a.m. flight and I woke up at like 9 20 in the morning and this girl's bed and I was like I gotta get the hell out of here but first I gotta piss is if I piss in this woman's bed it's gonna be it's gonna be horrible so I ran to the bathroom found the bathroom pissed for like a half hour you know those and I'm trying to like put my shit to get my I'm all fucked up and then I came out into like her living room and her table had been like smashed like a chris farley fucking table and you're that feeling when you're fucked up weird look at something and you're like that was definitely me I need just feel like I'm pretty sure I'm responsible for that and then I was like I gotta go find my clothes so I went back into her room and on the way there I saw like kind of like footprints of poo and then I came in and she had a high-top Nike sneaker that just had like a yeah and there was some little pieces around and then there was like a big puddle of urine till like I didn't just because you never just shit so I like pissed and shit but I got it in her sneaker like no purpose well I think I mean I was in a blackout so but I think what happened was I thought it was a toilet because I felt like my sense of humor I'm not like I've never been like I take a shit places so I think I just saw a cylinder well if it's dark it looks it's black and it's a hole how big is her fuckin choose real big feet it was it was a big woman no so I shit in there and then what did you lose contact with her after this no sevens I was like I gotta get out of here cuz I gotta go catch this flight so I took my sock and put it on like a like a puppet like a hand puppet a sock puppet and just kind of pick it up that way and then turn the sock inside out right which like like almost like a shit in a sock and threw that away and I tried to wipe up as much of the she asleep no no they're gone oh my god I thought it's like 9:30 in the morning I thought I just went so crazy they all fled their own home so then I get in the cab to go to the airport I'm missing my flight and I text the girl and I was like I am so so I want to kill myself like I can never do you tell her that I should know well I figured she knew so she wrote back it's okay it was it was crazy crazy night it was fun or whatever and I was like man this girl must fucking party like she's just like okay with me shitting like this woman's wild so then I got to the airport flew across the country miss my flight I got the next flight out on the plane I like cross my leg at one point and realized I had shit like up my pant leg so head it's like subtly put it down now we had a middle seat for a full cuz I miss my door outside of your pond outside of my pal my shit just like a good streak like I would say ankle Danny he didn't go to the bathroom and try cleaning it up no cuz I was already on the plane I was in a middle seat and I it was like caked on there Oman this is like hours later oh my god so then I landed took the plane at my phone off of airplane mode and had a text that was like holy shit we had no idea how bad it was and I was like that makes more sense that is a better reaction yeah cuz I thought they must so the crazy part is I shit it was like 9:00 in the morning they had left shortly it was your shit yeah they didn't have a dog and I see they don't just shit in their own shoes but then I was late so I had to go straight to the show and I ended up shit on your pants yeah yeah I with shit my pants and my leg it was like cake to my leg hair and it was the first no I don't think anybody smelled it I don't think they noticed cuz I think it would been I don't know no one said anything Joel this is fine but guys shit so then I finished I took a shower finally like twelve hours later I was actually I remember pulling little piece of shit out of my leg hair it was the best shower of my life it felt uh how was your set good I killed and I ended up winning that night because they each night you judged I came in like first place it was like one of the best sets I've ever had that sounds like a real comedian show but shit on your legs and you win a competition but fucking kill I love it that was pretty spot and then I ended up sending this message to these women I have the message it was on Facebook so it lives forever but it's about like this law it's like a 12-inch it just keeps going I'm like I want to kill myself I know this happened I really wanted to die and they were luckily they were like 22 they were like fresh out of college so they were like pretty lol forgiving yeah but they were in the 30s I wouldn't send you a bunch of crying emojis no they were just like laughing yeah that's my favorite one so I sent 300 bucks in a called my friend Nate bargatze and I was like how much is 300 bucks like a good amount and he's like he's from Tennessee he's like I don't think there's an amount you can spend so I sent him a card with 300 bucks and I didn't really keep in touch with them but they were they were nice they were like hopefully you don't get that fucked up again and then by the way I drank that and I kept drinking for two more you think that without him and then I remember that night being like well I'm gonna drink again at some point as well so I drank for like two more years then I got herpes I tried to stop then too and then I just kept going fuck it yeah and what made you hit bottom I finally just live fucking hated myself I still do a little bit but not as much and I just it wasn't fun I knew I had to quit it's like same as food at some I'm like at some point I got to stop doing this isn't a normal amount of drinking and then it just fucking it kind of happy I tried to stop a couple times and I'd go like a few days and and then one day it was just like a thing of like let me I'm gonna this is it I'm stopping now I remember my brother in law his father had just died it was Christmas as I was like making it you know when you're drunk trying to be funny and I was like busting his balls about his dad and he was like yeah I'm upset I remember just feeling like such a fucking piece of shit and then I remember like kind of the day after Christmas I was like I kind of just blacked out Chris like I came home and I was like I don't even remember what the fuck and I was like I gotta stop and then I was at feel helium in Philadelphia and I slub yeah and I was with Gary Gulman open for Gary Gulman also my career was like kind of shit I was like 16 years at 15 years in or actually less than that twelve years in I guess and I was like I gotta do something I gotta turn this around so now I just stopped and I got fucking really into it into sobriety and it's like a new life if you're like oh everything feels new again and fresh again I go back to this I'll get into sports again I'll go to museums you're not tired all the time yeah I know you just feel better you have the feel better things huge that's that's the problem as you're tired all the time like wouldn't you if you drink a lot you're always like a little bit behind the eight ball well I would lose days of my life cuz I just hung over a felt like shit and then I realized for basically a decade I was drunk or hungover or just foggy like where you turn your head and it takes a moment for everything to kind of like catch up whereas this fucking foggy mm-hmm and and just like that deep hatred and I knew I had to go all in and like I got a I can't I'm not a guy that's like I'll have a beer and I never had that even now when I think about I've sober almost seven years six and a half years even now when I think about a drink I'm not like that'd be fun to have a beer I'm like I'd be fun to have fucking 500 beers right now yet out again yeah so and then the problem was you know when you quit drinking so be like the first 90 days they're like just don't worry about anything except for not drinking just eat whatever do whatever and so I started doing that with food I'm eating cookies and so and then I just never started so now I just did that for years with food and now that's kind of caught up to me what do you do you think now how many years have been sober now about six and a half so you're just sober now you're cool with it yeah who you are yeah imagine if you did a show called joe liske gets fucked up or it's like you you have handlers to make sure you don't shit in anybody's shoe yeah you have everything taken care of and you go look I haven't had a drink in six years but I'm sober now I'm content being sober but for tonight and tonight only we're having a one night Joe list gets fucked up special yeah and you just started a bar and start getting hammered I think I would have to perform early and then I'm out doing a show no no no the show would be just following you around with cameras well you get blasted okay because if it's a show I'd have to do it early oh yeah I'd have to have like two beers cuz then I'd be sobbing and be like ah my fuckin is now it was so bad no time zero that's the motivate one of the motivating for me there's a lot but like the idea of going back to like day one it's like such a which happens and it's part of getting sober then people don't want to disparage people that are having that happen but like it's such a bummer to fuckin walk back in there and be like oh one day happens of course I knew a lot of guys who had that they would get sober fucked year dive back in and yeah I went a day well I tried earlier I tried to quit drinking and then I was like oh I smoke pot though cuz I don't know and then you realize with wheat like I'm like oh I'm outside of my mind this is the same as I'm fucked out like we get high enough you're like well this is not sobriety I'm fucking retarded right right right was it was your thing just not being in your mind getting outside of your mind or was your thing blacking out and ruining your life because the thing the only thing that's good about pot is you don't feel terrible yeah well I think I have like that addictive personality so then I'd be hile up but now it does seem like more appealing because nowadays first of all it's like you can go to store and there's a guy that's like this weed makes you feel happy this one chills you out this one makes you gay this one's great like before when I was I just have a big weed guy but I get drunk and smoke and sometimes you just smoke some fucking crazy demon weed and be out of your mind it was just whatever weed was just weed now it feels like there's categories and shit dude I did a b-real smoke box you know be real from Cypress Hill I died I do now I know Cypress Hill what be real is you know the guy would talk raps and the crazy high-pitched voice dr. feet oh yeah I did his smoke box and you get in this Cadillac and you smoke weed until you are no longer even a person you are just you are a thought that is like a cork that's flowing down a raging river headed to a waterfall like you are so fucked up yeah and you're trying to have a conversation and you're being filmed and these guys do that every day they just there's people that just get up litter eat it every day yeah I think that sometimes weed people don't take it sick it's like it's just weed and it's a it's natural whatever but sometimes there's people that I'm like yeah but you're fucked up all day every day yeah if you have an addictive personality and you have a problem with anything there's a lot of people that get into that kratom stuff do you know what that stuff is mm-hmm kratom is it's like a plant-based I think people are trying to call it an opiate I don't know if it's technically an opiate but it's legal you can buy it and helps people it actually alleviates a lot of the symptoms of opiates and it acts as a mild stimulant when you take a little bit of it like if you take two pills it's like a cup of coffee it's like oh I like this is nice but then I said I wonder what it's like like and I was asking a friend of mine who takes a long time ago how much do you take and he's like I take 10 pills 10 you take 10 like what the fuck is that like so I did it I tried it I think I took 8 I don't think I took 10 and I was fucked up I was like oh you guys are getting high yeah like this is your hi I'm Rui right now like this is not like you're not sober don't tell me you're sober and you're taking eight pills of crazy like that stuff gets you high right you can buy it legally but it's weird high it's like everything functions like your muscles and your arms and everything moves the way it's supposed to it doesn't feel like you're uncoordinated or you're tripping and stumbling or anything like that but your brain is like this is not sober it's just like screaming this is not sober but it's a different kind of this is not sober interesting yeah you're not you like I could have a conversation with you and you might not even know that it was fucked up on this stuff right and I could go lift weights I gonna go do something you wouldn't it wouldn't impair like you go running on that stuff so it's like a heady buzz or like a body to anything right it's a head it's a weird one like I was really shocked at how high I got hmm because that felt like because that's what someone said they said if you take two pills it has a mild stimulant effect somewhere two cup of coffee but if you take multiple pills then it becomes more of like like like a downer or not another downer more relaxing more like an opiate right but I didn't realize how fucked up you actually get like you get pretty fucked up and then you get a tolerance for it so that a lot of these guys are taking like 10 pills then going to the gym no like oh I need it for my back I'm like you can't blast it yeah that's like that was booze and all drugs it feels like you kind of chase that yeah thing I mean that's yeah yeah well that's the thing right it's like we were talking about with smartphones or like we were talking about video games like things get a get away from you yeah that's part of the problem being a comic right like all of us there's something wrong with your brain to want to this right yeah I think there's definitely some sort of desire this is some attention you didn't get somewhere something wrong you're upset about it and so when you're not on stage or when you are is you're trying to do something else to make you forget about that yeah attention or affection you didn't get somewhere along the line yeah it's a fucking if you can harness it though like that I didn't get enough attention you can be super beneficial it gives you insight yeah it'll give you motivation if you can harness it yeah it's interesting to go that sort of self reflecting and therapy or whatever that whatever your method is or people do it with mushrooms or whatever but then introspective of like oh those moments when you're like I'm doing that because of that hmm that's neat yeah then there's the next step of no longer doing the things you don't want to do because of that or the habits that you have and the next step you go to the rhabdo center and malibu start doing acid where's Maui Duncan Duncan goes to Maui every year hang someone Rob Dawson Wow they meditate that's it so yeah people come from all of the world to meet this guy and meditate with him yeah that's pretty amazing I listen to I love dick not Han you know that guy no oh he's a he's a Buddhist monk I think he's about to die I think he's like in his 90s he hung out with like MLK back in the day now okay nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize he's written like 70 books he's a dick not Han it's th i CH space Nhat where is he from he's from Vietnam but now he's been in he's been living in France for like I don't know 30 years he's got his own Meditation Center but he writes all these books and those videos you can find do you meditate I do I tried I tried sometimes I just I'm such a fuckin anxious guy that it's sometimes hard but I've read him a lot and jack Kornfield that's ticked on huh you know ninety years old he's close he's in his old picture problem rate but I also yeah I mean he's a he's a real Zen master so yeah so maybe he's gonna live forever or some shit and then Tara brach I listen to her but he's old as fuck now her dad that makes more sense I'll listen to her like guided meditation I'll do that but he's an app I just heard her podcast has like a she does these guided ones so not an app in a podcast and that sometimes I'll just sit have you ever done a float tank yet no I let your guy I don't know what you producer I guess was showing it to me but I feel like I'd have a fucking panic attack in there you need just open the door anytime you want okay and it's not like it closes you in yeah it seems Tara feel the door just go like just like that just touch it gently open it's nothing that's good to know yeah but no I've never I've never done it I should but yeah I've had panic disorder throughout my life and I just for the first time in like a long time had a couple panic attacks last week for the first time in two years yeah what was fucking with you I think a lot there's like a well first of all doing this show is anxiety numb now I feel like we're just bullshitting I'm just trying to pretend there's not that's how it always is lesser of people this is I'm glad that you got there cuz when we said in the beginning we almost didn't start you want to tell people you were telling me that you were kind of anxious I was let's just talk let's just uh we're gonna disarming but oh I'm not trying to be I appreciate it I appreciated the you are but I think a lot of it is like you know this is a huge show and then my wife was doing late night last night and then I'm on the road with Louie and you know he's this I have a lot of my biggest fears are being like you know you've disliked and wanting to be you know these people I'm a people pleaser as many alcoholics are so I feel like uh you feel like you're in the fire in these controversial situations and the bigger audience the more people are breaking down what you're saying and being like what's up with this fucking guy what is it like doing the road with are you doing the road with Louis now yeah well we've done a few dates I've done a few dates with them it's great as the protest died down and there was we just did act me Minneapolis I think it maxed out at eight people outside so but for the most I was like four or five did you say hi to them no I just walked by I mean I respect them doing their whatever they're doing but misguided yeah you know what what I was really angry at I was really angry at comedians response to his leaked set that was very angry about that yeah it was strange but I think people get pulled up into this thing for some reason there's a thing now where everyone thinks they're supposed to have a take on everything mm-hmm exact no matter what happens they're like I better come up with a tweet or my take or anything not actually necessary people ask you you why don't you have a take on this right why haven't you tweeted about this right like there was a the Christchurch Massacre happened and I was reading about it and I was like god damn this is fucking crazy and I'm reading about this and this guy was a white nationalist and it said hi to pudy pie before he went and killed all his people I'm like what the fuck like what is this yeah and then I never checked my mentions and then I just was because I was on Twitter looking at all this stuff I saw something that led to something that someone tagged me and then I looked at my mentions for a second and like how come you're not talking about Christchurch you racist piece of shit like it just happened yeah and I don't have a take like what the fuck am I supposed to say rest in peace like what does what does anyone want you to say when a massacre happens this was horrible everybody knows it's horrible yeah it's a weird thing now if you don't denounce something and people you're like then you're on you're supporting it yeah and you're like I'm just trying to with me there's been situations we're just talking to people if they don't want you talking to certain people because those people are right-wing or those people and if you oh you must be secretly white right-wing right I'm not I tell you I'm not yeah I don't you believe me it's a weird thing like I'm a liberal gyres call myself a 90s liberal before everything went sideways yeah I'm not like whatever you know woke it's happening yeah yeah I'm a you know yeah Alyssa Milano is calling for a sex strike yeah I saw that look well that's what you do when no once you fucking you anymore yeah start saying crazy shit like when I have a stick between us have a strike ladies you're gonna hold out like that and Tim Poole had the best take on that he's saying so men who agree with you won't get laid right like what it doesn't even make any sense like but the idea that it's it's the same thing we're talking about earlier they've lumped men into this category like women are gonna go on strike until we respect their reproductive rights within Georgia first of all it's just Georgia you want to strike for the whole country that's not gonna help Georgia I don't know if you understand voting but that's not how it works there's state politics local politics second of all like most men don't have anything to do with this now we have men meetings where we get together and say hey we got to stop these women from dope they're exercising their reproductive rights right like what you're punishing a bunch of people that have nothing to do with this because we also have penises like what what's the thought process there this is so but it's such an obvious virtue signal it's so obvious this is like pussy hats the woman's right we're gonna do this we're gonna do this but and then we're gonna we're gonna sex strike and a bunch of her friends probably like yeah this is gonna work like this is not how to handle things it's not us I've never voted against women's reproductive rights right if you're telling like my wife she can't fuck me because if she does she's not down for the cause like what you're orchestrating everyone's sex life that's crazy yes just gonna make people angry at you it's a little strange and I'm like that's that guy's that guy's an asshole can I still get laid yeah nothing he stinks no you can't and the you know abortions such a fucking creepy subject too because it's such a minefield like if you're a man and you even talk about it like first of all why are you talking about it has nothing to do with you it's a woman's right to choose and a woman's body like okay I get it yes but it's a thing so if it's a thing you're allowed to talk about a thing right and this thing happens to be a fetus that could become a Jo list or a Jamie Vernon or a Joe Rogan or who it gonna be a person I think is going me Vernon that guy right there oh hey Jay young Jamie so that if as the fetus grow it will become a person no I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to terminate the pregnancy I'm not saying that but that is what it is it is it's going to be a person and to pretend anything else it's like they don't no one wants you to discuss it that way like no one wants you to say that this is a viable offspring it's going to be a person someday no one wants you to say that it's just oh there's a code word it's like a woman's right to choose just like these these ways of describing it which I agree with them I'm not a pro-life person Oh pro-choice person right but when it gets to be like five months old and then people are saying well that's just a woman's right to choose okay okay it is it is it is but that's a baby now but that thing could live outside the womb but isn't there isn't that law and I don't even read that with Georgia law but isn't I don't know the Georgia law but like this thing with now they can late-term isn't that specifically if the baby or mother is in danger no no not everywhere in some places it is in some places it's not in some place you just have the right to have an abortion up until a certain amount of time and I think it varies I don't think there's a federal guidelines I think that's one of the reasons why Georgia just instituted this six week thing like their thing is the moment the child is a heart break the heart beat and that apparently is six weeks in right sometimes people don't even find out they're pregnant until seven eight nine weeks in and they're saying they have to carry the baby yeah it's a fucking minefield yeah it's a hard and like many subjects people want it to be just kind of black and white yeah but we need to have a sex strike to soothe this out yeah that's what it is girls we're gonna go on a sex strike how many women read that and like yeah none I want a maybe maybe a few thousand few crazy bitches just out of there far and a few men like yes please take it away from me please let me show I've hurt you let me show my virtue yeah I imagine it's a small amount imagine being her husband which is a cool now sex strike that's it sex strike and she sees the fucking the Twitter post and she made a poster for it like with the little fucking pink ribbon and shit like good Christ he's probably like it just he's probably talking to his lawyer like what okay what would I lose okay if we let if I left right now like how much would I have to pay like what if she can test that okay and then how much of the legal fees how many what is this like an average amount of time you have to spend in court it's all men they all did it no sex for any man until we get our rights well it's a very similar I mean isn't that the mindset of racism yes exact a similar mindset of like how someone was murdered at least you know six guys in the train were yelling at me exactly no more Latinos on the train yeah a hundred percent it's the same things generalizations and the idea that you have anything to do with other males and it's even crazier than racism because it's like the whole gender it's the whole gender it's like not not just like just white guys suck no it's like fucking everybody sucks nobody gets any pussy right for until we sort this out yeah but I but do you think maybe a part of it is just that what is this Jamie oh this is Bridget my friend Bridget call me but you know what's funny is yeah she liked it Alyssa Milano liked it that's a good joke she's got and she's funny Bridget fantasy is very funny but she's got to know that was a ridiculous thing to say sometimes you swing any miss just like sometimes you have a joke that you try out and it bombs will fuck this joke yeah I've been on jokes where I'm like oh no one even realized an attempt at humor had just been laid those are like oh sorry you know what's weird when a line kills at one show and then dies at the next show no I swear that's the same joke yeah it's crazy sometimes bits just work for like weeks and then go and then they stop and you're like what the fuck happened here I think it's your enthusiasm for them yes that's part of it yeah and it feels more fresh at the beginning and yeah you start faking the funk and the crowd starts to smell it yeah you don't give a fuck about the subject they can smell it on me what movie is this they can smell it on me sure is that dog can smell it anybody what is it there was a Tim Roth in Reservoir Dogs Oh I do one impression and it's Tim Roth and Reservoir Dogs and that's not even great because he's got British but he's doing an American accent so sometimes it kind of sounds weird they can smell it on me that's what he's in the drug deal oh yeah on that story that was a good fucking movie I loved that movie I met Quentin Tarantino he's an odd fellow he's a wonderful artist but yeah he's a little bizarre it's very odd but he's a fantastic director but he had all bombshell with him oh I was like to be uh oh the woman this what that guy looks like to be with with her like wolf boy did you figure it out okay I'm not gonna do impressions so will you pissed off when that Louie CK recording got release and comics were denouncing it yeah I was weird I mean it's a bummer looking first of all people a lot of people were like these aren't even jokes he's not even joking anymore and you're like no no they're jokes like I understand if you're don't like it or you're offended but you're like they're definitely jokes he's on stage he doesn't really think that they threw a fat kid in front of them and right that's not how he feels he's saying something that's fucked up and funny and it's funny because it's fucked up because you're not supposed to say it which is the exact thing he's done his whole career right and it's a new bit wasn't it supposed to be bright part outside of it wasn't done and for these people look there's a lot of times you'll say something one way and then you're like that's not working and then you'll figure out another way to sneak in through the back door and it works way better and then if they heard the first way and like this joke sucks like no no I figured out I say it later but now it's already on YouTube you've ruined the material yeah I mean he dropped the bit because it's just kind of like yeah it's okay too much but I had a fucking hilarious line if you want people to forget about you jerking off make jokes about kids getting shot yeah there's also a funny line where he's like why are you in a suit which is funny but yeah and then people were talking about how now the parents have to hear this and stuff and you're like well they weren't going to you took it and put it out in CBS picked and put it on CBS so now they're hearing it but before that there was just a hundred and eighty people in Long Island hearing it and yeah which thought it was supposed to be but the thing about working on material is if you like comedy you can't release people shit like that because you're never going to get good comedy because everyone's gonna like everytime Dave Chappelle does you know work out set or anybody you're gonna get these half-cooked bits and then you're gonna release them and it's gonna ruin it for you it's gonna ruin it for you for the people that listen it's like for the people that are in the room that's for them right if you're taking it out like there's been a lot of talk about Louie making this copyright thing saying that you know that there was a legal action if you print or you do anything to record or do anything to put the material online right and someone saying he can't do that I'm like well why can't he do that did you know the difference between that and music like if you go to hear someone sing a song and you write down the lyrics go oh my god Gary Clark jr. has this amazing new song here's the lyrics that doesn't ruin the song right but if you say oh he's got this hilarious joke and the twist is he says this well you just fucked that bit up for everyone that's ever gonna listen to it read that right yeah it's a it's frustrating it was a frustration when there people start being like he's all right now he's gonna do people are goddamn crazy but the comedians that denounced it we're embarrassing so I do you not know what a workout set is do you understand this guy was out of comedy for almost a year do you know that this guy was doing a fucking hour after being out of comedy for almost a year fuck you stop pretending that what you do is different stop in and so many people were doing it like it turned out that they had a bunch of jokes that were awful or about a mass shooting or about pulling your dick out in front of someone or about anything along those lines it's also a bad precedent to start where I'm like do we really want to start publicly shitting on comics unfinished bits exactly that seems like I don't want that no list at fucking cellar and he's got this hack then you're like Oh give me a moment or tell me behind the closed doors that like this hacky or something how long is your a bit ready before like do you have a Comedy Central special you have something right I did it Ivan Netflix half-hour and I did a Comedy Central half-hour okay so how long did you have to work on those bits before you were ready to put them on Comedy Central or Netflix quite a while I like to do a bit at least three months before it's somewhere yeah yeah yeah and it depends on the bit right some bits are pretty fucking good a couple weeks in yeah and other bits I've got a couple bits of my act now I'm I'm like this motherfucker needs an overhaul and I don't even know where to start yeah I've had bits that I did done for two years and then you finally find a line you're like ah there we go that's it and then you're like now it's more of a bit exact because it takes it takes time to figure it out and but yeah it's comics should but I understand people people hate Lou and they're gonna hate him so whatever he does or says they hate him so don't believe it you know what I think a lot of it is I think people are justifiably upset at the idea of him jerking off in front of women that didn't want him to here's there's a couple factors that though one is that he asked you know yeah it's a weird thing to want to do jerk off in front of people but he asked and a lot of these stories the way you're getting the version of it it's like worst case scenario it's like he blocked the door he didn't block any doors okay you know and they were laughing like people were joking around like it became this traumatic thing years later talking about it after the fact but then on top of that it's like God don't you think the guy has suffered enough like when when is he suffering enough you you see this lack of empathy with people where they don't even want to respect that he's a human being they don't they don't want to appreciate any of his old work they don't want to they don't have anything that he could do that would make them just go alright well I know you're not gonna do that again and you seem like a reasonable person it's like we like you can't be your past you're not the guy who shit in that sneaker right your Joe list today Yeah right yes he wants to be remembered for the worst right thing they did it's and it's I think it's just a thing where they know it's an easy target I really do I think at a certain point in time people just decide that this is a guy that you can take a free shot at and you can shit on them and you can attribute things to him that aren't true you can attribute tribute a bunch of things to him that are not accurate right and it's easy like like calling them alright or saying Louis CK's showing his true colors now Jesus Christ go back and watch his bit about hitting a deer okay it's a fucking ridiculous really funny material and that's what I enjoyed about his act right this that that bit if left alone I mean it's an out of his act now but if left alone in X amount of time he would have crafted that into a great bit I'm sure of it yeah I agree and there's so there was a bunch of shitty fucking half-assed comics that came out and we're talking trash about it and I was like you guys should shut the fuck up because this this whole art form is about trial and error this whole art form is about being able to work it's one of the rare things that we need a crowd to in order to for these things to come alive we had it and you have to take chances I just saw ironically with Louis I went we went and saw Apocalypse Now during the Tribeca Film Festival and Francis Ford Coppola was there and he came out he spoke about the film beforehand and after hmm and Robert Duvall was off also there he came out and went charlie don't surf it was amazing and it was really unbelievable but Coppola was talking after the film and he was like I don't have you know the whole story about Apocalypse Now that documentary hearts of darkness which is amazing and like he put like his house up for sale to like or put everything on the line to make the movie himself and he was talking about you have to take chances with art he's like there's no art without taking big chances yeah and I mean that's you're taking a chance by doing a joke I mean I wouldn't do a joke about the fuckin shooting but I wouldn't either but but you know it's it's a risk and it might go bad and it went well he got laughs yeah it got laughs but certainly if you take anything outside of comedy comedy club and put it out in the public it's not for those peoples for the people that bought the ticket well it's also in context of the experience of being in a comedy club having a couple drinks watching a hilarious I talk some shit especially a guy coming back after a national scandal worldwide worldwide scandal yes you know and it's just look I wouldn't joke around about them getting shot either but one of the things that made that bit work was that yes it was a horrible tragedy yes those kids went through that yes they're teenagers yes they're trying to figure out life and they're being interviewed on CNN and some of them were changing their opinions and and they're developing and growing as we speak but like one of them like that David hog guy he wrote fuck the patriarchy on his Twitter the other day like that was his tweet like and not even as a joke like that's an 18 year old that's what kids do yeah they say silly shit that's why the bit worked right I was like why are you interesting right you know like why do I have to hear from you but well you have to hear from them because their friends got shot me but no one obviously like that's not you this is not a conversation to sustain the comedy it's an art form and saying things that are funny that are fucked up that's part of the art form if you deny that you just either you that's like not the kind of comedy you like or you don't appreciate what comedy is yeah and also it's a weird thing where I'm like I'm for those kids yes that's great like this horrible thing happened and you're like we're gonna use what power we have them like I think that's great yes and they might actually fucking do something I mean it's like they're making changes and I'm like it's like fucking power to the people god bless you but I can still laugh at a joke about it it's still funny to me to see someone be like why are you in the suit you can both things can exist you can have empathy for murder victims and even be like rooting for me like wow that's amazing what these kids are doing or he's dead Joe and still be like that's funny it's funny it's it's not his best joke but it wasn't done you fucks and here's the other thing like do you know Brian Holtzman is I don't think so got to see him when you're in town if you can he's fucking hilarious he's a legitimate maniac he's okay a legend in Los Angeles started when I started The Comedy Store in 94 he was already there and he's really fucking funny but he had remember when susan smith drowned her kids that lady she pushed her fucking into a river or something and drown her kids no but it sounds silly he was on stage a very short amount of time afterwards going ladies and gentlemen I heard those were bad kids he goes I heard they sat that close to the TV they never put away their blocks there was spilling their fucking milk those kids will not be missed yeah and you were just like it's not he didn't really think those were bad kids yeah it's a fucked up thing to say that happens to be funny yeah you might not be into that kind of humor that's okay well that's part of I think what comedy is or has always been is saying a thing you're not supposed to say that's me the very idea of comedy yes is you're saying abnormal things right like you talking about coming in your own face and or someone coming in your face yeah you're not supposed to express your sexually desires so openly it's not it's not that you really mean that I do that's funny right right I think so right it wasn't really funny it's an art form that is often cited or quoted as if it's a statement you know like he said this like yeah he said that onstage in a comedy club as a part of a big giant chunk about this and you're taking out of context and you do it in the worst possible way you put it in print of course it looks terrible yeah course looks terrible in print because it's not in a comedy club but it's not in context it's like that has no relationship to the actual bit itself you're a print version of it it's not it's a lie you should go to jail for saying that's the joke you're a liar you're a liar you're defaming someone you're taking what they're doing and you're pretending that what they were saying is what they mean right you know that's not what they mean that's I don't care remember that Lenny boots and this in the movie Lenny I think what he talked about they were like reading his act yes but you're not saying it right exactly it's the same thing it's look no one thinks school shootings are a good thing no one does no no one does they they're doing jokes about it because we know it's a horrible tragedy that's why jokes work and they don't they don't work because you mean don't work because you're horrible they work because everyone knows you're joking if everybody really thought you were horrible person and you were happy that people get shot they wouldn't laugh at a goddamn thing you said right that's it's a it's a fucking weird art form it's a weird art form and for it to be dismantled and disrespected the way it is where people are what people break down people's bits and and take them out of context like that it's it's so foolish and the fact that people don't stand up for it that are in the art form itself that drives me fucking crazy it drove me anger there's a bunch of people don't even talk to anymore I'm like I'm not talking to you anymore like this is what you're gonna do if I do a bit that's half cooked and and then you're gonna talk shit about me right like this you're doing this for your own favor you're not doing this for the art form you're not doing you're not an empathetic person you're not looking you don't looking at him as a human being saying well clearly the guy fucked up he made some mistakes and it was good but look that if you listen to that set that's a good set especially for a guy who's been out of comedy for almost a fucking year yeah it's gotten a lot stronger I'm sure he's a hilarious comedian I mean he's gonna get to a point where he's got a real motherfucker of an hour and then someone's gonna have to figure out whether or not they're willing to take a chance and put it on well take your time but earlier to me can also just put it on YouTube his website or YouTube yes yes I hope he does that you know I mean this idea that he should be punished for eternity it's like it's what are we Catholics like what's going on here like what is this do you know what did he do I mean he did something that caused wound up crossing him 35 million dollars a massive public shame still to this day more than it's almost like two years later was like a year and a half now yes November 2017 yeah what the fuck like what do you want them to do you know I mean we're not talking about Harvey Weinstein here and this idea that you're you know the you not even supposed to compare offenders you know you're not supposed to make judgment calls well of course you are that's why some people go to jail for life and some people go to jail for two years and this is this is the reason why we have lesser punishments for lesser crimes right right yeah there's a system yeah please if you ask people if you in front of him and they say no and you don't jerk off in front of them good for you you got some restraint if you ask people if you can jerk off in front of it and they say yes and you do it like maybe it's a weird thing to do yeah but you're not Bill Cosby okay to say that you're not supposed to make these comparisons it's like this is a loaded subject - right we're talking about this and I see you're nervous oh yeah I'm terrified but ya know I love I love Louie I love Louie - he's a great comic yeah he's a great guy also but yeah I understand people are upset I get it I get it but I think it's disproportionate I really do you know I have a degree yeah hardly but yeah how long do you think it's gonna be before people just let it go well I think I think there's actually uh the group feeling that are really upset about it I think it's probably like a quarter of a million people that's a lot of people it's a lot of people but there's like 300 million people in the country maybe it's less than a quarter of a million it's I don't I think it's the minority so you think most people like ah he did something crazy but the other thing is like you want to kind of see the guy who joked off in front of women so people want to go see I mean the shows I mean I'll read Twitter and stuff sometimes I'll go on a little hangout and I'll just search his name to see I mean one time we went out to eat in New York and there was a kid you know like a hipster he looked similar to me actually uh-huh but like a young kid and he stopped and just like stared at us and was like I think started taking photos and then he left and then I looked up Louie's name on Twitter and I found the kid yeah and he wrote just all caps just gave Louie the finger which he didn't and then he wrote you signaling and then he wrote attention NYU students there's all caps louis c.k is in the neighborhood make him uncomfortable exclamation point we were like that's like psychotic you're a but that's what I was talking about earlier that I think he's a target and I think they just decide that this is what they're gonna do now and yeah like that guy was saying that he gave me the finger when he did and that's the virtue of signaling aspect of it it's one of the weirdest parts about social media because these people that ordinarily like in a real world scenario you have an opportunity say something if you really feel so compelled the guy's right in front of you you don't say shit and then you get online and tell other people to do it right are the people to make them uncomfortable well for the most part yeah well we'll go around and it is everything is it's the weird thing about online most people are much different in person because you realize it's a human being I think the natural thing is like oh this is a person exactly and then you know we'll go to like these kind of hipster e coffee shops where you think that that kind of person would be and there he goes hi how are you can I get a cot and they go oh sure yeah that nobody how many people get dirty looks and stuff yeah their clothes there's way more online than then not online but that's a shows the shows are all selling out and there's a few people outside does he ever talk to those people Outsiders you just get in no I don't think so how does he get in this kind of a back don't we sweat in the back and you know good for them I think that they're misguided no she said but yeah I I think they want him to be this evil person they should be protesting against but I think if you look at it on paper what he did was just not good it's like it's it's you know the worst that I had heard was that some people's careers had suffered because they were talking about it alright that's someone but I don't know how much of that is accurate I don't need to find out about that yeah I don't I don't know either I don't know the whole thing I always feel like I love Louie he's one of my best friends now which is weird to say but we're close but I don't really begrudge the women I think that two different people can have the same experience and take different things from a few different ways mister and I understand sexuality is weird so like they could in the moment and his perception might be well they said yes and I think he kind of talks about this a little bit on standing I don't want to tell his feelings were stories to tell but I think one person can be like I thought they were into I thought they were saying yes they're into and those women can say can feel yeah we kind of said yes but we felt fucked up and pressured to people can have the same experience and have different perspectives so I don't horse yeah but grudge getting the women I understand that they are hurt and feel mistreated even if they say yes you're still and you see something you didn't want to see like whoa and then you can never unsee it yes like it's in your head yeah I understand they're affected by it but but your table in front of you know I keep asking I'll do it no no I asked them to committee me he has to ask first maybe that's his thing now maybe I initially I blew it maybe you have to like pretty shy yeah so you know what I would hate if you jerked off on me see like drop hints yeah yeah maybe I will but he's but he says he's a good person and a great dad and I love him I love the guy yeah everybody wants to erase everything he's ever done so like didn't FX like not just cancel it but they made the show unavailable yeah I think you can get on iTunes but yeah it's done and then I think he's still on Netflix though yeah but yeah you can still see but they cancelled the new one that he was gonna do yes and then pets too they'd really got rid of him yeah so it was a bummer but it's weird with people I mean shouldn't we be empathetic to all people yes I think we should and I think you know maybe it would serve him if he went out and talked about it extensively like it had a conversation about like maybe video tape did or something I don't know like people had his take on it other than that little letter that he brought right after it happened yeah maybe that would help yeah which I thought was a good apology a good statement I thought yeah some people will never be happy and some people were happy with it and some people just felt like it wasn't enough that you know who didn't specifically say I am sorry you know I feel horrible I'm sorry I did this he basically said he did it and those stories are true and that he fucked up and he thought that they you know he thought that but them saying yes that that was okay but meanwhile he took advantage of the fact they admired him yeah and he's very yeah yeah he expressed regret yeah well like but like you said just come people are gonna be unhappy no matter no matter what no matter what even if he said I am sorry that's not good enough you're only sorry because you got caught like people they're always going to have there's some people that are just not empathetic and this is what what I really got very angry about with the the the leak of the recording my cats not his best material of course it's not even it hasn't done comedy in 10 months like when I was hearing it from other comedians I'm like do you how do you how do you do this right don't you do the same thing we do right like what are you doing he's a fucking person he's a human being he's a year and a half of him being stared at everywhere he goes yeah and fucked with he gets it and losing friends yes I'm sure yeah but he those friends if he lost some friends he's better off if he lost friends because of that like if that was Ari I would call him up like if there was a New York Times article about Ari jerking off in front of people I'd be like bro I'm a little hurt you never jerked off in front of me I wouldn't I would if he Sai got fucked up like I've had conversations with Ari about things where you know he's like I fucked up I should've done that was a bitch move like he'll tell you yeah you know like you can't do anything like you've once you're my friend like let's you're out there murdering kids or something or doing something really fucked up or actually raping someone yeah any friends of Louie los for that like come on man what did you think do you think it was a perfect person he's a nut it's a maniac goddamn professional comedian right right you know yeah we're flawed people yeah that's how it all comes out good it's like there's got to be something fucked up about your head where you can come up with these and another one that drives me crazy is these guys who you know are freaks and they're out of their fucking mind off stage but on stage they have like sort of a more squeaky-clean thing and their public thing is more squeaky clean and they're judgmental about it like oh my god like please stop you're fucking crazy as anybody you just have a good squeaky clean act so shut your hole yeah sometimes I think the people with the cleanest acts are the wildest animals it's often the case yeah it's often the case yeah which is fine man like perfect samples Brian Regan in a good way he is so fucking funny and so clean the funniest yeah you go this guy's gotta be fucked up there's got to be something wrong with ya nothing with a super normal friendly guy nice to everybody great guy the nicest guy what is in your dungeon sir what time we were hanging out and he was smoking a cigar and I thought it'd be funny to say hey can I get a little bit of that cigar that's such a ridiculous and he was like oh sure and I was like what I'm kidding I wouldn't put my mouth on your cigar but you would enjoy it yeah that was strange and a blunt you deal with a blunt which is kind of half join half cigar yeah maybe actually I'm the asshole on this story maybe he's not even that nice it's just as normal no that is a weird thing to ask a cigar feels very personal to and you're like it's yours for like an hour exactly yeah actually it's just kind of a quick well yeah joints to hits like if you have a whole joint yourself you're greedy yeah it's also there's like a camaraderie thing that comes from smoking joints together yeah agree yeah ready right here chest over there that's a full chest filled with weed wow isn't that uh can you get in trouble for that no it's legal but with that much couldn't get you four in ten distribute or something no it's legal here really case yeah marijuana is legal but like guns are illegal that guy had a thousand they but that guy had illegal sales he was selling I got yes I say they got tipped off that he was a dealer he's probably selling it to gang members and drug dealers and such oh no oh Tom do you think about having just a little weed just a little it's a little touch but would you just go start shooting heroin like immediately no I don't think I would do that but I don't I don't think weed does not as much excite me or anything what does drinking yeah I mean I drank I mean I still I joke about it like I love my sobriety but like one and a half vicodin and three beer was like the best I've ever felt in my life yeah and like a cigar what I went to Baghdad I did like USO thing with Nate bargatze and we had like we bought Cubans and I had some vikon I took like a vicodin I don't know if he did I don't want to I don't think he did but I'd like a vicodin we had a couple beers and a cigar we're at Saddam Hussein's palace and in the moment I was like this is the best I've ever felt did you do stand-up over there yeah what is it like doing stand-up for the troops over there it was fine it was amazed the most grateful audience they were like so nice and kind and it was really cool I mean some of it suck because someone was like 2:00 in the afternoon and there's like 12 guys it's fucking a hundred degrees they're holding rifles being like what the fuck is this that was the show a couple of them yeah some but some of them were like the ones in Kuwait we're better because that was like not a war zone and you're on a base and they'd be like a hundred people but some of them were like just in the middle of the 11 o'clock in the morning in the middle of fucking Baghdad Wow but it was pretty amazing like we got to fly on these Blackhawks and we were in Baghdad we went by the post cross swords and stuff where the statue was pulled down and shit what did you do when you were in Sodom Hussein's palace that became like an American base we stayed there Wow yeah it's kind of a DIN Sodom Hussein's Powell yeah yeah I don't think I did I think Nate and I shared a room and I asked he said no I would have to I think I'd feel compelled I'd be like bro you're gonna have to leave the room I got a I got a goal I got to check something off the list it's it's a bizarre feeling cuz you know we like it was like yeah we took over and then just made this palace into him face and there's like a driving range you can like hit into like his prayer pond or whatever whatever the fuck it's like reflection pools got a prayer pond filled with golf balls yeah that's hilarious and they sell Cubans and like the lobby America yeah we're somewhere were we are fucking something yeah but now it was amazing it was awesome one side we were on the Black Hawk helicopter and they shoot flares out for whatever I can't remember why on every flight but they didn't tell us that so all of a sudden you just hear like and you feel the heat and I thought we were in a fucking battle like I almost shit might be like it felt like you know you don't have to shit and all of a sudden you're like business shit I could shit right now yeah it was that feeling your body tries to evacuate anything in there because it thinks it's in danger yeah so like with spiel we want to be able to run let's get on yeah yeah when you get really nervous like that that's that you immediately have to piss and shit yeah I just took a huge shit right before this show did you use the little buttons on the toilet to shoot water up your asshole it wasn't here I was afraid you'd beat me up if I should so is that the Starbucks you know who did do that James Brown when you that's one of the ways he got arrested he shot up someone who used his toilet oh shoot out with the cops not which there's a picture of him his mug shot right out there and was from that arrest Wow yeah yeah I should at Starbucks I was at the Starbucks across street by the way and homeless cooties I was in line and like a dude a white dude with a skateboard just cut in front of me in the line is very bizarre and I said what I'm in I'm in next and he's like can I just buy some gum he was buying Starbucks gum which is already a red flag and I was like I guess I mean I was in LASIK I'm I didn't even work in five minutes whoa what a dick I didn't know you could do that you can't do that all right I don't have to be anywhere should we talk to you like that that was early but yeah he looked at me like I was an asshole yeah he's a dick I was like maybe you shouldn't be buying gum also maybe you might want to find a different means of transportation than a skateboard yeah you're late fuck yeah you're fucking late loser I'm gonna be at work in five minutes and I need gum what do you do do you talk clothes for a living yeah a fucking jerk-off he probably listening he does nobody does didn't know where I was going didn't know he's probably I'm so sorry bro yeah I didn't want to get knocked at work get in trouble man yeah it was last time you had a job 2007 which this I worked at Sears I did loss prevention oh it was amazing it was one of the best day jobs ever really well my cousin was the boss which helped and he let me work from 10:00 to 6:00 which is great comedy hours mm-hmm and then we were like plain-clothed i guess just uh oh so he just walked around busted people stealing yeah it had like a little radio on the the belt and then we had a crazy camera system for 2007 like it was I think we had 82 cameras and you could zoom and shit you just watch people all day and then you'd walk around the store and be like we to keep an eye on the camera 1100 CE like a secret agent it was fun it was really fun and we got to stop shoplifters and shit it was amazing I missed I actually miss it it was really fun Wow I used to work for a private investigator and similar yeah it was it actually turned out it was one of those people where you meet and you go this guy should be a comedian he was hilarious name is Dave dull and he's dead now and I keep a voicemail message from him just because he was such such a character he was just such a fucking character and he was hilarious and he got a DUI and they took away his license and what he really needed was not an assistant you needed her driver so I just had a good have a good drivers license so but I was working as an assistant and then we became friends and we bus people mostly people that were stealing insurance money they were like doing things like pretending they were injured and they take another job on the side and then would catch them we'd have to get there like five o'clock in the morning and wait for them to get up and go to work and then follow them take pictures of them and shit that's fun it was fun gig yeah was fun it was real fun too because he was actually cousins with Bill Downes who was one of the owners of the comedy connection bill nobody downs that's it yeah me too many times and that was Dave was his cousin so it's like just dumb luck I became friends with this guy but from driving him around and his cousin was the guy one of the guys that owned the comedy connection well yeah I loved working at Sears it was fun I feel like comedians are actually good at that jump is where yeah I prepare and we're doing a lot of judging anyway so you want you like an audience come in you're like that guy's gonna hate me this woman is too drunk that guy's fat right and I think it's similar to chocolate you like something's up with this guy well it's also like it sounds like a job that doesn't suck like you can wander around no one's telling you what do it's not like you're stuck at a fucking desk going over stupid numbers or something you don't give a fuck about yeah and it's low maintenance physically I know guys in New York that are like movers for their day job and I'm like you can't have a fucking manual labor job like you get up at all carrying couches like you're not gonna hit an open mic at 8 p.m. you're gonna be exhausted yeah but I loved it and having your cousin as the boss is great I streak through a Sears at the my last day you took your clothes off I yeah we decided well I didn't want to I couldn't go naked because it's like a sex crime so I covered my face with a brown paper bag and bought like a candy thong necklace at the home I can't a necklace the candy thong at Spencer's gifts and I wore that my buddy just sent it to me I hadn't seen it like 12 years it's a sex crime if you take your clothes off yeah if you run through naked yeah hilarious that's a sex crime so I was like I better have no clothes on which is how you are naturally born you are a walking sex crime I get you can't have people running around naked it's do a minute wait a minute but why not what is the problem okay if a woman walked through a store naked do you think she should go to jail I don't think she I just think I would assume she has mental problems I think she just likes to be naked if a gal goes through a place like maybe you're at Target and some some gout sighs take off her clothes and walk as far as she can through target before they arrest her yeah are you in support of her being arrested and taken to a jail and hit with a sex crime no I'm not in support of that but I there's a lot of things that rules in laws that I'm not in support of that it seems like it's okay if a guy gets arrested doing that well it depends on what he's doing I suppose so I feel if a guy's running around naked maybe just running and jumping around inside target yeah that guy's a criminal I don't know is he harder that's a good question it's very interesting it's a hard yeah he's hard he goes straight to jail well that's like a right to the electric chair that's what particular sexual but that does cock yeah yeah it's electric condom what if he's got all his clothes on except for his cock and balls and he's just he's just riding out you know he's got a just coming out of the antenna rule in San Francisco like you can't walk around naked you just can't have a hard-on that's really that's what I just heard Bryan Callen say that much Google that Google that we need to find out this true in New York I know in the park you can be naked I think naked you can walk around topless I've seen a couple of women women are allowed to go topless because men used to be able to go well men could go topless forever but there was a rule that said the women couldn't and women are like well this is bullshit and they're right and I think a lot of them didn't even want to be topless right but they were like well this has fucked up people telling us that our nip like Sarah Silverman Sarah Silverman just posted on Instagram of a photo of her mirror like her bathroom mirror you can see her tits in the mirror she did it on purpose to like make a point like why first of all she did it because she has great tits okay I just want everybody to see your great tits anything they're pretty fantastic I've missed it I'm bummed but also like why is it okay if you could see my tits why is it okay to see my nipples but you can't see her nipples like what do we babies I agree that's free the nipple I'm for it Instagram is really hardcore on that but Twitter you could do porn yeah they'll have porn on fucking Twitter there's porn olds I follow porn stars they watch them fuck maybe some porn you think so yeah why not I got a dick you do have a dick yeah that's right here yeah it's nice do you think that you should be arrested if you just walk around naked if I was making the rule I don't know it's hard because it's uh it's on what you do with it if you'll rub it on people yeah yes yeah and kids kids point you and laughs and you go home that's the thing it depends I mean there should be adult areas where you can walk around naked I think the nude beach yes they have those they have those yeah but arrested I don't know I would just assume someone is a little off mentally I'm walking around naked where our society norms worth so yeah I don't think so it sounds like a guy Society sounds like a horse that wins the Kentucky Derby says that they changed the public nudity law in San Francisco and like 2013 I think but we were there when you shot your special and a hundred percent I was at the top of Lombard Street and there was a large gathering of naked people so oh I don't know what the fuck that was about nonsense so there was they didn't get it's not there's cops right there they didn't stop them from doing anything like pictures of it so I don't know what that was about what are we gonna do I
