round two you dirty freaks you stream dot TV for it / oh all right we're back um so crash you've been doing this you've been this tank business longer than the fucked up no I didn't you've been in this tank business longer than I've known you you when when did you get started making these fucking things um it's about 15 years 99 and what would brought you into that well yeah I think it was with me I was ready to choose to have a ASAP nightclubs and I was in the music industry and I'd uh you know narcotics I was into drugs and stuff I'd like to do that for you know but was it the time was in you know in the 80s and stuff and there's a music industry used to have night clubs I used to do management and then I wanted to do an audio later on back in the seventies where the Stevie Ray Vaughan stuff like that blues clubs in the DC and then we went on like in the 80s and had like you know Culture Club the rhythmic sand everywhere we count bass and then later on he went into audio at Caesars and I worked the showroom in there and I were the Liberace and as a on and on is in a different genre whatever you know shows from then I we used to tour a little bit and then these gigs and then I got a band going there and we used to open up for one of the bands I was touring with and then we three guys so he had interested in like Oh an hour to make some be in this make it doing music and got these studios and had 60 of those in Hollywood and then finally uh I was done you know I had enough of these people he's strung out on heroin and United right so they uh I've had it not a functional though I'm not a stealer I don't steal I'm a functioning guy back then and I don't steal and I work and I do jobs but I used to get I just like to really get high you know as I was part of what that you know what we did right but so I was finally done with that and I kicked the dope whenever we went on out there to Vegas from Hollywood left my buildings and I built a recording star anch out there ten miles south of town built a studio and there's my guys come out when to do some recording out there at this ranch I got there and I'm in the back there I just built it at my head now no there was a good old water thing from what the horses were getting water from or whatever it was I had my head in there and I was working on my voice and when I pulled my head out all of a sudden I I know I'm supposed to build these deprivation chambers I don't even know what is a deprivation chamber it so you have you had like this idea Jamie keep take this down off just go with the screen so we could just see those those photos around before I get distracted sometimes well yeah yeah yeah yeah um so you just out of nowhere had this idea wasn't even an idea yeah it wasn't an idea cuz I don't even know what it was so just hit you and oh my god boys light or nothing it was just all of a sudden I had my head in that thing I thought and when I pulled my head out I knew I'm supposed to build deprivation chambers and get ever people to do it I don't know what is a deprivation chamber or nothing I just built a recording studio I got no interest I'm already doing what I want to do I don't need a change of life or I've quit doing what it was that was holding me up you know so I was on my path already but it hit me so hard and at that moment I was relieved of all my previous you know like I had a you know you think back it's all I used to have this I used to have that I'd build empires and then collapse them over the years you know I'd write work worked worked really hard and then because too much fun wrecked it every time you know so I'd been through and at that point in my life is saying bummer you know I kept thinking about now I'm starting over again and whatever and at the moment when I pull my head out there this no longer affected me at all none of my past was so you lean into this thing that they used to hold water hold water for animals horses probably and you looking in there and you pull your head out and all of a sudden you have this mandate you have to build sensory deprivation tanks so you essentially got a message from God I don't believe in God listen pal he was talking even if it wasn't God who was it was I don't believe it anything I don't know what it was I'm confused it can does indicate though some sort of superior but think about them into the chain of events that happen now you create that thing you know you you you improve upon the existing dynamic the existing design rather in a substantial way you become obsessed with it you and I get hooked up we make videos about it we start putting it out you're doing a podcast now more people are finding out about it more people are opening the senator I get every time I go to a town like it seems there if it's town it has a sensory deprivation tank I get these offers to come stop by and check them out and say hey we started doing it because we heard about it on the podcast it's a great way to make a living we love floating we love the benefits of it we just want to thank you so much that happens all the time in the movie man you're in the movie is it because what happen happen and what's going to happen is yet to be because what's coming up still is is is much larger than what's happened so far with tanks with these chambers right we think they're going to be every we don't think so I'm pretty well sure of it at this point because I have a I have a realistic vision of the situation and I'm convinced at this point that indeed it is going to work you know and I don't know how it all is going to turn out of course but I I think that we're having a chance now and that's why this situation is so important to me this this disinfection and this electrical and all these these features that have to do with health and safety this can become a safe healthy and a just like restaurants just like anything else that involves cleanliness this is very important it's a public service and then for you what's important is that it protects the benefits of this service where all the negative aspects of it are eliminated with foresight we're thinking about it in advance and I think that's super important and I really really commend you on that and you also have these really fascinating ideas about how to go about that I mean your your your systems of cleanliness and although the ozone the filters and the the UV the sensitivity of the filters it's all incredible stuff incredibly detailed stuff yeah we've spent a lot of time keeping getting better we're just now finishing up with a whole nother bunch of stuff too that it's one thing after the next thing I see when I first started this is using apart from you know this or that or whatever there was like no parts for anything that you were trying to make and like really try to figure out how to improvise whereas now though all of every single component that we use is made for us we have very specific providers of all of this stuff that we've refined over the years these containers everything it's all very specific because there's a an umbilical amount of problem what's that term bespoke right the custom made is that what bespoke is talk I believe that is feasible placate in the last one no no I will learn through spoken alone be slow at this one yeah I'm pretty support that's what it means made to order yeah right order right yeah so essentially these parts and components did not exist until you came along to design these exactly new devices for chambers and figured out how to get them all to work together yeah it's been you know they give it to go on you get it off all the electrical I mean it's been a it's been a it's been fun you know maybe it's getting like to the point now - we're glad that we finally are on the other side of all this stuff and that it is a valid system that the system now demands acknowledgement we put it in there and that they can't say hey you can't do this here that's that's not true we could put one of our devices anywhere and the authorities will allow it because it's done to code that's why when these places they're trying to get through these trouble they're looking for an exemption or a was the other word they got variants these different things they try to get all so it's not a swimming pool so you don't have to have any code or whatever these things aren't cool writing is wins one pools have code right yeah and because this isn't a pool doesn't mean it shouldn't have code that just means it should have a set of codes that are specifically designed for this environment which is what this stuff is here this CCS standard here that we have you see it so it's all that stuff there then you read through this and this is the reality of the direction that the industry is going in that the authorities are aware and and then they're not stupid they understand what liability is they they can't say hey go ahead it's okay we don't care they can't turn a blind eye on this anymore because it's been brought to their attention now well it's also been brought to their attention that there's a lot going on right now where people are being investigated for for things like the doctor stuff we've got all this weight loss shit that's out there and you know all the self-help industry like things along the lines of isolation tanks it could be incredibly damaging if these things become as popular as you and I think they will be and the filtration systems aren't good and people have nightmare stories exactly why survive ins it won't survive survive that's what happen grossed out by it yeah the AIDS came out these things were not except the capable of dealing with in AIDS even these these uh parasites like the Cryptosporidium that'll take 10 days in chlorine to deactivate a Giardia that's that's a new you know a in chlorine and then bromine and course these are not effective methods to deal with well that and that's something that people are considered for these tanks chlorine and it's it's it's it's actually bad for your skin to sit in it like that it's not it's not healthy for you like the skin like when you go into a chlorinated pool and you go into like a public pool especially that's heavily corn in it hurts your eyes your vision at end yes system it is you're breathing it and when it's breaking down in an action with these other materials these methane's in the like I say it's creating a politically by products then that need to be eradicated you can't just keep that's where you go to these places they said hey how can you switching that water out of there like oh you know this guy on that thing with the Hamiltons oh every four months and you're going huh so today you're going to take eight he says it's expensive don't want to do it expensive so today we'll take $800 your money and throw it down a drain but yesterday we just find it charge somebody come in here and stew around in that stuff and I mean it isn't right I mean there should be a regulatory agency that demands you know a certain level of cleanliness yeah absolutely yeah I mean it's important well it's important too that there's there's ways that people can avoid the negative aspects entirely figure that out do it and don't have fast that don't put people at risk but as I said before we're talking about before there's one things that I wanted to get into what about like a commercial version of it a non commercial version of a home version of it right a version where you know that's just going to be you using it you know that you're not going to do anything stupid you're going to take a shower before you go in you're not going to urinate in it you know that it's only yours like you wouldn't need all that other extra jazz if it was only yours correct well what what we would want to do is make sure that whatever we build is built to code mm-hmm we don't want to put stuff into circulation that's not code worth a look if signage to happen to somebody liability issues like if they if we cheaped out on something and it made it and then they you know okay but listen hold on a second you're saying cheaped out but i don't necessarily think it's cheeping out it's only cheeping out if you don't know what's going to into that water if you know what's going into that water because it's only your's it's not cheeping out at all it's like do you need to overburden your system do you need to make it so it's unbelievably stringent it removes all the path just no you're not no one's going in there but you know if it's just you don't you think that would be that mean I'd not only that'd be totally acceptable it would be ethical so as you tell the people what to do well I could agree with that you know the the issue is with us though is that people they're there they're going to take that that that system that we said is for your home and they're going to put it into a commercial space right but you know once that these laws and all of these standards are put into place then certainly then we might be interested in saying okay now here's how it could be done that that would be less effective say than the commercial version mm-hmm but first we would have first what we're we're very diligent about is to establish these guidelines in the beginning not to say oh well yeah some of our stuff does this or that it's like all of it does it's certified it's it's perfect as it is now but the rest of it is like okay we could do that but it wouldn't be you know what it is that we've taken so much time and effort to to get right now we know all the other components the less expensive ones let's say right and we could do that right but what I'm saying is the only reason why you need all those expensive components because you're dealing with more than one human being right if it's me that's the one human being I'm completely okay with taking super clean actions on it yeah it would not be like I like to have the best yeah I know but for someone who lives you know in a modest way and can't afford spend the massive amount is there a way like I know that there's this new thing that they're content yeah what do you know that well it's a shower curtain on a on an aluminum frame you know right uh you know I don't know how they're gonna keep that stuff from hardening up there's a lot of things I don't know about you know no I don't want it like salt in the water yeah right and now that I don't know how they're going to keep that somewhere without getting a hard I don't know how it's not going to dissipate out of there you know I haven't really studied into it but I'm aware of certain limitations that occur just in general when you're dealing with this material right and do you think that perhaps some of these other designs are made from people that do not have a long term history a long time history in this sort of a business like they don't understand exactly what's involved what the like I remember the thing about the dude who worked for Sumati he had encountered all the bullshit before he knew about when engine seized up he knew the salt content was too high and it would fuck with the spa engines you replaced he knew he knew in advance what it was probably when we talked on the phone what the issues were yes and he would come home and fix them so you think a lot of these folks they're just sort of getting into tanks now and then they go hey I got an idea but they're not foreseeing the potential hazards or issues that would come from these things yes some was that a good a good explanation that that's this or I don't think that they care that the ones that I'm aware of some of these guys I don't know I know because I I tried not to get involved with these people because we're on our own page we are trying to get or not we're not trying we're doing it we are moving forward in a direction I understand what I mean you're aware of these all these little companies that are coming up and the good thing is that it's making people aware of tanks like a Kickstarter you know somebody sent me a Kickstarter for that that Zen tank thing and I looked at and I was like yeah I don't know if I can retweet this I don't know enough about it I don't know if it's good if it's bad I don't know if it's a good idea I made it on that Google on your computer when you have the Yahoo uh-huh search motor or whatever it is there is it I saw it on the Yahoo it said Ozen 10 or whatever it's interesting so it's the public has a somewhat of a interest in it let's say that E News is doing a some series on actors and how they get into a peak performance or whatever it is like this and that and they want to include us in that in that frame of this type of activities that using energy deprivation yeah you know it's how many celebrities use have a sensory deprivation tanks there's more more we have them coming in more now really yeah there's something you know that are very it's free it's pretty cool too you know and there are those good people as well the ones that come in that are famous or whatever they're they're never like a big you know it's me or anything like that they come in lope you wreck you know that's why I come in dude Elton John sunglasses big fucking feather hats shit I come in big there's our world yeah you guys I don't have the occasion where your Gators there but the people then that that that are a truck so what I'm saying though is it's becoming more and more of a mainstream are becoming more and more popular and people becoming more and more aware of it and I know a lot of fighters use it Diego successively big on it Jeremy Stephens who we talked about earlier he loves it there's a lot of you when that fighters that commit not it was a very close fight but he did not win but it was uh it was very close it was very good it was an excellent fight it was really close like at the end I believe it was a split decision well and at the end we were going man who knows but I think the right guy 1 I think Cub Swanson won the fight but it was like I said it was super super close they both put it all in it was great it was a wild fight to watch these guys are so skilled mmm that that's been about kick with a guy kicks him in the chin I watched you walk out on a little clip and you're walking out on this is a long time ago and as you're walking you don't even stop walking and you jump around and kick the guy I think he kick him in the chest or something and he goes out immediately I mean it was like it wasn't even you didn't even stop walking and then that guy from Mott what is it there's a law-and-order show the bald guy that's like the captain or whatever it is he was telling the story about you and him going through New York and there's these hoodlums writers I got four or five or somebody said so joe says what are you talking into microphone crash oh yeah sorry about that sir tells uh joe says to him I forgot is do you know the guy is the bald law-and-order guy he's like dan Florrick dad said he said you guys were and Joe looks over and he says hey can you take one of these guys and he goes okay I said it's Joe jumped up and and not even this never happened in New York I didn't knock anybody out this is a completely fabricated story and you're in New York there's some who'd listen to me talking about me I'm trying to dig nomming happen did not have never happened see this is the story he told me was he was because he was might have been on pain pills are you sure it's the right guy ambien I don't know if it's the right but you just never had a problem like I did not beat everybody in New York never kicked a guy down oh the other ones ran off I haven't been able to talk man no I haven't been in any sort of a physical altercation since I was in high school really yeah you never did never get into a situation with some guy getting a lippy mouth you got to put him up with a guy on fear factor that I had a grab but once I grabbed him shut up and I just grabbed him held onto him grabbed his neck late I didn't hurt him I just he was too dangerous he had hit some people before he had thrown his wife down on a television show and he had attacked a counselor on another television show and we they had warned us before he came on the show that he was like it was very uh he's a contestant and yes he was a celebrity one of those reality celebrities he had been on a reality show with his wife oh this is the new one it was an old fear factor they had reality shows back then oh yeah man sure they had survivor man started in 2000 I want to say like 2001 or survivor did rather huh 2001 and this guy was on The Amazing Race which I think was like 2004 or 3 or something yeah I mean they've had those for a long time grabbed him to get him just to chill I think I thought he's gonna hit me he kept getting my face I pushed him away got my face again I was like I'm not gonna let the problem with someone hitting you is it's really hard to see they're going to hit you if they sucker punch you by the time you react you've already been hit you know it's the reaction times that people have are way slower than action times action times are way faster so someone decides to hit you and you don't see a comment it can be very dangerous and when someone keeps invading your space and there they're not listening they're violent they're angry they're spinning your face or screaming if you just let a guy hit you you know the first punch is one of the most important aspects of any sort of an altercation if you get hit you get hurt that hurt damaged and then someone can fuck you up yeah I gotta be really careful and regroup yeah so when someone these violating all the laws of engagement and he's also he's showing himself to be very very dumb about physical altercation because he keeps coming forward I push him away from me and he keeps coming for it again like something's gonna happen if you keep doing this you're not thinking about it you're not thinking about what the repercussions are you don't even know how to fight and yet you still you already know that your tiem uh Wow look at that as himself but not just that I'm looking at his physical frame I'm like he's just he's frail there's nothing there that's like dangerous there's no explosive movement he's spitting he's yelling he's red in the face it's all emotional so I run out of gas in five seconds if I grab him I'm just thinking all these things like but I don't want him to hit me that's the only one time though definitely on time on television have gotten in arguments with people before but I'm a nice person man the most part I can avoid most bullshit but I didn't kick anybody in New York that's what I think he said he said I did the other ones ran off you asked him if he could handle one of them he said yeah I don't know what I don't know I don't know what to say I don't know what you remember I don't know who was on ambien I don't know who is on third all right I don't know I needed to be honest with you but yeah I wouldn't do thought about those that a lot of these people I think that they're you know once you stand up they take a little scatter off sometimes put the choke on the guy that'll usually stop you you know you should always avoid a trivial altercation if you can do it any physical altercation if you can avoid it please do you're always better off people cooler heads prevail people relax they calm down they calm down and get over a situation that could have resulted in a murder I mean that happens all the time where it's just like people escalate and they get this point they make irrational decisions and they're super violent and then they go and do something really dumb you know it happens all the time people they get caught up in their emotions they get caught up in their anger they get caught up and they're there primal chimpanzee rage and they just fuck up and they do something terrible that's why how people who love each other wind up killing each other I mean where how could that even be rational how could you ever kill someone that you used to love and it all boils down to some of the same issues that we were talking about earlier people don't have releases they don't have a release for their aggression they don't have a release for their frustration they don't have a release for the energy that their body continues to make they have all this food they're taking in their body their bodies getting fat because they're not exercising it so this is all these imbalances and everybody's uncomfortable and people are agitated they're agitated and easily irritated and it's all about personal maintenance and it's all an issue of personal maintenance whether it's by taking yoga classes or what you and I like to do by getting into the tank or what some folks like to do they just like to go for an evening jog I know a lot of people that say that they they go for a jog like Jamie's big jogger you go for a run and it clears your mind when it's over you just things that seem so important 20 minutes ago they don't seem that important anymore an hour ago you were sweating all these different things and now you're like in a greater perspective everything's gonna be okay I was just caught up in a wave of momentum of emotions and anxiety and oftentimes you can alleviate a big chunk of those just with physical exercise there's like they say that physical exercise is as effective as antidepressants when it comes to making people feel better yes that physical exercise for a lot of folks is the recipe okay what is a comedy writer and he comes in and he says that what's he name I don't know his name I forgot any writer guy yeah he's coming right he goes for a walk that he doesn't even know run he says he runs he doesn't even like to run but when he goes out knee runs it creates a mental framework that he uses to write with yes so he'll go out and just go for a run to create the mental mind frame that he's going to work off of his material with yeah not to get the physical benefits right mmm is it I thought whoa that's a interesting cuz I know sometimes about riding my bike some stuff comes into my head oh wow I didn't think about that you know right so I guess when you're in this room you know exercising moto your physical stuff is taken care of well sure you're also you're pumping your body filled with blood you're accelerating all your processes you're getting all your hormones going you're getting all your endorphins going your body's pumping you know you're flushing out your system everything's moving you're sweating so you're sweating toxins out of your system allegedly I don't like when people talk about that because usually they don't know what the fuck they're talking about now I'm getting rid of all the toxins are you really are you just sweating you know what's happening here so I'm not really sure which to but that's a lot of it it's a you know it's exercise I think that allows the mind to release a little bitter and these come down perhaps when it's the physical situation is requiring more of you then and then your mind is like freed up from creating problems to avoid it's the battery thing we were talking about earlier to it's your body stores up all this energy and you don't have a release some folks never have and any sort of an explosive release like months weeks you know days there's nothing it never happens they have no no release so their body's just like wow you know it's designed for all these different things that it doesn't get used for it's designed so that you can do manual labor it's designed so that you could hunt for food so that you could gather in farm it's designed to be sturdy when required to be and when you don't require to be it gets uncomfortable you know and that's that's the issue that a lot of people face in this weird modern world that we've created we don't we don't give the body what it really truly needs listen homeostasis especially a natural state or something like that and I think that one of the fascinating things about the tank is that it allows a very unusual type of relaxation it also is an incredible way to absorb magnesium into your body like magnesium which is an important mineral it gets absorbed through your body through those salts so like epsom salts is one of the best ways to get into your body you feel better when you lie on that thing you feel invigorated I lie on that thing for a couple hours I feel like I just slept like a really good eight hours sleep like a my body such a good I'm so good flavors are so good that's what it's other people they in what's interesting is that people like it when they come in and they do it they go oh you know that was a very low percentage of you know nothing we ever asked or anything but most people say wow wow you know it is a it's such a positive learning and the the downside you know I don't even know what it is I don't think there's a downside but I have had people come to me that that were in a poorly setup tank like this one guy came to me was hey I try to do it but I was sweating I was like well you're in a badly setup tank you're not supposed to sweat you're almost supposed to feel slightly cool yeah Jimmy get in somehow slightly cool and if you're sweating at all it's just the temperature the water's too high and that can happen it's happened to me before I've had my temperature set wrong or for whatever reason it gets warmer outside Oh I emailed you about that Riesling good leave the door open for a while let some of the heat out you know this is the number down one not you just left it I left it do you want to stick it always to it yeah it doesn't matter I can do that yeah yeah but it's some if it's set up correctly it's an amazing thing and it should be something that everyone at least at one point your life recognizes or experiences because I think that it's it's an alien environment that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world if you could take a pill that could give you the experience that you get when you're full blown in the tank you know how that you know that feeling that you get when you're fully relaxed when you've completely let go like an hour in or something like that where everything is just so chill and your mind is in this like incredible place and you're you know essentially just breathing and floating when you hit that moment man if you could get a pill that could put people in that state it would be like ecstasy people would be like trading in the black-market they'd be like this is amazing do the feeling that gives you like the world goes away dude you don't feel your body the world goes away and you're alone with your mind in an empty room you believe whoa people would freak out oh yeah it's a Felder they would be like that's the craziest drug every right it's freaky bro it's so illegal though if you call with it you're dead it's completely blacked out for a city yeah and while it lost it is like a drug in its effects but it's completely natural completely safe completely I mean I guess you could get addicted to it because I think a person get pretty much addicted to anything right you know if it's worth doing it's worth overdoing haha people say that about jerking off then they get blisters in their dick yeah the locusts come in there I don't worry about the locusts then you know and then you got to worry about you know people get that way with gambling people I mean people get addicted to bug a lot of things that aren't physically addictive as far as like the cellular level but you get addicted to those rushes that you get you get it motion Aaliyah we get addicted to fighting with their spouse so a lot of people that just can't help but they have these seesaw battles within their relationships where they get mad and yell at each other and then they recover and they love each other so much better because of the fact they've gone through this this almost a neurochemical where it we get upset and then we go we get a hit from that well interesting but we get bored you know we're designed to go wild through the jungle banging each other like monkeys yeah we don't do that anymore so we get bored so the way we keep it exciting is start fights it's to shit I don't have set makeup with each other yeah I just think what what I love about the tank is it gives you a chance to sort of step back and see stuff like that gives you a chance to step back and see like your whole life and to be alone with your mind okay alone with your mind to just really get a good look at what the fuck's going on it's such a good place to go to well yeah it should be then because it's like the regular world is just loaded with stuff now it's like a constant in order just like unplugged not answer the phone or not not have anything going on at all yes so very so rare complex to get yourself somewhere where you almost have to like leave and go on a vacation or something but in there you could just you could just get in there and close the door and then take yourself out of whatever it was that you know what was where you wanted to leave from you know and it can't come back later better prepared to deal with the situation that it might have been you know yeah I agree and I think it's just it's so interesting to me that this slipped through the cracks for decades that somehow or another people forgot about this and it was one of those things it was incredibly fringe when I came upon it I went to a place called soothing solutions it's still opened in Burbank and they have those Sumati tanks and they do a great job taking care of them they have a shower right there they have a good real good setup and the lady that ran it was super nice but she was like it was on the verge of going under like there wasn't that many people that were using those tanks it was just those are pretty rare it wasn't like this super popular thing and I remember the first time I did it there I was like this is fucking bananas how was this not something that everybody's talking about everywhere you go and I questioned her about it I questioned other people about it then I would ask people if you heard about it and I was stunned by how few people in the psychedelic community didn't do it we're gonna sell thousands of them Dennis mic-n has never done it I'm sure they're going this is such an outrageous you know you're gonna do everybody when I first did it and I started doing it and going this is something that it's graham hancock had never done it and I know you told me supposed to come to my house and do it I was gonna send him to you to do it alright next time he's in he's in America I'm fuckin I'm dragging him to one of those things it's like how can you go around you travel all the way the jungle do ayahuasca come it's right here sit down tapped into himself really good he's amazing Hooper intuitive like that he's a great great guy too just as a beautiful human being and being yeah somebody that really has a lot of laudanum - fascinating honest inquisitive willing to take chances in even if he's incorrect occasionally with some of these ideas the ones that he's been correct about it's pretty mind-blowing some of the implications of one of the some of the things that he's discovered and with things that were talking about this on the phone on the car right up here that gobekli tepe situation where they've discovered this incredible stone ruins from 14,000 years ago and this is something that they just didn't even know existed before they didn't know there was a culture 14,000 years ago that was capable of building something like this and because the fact that it was covered up 14,000 years ago they're pretty sure that it was built at least that long ago perhaps even longest covered up on purpose was covered up on pavement they said I think they explained how the ark and this is all mainstream archaeology folks this isn't some weird friendship this is I mean pretty much completely agreed upon by all these different scientists that at some point around 12,000 years ago they covered all of these stone structures and it's an enormous stone structure complex of these concentric circles and there's these weird three-dimensional carvings that are into these stone columns are huge we're very intricate very difficult to do especially back then when they thought that people were essentially just hunters and gatherers which is you know they didn't think that people had built cities back then so 14,000 years ago someone or 12,000 plus years ago someone had had the ability to do this that we were unaware of until this discovery and this discovery wasn't even made until I can I think the 90s 80s or 90s someone found one of these stones and they started uncovering it and to this day they've only uncovered like 5% why isn't that a focus well it is it's just slowly but surely 5% uncovered but it's it's a noticeable why why is it society like informed about Kim Kardashian's ass is huge and a lot of people think it's fake that's it her dog has got a he's got his paws probably something's wrong something wrong with a dog whatever shall I get the shoe shoot oh that yes well it's just vein stream television mainstream media is a lot of is you know it's it's a business and it's based on the the base humans the amount of numbers look I've talked a lot of people that work for paparazzi's that work for like TMZ the work these people they're just regular people that are a part of this system that they get some money out of and the they get some money out of the system exists because people are curious as to what Britney Spears is up to they're curious as to you know how Kanye West is going to deal with Jimmy Kimmel making fun of them people just get super obsessed by this stuff and there's a business and feeding that obsession so all these people that don't take themselves away from the television and don't get into an isolation tank and don't take a yoke and don't consciously choose to not inundate their mind with silly nonsense instead if they just took a broader path took a wider view took a more sensible approach to their life you know I think we would see less and less of that stuff you know it exists because there's a void because there's a reason for it because it's interesting to people it could be a fad maybe if people continue to you know get smarter it goes on the course that we looked at earlier in the podcast the court not the courtship of eddie's father but of leave to beaver we looked at Leave It to Beaver and then look at things that we see on television today in the sophistication level of the media that we produce the the artwork that we produce is pretty intense the growth amount is pretty intense so I think that that is just that's the evidence that people are becoming more sophisticated overall there's still going to be plenty of idiots there always will be there's always going to be people that resist there's always going to be people that are like involved in religious cults there's going to be people that are ideologues that have these insane ideologies there's always going to be that but I think that overall things are getting more sophisticated people are becoming more aware people becoming more smart don't you think I'm hoping for that and I believe that that's that's probably correct and the tanks part of that and some one tank can help a person I mean if everybody you know likes say they put them in these schools help these kids you know the define themselves you know that that's very important for people to have that opportunity in that that option mm-hmm to take and turn out how they want to be based on what it is that they think that how they want to be you know I mean to do it because of your own reasons yeah and know what those reasons are and that's one of the things about meditation whether it's TM or whether it's yoga whether it's going into a tank when you're alone with your thoughts you get an idea of what your thoughts actually are if you live your life just acting constantly on the momentum of other people's expectations of you wanting to be like by these other people you can run into a trap and you you you set up a life that you didn't really want you're fucked you're you're you're trapped in this situation where you have a mortgage you've got credit card bills you've got student loans you have to pay you have a bunch of shit going on you have to continue to feed and all that and especially if you have a family and you have to feed them oh my goodness then you're fully locked you and you can't take any chances whatsoever and oftentimes people make the mistake of getting stuck and it is just a tactical mistake just like it would be a mistake if you got stuck on a video game just like it would be a mistake if you followed a map incorrectly and you get stuck in the woods your life is certainly some sort of a journey it's certainly some sort of a journey and we have to all be aware that when we're making journeys we're not going to always make the right steps and sometimes you have to back up and try again and if you're in a position where you can't back up and try again you've trapped yourself and the system will set out honey pots for people to get trapped in the system will set out the ideas of retirement the ideas of the golden years providing you benefits providing you a healthy work environment why well because they want people to work for them they don't want people to realize their own dreams and escape but those of us a fucking pain in the ass you got to hire more people and train them and they want to set it up so that you stick around stick around some sort of an unsatisfying world it's up to you to see that video game problem to see that issue as it comes up on the map known I think this is a right turn to see all the problems that could potentially lay in front of you and calculate your your future and then also look around all the people that didn't do it and look at the misery that they're in and learn that you don't want to be like them and then look at the people that have kind of taken chances and navigated their way what did they do differently than you what would objectivity do they have that maybe you lack what insight into their own mistakes are they willing to delve into that you're not that you step back and go you know I don't don't I just don't want to look at myself that closely but the person who's able to look at themselves the closest it's going to get the more rational results well put you know because you're your own architect you know what I mean you turn out how you sort of I want to be like Shaquille O'Neal shit's not going to happen well you know if you wanted to be like is Satya black is really the odds are slim that ya can't imagine if you could imagine they found out the secret is real that you could just become whatever you want so if you thought hard enough about being a giant you would just start growing if you thought hard enough about being a woman you would just turn into a woman like people like look at you like is something going on crash you just be like well I've been thinking a lot about living my life as a woman so I just started become a woman you just do it like from a cellular level unconsciously totally what does what's going on here with this that's ridiculous I'm completely consciously isn't that the idea behind like the the secret did you get like um when that whole the secret thing was going on and what the bleep do we know and people started really getting into the idea of manifesting your own reality with your imagination did you get a lot more people coming into the tank centers we think that was probably like kind of into people maybe started to that group was it called group consciousness or some collect collective consciousness yeah yeah you know I don't like that and I don't like that you know motive stuff about the water having a personality or whatever does empal shit I have a dark field microscope then I studied you know a bit about water and I you know I I yell at it or I'm nice to it and I can't tell the difference you know I've tried it yeah you you know this you're rotten and it doesn't seem to affect the water under my microscope but he does the freezing I don't know how he did it but what is it called the message in the water well it's Yamamoto he's a scientist that suggests that the water is it like we're water sort of I think is the the premise is that yeah if you're nice to water water is nice and this if you're nice to people they're nice I think it's something it's called hidden messages in water and it's all pretty fascinating but a lot of people think it's total bullshit scientists think that yeah but those the ones you got to listen to bang because all these other people they're seeing ghosts and shit you know the problem is the scientists of the one they're analyzing shit and looking for actual results whereas the people that are like really in this spirituality and channelers and they're looking to find a very specific result they're not looking to just measure these things you know it's fun you ever done that thing with the muscle testing and they push on your arm they put the little medallion on you the Tesla medallion or whatever no uh you know your this is a Tesla technology or now it's so okay they put a little wristband a little whatever it is so I could never understand how that works doesn't make any sense to me right that's so one day I'd sky shows up news okay okay let me try this thing so I have a desk behind me with a towel on it so next is a proximity thing you gotta be within ten feet of this thing or something still has an effect so I say okay okay what is this thing it's like a medallion there my down yeah or a ring or Agneta yeah they say something's about Tesla technology and they put your arm up and they push down on your arms people love that's all bullshit those are carne trick couldn't understand how it was work so I took the thing now I say okay here watch this take the table behind me either I'm gonna have it in my hand or not look behind my back and I either put it up on the table underneath the towel or I had it my hand right and when I came back then all the chests were off the guy had not a clue how to manipulate the test so oh so he didn't know if you had it on you so then he started doing all his carny tricks and it didn't he couldn't commit to them cuz it did I uh-huh was well-nigh how to do them he was trying to produce try it with me he did it to my my co-host in the UFC and he's believing in he had won on shit he's telling me you got try this is amazing and I was like what is it the guy goes well I'm explaining to you it's all about Polaris arts using all these weren't the hilarity magnetism is all about fucking voodoo Tesla he thought telling me all this stuff and then he said this this this thing we put on your risk and make you stronger and I go really and he goes yeah so he goes alright um I want you to do this and he like put made me put my arm out right then he goes okay now resist me you know and I've resisted him and then he's like alright you're not supposed to be able to resist that I was like look man you're making a mistake you got bad leverage in pushing debt you're trying to push down on my arms you're not big enough I can hold my arms out there like that it's lift up yeah I lift weights this shit ain't gonna work and then he goes alright now I want you to put this on you know tell me if you feel like stronger I go am i stronger you're not gonna get me stronger from a fucking little rubber band around my wrist this is ridiculous I go you're standing in a different position I go you're doing it differently okay you were trying to get closer to me before and now you're doing it further away from me which you know you have less leverage this is stupid I was like this is dumb as fuck man parlour track dude got mad at me man he was really upset at me face started getting red I go listen man there's no scientific basis for any of this shit he was 100,000 off which can't be wrong turns out they were wrong turns out they sued and turns out there's a class-action lawsuit and all those fucking people got their money back means like a it's a big deal yeah it's a parlor trick total or shit but I talked to fucking athletes that's War II worked they do that the people believe you well that's why I like you say was it the chamber though is that like they do all those a hoax E or this they tried this or they they tried to acupressure and then they do these shows on TV and they try to you know discredit yeah he's a natural well you can't discredit the chamber they've never been able to come it wouldn't want to first of all it's it's so natural it's so natural and so positive and you look at it so ingenious in its design ten effect with the absence also effect does something it helps you do something with yourself and I mean what else is there that does that hardly and it's super relaxing just super relaxing we could all use to relax fuck I know I can goddamn it let's make I could fuck it used to relax away these people are coming at they're at a big hurry to relax yeah they're to hurry up roxtor I have an hour yeah get in there quick we give them two hours for 40 bucks that's amazing by the way you have the best fucking rates man nobody has rates like that everybody else is like I've heard fifty bucks an hour I've heard people saying well you know there's no money in this is no profit in it so it's we have to charge this much just to keep the doors open but what you've always done is I mean I can't tell you how many people have gone to the float lab and go to so cheap I was like yeah yeah in comparing like in my town it's a hundred fifty bucks for an hour like I've heard that I've heard a hundred fifty bucks you know for an hour what's the most expensive you've heard someone charge I know 20 and stuff I don't ha see just if it bums me out because it's not cool to charge people like that to try to you know if you if this is a person oh you know you could charge more well so what I don't have to I don't well if you have an initial investment you build an X amount of tanks and then you have a place where it makes sense like as far as like the amount of rent and then you just have them filled all day long it can be profitable I mean you're not going to be Rockefeller not gonna but you're not trying to do that you're just trying to spread this shit try to accommodate the people in general not a specific group of people like I remember I saw the club's I always have the jello shooters for a dollar I have a dollar a beer always a dollar draft always and then I have a dollar shoe almighty ops is a dollar you know I could see people that the money is a thing for dealing with regular you want to have what is your objective you're trying to make is this your money thing or trying to provide a service and and created which community like that come to you like I never hear anybody I've never once heard anybody go do you think oh you know what crash was rude the place sucked the tanks were expensive no one's ever said that they always say Oh crash is so cool the place is so nice I love it there it's great like no one has any negativity well that's that's like Ian so handsome look at him over there beautiful bastard there's a bring it the girls I like that oh it's good move Ian should be like oiled up and shirtless you'd attract dudes and girls is that people coming in from all around to use those tanks yeah did he even use this tank yeah does it need to the tainted Ian uses oh hey that's it not doing another thing we have a little chamber I want to give it away we we updated that thing - okay it's all black now we made the entry we change the door out now it's a it's a black door and it's inlaid and we've taken we've fixed it all up and oh that's awesome so something with it let's do that look at them tell me what we need to do and we'll we'll give it away let's do that one cuz I gave away my last tank yeah my samani tank I I had a random drawing online people send me their emails and I just went I spun I like did the thing with my laptop and I'm like clip okay this guy and then I just sent it to that guy just total random decided to send it to this one guy in San Diego and he my tank well this is Genesis yeah we we tuned it all up it's an outrageous vehicle man it's it's a cool rig and it's uh you know it's your old thing so is it how much is a salt cost it's funny about that too so you get you thinking about the epson salt magnesium sulfate SP grade right yes it depends on where you get it at even though it's labeled the same way USP is a pharmaceutical grade mm-hmm there's a quality is different like if you know any way you could get it at the home I mean at the bed bathroom beer 99-cent store for 50 cents a pound right yet it's you know it's not the highest grade even so you got to get it from you you hook me up with some chemical companies that's what I get it with right yeah yeah and it's like 75 80 cents a pound or something there which is you know but so you figure it's like a thousand pounds it's 800 bucks and who'll but that chamber though is in primo shape we have it all fixed up and one day we'll figure out what we're going to do because you know we're going to be talking more about this this venue in Westwood yeah so you're going to open up a place in Westwood when it's going to be open for the public that's a good question we've been working on it for a while now because of the a few details with people that we needed to get behind us how many tanks do you have right now in Venice - two that's it that's it Wow and then take place in Westwood we'll have ten ten oh so - and in Venice are booked up like deep into August right yes and would be if you probably had 20 of them you know in turn note there's a lot of calls and we don't make an effort to utilize any you know like there's been some shows on the TV shows want to come in we have any but we don't have any time right that's like so oh they want to come and film there or something well vice film there that was cool in Hamilton Morris I remember he contacted me after his over said it was one of the most life-changing things he's ever done he ate a pot edible and got into your tank and just like changed his world what changed our world - that really was it was an extraordinary opportunity for us then - to have the chance to to show some people what this was about he really informed a lot of people you know you know you and him and other people that you know that mostly it's just you and I don't know who else is really pending on well that was his first jaunt yeah his first real run in the tank but he's his whole thing that pharmacopoeia show that he does and really was fascinating he got a lot of really fast in the episode it's really cool well produced episodes where they covered a lot of different kinds of psychedelics a lot of different kinds of subjects but this the subject this this whole thing where people are getting curious about altered states of consciousness is increasing and growing and even more so this idea that you could do it in something like the tank where it's totally natural and safe and healthy you know don't worry about it and so I think I think it's all part of this new sort of expanding of our ideas that we're seeing in today's society it's an expanding of what what is you know what do you have in your life what's in your world you know you know what are you adding to your body what are you adding to your day what how are you expanding your your consciousness your point of view these are all new things to new new considerations these are points to consider that in the past really haven't been left up to the individual exactly like you go along with the tide you know but now you can you could grab ahold of yourself and say listen and I'm going to think about this the way I think about it and then make the decisions to you know have be versus you know not a victim anymore you know isn't victim all there this there that you know they are what they are but you know you with ability to recognize your you know that you have you are capable and that you are potentially just getting started I mean we're all yeah young if we want to be if you want we're certainly all a work in progress and you know let's hope the more you keep improving yourself the more you enjoy this process of life so we're talking about like people trying Pilates people love trying to shit you know I get into archery recently it's fun it's like something exciting about learning something you know you don't know that much about it and you can see your progress you know maybe you know take up a martial art or soil or a skill yeah something you can start doing something sewing I mean that I don't know anything I mean it but but the you know it's good to have a balance yeah I know that it is it's it's super super important to have a balance and also to find things in your life that stimulate you the more things that I do that excite me and stimulate me the more things that I do where I'm learning new stuff you know it's just I get into things and those things that I get into wind up in rich in my life the enthusiasm that I get from pursuing some new subject that I'm interesting is that cool when you're learning what you want to learn about which is why I wanted to talk to you about these crazy screens that you're trying to hook up these tanks with this is the thing that crash was going off about forever was these screens that would suspend above the tank and emit the lowest amount of light possible so you only saw the image you didn't see the actual screen itself or the border itself you just saw the image in front of you and in that sensory deprivation state where the only input it was coming in was what you were catching off the screen what you were hearing from the program that your mind would be way more easily a way more able to absorb the information it's a trip we after five tribes military providers we used to get this thing finally doing what it's supposed to do who says anyways it have been a difficult killer to be contained that image in that area that it has to be in with Fort so that that is very because you know you're laying down looking at it and one of the first things that we figured out was because you're on your back right is it there so we take it and you go like this Zoop and you go Boop and as soon as the screen changes around you're convinced that you're standing on your feet and looking forward on your feet at the screen really oh this is one of the first things and then there's some other stuff here that you know that so when you're lying on your back and you're watching the video you think you're standing after you take the video that you make them but there is no video for this really it's like mostly your brain you don't want to see gone with the wind or you know you get your your whole mind it just yes patterns or movements or whatever we've been working with different stuff as much as we can with the time we don't have enough time but we come back we have a we have a strategy then to start to produce these programs involved in this system but the the initial what's occurring there with that is then you know that's that's the future you see this what we explain it though there's a screen that's hovering over our face uh how when you're laying on your back and how wide is it it's the one we have now is 19 inches because the material required to build it they can't get it any big now though there's 32 inch screen material I can get it to make the to make it 32 inches across but is their size that it's no longer good because you have to know that blackboard it's all black so the whole thing is a screen right it the the the image will move around within the screen so you have it all black we're working on something you know like those tiles hmm in the bottom so if you're in a dome now and you're laying them back on your dome and those tiles are underneath you so that the bottom is waterproof of course but you use it lights on the bottom a projector or whatever you know on the bottom and in a dome you're laying on your back and the dome then is all filled in with screens oh and the bottom so now you're laying in this thing and you're flying it through space and a dumb the upside everywhere you look and then it flips you over but wait a minute wait a link you're lying but you can see you can't see through the water yeah it's clear as a bell so the but wouldn't that ruin the whole idea of a sensory deprivation oh no it's a whole nother thing light underneath you see light you're flying but you can't turn behind you and look behind you if it's screen everywhere you're enclosed in it this is riveted here I don't really want to okay but if you're lying I'm confused sorry yeah but you keep interrupting or if you're lying on your back you're looking up right what difference does it make what's behind you you're not going to see that well you you want to know that it's not it's something because then you're flying you're suspended you look around you're in the air I mean underneath you is cool too if you can have the whole thing encompassed in you Shoji I did wind up looking up but you can't when you're lying back like that you don't know which ways up you down no you would be it would make you think that you're on your stomach looking up at what's you know I mean looking down that what's actually up you don't your mind is twisted when it twists you have no reference right so when you move you in there you are under the impression that's the position you're in well sometimes I don't know where I'm at when I'm in the tank when I sort of snap out of it I've never moved I don't even know where my feet are facing yeah bottom ever fallen out or anything like that where you take off any which way or no yeah you feel like you're flying through space see now that kind of stuff is like freaky you can't tell people about it cuz they're going alright then well you do I think they froze me out because I used to talk too much about stuff that was probably froze yo who's they I don't know who they are fucking government man Oh area 51 those guys don't have nothing to do with me I'm more of a you say but they're controlling you with chemtrails spraying in the skies nanobots up there dripping down that nano stuff now that's a weird stuff huh we won't go there don't go there yeah yeah but this other thing I had to do with audio mostly the audio is what's the yes in the audio actually met you had some demonstrations where I made the water move oh the water is moving it's a cymatic frequencies we've figured out how to them to create the patterns of sound see we're made out of frequency based material maybe you bro I made a twisted say yeah yeah exact sex appeal is there's all the file but we're made out of frequencies like would even see based materials everything is it's moving oh you mean like strings every the idea of everything moving at a different vibration matter is comprised of materials then that are you know mm-hmm unique like your liver is different than your your kidney you know the frequency of the deliver or the material that the kidneys made out of is be different so the cells then that would be used for these purposes with if you could see what they tell you that the replication of the cell creates a depreciated version in other words as you aging right yes exactly okay well what if instead of a depreciated version of the previous one what if you did better but if you created a cell that was better why wouldn't you if you already understood but happened to do that well this is going to be a tool we have this the sensors now see I was talking about the brain thing the Germans are getting me with a cap there what's the neuron the brain thing with a cap that has the electrodes on it like a swimming cap well it's not I don't cap no it's got electrodes on it it's a cap that goes on your head okay they haven't built it for me yet but I've discussed it with them and they understand that they can do it based on some thing they've done in a bathtub somewhere but the the sensors then you see as they're connected to you you input information see that's the other things the sensory of of what's going out and what's going into you and then monitoring what occurs based on this input this is what that thing is all about but you know I don't want to get too deep in there because it's kind of like in the future right now and then so your idea is to combine sound with images to essentially tune your body to a different frequency and that could potentially change the way your body produces cells absolutely that's a whoa interesting analogy of the situation but indeed there's a lot of evidence to you know a lot of evidence about meditation in the mind and the effect on the mind the physical effect on the brain and that what is meditation it's tuning into a certain type of frequency atherton certain type of mindset turning into a certain mentality tuning into a certain energy that the mind is is focused on and that that actually has a profound effect on the very brain itself that's pretty interesting stuff a super interesting this so that makes something like what you're saying actually viable oh yeah know that we have a group of people that are willing to give us the money for that you know that's we have the resources now to complete that you know in some sort of period of time once we focus back to it we've been trying to get this other stuff done so then we could get back to this stuff but that technology that we have built and patented as well is extraordinary and that that takes this thing to another level I mean this is what it is and that's why it's so important as well these vehicles that we're producing now not only will they be used for this you know stuff that we've been talking about here in regards to relaxation and so forth else it will eventually in the future be used also for you know other health benefits and learning and a whole array of various positive features that this the positive benefits of it absolutely influence that human and to be used in conjunction with a lot of other things in your life proper diet exercise diet meditation all these things absolutely that is this there is no there's all this silver bullet it's a it's a comic like you have to get it should be everything it is important food your intake their mind your rest or whatever it is it's all like that if you can get yourself you know balanced out and we have a lot of room for growth you know like I said we're just getting started as a I think that the the species itself humans that we are are just starting to understand a little bit about what we are we don't know where we came from a very good point yeah yeah we are starting to end we discussed it in the previous podcast about the just just the couple generations between us the people that lived in the 1940s during World War one the World War two rather than dropping the first atomic bomb and then people before that in the 1800s it's just a few generations you're just dealing with a few 70 now how this retinol works and you've seen this in the back of the head it's in the dark or the eyes eyes changed around the information somehow and it comes out there and then you think it's out there when it's somehow back in here being interpretated well but we're talking about earlier with meditation there's a study if you if you google how meditation changes your brain a neuroscientist explains there was a group of Harvard neuroscientist led bar this woman Sarah Lazar who's a PhD and they they were interested in mindfulness meditation and they've reported that the brain structures they monitored brain structures change after only eight weeks of meditation practice eight weeks of meditation practice and your brain starts branching out in a different way starts truly expanding your consciousness you think of expanding your consciousness being some sort of an airy-fairy thing well no it's measurable like it's expanding your mind itself what is more important than this I'd only is anything more important I may not it is that did is the premiere opportunity yeah to to to do something for yourself and if you can expand your mind believe me all these people that are trying this if they tried it in a tank it would be oh so much more effective it's it's it's it takes so much it's like you know can you uh you know can you get across the country riding a bike you certainly can can you get across faster if you ride a plane fuck yeah okay and this is the difference it's like you can get there on a bike you certainly can good luck good luck all techno shamanism mmm you know in a lot of ways acknowledge II to to to create like they say these monks they're out there trying to get these dated levels yeah is that 20 years in a side of a mountain meditating or you could go jump in the chamber and get yourself sorted out and you know much faster well yeah I mean I would like to see what those Kundalini masters see when they hit that highest level because I do believe that they can achieve psychedelic states when they're doing that route they're not leaning people I don't know they are but some of those monks up there in these uh monasteries or wherever they're at they use these frequencies that they produce with their uh yeah notes and stuff to affect them as I'm not well Duncan Trussell knows how to do that he'll he'll he can do those chants those crazy Buddhist chants he hasn't memorized it's very freaky when he starts doing it does it take him in just some art as he go in his mind yeah come on he he also the freeing aspect of chanting and just the harmonizing and saying all those things you just sort of like get into this state Ross I mean if it puts you into this vibe Duncan benefited tremendously from the tank though Duncan has been my friend for a long time and one time way in the past he had a bad breakup called me up from a hotel he was at some hotel he's like dude you know my girlfriend just kicked me out we had this horrible breakup it just went awful and I'm like he was living with her he's like I'm literally homeless and I said hey come live with me I got an extra bedroom so Duncan came and lived with me and was going into the tank that you designed and he would go in the tank every day he lived with me for like um a few months I don't know how many maybe four or five I don't remember totally until he got back on his feet again but he sorted everything out in that tank and he would tell me about it he was like dude he goes I just can't wait to get back in that tank and every day I just get in that tank and I'm figuring it out more and more he's figuring it out and he's not reading what they said or it goes in there and it figures it out I've never met a guy who got his shit in order quicker back quicker than from a devastating breakup then Duncan did was willing to him to go in there and and and do the work required to get done with that he also realized what had gone wrong like really quickly instead of like wallowing in his own self-pity or trying to distort reality to sort of just sort of be more easily digestible you know like it was all her she's crazy now sort of he saw the whole thing West on it he didn't put any twist on it you saw his part in it as well as the other one in yeah and then from then he went on to becoming a successful comedian me it's crazy it's just like a slow build from there he caught caught that momentum but it was a lot of it was based on doing going that in that tank having those experiences on a daily basis it's it's a it's a fantastic system for people to then you know access themselves yeah I mean that you know that the rest of it is you know it's it's a it's crapshoot you really never know what you're going to run into in there but you do always have that opportunity to look at yourself and you know and sometimes I don't even do that sometimes I just relax sometimes there are times where like you know I'll come home and maybe I come home from a show and everyone's asleep and I say I just need to go in there and chill for a bit and I'll just go in there and just chill like I'm done I'm tired I did work I did shows I did a podcast I did some writing I maybe even worked out already - I don't have nothing to think about I just chill and so I go in there I just the checkout loading man less this the the lightning of the load the releasing of all those muscles and the I get out of there and I feel so good I feel so like calm and chill so important man it should be everywhere they should have them every gym should have them community center should have them schools should have them university should have them it should be just as important it's having a basketball court you got a basketball court you don't have a tank the fuck you guys crying teaching people shit you know you need to get a goddamn tank room son well we're going to I think we're going to do that what we can do to make that all happen you know these schools and stuff these kids are at once again not you know if things go the way that we we hope they go we're all about providing these vehicles for schools and you know old people or veterans or these veterans get a lot of benefit out of this too they get that PSD whatever it is EST yeah those traumatic stress disorder they say that the chamber is is the one thing that helps them up you know think they're all getting the Kim that you know the medication and so forth but other than that they don't really have a an option you know and so this is a thing that would be very appropriate to offer these these servicemen and women they come back and have troubles dealing with the framework of their situation when they get back here they had little opportunity to go in there and investigate the you know because it's already done you can't go in there and erase whatever it was it's bothering you but you could go in there and come to terms with whatever it was realizing it is it's done it is what it was just like any other problem that people go back to I mean at some point it's it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to get upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past you know and that's a huge point because people to find themselves by the past instead of thinking about who they are now and set up they still look back at a mistake they made and don't just get past that mistake grow and learn but dwell on it think it defines them it's the worst thing I met some guys in band use as singers I've only met him twice two different times years later both times he started telling me about the story about what happened to him when he was in this anything in this poor guy has gone on all these years and he's still focused on the worst situation that he ever had to live through yeah and he's so attached to it well some guys get one breakup and they're done some guys one breakup in their 20s will tank them for a decade I've met guys like that that yeah you know I came out here with Charlie and you know she fucking fell in love with her trainer and dude Sally still move on what is that and fucking years ago oh well you know changed my life bro but target are you so disappointed I can't trust women anymore uh-oh you stupid fuck you know what if he got mugged by one person he done trusting people every exactly I mean I one person was a murderer let's not trust anybody yeah yeah you know I heard about Ted Bundy I'm not trusting people anymore okay great I'm not sleeping tonight we yeah I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life you're gonna run into him we all are no you can learn and grow if you survive you pick yourself up you dust the dust off and then you start going and I don't let this stuff don't let it beat you down it's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in life their ability to face hardships you know and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and bullshit and then one day something goes wrong and I mean that's why spoiled kids are so sad like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever a young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to keep on rescuing him his dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them money I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have the character themselves to be able to get by in life they constantly need someone to help them and bail them out even as a grown man I've met guys in their 40s that still need help from their parents I'm like what the fuck man you're never going to get it right because some where along the line they didn't face enough of the adversity to realize that there's sometimes you just got to get up and get shit done there's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push forward even if you want to stay in bed and if you don't do that you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy keeps rescuing you you never develop those tools you never develop that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your life because you're you're soft you got a cushiony you got a safety net a safety net for your safety net I have this friend and she has this uh this friend that she's been friends with for decades and his poor fuck his family super super super wealthy like unbelievable wealthy billions of dollars and he had that not only did he had he had a trust fund and a backup trust fund so he blew through the trust fund and then he blew through the backup trust fund real estate investments and just disastrous business ventures no character no discipline no ability to stick it out but incredible amount of resources he had millions and millions of dollars just pissed it all away didn't understand it completely depressed in one day said to her he said you know cuz she has children as well and she has sons he said to where he goes whatever you do do not give your kids money don't give them a fucking penny goes especially your boys don't give them a penny that ruined me don't give money wow it's deep shit to be a man like in your late 40s looking back at your life this disaster wreckage that you've put forth with the millions you've blown now he has like a retail job his parents fucking abandon them I mean you look at that and you go whoa this is this is wild shit man so guys she's still struggling from the way he was developed from the the tools that were instilled in him at a childhood and in you know in adolescence and having that safety net just provided him with a way to stay in bed kept him weak never developed character now or they have an opportunity every time things go wrong every time things feel terrible you have an opportunity to learn from whatever makes you feel terrible and never allow it to happen again exactly yeah thank you that was forward don't don't do it again yeah you know learn from your mistakes we all make them that's where meditation comes in recognizing that and solidifying it in your head and I believe meditation the tank which is more magnified form of meditation I think it's more intense and I think that you can you could really get something out of that if with those sort of ideas in mind about constant consistent improvement and it's only the only thing that you'll allow from yourself is to maintain a certain standard then consistently try to improve and do that do that and you'll be a happier person that's an amazing concept there to become a part of to where you're involved in your the construction of your own character yes through your own efforts and your own evaluation and then to to make the right steps and make the right decisions that you become even stronger as you go yeah engineering your life it can be done you know it's not it's not impossible you can do it to a certain extent certain extent you can do it the world could be a better place crash right it's becoming a better place becoming analysis but everybody's part error is to do is to hopefully make it a little bit better you know if we could all get on that just do that together try to make things a little bit better just a little bit better it would really have a monsters effect I agree and I want to thank you I want to thank you for coming on the podcast and talking about the stuff and I really want to thank you for being this guy who's out there innovating in this you know almost forgotten business because for me knowing you has been very important it's helped me a lot and knowing your tanks and being aware of that you know there's a guy out there that's pushing it so far he's created this incredible portal I think of it I mean I know what it is it's a tank filled with water I know there's a heater attached and I know there's filters and I know but for me it's a portal I get in that fucking thing and I transform I travel I go to places yeah it doesn't mental vehicle takes you somewhere yeah it does it opens up passages in your mind to take you to some pretty extraordinary places so thank you my brother thank you Joe you've you know been monumental in my life and I want to thank you you know from the bottom my heart did well we found each other man that's what that's how that's supposed to work you know you know we we both let people understand what the benefits of these things are and we benefit from them as well and are generous with those ideas and spread those ideas to other people just to let them know man I'm not making this up you can you can really get better yeah your life can fuck it and the people who if you're perfect right now who are you who you you strange fuck but I really believe every lonely and everyone everyone could benefit from that everyone so uh if you guys want to go the float lab is
