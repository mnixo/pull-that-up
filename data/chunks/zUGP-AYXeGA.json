haha hello freak bitches my mom is a wonderful woman I just spent oh you know she's getting old and stuff and I I took her to see Dolly Parton in Tampa and Dolly Parton I've seen three times in two months mansion I was like she smells like cotton candy and baby powder and really Parton does dude I'm just I know here let me try to hit you always hit me to cool shit Dolly Parton is 70 years old she did a three-hour fucking show she didn't sit in one place she moved all over the stage she played piano guitar banjo flute and at one point she blew a saxophone which sounds dirty I mess it now she didn't just blow zags villian like I had a few notes she played yakety sax which is like Jackie's ex ran a nanana nananana in it that requires some fucking lung power she's 70 years old I took my seven-year-old mother to see her and like mom's got a cane and we had to get a people mover and stuff like that like she's it's crazy man so like I took mom to to go see Dolly Parton and my mother you know God love her she's amazing one of my favorite people in the world but you know she's like Tiger you finally made it and I was like why and she's like because like we got to meet Dolly Parton I was like mom you could've met Dolly Parton any old time and that's not a sign of like prosperity or success or something like that like that happened back on clerks ISM but those days when Dolly Parton was on TV there was only like three channels yeah you simple she fills arenas like it's crazy it's a madness and just watching somebody like you know I saw her I saw her when I went up to Vancouver to shoot an episode of flash a wet and I was a holy shit and there's a part of me of course I'm not a big country guy but my old man loved Country and Western even though we came from New Jersey we weren't even from like southern Jersey were from Central Jersey he loved Country West Country moisture I hated a grown-up and he's doubt dad for like 12 13 years and naturally the older one gets you hear that music it takes you not to the president but right back to your childhood so lately even though I've never been a country person I find more country leaking into my life and has everything to do with my father or something like that so I want to see the show and it was like I might as well take my dad with me he's been dead so long but like that was his dream show like he loved parties big country music fan generally love Dolly Parton so I want to see the show the first time says like I got nothing to do let's go and then I was blown away about her showmanship and storyteller as well shouldn't just sit there to play the music between songs she'll sit there and tell your story about growing up in the Rocky Mountains she's fucking funny dude I know she's got like patter she's probably been doing for years but she talks about she's like when I was a little girl like we went into town and they grew up fucking poor she's one of like 13 children or something like that and she's like I saw this woman this beautiful woman and you know she's painted like an angel and she had pretty clothes and real big pretty hair she burn heels and a lot of makeup and I said mom who's that and their moms like that's the town trough that girl is nothing but trash and she goes I said that's what I want to be when I grow up so that's why that's why she's got the look she's got she's like it cost a lot of money to look this cheap so she that's a Larry I tell you dude she's like it's a true like even if you're not like a Dolly Parton fan like what a true night of entertainment like and you just welcome I saw her like last weekend I took mom to see her in Tampa and I won-soon of a time and I saw at the Hollywood Bowl and then like a month ago and then I took mom to see her in Tampa and that was more like hey dad would love this you know but she has weird moment where she met dolly and like like you're talked about to seven-year-old one and my mom like went in for a fucking kiss not like I want to French you but just like the way you would kiss a friend but right and then you could see dolly who's like had to politically maneuver strangers for 15 years or so figure out do I say hey I don't kiss strangers or do I just tell her lips we going for the lip what she was going for it was awkward dude there was a moment where they were to expire and then finally they could and you know she was like my husband loved your music and shit it's really fucking beautiful to see Wow but mom I love mom to death but mom is like such everybody's mother's very singular individual but mom like had this thing I was trying to figure out I was like when did this person die they were talking about Matt Barber was like when did aunt Barbara die and my mom is like oh hold on and she had this thing when we were kids like she'd get a calendar from church and she wouldn't write on it your birthday or a relative's birthday she'd write the day that they died so like this day was the day uncle Andy died this day aunt Connie died so my mom keeps all that information so she goes hold on she comes out with a box of like funeral mask cards like when somebody dies you go to a funeral there's a little trading card that has bright sure of a saint and on the back has a person's name and when they were born when they were dead my mom has that like a collection the way you'd collect baseball cards and shit and we spread them all out on the table there's 12 significant deaths in our family she had lots more but the ones that would matter to both me and her in our immediate zone family and between 12 deaths I was able to quiz my mother like who died 1980 and she was like oh that was grandpa Smith like she is my mom's obsessed with death but not know like death is metal when she was a child in Catholic school they tried to explain hell to her you know like as you do in Catholic school and she was fucking far too young to get the idea so death has been her obsession her whole life staving it off stopping it from like taking not just her her but her family you know she lost her husband to it we all death is just a natural part of the process you from me I mean my mom finds it like she's terrified but now I as a creative person and I wonder if you feel the same way and I fancy myself a creative person some people like you not very creative but I fancy myself a creative person no caveat death to me is not scary as much as like a repugnant idea where you're like what stop all this like I'm just getting the hang of it I'm just learning like I got so many more jokes to tell and shit like that like death to people who make stuff like us and that's why you might be the exception because you deal with death on a regular basis like with huntin and shit like that like it's just something that probably enters your purview far more than mine but it is like one of those things man where you like wow I didn't really thought about that too often but she's thinks about awful when I think of death I'm irritated by cuz I'm like sunfare like why like right but I imagine if I was like my grandmother my grandmother like lost her sight 12 14 years before she died and I loved hanging out with her eyes play cards with her and shit like that and then when she lost her sight like she did she was no longer interested in living so she would sit around and be like how are you Grammy go we should be sitting in the dark and shit listen to the radio maybe no longer crocheting like she's due east to play cards can do any that shit so she just sat there and he'd be like how are you she be like well I asked him to take me and he said he didn't answer still not today and I was a cool Graham she's like Jesus every day I pray that he finally take me and I'm still here she grew slowly grew to be bitter about life and shit now from where I sit right now I'm the guy that's like I never want this party to a no shit but I guess there could be a time in my life where you know everyone you know and love is past and you just get to a place where you're like you know what I'm okay I'm okay like who was it the singer that that just passed was a guy that sang Alleluia Leonard Cohen was gonna say Lawrence called Leonard Cohen didn't interview like before he passed like five months five weeks maybe before he passed where he was like yeah I'm ready for death he's going to much done everything I wanted to do and I'm I'm ready for and he went fairly short there shortly thereafter grandma didn't mesh young on for a while but wanted to die I hope I'm never that person [Music]
