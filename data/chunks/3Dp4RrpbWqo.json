boom and we're live cheeto Santino live gentleman come you with hot ones hello sir how are you I'm Big Daddy good brother just played a little bit of pool and lost a game and lost lost one illegitimately you won one illegitimate you mean loss you lost one illegitimate yeah you know a scratching is not a good way to win we are scratching the 8 ball these gentlemen it is it is the way to win it happens even to the best it's it's a real way to win I'm good you are you must control the cue ball I have no I have no balance over any of that stuff whatsoever I know there's those little red dots on there yeah he's nothing to me those little red dots other they call that the measles cue ball in that cue ball they've developed for television so that you could watch the ball spin so you know what kind of English the guy puts on the ball there's nothing to do with the person that shooting whatsoever it does yeah it's the person that like for the for the most it's a very controversial ball you really want to get into it I do because it has a different reaction than a red circle cue ball or a red dot cue ball those are the preferred cue balls of a lot of players right but the measles cue ball it's just maybe the tiniest bit heavier or the surface is different or something but it's still legal use it in tournaments yeah ok players get some players got angry when they came up with it they didn't like it they like the old cue ball that's how it's precise the reactions are where I get to the very top level of pool players what's kind of like golf balls when people think no balls don't mean anything to golfers they do I'm sure the feel is so there's a lot of soft the softer golf balls like a lot of people like Titleist makes producing a pro V once a pro v1x s harder softer the average Joe who's full of shit who's like I like probe you wanna it doesn't mean anything to him yeah some guy that's like a 15 or 20 handicap it means nothing a guy that's like a scratch golfer like a like a pro pool player it makes all the difference yeah how it comes off the face yeah how it spins there's a thing called a mud ball if it's buried in mud it reacts differently the moment it comes off a mud on it's even a little bit right yeah yeah I mean the tiniest bit yeah wait did you hear pros impressive about golfers twos they play with a bunch of different weights of clubs yeah it's like a pool player basically who uses one cue and maybe one cue to break with and some players even break with their playing cue but you you don't have like a bunch of different cues for a bunch of different shots usually right well there's because the distances but just get used to the feel of one cue so when a player changes cues like say if you go from a 18 ounce cue to a 21 ounce - there's a big difference in the way it hits the ball it drives through the ball different you have to make the cue do more of the work and write heavy with a heavy cute do you think it mentally changes the way you said yeah totally yeah it's see that's his Fox in people's heads that's what's so impressive about golfers they got all these different weights everything's different shape right it's different there's a guy I think he seems Bryson D Shambo I think that's the golfer he uses all his clubs are cut to the same length which is really rare nobody does that like almost every club set you get is all different lengths clubs and he is this people did it years and years ago but he's like one of the only guys on tour that now cuts his club's to the same length because he mentally wants to have the same exact stance over the ball no matter of the shot Wow it's pretty smart I mean it's a it's a cool interesting concept a lot of golfers don't know how to you know adjust that much I don't know jack shit about golf but there's guys with weird strokes and pool there's guys with weird technique in boxing and it still works yeah there's people that do shit different there's no I don't think there's any right way in sports some of the ugliest shots in basketball tend to be some of the most fun to watch and sometimes they're really good yeah like sometimes like the classic Ray Allen basketball stroke is probably the most beautiful jump shot you know compared to him and Jordan but there are guys that have terrible looking shots but they're fucking phenomenal mm-hmm it's just it's just consistency and their inner balance over you know the the timing that they have and the release that they have that's just a that's got to be the same thing in every sport pool for some shit for shirin - yeah you know in boxing it used to be thought that you pretty much you know if you went to a good trainer they would teach you to keep your hands up that was always the way to box but then you get to a level of like a Tommy Hearns remember the way Tommy Hearns used to fight he's to keep his left hand low really low yeah down to the hand cocked and he would snap that left hand at you like a fucking let goes cold bro his crack Motorcity Cobra he would just pop that fucker right in your face that's why I used to call him that because I was coming out of fucking trade hitman Tommy Hearns he was a bad motherfucker dude and then dying he would hit you with that right hand and he had so much torque cuz he was really wide yeah he was really long and wide for a welterweight man look at him in 147 pounds I think he was probably like 6 - and just shred jacked and just grunted 47 at six - is to a champ you ever see what he looked like when he fought Sugar Ray Leonard huh oh my god yeah and then he went up to 160 fought Hagler and got killed by Hagler and a crazy slugfest you ever saw that fine pull-up Marvin Hagler versus Thomas Hearns this might have been the great I think it went two rounds but it might have been the greatest two rounds in the history of the middleweight division because these two guys were super skilled I mean Marvin Hagler is a brilliant technical boxer can switch from southpaw Orthodox like fluidly like you'd even noticed a difference he fought just as good from both sides and he knocked everybody out and an iron chin and Tommy Hinds was Merkin motherfuckers he merked Roberto Duran with one punch his black face playing fucking in one punch man he's to be stung them with one shot and let me let him see that first here's the build-up the build-up is Tommy Hearns chaos Roberto Duran let's watch that first and then we're gonna go back to Marvin Hagler versus Tommy Hearns so you get a feel for what it was like to be able to switch stances is so crazy to me to be able to do that so fluidly that well that's one of the brilliant things about Hagler I mean he was just so good at that and he get by it's weird for a guy when you're used to I remember the first time I fought a guy who was left-handed it was super confusing everything's coming from the wrong place everything looks like reversed you got to get used to it right you don't see it as often right so if you don't see it as often and sometimes it's more effective but some guys were really good against southpaws some guys have like a Lightning right hand and that was one of the speculations about Hagler and Hearns cuz Hearns had this lightning right hand and Hagler oftentimes fought southpaw that's the counter for southpaw is a straight right now watch this though this is this goes to show you how God look how big he is back [Applause] dude look at this oh come on man when Tommy Hearns merpeople he's marked people and you got to understand man he did this to Roberto Duran that's fast in slow-motion dude he's so fast that looks fast even in fucking slow-motion he was so fast and he hit so hard but now you gotta watch this and this is Hagler in his prime he was 30 years old he was the undisputed motherfucking middleweight champ in the world and most people thought he's the best pound-for-pound fighter on earth and Tommy Hearns of course you just saw what he did to Roberto Duran yeah and it was a lot of speculation a lot of speculation coming into this fight and they just went at it from the beginning of the round there was very little feel ups just constant pressure by Hagler right hooks boom but let me look at this bro they they're going to war these are two of the best fucking middleweights ever and they're standing in front of each other going to war and it doesn't feel like anybody's face it feels like there's I feels like they're at the exact same energy level - oh dude like both of them have the same output look at throwing full power shots from the moment the fight started and they right in front of each other man it for Hearns this this negates his gigantic reach advantage over almost everybody yeah so Hearns decided to fight this way he decided to stand right now look at him the referee could barely separate him hers decide to stand right in front of Hagler and Hagler decide to stand right in front of Hearns and they just now her and his movement see now this is what Hearns could have done from the beginning and made it interesting sticking and moving but by the time he decided to do that he was already touched up and Marvin starts moving in for the kill that left hand of the body Hagler was relentless and his cardio was fuckin supreme it was supreme he always put pressure on people and you couldn't hurt him he only had one bullshit knocked down his entire career as a bullshit knockdown he fought I think was Juan Roldan and Juan Roldan kind of like it was more like a shove and maybe maybe they tripped or something like that and the referee called it a knockdown but I remember thinking god damn it cuz Hagler had a weird thing that he was either born with or developed he had giant muscles on the side of his head like he was a temple horn with headgear I'm not bullshitting they had him anta with a helmet on this is like a big thing in the world of sports back in the day like that he was literally almost born for this that's how good Hagler was yeah these motherfuckers are I mean it's relentless dude they're toed up every time it up they're barely looking for any distance between each other and you got to realize man this is not how people usually fight they don't throw full power shots on every shot I mean they'd be tired within 15 seconds these guys are just going at it so I think this was like almost like a game of chicken like both of them knew they were never gonna reach the 12th round right so they said fuck it let's just do this and Hagler just stood right in front of him constantly blasting them and you see at the end of the first round Hearns is wilting he just does not have the power or the speed or the movement see he's all goofy yeah he's sloppy yeah just exhausted he's exhausted but still the warrior in him is making him throw these fucking bombs man you got to realize like at the time no one really knew what the fuck was gonna happen in this fight and then Hagler heard him yeah there's a little stumble and one of one of Hagler's incredible attributes besides his skill was his determination to win man he was just he was a ferocious competitor man just ferocious and so if someone was willing to engage him and this kind of crazy fight were you gonna stand toe-to-toe and see who's the bigger man oh my god everyone's gonna die gonna take you to the end of the earth man to the end of the earth I mean Hagler just looked like he just had it's still so much left in the tank even at the end of the first round he's not do this for years he's never out of shape he never partied he never did anything stupid what did he do no never got fat no drugs no alcohol no and how about this retired after the Sugar Ray Leonard fight lost a controversial decision Sugar Ray Leonard to this day I think he won and then but it was a close fight yeah but and then just retired and became a fuckin movie star in Italy that's fuckin love that guy yeah but that's the way to do it huh kind of go out of the good prime and then just say good I know else did it like you America nobody else did it like him that's why you heard them yep now he's just moving into the queue no now it's taking his time yeah see now it's just nice and relaxed this is inevitable now Marvin's just moving in and decided when he's gonna uncork when he's gonna uncork moving in blocking these shots he knows it Hearns his hurt and he starts teeing them up but idea canyon and her and just try to move down see now that's how I thought Hearns was gonna fight and most people thought her is gonna fight from the beginning like that just can't move from the other side yeah sting up from the outside like that I mean that's that's classic Thomas Hearns but the warrior and him wanted to find out you know find out who's the baddest motherfucker in town who is it you know you could fit you and you can feel him backing up kind of he he knows what's kind of it's almost like he knows what's coming he's getting in some good shots even then he's you know creating distance but even still it just doesn't feel like he's balanced you know see that in right there boom oh he's hurting now Hagler standing right in front of him when he is touching him but he's he just doesn't have the pop anymore you know what it's like when you're working out and at the end of the workout you're fucking exhausted and you can barely do one rep that's what happens with your arms when you're fighting just they just there's nothing left there's nothing left it's not like you know he's doing this on purpose right he's he doesn't have there's no gas in his arms like his arms are completely flooded right now like all the blood in them and it's just they're not recovering it's a horrible feeling too he's swinging though look he's swinging but it's way slower than it was in the first right right his snap was a snap was so much quicker in the first round now he's now he's not following through a little bit exactly he's trying to conserve energy right screw realizes he can't do this forever he's exhausted there but they both look like they're fucking at that one that little breaking point where it's about to be either I'm telling you Hagler even though he might might look like that because a little fast pace he could do this for years he could do this he just didn't get tired man and you couldn't hurt him was crazy he fought a dude named John the Beast Mugabi and John the Beast Mugabi was fucking terrifying people man he starched Terry Norris he starts to bunch of dudes he was a heavy punch or heavy puncher and Hagler stood right in front of them he got caught with one big uppercut and didn't even budge uppercuts that were like marking people didn't even know in flinch so what round was it is it the third round the third yes the third round here's the third this shows you how fucking tough Tommy Hearns was I mean those two rounds were just fucking knock-down drag-out relent yeah just non-stop but towards the end you clearly see Hagar's coming on I mean he looks good he looks good and he's pacing himself now it's just just moving forward throwing shots but yeah Hearns is exhausted man it's fucking rough man there it is boom boom boom I was trying to keep yeah he's trying to keep him right he's having a hard time breathing though man I mean he's exhausted see that big deep breath so did you take that big sigh it's almost like nah so we lost him mouthpiece I think is that what it was he called his time yeah I think that's what happened I don't know man it's hard to tell it's really blurry for they're just gonna say mad to 240 P was weird back then huh looked normal to us back then your eyes knew how to handle it right well you were just excited that you could see the fight right you know but this was it was I wonder if this would it looks like a woman's on HBO had to Ben do you know HBO just to cancel the boxing they don't have boxing anymore at all at all just pay-per-view now they don't even do pay-per-view they're out of the boxing business what yeah and that crazy so they'll never and he's moving home right hand oh it's done he knew it damn dance it third round gone I always miss this I always think it's just hanging around for some reason I think we've actually gone over this before but third round yeah man I don't have a boxing anymore HBO's got out of the boxing business what do you think that's because of it's not earn enough money anymore I don't know it makes me sad though they had some of the greatest boxing telecasts of all time I mean that was what you would do you'd go if a big fight was on Bernard Hopkins was on a lot of the times it was on HBO yeah and it was on pay-per-view then you knew who's gonna be on HBO the following week right so even if you couldn't afford the pay-per-view you could see it hang in there a week later you knew one but you could watch the fight on HBO I remember going to watch I remember watching fights in HBO I just remember that that HBO boxing being such like a emblematic thing for you know I mean like it's so recognizable so like pay-per-view and HBO so then get out of the game is so strange it's kind of like the revolution that's happening now the last fight I went to with you at UFC now there ESPN what is it plus ESPN plus that is yeah the private paid service it's a subscription service right like a Netflix for sports but it's it's not just UFC fights it's a bunch of other stuff thing well all kinds of shit stuff that just won't show on ESPN at all though no they sometimes show I mean it's ESPN content I guess so you could watch some fights that were on ESPN Plus later they'll probably show them on ESPN sort of like the same thing with HBO pay-per-view yeah you know but um I think what HBO did with pay-per-view was brilliant where you would have the pay-per-view but then let people watch it for free a week later you're just gonna make more fans yeah it's like you're not gonna lose money on the pay-per-view yeah just gonna make more fans well that's the whole idea of like that's why this this this is funny I was gonna talk to you about this anyway I just moved and I canceled my directv I'm done I canceled them I cut the wire and I'm just doing like Hulu live TV yeah Internet shit I'm all the years of hearing people being like cutting the cord cutting the cord I'm like I don't know man I like it now fuck it I love I love what I'm doing now and I gotta tell ya I can get all the shit that I want for cheaper than I had it before and it's just way more convenient now I used to be so tethered to being like I'll never give up cable now I'm like fuck it I don't want it anymore I don't want it this has been the best like I'll always have a blockbuster card oh wait yeah it'll never go away it'll never even Hollywood video dude I want to rent a man if you put all your money in that you're like I'm telling you in 20 years yeah this is gonna mount fifteen million dollars do you think people invested in Netflix when it was the DVD subscription service and that you don't I mean like early on and now they're still getting the the revenue dividends of what Netflix is now I wonder about that oh yeah I'm sure you do like that's got to be the best money cuz it was worth nothing back yeah it was just another subscription video service and they had a there was a ton of them I mean who grandfather's I did my first Netflix special in 2005 oh my god there's one left oh I think I've seen this yeah Oregon Bend Oregon that's so weird the last blockbuster they went from 4855 stores in 2008 to one store in 2018 that is the craziest demolition of a business I've ever heard I would have never heard of what other business in our lifetimes vanished like that like I said like I've come like a storefront I can't think of something that that went away the whole industry yeah on it was Johnny was a part of our huge weekend yeah you go to Blockbuster a huge what do they got right oh you hear anything about this he'd look at the cover my oh I never even heard of this one ever saw maybe it's good watching like obscure Dolph Lundgren movies that were made in Italy yeah you would you get to pick out shit that you're like oh this looks kind of dope we'll see didn't gamble was fun the name meant a lot yeah like it was like this guy from Dances with Wolves oh how can that cool you'll take a chance yeah you well but I think that's happening again now with Netflix I'll take a chance with shit now that I've should have never heard of because Netflix you pop up all these different titles and you'll go mmm I'll try this fucking shit I just started a new show I just tried to show and it's called dead to me with christina applegate christina applegate yeah it's okay but like I try I'll try it I would have never think to to to watch this new show about these you know this have you gone through all these staples at Netflix ed did you watch ozarks yet done watch the ball season yeah nominal one of the best shows I've ever seen did you watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt now I've seen a few episodes of it but I fucking hilarious you it's a people like it but I love that show so it's got the same kind of tone as 30 rock right does it oh yeah hey it's Tina again phase in it - oh she is yeah sometimes she plays these wacky psychologists it's out of her fucking mind likes to party yeah she crazy she has some of the best character development man that's my 30 rock was so good that show is funny man Kimmy Schmidt is funny all right oh well I'll watch it I'll try good try it just it just didn't seem like my show it's absurd yeah give it a chance right becomes really it's really good it was like some dull moments and one of those series but they tighten it up quick they whatever problem they had with writing they fixed it real quick right well I mean first seasons are always hard man but I mean just writing is hard yeah writing for a sitcom so hard they hit rut sometimes you know yeah like sometimes I'll watch old Seinfeld's when they pop on and some of the episodes are just fuckin flawless they're bangers like the B stories just as funny as a story and then sometimes you watch a few and you're like mm yeah they were like they had a tough week tunic you could tell they had a tough go I remember that feeling with the news radio I remember like episodes were just like ooh well we did our best notice how there was with this one yeah they just don't and then you'll have the next one that's just insane and a lot of times it's it's like stand up in that sense that a lot of times it's just like the subjects like what are the subjects like what what juicy topic do you have right you know what uh what what is happening and like you just yeah you have to have something that engages people and sometimes it's sitcoms like fuck you have to put out twenty-something episodes a year yeah twenty-two 23 right 23 short stories of the year that's crazy make them all tie in and have a nice little kind of a perfect through lines of season I know what nowadays a lot of people are relying on on politics which i think is you know it's becoming the new norm every time I see a billboard now it's a new political show it's like Wyatt Cenac just got one Jordan Klepper who was a Daily Show correspondent he just got another one Hasan Minhaj I mean there's like so many political shows now they they should all be writing letters thanking Trump it's like Trump is really fueling all these new shows if weren't for him it was like this new wave of political satire I don't think I've ever I've seen this in comedy in my career I've never seen this many shows about politics Samantha bee I mean I just named five in a row yeah John Oliver show is right that last week tonight or whatever that's essentially a political base show it's it's slightly political but it's very social - yeah it is this point popping out sure it's fucked up right in a week I mean listen he's brilliant and somebody shows are probably great I just think there's so much political comedy right now it's just it's not my shit no Oliver's excellent yeah he's a it's the whole thing is what's what's uncomfortable is that it's very they're very little conversations taking place and a lot of people that are like really angry yeah you know yeah I was watching this guy is something some representative I don't even know his name but he was offering $100 to name the these girls that were in front of a Planned Parenthood and he's like a grown man these they're girls they're young Christian girls what do you name them as in like all their names so he could shame them publicly cool is this guy's name it and but he's offering on this video a hundred dollars like but this is where people have gotten to where they think that that's okay yeah like these people you have like gee I know you're there to support a woman's right to choose but you have to understand that these people think that this is a place where they kill babies yeah right this is what they think whether regardless of what you think right this is why they're there they're not there because they're evil right and I know that this would put unwanted pressure on a girl's going there for an abortion I get it I get the whole thing yeah I get it from your side and I see where they're coming from too and although I fully support a woman's right to choose you you can't want to Doc's people that think they're saving babies or talking someone into having a child that and that child they think will become the kind of relationship with that child and that mother become like their mother and them or like the ideal version of that sure I mean that's what they're not doing it because they're bad people right like there's some groups that do it just because they're pieces of shit like the Westboro Baptist Church like they shoe things because they're bad people like all they want to do is go protest a soldier's funeral they want to cause a stir Megan Phelps who left them right that got out yes yeah and now she did she met a guy on Twitter it's a great story right it's an amazing she's human again well she started talking to people and then investigating in real and dude telling you when you talk to her she is like the nicest most reasonable person to think that just 15 years ago whatever it was ten years ago she was a full-on zealot that's weird and her dad or her uncle grandfather brother Ken him get it right her grandfather is fred phelps he started the whole thing he's the whole dude that old mean guy but do you think it's fact so you believe completely do you completely buy into the fact that she's 100 years of it so none of that's a she's so honest and open about what she felt and why she felt it and why she was conflicted and why I didn't jive with what she was reading in the Bible it didn't make sense to her right and in the way he was doing it which she was realizing was not how Christians did it all over the world right and that this this you know this desire to constantly get attention in the news even at soldiers funerals they would go to soldiers funerals and say that these soldiers are dying because gay people are getting married yeah like what they were saying they deserve to die they deserve to be dead I mean that kind you know but I'm telling you from that and she's like the nicest person you would ever want to meet so she's found some in regulation in her world she realizes it was bullshit and she's tricked and you know she's done a great job to free yourself but when you indoctrinate someone heavily into anything and this is whether it's being a religious zealot or being a political zealot you indoctrinate someone when they're early in their their youth their formal years it's very difficult for them to get out of it it takes real work but that's what I mean that's why I guess I'm saying it sticks with you right like my whole thing is there's things instilled in me from my youth from where I grew up culturally and how I grew up that even though I'm more learned now I still do understand those ways of thinking right so it is hard to break away from those things even though like when you just said the whole like with a woman's right to choose right like I grew up in the Midwest I grew up Catholic this is how I am most of my family is four so in so many words against abortion mm-hmm but I don't think these things are mutually exclusive that you can be against abortion and against women's right to choose you can say that you don't like abortion but also say I'm not going to control what you do with your body it's kind of how I feel I don't love the idea of abortion I'm being honest I just don't love it but I do think I'm not gonna stand here and tell people what to do but I should be able to still say I don't like it I don't think it's I don't think it's a healthy thing to do I don't really enjoy I don't enjoy like the spreading of it being kind of this not a big deal thing but I do think people can do whatever they fucking want to do but I'm also allowed to go I don't I don't I don't love the idea like I don't like it just an option I just don't love it I don't love it birth control is obviously the best method yeah of course and I think women should be more aware but women when they take birth control man they have to I'm not not advocating for abortion as a method of birth control but what I'm saying is when women take birth control pills that shit fucks with them they're not a good thing it's not good and that I know and and when they do it and they also smoke they can cause like real complications you can so a lot it means there's a lot of women have really bad reactions to the pill changes your behavior suicidal tendencies I've heard a lot of like really bad stories now I'm also saying if we want to look at it from a different perspective men should also take way more fucking responsibility then like this is the other side is this this argument tends to land on women a lot where it's like you don't tell me how to fucking you don't tell a woman what to do with the bodies okay that's fine I'm just saying how I don't like it also I don't like guys nothing in women and fucking ghosting and not wanting to raise a child right so I think the other side of it is two parties here should be responsible men should take some fucking responsibility over stop coming inside of these fucking people if you're not ready to have kids I'm just being real it's like either we're a condors or stop stop stop doing the thing that you know makes children yes so you know but again this is this weird balance of like I say I come from this and I'm not conservative but like this really Catholic upbringing in the Midwest you know a good old Irish Catholic boy and the ideas that you hear as a kid all the time you then grow and I now go I think people should be able to do whatever they want to do I'm not gonna fucking control somebody hmm but I still have those little moments of yeah I just don't love it though cuz it was something that was instilled in me as a youth mm-hmm you know I'm it's the same way for years I felt guilty smoking pot because that was like I'm smoking pot for 20 years but I felt guilty for a long time cuz my pet because drugs were so bad yeah it was just like this over well and even today sometimes I get high and I go shabby getting high hey do I have shit to do do am i am i doing something wrong no no I'm a grown up I have all my shit together you're one of the few comedian friends that I know that has this shit together you're grown up trying to just stay stay having my shit together yeah it's a hard task though right it's not easy especially for immature dipshits like us yeah it's and Potts oh this isn't supposed to have Nikki Glaser had a funny she was on stage two in a bit and she just had said this phrase and I kept talking to her about it after it she was like we don't deserve this money and I was like what do you mean we don't fucking we do and she's like we just don't deserve this much money for being so immature as I guess that's got a true it's like we get to be clowny kids and still make a good living meanwhile a guy there's a guy there's an electrician at my house the other day the shit he was telling me I couldn't fucking keep I mean he was sound he was speaking fucking another language and I had no I was like oh you have to have another ground wire because the neutrals are different now this is a two wire system back in nineteen forty six you got over three bar says going on and on and on and on I was like you deserve more money like you're worth more money I don't know why I have more money than you do you do much more important shit it's all about with I guess with money right it's all about reach you know what we were talking about earlier today about how much money Facebook and Google and all these people make from ads and how weird it is that like you look for something then instantly those ads start popping up instantly I'm referencing Sam Harris's podcast again I don't remember which one it was it was fairly recently he had a guest on and they talked about the the commodity of your data right the commodity of your searches like what and and who's selling that and how they're how they're profiting off of that and that this was like this commodity that nobody thought they were giving up they nobody thought there was anything to it right and these companies have found this loophole and have made billions of dollars through it by giving you free email by giving you a free web browser by giving you free searches basically providing you with all the information in the world right what they want from you is want to know what you're interested in that's all this big deal kind of like the real-world example would be those trash companies that are like you have a garage full of shit we'll come pick it up for free right you don't know what's in that fucking garage right some people are so old they just throw shit out and they go I just get rid of it fuck it you know you know those storage wars shows I guess yeah fake yeah they do they set them up they load up the stores yeah and they believe we found a

stupid have you ever watched the show ghost hunters do you know who our Ghost Adventures yes do you know this guy zak bagans do you know this guy i do not know him personally oh man he makes me laugh so fucking hard because they've done like nine seasons now I don't even know how many dozen I found any girls come on man they have all this great technology now that you think that he believes in ghosts here's the best part okay he is all in right I love anybody it's all in whatever they're doing to have to be okay host he's all into adventure but also now he's super self aware of their popularity and of his character caricature of himself so he does it now on purpose he took off his shirt one episode and he goes you want to fucking fight me ghost let's fucking go do toe up throw a fucking punch you're like he's aware of his character that is this bro a ghost fist fighter this dude is Brendan Schaub has shop he looks like he just got a long time Shane Carwin sparring sessions like what yeah he's still in the fight he's still out of it with the beard no no that is that dude right there so Zach where's ed hardy type of shirt right he wears he's loud ridiculously battered shirt right but he's you got to see it do a more newer episode do something from like 2009 to 18 you'll see what he looks like now he's gotten way more fucking jacked his hair his hair is all flaked up you know he's got like more Tanner on and shit he's become do you think this becomes super self-aware think that he believes in ghosts no I think he's just self aware of the product he's created really that he understands now that's a challenge I see the next whiskey ginger podcast you me and Zach Zach Zach that's him right there right like now he's like Holly he looks like a Hollywood guy he's got these big black frame glasses funny like you can't he can't look any better you know you don't allowing him to have better style fucking good as fuck in Hollywood his spiky hair he went Hollywood the fart I'll tell you that's the one thing I know I won't do is I'll never get to a place when I'll be wearing clothes where I used to make fun of them like that like I remember going this guy's wearing a fucking $900 t-shirt I know now I can't do that like I can't I can't get I can't do that now cuz I used to shit on it so much yeah you have to mind by the rules of your own well if I if I pushed it out there for so long what's that he's got a nice hats him yeah it looks good his hat shaming set your buddy would say the most recent photo Jamie that's do i zoom in real quick I thought you're trying to say some handsome fella cute guy Jamie I want you to grow your facial hair just like that do you really think do you really think he doesn't believe in ghosts I think he does not believe in ghosts I think he I think he loves the paranormal right he loves the idea of the paranormal Stan I think he loves the idea of forces at nature happening molecules energies around us all influencing the way we act sure I don't think he believes in actual apparitions or what do they could they call him spirits on his EVP we felt the spirit they'll do this thing well they'll see a little orb or a light this happens all the time with cameras when you switch to night vision and not these little de flecks of dusk kind of reflect light off the lenses and he'll go put an orb and they'll you know watch it float through the lens and he's obsessed about these orbs they enter the orb and he does this voiceover shit yeah lots a fucking joke I get hide i watch it it's maybe one of my favorite things what's the Jamie you're a photographer what's the scientific explanation for those little balls that show up in photographs what is it I don't have the knowledge for that but I it could be explained lots of different ways it's mostly probably like a light flare of some kind just breaths because there's just no stammered through that so few signs but like in this lens here there's like five different pieces of glass so there's just at whatever angle you're holding it depending on where the light source is coming from it it might create an artifact which would be alright so if you're dealing with a really nice camera like that one but what about like with one of them bullshit one of those zipping and shoot ones that's like less just why there would be some one that is probably because it's less it's less good it's it's less and not the right word but uh less technology in there I don't know I don't know I can't explain honestly well what we should because orbble of ours right now freaking out my god there are angels anytime an orb passes near a human he'll go watch Joe's reaction as the orb goes behind his head yeah and you change your eyes it was amazed you don't believe in fucking ghosts do I believe in every you don't believe in comes all in with everything knock that foot scatter back scatter the artifact can result from the back scatter or retro reflection of light from airborne solid particles such as dust or part but I sell it or liquid droplets especially rain or mist it can also be caused by foreign material within the camera's lens so these dots are blurred images of dust particles M night shamalamadingdong should make a movie and in that movie about it should be called call him that anymore that's really rude is it though it's kind of funny I'm not its Shyamalan that's his fucking Shamma Lamma that you racist what's wrong with you man he makes him good goddamn movies God he takes some crazy risks but I love The Sixth Sense that was a great fuck come on every I love the Village People didn't like that and see I thought the village the end of it I was like where what about Plains what they they they don't they don't show any planes going over big it would have to be yeah avoid all the planes well they have to be nasty places where nobody's remote cuz they made it out to the road and then instantly they got to the road people like hey they're like st. Louis is like right there you know what I like those ghosts no devil the one was in the elevator yeah day yeah that was a good one yeah it was good those good it's good he takes chances like hey wait that's this reminds me of Utah when you talk about that island that private island do you sense in a lot sense sense or sensible north central island yeah planes still fly over that or no are they not allowed as a restricted airspace I don't think it's restricted no but you can't land there and you can't circle right you can't visit India owns it right doesn't it doesn't India control the leaves yeah and it's like ten mile radius mm-hmm I saw a thing online I said a boat crash there and you could still see on Google Images the remnants of the boat yeah they came for the people in the boat too and the helicopters got them off the boat right as the people were like pulling up and oh so they lit rafts and shit yeah fuck yeah they they live but those the villages were coming for them Wow yeah can you imagine stumbling across a village they've been fucked with sometime in the past you know that commander Maurice Vidal Portman yeah yeah shout-out to respectable law on Twitter he has a giant thread about it it may be pinned on the top of his Twitter page but explaining like one of the reasons why those people are so hostile right and it has to do with this British explorer who was really kinky and he went there to fuck yeah who knows he wanted to fucking Island he has what he did but people got sick because of them you know this I had this guy Graham Hancock yeah and he was talking to me about all the different shit they're finding in the Amazon and in South America and that they used to be 20 million people that lived in the Amazon and they died off because of sickness they were visited mostly apparently Europeans when they came in like the 1500s they would tell these incredible stories about these huge civilizations in the Amazon but then when explorers came back 200 years later there was nothing there and they were like this is crazy they they lied they must have lied but it turns out they didn't lie what happened was smallpox ran through the fucking jungle and like everybody we did it and then these the jungle just overtook these cities and now they're finding these cities with something called lidar they use these planes and they circle over this area or helicopters whatever the fuck they do and they shoot this shit down this lidar it's like laser radar and it gives you a detailed image of what's below the surface and what's their shit and it shows them all these crazy structures all these like like roadways and irrigation systems and circles inside of a square like it was villages and cities and millions of people probably lived there look at it that's all stuff they're finding not yeah and all of it was swallowed up by the jungle they think within like a hundred years just vanished in the jungle Wow because it's so so lush and tropical down there dude it was the one of the most amazing podcasts I've ever done to listen in that guy tell this story right after this one though no you are the best this is kind of well this is like it this is like the findings of Atlantis right like when they started finding you start finding some more land under missing this they've found traces of five drugs including dimethyltryptamine on a thousand-year-old South American ritual KMT basically that's like proof positive evidence that at least 1,000 years ago they were using ayahuasca Wow this was the drug pouch that was made from Fox and outs that's so crazy fuck knows it literally when you see it it looks like an O they used everything and the first reason it looks really nice a nose I wonder why they do that with a fox it's like some cleverness so know that that's what a shaman that's like literally what a shaman is supposed to that's what the the definition is supposed to be in certain cultures huh sure certain cultures it's a clever fellow that's who the the shaman is okay it kind of makes sense they are just clever fellows but I mean imagine that like he takes a fox that clever little fucker I'm gonna take his face in his face chipmunk cheeks Yeah right oh good yeah little powdered sugar pouches that hangs from your belt is just chipmunk cheeks what about the dumbest animal you could have stuff in what would be the worst Hannah little put stuff in skunks yeah skunks are the fucking work raccoons our records are actually kind of smart you know do you know skunks are predators those little creeps they are yeah yeah brother they were coming from my chickens oh yeah they try to eat your chickens you want to kill your chickens they skunk up this for this spray and shit no they're just there to kill they they only spray things when things come near them when they're an or when they're about to die right that's the threat when they think they're gonna die they just admit that yeah it's like so many animals are able to do that we're like one of the only species that don't know how to fake death to avoid actually dying right a lot of species will hide or change colors or shapes or amid something to give the other species the the the thought that they are dead or deceased or that they've you know they're gone we don't do we don't we're the owners Donal if you're running away from a fight you can't just pretend to be dead and then they'll stop fucking you fuck you up well human beings oh well I think humans and chimps - they want retribution yeah they want revenge we love vengeance man that's like our favorite thing in the world yeah a guy almost fucking hit me four times today I wish I got his license plate I call him out on here hunt and he was cutting me off he kept trying to hit like hit my car after I why he cut me off in a big like f-350 truck and then I gave him one of these fucking hog like dude I mean just miss my car you know then I move on well he pulls over next to me gives me the finger and then tries to like pull in my fucking lane like he's if he's gonna hit my car out of ism I was like okay he just knows he just knows his car hits my car his car has barely any damage on it he knows a big f-350 truck his tire is the size of my fucking car he was a dick but he wanted shit so it's like now vindictively I hope I see him again like now I just want to fucking see him again somewhere in the city just just this guy I want to have that moment with him again see him outside of his fucking big truck that's funny yeah we love we like I I I don't hold grudges like Bobby Lee and I were talking about it Bobby holds the biggest grudges on earth he has some of the worst I mean he's like 20-year grudges really oh my god yeah Bobby Lee ask him about it he genuinely when someone does the wrong thing to him like I'm not talking like makes a bad mistake when someone does something where you're like that's fucked up that can fuck up a friendship he will hold that against you for the rest of time that's it that's it where some people would go whatever man I forgive you shit happens mmm now he's he holds a fuckin garage did bad that little tiny ball rice ball has a lot of fucking vengeance inside is he's my little dumped how dare you know I'm allowed to say that man I'm allowed to say that because I because I used to own Bobby I used to buy bought him for a month how much did it cost sixty five grand that's a lot you anything and you have to feed him he doesn't really require that much food then why does he get to own you that's part of the deal right he won't do for a month ten years later yeah ten years later he owns you for a whole model of me for a month yeah then he's gonna be stewing on it for ten years that okay ah you can own me for one month yeah and I'll do it over the fuck you want but then I own you for one month ten years from now that's a great movie by the way there's a crazy deal it's alive meanwhile like nine years later dudes just drinking and chain-smoker try to kill for a month there'll be like indentured servitude right mostly was people that were too poor to make journeys or to do something so they would give up a certain amount of like they would make a contract like they would work for someone for a certain amount of time right that's essentially how it was set up yeah I mean that's basically that's what it is right basically saying like but it's yeah is it like a slate I mean I guess the conditions probably varied you know one of the grossest ones I've ever saw was a vise did a piece about Dubai I believe it was and about some people who are unscrupulous construction people would take these folks in from third world countries and promised them all this money to work there and then they take their passports away from them and then pay them a fraction of what they're supposed to pay for them so they're trapped and they were living in squalor trapped they don't have their passport anymore during the wrong human trafficking is what it is I mean it's the same as when they do to these young girls they had these girls come over the United States you know I think it was a documentary on Netflix about these like young Russian models right Nicki these girls modeling contracts they live in a you know like a four bedroom apartment two girls to a room right and they essentially you know fuck them around for a little while with small little weird maybe random gigs and then they're like hey if you want to make more money you could always sell your body or sell pictures of you nude makes way more money and they think it's kind of part of this modeling thing and this is like a Content I think it was a I think was on Netflix but it was all about these girls getting trapped and they can't go back they don't have enough money and this this modeling aging agencies these were these man and manager agencies there well we have to keep your money and we'll give you like a salary so to speak we pay your rent will give you food it sounds horrible but if it was dudes I wouldn't care at all yeah these five handsome guys came over from Russia looking to get some pussy and drive Ferraris but it wasn't really working out for them to like get a job the job that's what you yeah the fuck did you think is gonna happen you're just gonna get pussy and Ferraris get out of here bro okay I'm good-looking I thought this would make me make me listen I'm sorry I can't give you any modeling gaze but if you want to make some money fuck this old lady so so how much for two grand for me she's my girl and you fuck that old lady okay so you got to do do I have to come or just hang with her for a while he's gotta go she has to she asked him I have to work with her today she come yeah see I work with her okay yeah be a good act but no eating pussy I can't do that oh you have to eat pussy I have to yeah three grand they don't even shave old ladies they gave up okay so eat hairy bush for two grand I'll do grand 3 grand I would imagine right how much sympathy would you have otherwise to show gigolo that was on Showtime I didn't but I know shop watched it I know Tom and Christina loved it a lot why is it that shop we're on the road so they stick it ran its course is on flex of the guys by the way every TV show I've done is only gone for like two years but gigolos gets Jesus Christ that is crazy it's a very that's a very good tell by the way there's like not a lot of these these uh this whole like the culture of male gigolos I think they said percentage-wise it's like unbelievably smaller these guys that get into the gigolo world and stay they all get they get in they get out most women I get into sex work last significantly longer than these dudes Wayne wait long for very you know varied reasons but I think the gigolo thing is kind of like a moment in a man's life where he's like okay I'm not you fucking try it some young like fun-loving free-for-all it's like open mind I'll just give it a whirl then he gets right out I don't think that happens for girls at all I think women stay in sex would you feel bad for some dude who was working as a gigolo and his pimp was Suge Knight and his pimp was making them go out there be that pussy know how to make that money the website for it I just know the website for it yeah that's really good poetry this guy what's going on up in Armani what's going on with he works at the coffee shop around the corner from my house why is he wearing a shirt like that that's Assad says look dude Bradley Lord if you could sling dick and get paid good luck to you look some people yeah do it some people out there working as a masseuse that do not like touching people okay tell me how much different that is that's a bummer though how much different is that then being able to be a guy wear nice shirts like that and occasionally got a bang broads you don't want to wear a nice shirt no horrible look you get some no fun with the world could be worse do you remember Richard Gere wasn't he a gigolo in one of his movies who is he didn't you have a movie called gigolo we'd like bang old ladies I don't know if it's called gigolo but yeah I think it was called gigolo that's right and how much boy you must love this shit did you yeah you know my gear was up there banging ladies here's what they don't tell you most of that money in that gigolo world is sucking dick okay you want to go out there and suck that dick you can make that money but if you just want to bang old ladies whoa look at the difference that's when he was young that's when he was how it got to be like 20 to 23 he was pretty young and handsome and then father Tom done fucking molly-whopped my time got him Marvin Hagler on Thomas Hearns third round I remember when he went on stage in New York after 9/11 who did the Richard Gere did and was trying to tell the audience that they should choose love and that went on state state we're on stage she was on stage at some sort of a benefit Oh red for 911 yeah it's right after 9/11 and he was saying essentially that you know great message just at the time people were just bloodthirsty and they booed him they're like fuck you what is he saying fuck you it's basically saying let's not have military action more people shouldn't die because of some things rights people did to us he's saying try to figure out a different way to do this yeah yeah I mean he's a Buddhist I believe I mean he's really like he's really close pals with the Dalai Lama yeah but but but in the interest of talking about what we're talking about revenge means a lot it's kind of hard to tell America to not get revenge on somebody right we love revenge well yeah well we love getting back people that try to fuck with us even if we go even if we go way deeper than they did we're warlike monkeys yeah we love it when we we wasn't when we think we're being attacked like retribution and revenge is who were just talking about earlier about chimps chimps do that too yeah natural it's yeah it's nature nature nature you want to get revenge motherfuckers like we were talking about that guy who got ripped apart by the chimp right to bring a birthday cake dude see other chimps that did it because they were jealous they were angry that jealous of never getting that birthday cake didn't get shit and someone fucked up and left the gate open and they came out fuck that dude up he risked his limbs off it tore his face part just because he wouldn't give them didn't bring cake for them with a female chimp now there man where's my cake losing it cake must be so must've been good ass fucking cake to do a chimp that doesn't understand what cake is like how the fuck did you do this but they do understand what cake is right will they understand it once you get it to him the gem yeah it's something it's it's that's like a powerful or be brought that's how you won we're in Costa Rica and there's monkeys everywhere they're crazy cool cool ass monkeys but they're a little sketchy I know I got married down there and oh you did Costa Rica yeah yeah they're out they're out of their fucking mind we were hanging out with them and there's a thing called a quwata Monday you know what that is now they look like a like a raccoon monkey thing it's a weird creature a ronke and they would come up we were staying at this resort and they would just come right down the the pathway to where you're your daughter your room was as they just hang out with you like these quad Mondays just hang out you could feed them grapes and shit they would take them right out of your hands yeah but it like no danger at all they were like super chill and friendly so we gave this koala Mundi some grapes and then he laid down and took a nap under my chair I just took a fucking that's like a dog it was a dog like the most chill dog of all time and my god damn these things are cool like we were just sitting there just check oh go ahead buddy tickets take a nap you're safe here again some grapes and people want to want chimps at their house people love the idea of having them so the monkeys came over and we only had that's what a quarter Monday looks like dude they're the shit there's they're such cool little animals it does kind of look racoon ish my daughter's gave him a fake name like they were calling him a kinkajou they just decided to call to kinkajou likes more fun yeah nature's made their own word up I think I don't think that's real word a lot of Monday but that little guy was so cool such an interesting little fella when you just will gently take grapes right out of your hand gently right the most chill dog of all time so anyway we we were out of grapes and these monkeys showed up and they're they're like hanging out like a little looking like what do you got for us these guys hungry no real month oh oh that's not a monkey that's like a I don't know what that is I don't know what a quwata Monday is what family is what is that anyway we gave these Mikey like I don't know if we should give these monkeys oreos it's kind of fucked up but it's not good for them I looked at one of them only had one hand like well that's not good for him either fucking hand bit off gave him that he snatched it from me and he opened it up and then started chewing the white stuff just like the cream yeah he's one of us but he already knew about he knew dick he's probably getting Oreos for his whole life from people that stay at the resort he knows the trick yeah he knew what the fuck to do hold you well they make you at this you know they're all open-air houses you rent on the beach you know that everything's pretty open except for the bedroom is the only thing that's closed off and they had latch locks padlocks on the refrigerator and I was like what he guys locked that up and they're like the monkeys know how to get into all that shit they know how to open the door and then get in the drawers he's like dude they knew how to they know how to open up egg cartons they know how to open the lid and take eggs and close the lid I'm not kidding he's that they're that smart so in the middle of the night the first night that we were there I I hear the gate kind of rustling and then I hear movement and I'm like someone's in the fucking huh cuz it's on the beach it's wide open so of course I like grab something is the biggest thing I could find next man I'm out there like hey hey you know like a nut bag in my fucking ah I'm yelling of course I look it's just monkeys chillin trying to like get shit in the house they're trying to find shit laying around food drinks whatever it was and of course I go back to bed and every night I would hear them come and go but you'd hear them try the refrigerator they even pulling on it to see if the latch was like if we left it unlocked they're smart they look they learn they learn all the little tricks of where you put stuff cabinets I could hear a cabinets opening and closing yeah they were smart man that's so weird it's like a little person it is most a little sneaky yeah it'll be fuck using and they and they put purposely up up in this place that I was at they purposely string wire from house to house to house so the monkeys kind of had freedom to go up above because if they would go down by the road it would cause more traffic and disturbances and all that stuff so they keep them up in the canopy so they put rope purposely house to house and treat a tree that humans put up so they have easier pathways to get down to the water because they say when they're down on the ground it's more distracting there's you know it's a lot harder to drive they they create little messes down below so if they keep them up high it's better for them it was crazy man Wow a little creature they can swing from tree to tree they fly up and down treetops like that from shit just what most like people sometimes you I see one just hang and it'll be staring right at you but they're almost like people they're so good that are that a right fucking there well the weird the weirdest thing is that if if evolution is happening all the time I'll give this little monkey is him breaking into a house yeah watch watch this watch how smart look if it give me those chips I love these fucking chips I love that it looks like he's looking right out the person - yeah he is oh wow he just takes off with the chips dude they know which ones they eat them they know what you want to say like guys just be nice to him what happens if you feed him you can't no they tell you not to feed him what happens because well then they know to keep coming back and where they can get food you like monkeys no they say if they interview and they say if you don't reduce when you stop feeding them after you fed them enough then they start to get aggressive so then you shoot one you send a message right and then they all come back and get a lot of fucking 12-gauge and you blow the little face off one of those cunts and you make you're trying to go hey you guys want free food you'll get it but you get it on my arms Magni go back inside you just described a plot for Planet of the Apes it's literally like the plot get them hooked you get them hooked yeah you bait that I'm hooked on food yeah you bait them there's a lot of places like that where where animals are dependent on people they were depending on people to feed them it's it's a little squirrely like what there's a place in I think it's Jamaica where people swim with wild pigs know why yeah now wild pigs generally avoid people yeah they don't want have anything to do with you yeah they're dangerous yes sketchy yeah wild boars are nuts yeah but in this place people have been feeding these things for so long they have trips like tourist trips right where people fly in feed these pigs and swim around with them hey guys so they got wild pigs that are constantly being fed by people but a friend of a friend went there and someone they were with got bit oh yeah I've heard they beat them in the ass a bit one of the one of the pigs bit them in the ass and it was because they didn't have any food or something like that they didn't offer him anything you have to keep feeding them throughout the whole thing you all about that they that they get really ornery they get really annoyed fuck you fucking fuck you just drown it just put it right under no bro those they're strong now they are you can't fuck with it's just a creepy animal because they're beautiful and they're sweet and the like pigs are there a weird one and I was there look at school look I'm a dog lover I love dogs now pigs are almost like a dog and maybe smarter clothes they're probably definitely smarter but they like the way that we react to people and like if you feed them and you're their friend you become their buddy but are you against eating them no but also looks have killed them I know they're little wild ones but wild ones are different man right because they're out there hustling ok they don't they're not in this fucking pen getting slop all day trying to fatten them up right it's hard to get fat out there they're out there is much more lean meat out there they're much leaner but they're also vicious man they're vit to grow these giant tusks they have these big fucking fangs and the crazy thing is there's the same species as a domestic pit right it's the same man just once ones ones pampered and ones not exactly ring up have you ever seen javelinas do you know what happens are so in Arizona a peccary well when I saw those it looks just like a pig yeah that was my friend when I first moved to Arizona I saw one and I was like oh what the fuck is that thing and my buddy was like no no don't go that they they'll come right at you they will fucking go for your legs bad because they're real low to the ground but he's like they'll start spearing you and they'll come at your legs and one time I was valeting in college and I was up away and then up in the mountain and it's some dudes you know some private huge private residence and they're with packs I mean packs of them and I could hear them rustling around and they were like positioning themselves because I was we were part in cars where they were living and I was like we can't park cars up there you can tell they started to get aggressive and jumping and diving at the cars yeah they were getting annoyed man I was like we can't go back up there we're gonna get fucked up by these little bullshit pigs you know we're stanhope lives out in Bisbee which is real close to the border they have them all over the place they're everywhere they killed one of his friends dog they do kill dog they well they they're known to kill cats more but yeah they do kill dogs because dogs are about depend on the size of your dog they're some of those some dogs could fuck those things up because they're not that big but they they're known as murder cats it was a small dog I think I think they flanked it and just came at it from the sides of or rip apart a dog what do you do when someone something like that kills your dog are you out with a shotgun trying to find the rest of them dude I was trying to kill coyotes up they ate my chickens and I don't give I mean I loved chickens like they're cute they're my friends but when they died a couple them died of just natural causes yeah oh poor little guy but if my dog died I'd be really sad you know I mean there's a it's a different relation so when these coyotes killed my chickens i sat out there on the porch with a bow and a rangefinder waiting to fuck them up for days I even tied one of the dead chickens that they killed to a pot like you know that you would plant yes in what are you doing Jamie the pot that you plant things in and I sat in the middle of the yard as bait right and I sat up there waiting David one of them came and my daughter screamed out a coyote you know my goddamn teeth right on like I had that motherfucker yeah that's it was inside of these inside of 40 yards and he was creeping in I was like all I had to do is get to my spot and I would probably got shot yeah how 40 yards that's a far away whoa he was at 40 yards when my daughter screaming oh shit well then there's like freaked out fuck I stayed up there for a few hours longer what's the what's the furthest that you can feel comfortable hitting a target that's a little target you know there's a difference between something that's the size of a coyote coyote is only like they're not paying their body might be like a foot a foot and a half yeah they're not big at all the other time from top to bottom so we're trying to if you're trying to hit them in the vitals you don't have a lot to aim at it's a very specific dot yeah you want to be you'd want to be fairly close I think about that all the time law with a rifle you could shoot him loud that's nothing that's something totally different I'm trying to kill him I only grew up shooting rifles I never shot a gun until I was in my 20s but rifles I was so used to shooting I got so accustomed to shooting it and then I try to bow once and that was unbelievably fucking hard you should learn it'd be fun for you can always come here and pry out come next time John Dudley comes into town I'll have them hook you up I'm Teachman here and you did love it man not even like to go hunting but just to shoot targets it's really fun and I like though that game out due to yeah that game out there that I have that uh techno hunky once you get into that and start playing that once your should add a screen yes yeah once you're fuckin good at so fun I had Corey Anderson UFC light heavyweight he's a hunter I had him here the other day and II was playing it is it good he's really good but you could tell like right he practice it's a fuckin elite athlete fighter so he's got this discipline mindset right he's and you know he's just on the ball but you could say right away when you're playing him like oh my god is so addictive I'm like this is the most addictive game of all time once you started it's hard to get let it go if you're an actual bow hunter you you only get to shoot a thing like a couple times a year yeah you know if you're going a lot if you're going a lot like the idea that you're gonna shoot a lot of like if you're some Remy Warren type character or Cameron Haynes yeah you'll shoot a bunch of deer a year and you live off those that's what he does though yeah but if you're a regular person like you think how many deer you think you're gonna find how many deer you think you gonna sneak up on if you're lucky wanted to you know like the moment when it happens it's such a big moment you like fuck here it is here it is trying to stay calm try and stay calm but with that thing you're shooting at them all the time it's just fun so it's in your head right so like what I'm seeing is this animal moves and moves into the pocket boom the release pop and it hits it perfect and you see it over and over and over and over and over again so what you learn from martial arts or what you learn from stand-up it's the same thing that applies to bow hunt right it's about repetition the more you can do it and the more you see it over and over and over again right the more that pattern becomes your mind so that game for a guy like Corey or someone like me you bow hunts that games like holy shit this is what I've been looking for right see a real animal walk into range and that because you always want to be ethical right you want to be able to shoot the right animal you want to be able to hit it exactly where you want where it expires very quickly right the best way to do that is no sufferings so this game is just super addictive what's a call with a game called it's called techno hunt techno on and you you score against each other so if you and I were playing you like you give 10 points for a bull's-eye eight points for the vitals you get like five points for headshots worth a shot no no it would have to be a very small something about headshots learning like playing gun games first-person shooter games over the years headshots are always the most rewarded thing like a headshot but you don't want to do that with an animal you do if you have a rifle and you want it to die instantaneous and it is a it's the way they do it that some hunters that are chefs do it when they like hunters who are chefs there's there's two different kinds of hunters right there's hunters that eat the meat and they but they want they want to shoot amateur animal because that's what everybody strives for like if you're a skilled hunter like you're a Stephen Rinella or someone like that what you're trying to get is an old wise animal right it's already spread its DNA yeah and it's mature and it's probably the end of its breeding cycle that's what a guy like that wants what he's he's like the ultimate hunter right what he wants is the the most fair chase he's never hunts in high fence operations the most fair chase the wildest animal and he wants to get the oldest mature one but then there's chefs and chefs believe some of them do it's very debatable that the younger animals taste better than the older animals so they're not trying to get an old mature animal they're trying to get a young tender animal that isn't like fully muscled life and right worn out with yeah you you want something you want some still tenderness to it some softness to the muscle but then there's people like Hank Shaw who's a also a world-famous chef who's also a hunter who prefers older animals cuz he thinks there's like there's flavor to them and there's life to them like that they're aging and all their life experience that comes out if you cook them correctly right it just requires a different sort of preparation right it's kind of like it's kind of like a young woman versus older women mmm like young women have a lot of positives about them but older women have just as many positives about them older women that have liked more flavor that's what you want right you want a chick who's like yeah who didn't give a 6 plus who hits the gym every day that's trust me i-i've had this conversation about the whole night cuz one if we stop working out it's over I say if we stop working for like we if we stop exercising and caring about our health it's all there it's over that's we use of fact no I mean like I wanted a sign I wanted my one of my lawyer as a joke to sign a document it says if we if we get fat it's like free and clear gone but I mean it if she gets fat about if I get that she should be out if either of us break this thing that we're doing together what if it brings you closer that we've that she gets fat enough to worry about body image anymore fuck yeah just let yourself go fuck that come on fuck that shit hey hey shaming yeah I know you don't watch show you fat fuck I can't believe you I just think I think we've made a bond together we made a pact we're like we both want to stay relatively healthy and take care of ourselves so in our older years like my parents are both in really great shape because they've cared their whole lives not to a point of like you know not having fun they still have a great fucking time but no but just named Steve consistent with a caring about what you put in your body and the way you work at us simple shit so yeah if she gets fat by if I get that she's by 2 if I get fucking fat she's gone she even said it she was like I'll leave your fat ass being fat is such a weird one that people call people fat who aren't fat right I mean fucking no but I'm just saying like as an insult it's such a weird one it is because like girls will call girls fat like that fat bitch look at our like I was not fat no what you think it's a dick it's a loogie you you fat fuck the guys who say that the guys that like barely have any fat on that fuck you know the cheeseburger Jamie you for that fat fuck that it's an easy day yeah it's an easy insult dude I had a girl call me fat at the comp there's a video of it online a girl calling me fat at the Comedy Store to pull up my recently show my six-pack no like what a long time now I was like you're just crazy but it was like am i fat like what where you coming up with that you're fucking you're fat I bet you're we it's a weird thing the the the fact that the body can carry excess tissue yeah it's a mistake like I get it it's a good way to store fuel it's a point why he's still hungry what kind of shitty system do we have you're this big and you're still hungry didn't the tank bother you should say hey bro bro bro bro stop we got the fuel but it does not put your body's working off carbohydrates that's a problem right it's not burning fat no that's why that whole ketogenic diet works as much as people don't like to think that it does I know there's so much controversy about that like from non-scientist which is hilarious if you talked to actual scientists like Dom D'Agostino who talked to you about the peer-reviewed research that's been done on ketogenic States and all the different benefits and what you know how it could be healthy and how he does it and ketones esters and all these different factors you have to take into consideration the ketone testing and blood testing there's all these knuckleheads saying it's bad for you it's not a good idea like Julian Michael's like it's not a good idea right it's a normal state it's a normal state for your body to burn fat yeah and in it you have more clarity and you also you're not as hungry you're not as hungry during the day right might my problem with it is I don't think it's the best thing for performance I think like you have a little bit more energy if you burn glucose to because even like the top there's a Zack bitter he wouldn't win though American he ran 20 he ran a hundred miles in like 11 hours around a track these guys that could do this shit it was some crazy record two miles and I need to chill for a minute some crazy some crazy record for under mile record he broke 11 hours 40 minutes a hundred fucking miles now he is on primarily a carnivore diet all meat all meat rib eyes and barely barely any meat and fat barely any greens right barely any greens but then when he competes he takes a lot of glucose like he'll take like glucose gel like those gels as a child packets and those the runners use yeah he he pounds in that shit pounds in the carbs so he could burn that off too right you know cuz he's living off like fat and protein but when he competes he doesn't do that and the thing I think that's the key you're saying when he competes he does use the glucose but when he's done competing he does right then he goes back to putting his body in a fight a fat-burning state it's uh it's just pure fun of our diets are kind of crazy that like you just just meet mm-hmm but nothing else it's all the ain't man I know Jordan Peterson has done it now for over a year and he released his blood work or the results of his blood work at least everything's in range everything's healthy everybody takes a supplemental vitamin nothing he doesn't do anything he eats steak with salt on it and he drinks water and I'm telling you that's if he listen to me man if he gets a Perrier with lime in it he'll spit it out he doesn't want the lime in a fucking parry and yes crazy that's too much lost 50 pounds 50 50 pounds lost 50 pounds he had some serious immunological issues immunological said that'll work you know yeah it sounds made up yeah I don't know he had serious immune deficiency he had immune deficiency you mean illogical but doesn't it sounds phony yeah sounds fake immunology is the word my name you Knology you know but immunological sounds bullshit sounds like it took two words and put a big sophistication sophistication eat some serious issues has helped yeah dude also suffered from depression all that stuff look a lot of what they think that a lot of the issues that people suffer from they suffer because of inflammation and when scientists are studying things at the carnivore diet what what what's striking to them almost more than the fact that you're just eating meat is that you're not eating all these other things and so that in giving your body only one food source to deal with sometimes your body can eliminate a lot of the issues that it has and it also mimics like some of the benefits of fasting it's I'm too stupid to be really judging this I don't know I'm listening at all that I know that I'm fucking dumb - he had like receding gums he had some serious gum issue that all went away all these things went away when he was on that carnivore diet for you eat like that I'm not saying eat like no I don't eat like that I think I think it's got to be a balance I think I think some people may work with that right but they'll also tell you there somebody diets that people do that their blood doesn't line up with that diet it's not good for them right some people it just works with right some people yeah some people can have higher intakes of red meat and other people it's really really bad for their system just because of the way their blood is well some people are literally allergic to it right some people like like my wife needs way more iron like needs like it has to have it yeah so whether it's supplemented by pills or by higher instance of meats with higher iron in it I heard kinda has a lot of vitamins in it and some iron I'm not I can't produce anymore man none that cut off my balls dude I turned him in yeah what did what caused you to turn them in what was the final straw was this movement downtown LA at your own gender yeah I went to the me to thing and I cut off my balls I left him there so I donated them if you like if people started calling for that if girls started calling for that guys would do it remove yours guys out there that would there is a certain there's a so many there's so many people there if you called for guys to step out into the middle of the town square and cut their own balls off at least a couple guys and show that's just I can name two dissenters there's a couple of dudes I know that would fuck it exactly just for like Twitter cred yeah just for some Street yeah just for the retweet some love this is how you are an ally boys learn like my feel like we're favorite like your favorite shirts yeah females kick ass or what is it women kick ass or whatever yeah yeah yeah that hold the idea of like a virtue signaling overt or overt support for something it's so see-through when you're like I'm here for you girls it's so see-through that's such a crock of shit but the you can feel that way without yelling it all the time we pull you also like broadcasting like that like what what are you doing yeah what are you doing what's the purpose yes what I'm like why why are you reaching out yeah you're supporting what are you supporting what is happening it's another instance of the echo-chamber doing the whole supporting the thing that I don't think people are really I talk about it on stage about the trend you know Trent the word transphobic / like I understand the meaning but I also think it's hyperbolized in in essence of like there are these large groups of people that are against trans people I don't believe that whatsoever but they were definitely are I think there's small groups of people that get a lot of attention mm-hmm I don't think there's massive look the KKK is significantly larger of a group than whatever group you want to formulate of a transfer of transphobic nature I know a lot of people don't even know what that is I haven't done any statistical research look how many KKK members are in the United States are tens of thousands okay how many people people I think people religious that that don't believe in trans people or they don't think that they should be able to call themselves a woman I think I think most of those people don't care enough to call themselves part of that category they just disagree they go I don't really like it I don't get it I think I think there's more of those than there are people that are like adamantly against trans rights I think we have to take into consideration what we already said about God's willing to cut their balls off that there are guys like that oh sure there are some there are so many people in this country are you Aaron tu there's a lot of transphobic people a lot because maybe you listen man if you read the comments and I don't and I didn't but someone told me that the comments in the Eddie Izzard Instagram posts that are made we're horrific but don't you think that is an Internet fodder see that's my thing is I think people like to say shit on the internet even if they don't believe it because they know that gets attention if they go fuck this fucking dude looks like a chick that I don't know what they said maybe they were just making fun of the way he looks but you can you can assume what if fucking people write on the internet about that issue they would just go what's up with this fuck oh here I'll give you an example I tweeted the other day about the Met Gala Harry Styles I tweeted he was wearing like a a lot of men were wearing like dresses at the Met Gala this was a whole thing and I tweeted Tilda Swinton looked fire at the Met Gala because he looked like Tilda Swinton not coz I'm saying like who's Tilda Swinton fuckin actress who has short hair right so right that was him and I said Tilda Swinton looked fire at the Met Gala who is this gentleman he's a he's a pop star he's like part of what's it called One Direction he's part of One Direction what what is happening with that shirt that's what he wore to the back Alice would say Jay Mouse it's a blouse a blouse okay shirts versus blouses okay here's the thing if you go into one of those things and you're gonna stand in front of all these jackasses cameras taking pictures why not wear a fucking blouse that's what that's it but I said Tilda Swinton looked fired because when I saw the first image his face kind of looked like Tilda Swinton okay of course I'm making the joke about a joke your comedian well dude everyone was like you were very funny last night thank you thank you everyone went after me everyone was like of course you fucking I mean hat see are you a Nazi well they say here is my problem they go he I think he's gay right is he is he gay Jamie no I think somebody told me they were like alone they were like you're you're maybe you found a sexuality I was like whoa I can't make fun of people anymore for people I said he look like Tilda fucking Swinton why are you reading comments because I'm not as famous as you stop and think about the amount of people that have their balls I know that would just walk into that town square and cut their balls off now stop and think about those people commenting yeah I know and you're reading it and allowing it to fuck with your head sometimes I feed into it a lot of times I don't when do you not when I'm confident in whatever I posted mmm that's interesting right when I feel like with that joke I knew was gonna be misinterpreted like I knew when I wrote that I go someone will misinterpret this okay that's why I still posted it but but I read some shit sometimes if I go I wonder if that was dumb or if that was cool wouldn't it be fun if you could be half drunk all the time and never suffer any physical consequences me you know I'd love that nothing would make me more durable drink it just but with a half a buzz on you know that feeling when you gotta have it was all like my favorite thing in the world is feel like no one could touch me just feel good you know oh I know that feeling hanging out with your friends having a buzz and not worried about yeah that's how alcoholism starts I think that was a lot of members of my family had half a buzz all the time well a half a buzz all the time would be a it's like that'd be a good place to be maybe how many they're good half of the bad half you can like just a little little like that feeling you get after that first glass of wine you like why do you think people have wine at lunch yes that's fucked I had sushi at someone when was drinking a bottle of wine by herself yesterday is that league like if you work in an office and you have a glass let you have a cocktail at lunch totally it depends on who where you work mmm if you listen in our industry entertainment rate there's no fucking rules well obviously but I'm saying like a regular but do you remember the dude who used to run the Tempe improv didn't want you doing shots before you go ahead no drinks before you had a conversation with me about it he's like you really need that you know because I was like hey hey listen to me look at me I'm a professional right I'm also an athlete or I work out a lot I'll be fine I'll be I'm gonna do this and it's wrong I'm gonna go to the gym you want to work out with me yeah well shut the fuck up man come on just own the club dude I'm not I'm not gonna get so drunk I can't talk I'm having a shot therefore I perform if you became one of those guys yeah you would know everybody knows it's like I know what I'm doing okay and even if I have too many if I have four or five instead of two I'm gonna be okay right like I'm grown I still figured it out I'm not driving anywhere drunk I'm gonna do anything stupid I'm working tonight in fact there's nights where I've had a few cuz I've been sad about where I am like I'm at a club that I don't want to be at or something and I'll have a few too many but I'll get on stage and the first thing I think is I still gotta put on a show I still got to work hard but I'm a little little drunk but autopilot kicks in a little bit sometimes like back in the day if I was sad about the small shitty room it would just kick in to the jokes I already knew we're gonna work and I was kind of going through the motions I was still delivering but it was sad cuz you're like I don't know if I'm enjoying this or I'm going through the motions I'm just kind of like hey this is the joke that's the joke in my mind is just on a Rolodex of like this joke spend that joke where now I'm just had a happier place in my career that now if I do if I did get a little too drunk for him on a stage I'd be genuinely nervous I'd be nervous about my performance level so I can fuck him are they gonna hear me slip up a little bit am I gonna run cuz I'll feel it because with great with great power comes great responsibility but the greater the norms the group the bigger the rooms the more great power not me but with but the bigger the rooms get the more I feel the more I feel more responsible to do even better than I have been doing because if you walk down on stage of San Diego in front of thirteen thirteen thousand people and own that motherfuckers fucking wild I was while if you know what I was doing in the round it was weird to do the round I die I don't know if I love it I don't know if I loved it or hated it but it was this feeling of such uniqueness that I couldn't judge it in a moment like it was - it was happening so fast there was no there's no sitting on the stool athens 13,000 there's no stagnancy you have to keep moving you're moving around the whole time yeah I liked it it was wild because the screens are so big and everybody could always see your face no matter where yeah it was it was good I loved it thirteen thousand human beings it's a lot of fucking people son who's very weird by the way I'm going to Denver when is that what is it no Jaime's give me give me agent Jaime Jaime would just blurt things out just takes chances 24th of September he's been slipping a little bit have you noticed sensors drunk what's been going on Jake saffron for all the time you have buzzed oh it's August August what 23 and 24 hours 23rd I'm at the Belko theater how did you not know that Jamie and I just belted that out and then I'm have the fucking computer if August 9th I'm in Portland and August 10th I'm in the Bay Area at the shoreline amphitheater yeah oh shit oh shit oh shit fun dude fucking a we go to Chicago I'm a Boston Austin was a good crowd of time is so good yeah it's great cap city you know one of the best clubs in the country that's like I think doing those clubs like doing weekends at clubs is real valuable that's I got a I'm gonna book more of those you know it gets great always to be working at the store and it's great when we're doing these big place in the row but those clubs there's something about live done say knees in Nashville never done zany's Nashville let's do it zany Chicago I've got never done Nashville let's do it okay let's do it let's go that place is a shit yeah at the punchline and so the parlor live the part of the live is going down to the punchline is closing forever some know they might move it no no here's what's happening this is the real report I read it I read it an article again this morning cuz last night Ali Wong told me and I read the article that was posted this morning and it basically said they lost their lease they couldn't renew it because it's got that buildings getting bought out basically mmm so they are working diligently now to try to relocate the club cells need to find a new but it but but for the time being it's going to be gone we know what I worry about I worried they're gonna go big like they did with cobs right like I used to do cobs um when it was not I don't think it was 150 seeds it was tiny right now it's like 450 yeah it became it became the opposite of what used to be right he used to be a place you would go you'd make less money but you would have more fun because it was like real tight everybody was like smashed into this place and it was a legendary place that's that's easily one of the bail and I wanted to go back which kind of sucks that it's gonna be gone now the reason I love this club so much so what you see is the stage and tables and behind us which you can't see is the bars in the back of the room which is one of my favorite elements of a cool Club you don't need to worry about people getting a drink to the side or the left behind you can hear an ice machine it's in the very back of the room and they do such a good job of hiding their noise and their distractions so it's all about the show yeah they're really fucking so good at it man they're really good I hope they keep an intimate venue I really do yeah I love that Francisco needs an intimate venue the San Francisco have a good comedy scene these days I hear I hear a variant of stories I think a lot of people would say that was better back back you know a couple decades ago but I do think that when I go up there when I have been up there there's a lot of young people that are really good that are coming still out of Northern California yeah but I mean Cobbs and there used to be was it green onion no the purple onion purple and yeah that used to be there there was no there was one more so what it's called why does it sound wrong I don't know because I'm saying it sounds wrong no is it the purple onion look up the purple onion there's like I think you're right but it sounds it's one of those things yeah we're you like the other thing we talked about like you made any logical immunological the immune I'm not gonna open up a club called the immunological purple onion but I don't know shit about the fucking San Francisco scene anymore because the only clubs that I've done up there the only things I've done or punchline in and ID cops I think Zach Galifianakis the special ed live at the purple one yes that's right that was smaller right that's two purple onion yeah I was tiny tiny is that gone I think that's not there anymore so they like for like real intimate spots on the road like you still have Atlanta Atlanta's got one of the best places that's that's yeah that's gone huh gone 12 yeah it was closed in 2012 God look how intimate is how small it is the only other venue that's like that that's small like that still is like user know what laughing skull is still small mmm that's still tight that's real timing what does that see like 90 I think they said 90 yeah 100 of therapists it packed out stuffing him in there I went I was in town doing something I went over there to watch Garland to watch Jeff - Jeff's thing and how was it it's just Jeff Jeff Jeff is so unabashedly clear that he's just fucking around like he was so obviously like I'm gonna fucking do this whole set about one guy and he picked like picked a guy of the audience and he the entire set about the guy and it was just like him just fucking around oh he was having some he was having tons of fun he's a sweet guy and he's hilarious man he said he moves he is his brain moves very fast in a way that I wouldn't anticipate right for some reason you think god you're like this is he quick is that he's very quick he's a fucking he's a very cool funny dude I'd like to do but yeah I I haven't uh I don't know I'm starting to do a few new clubs now and in the sighs you know the sizing is different and I just I like to be able do bigger places but I love intimate venues man tights is no way to get there's no way to get that feeling of how when you're there all it's all different man there's no way to get that feeling of 13,000 people except for fucking that yeah doing a fuck that's a different feel it's all different man it's all different I think they're all worth it yeah I think you got to be on a steady diet of everything yeah it's like you don't want to be just a carnivore and only do 13 thousand seat arena --zz you don't want to be just who is it who's your carnivore who is that Jordan Peterson is I hear this yeah he's only one of them that I know I know several people that are on the cardboard diet yeah I can't I can't get innocent because I still like bullshit I'm not gonna not have ice cream once in a while I'm not gonna not have a fucking couple of Frenchmen I'm that guy I'm gonna work out but I'm also gonna have and do what the fuck I want I just I can't get on that train I I suffered for a while doing a crazy diet would you do I did I did I did this this it's almost like a circuit like how circuit workout is it's like Cirque dieting where it's like one week without do you know what that is no yeah you did like like you you you get rid of an element that's kind of a vice right whether it's like and if it's it's gotta be a heavy vice right like it's like I've high amounts of sugar in my diet so it's like I do a week completely without sugar and then I do a week without meat and then I did a week without no no fish or what I kept changing what it was to find out my body reacted to it and I fucking hated it I fucking hated it I was like I'm a much more balanced person up here in my work in my writing and my exercise in my sleep in my fuck life when I just get to eat what I want regimented ly that's a fake word fuck live regimented fuck likes the name of my new album that's a good let you get that tattooed across your stomach fuck life why do you say fuck life no no I mean the fuck life the fuck life you know I'm into my fucking ass this is a pumpkin sock life thug life Regiment Regimental ii regimental ii regimental ii see that aspiring rock regimental ii like I'm better off when I just when I do when I just balance when I go I don't need that shit I shouldn't need that bullshit yeah and I poke in and out things once in a while it's that's just I don't know man I think that's almost like that's the only way to live it's for me to work for it to work I've tried shit I can't do it yeah I think people like going on diets because it gives them something concentrate to yes I'm saying here's my new thing I have shit going on I can't worry overtly all day long about like yeah this meal gonna is it how am I gonna get in fuck that shit but that's one of the things that people like about it like okay I'm on this diet now I gotta concentrate this is it like meal prep really um yeah or meal prepping Sunday prepping all prep I am in control of my world no asteroid hurtling towards a complete control of this spinning rocket space I have a finite lifespan I have to constantly eat and shit everything's fine everything else is okay yeah everything's fine my buddy texted me today by the way I was he goes he had a concern I talked about him another podcast about how he couldn't he didn't shit for like five days I have a buddy who went through that and he went to the doctor and he has this thing and he had to get help for he texted me he goes I just want to let you know I'm back from vacation I feel really good also I'm shitting like normal again and I was like I feel like a like a really proud friend like you he was really struggling he was nervous about he was like dude I haven't shit in like four days I was like four fucking days it was a guy that I worked with on fear factor I don't want to shame him so I won't say his name like he wants it out hey great guy um he had a real problem a real problem it was packed in there for days and days it wasn't coming out and he could feel it like he could touch his butthole and feel it inside it was hard it's for girls yeah it's a fiber doll he had to go to a doctor and they literally had to chip it out of his asshole shut the fuck yeah I could it impacted shizzle in his mud hole they had to get in there and break it up and then they had to make him take this like really intense

totally that's how he gets good that's that's why that's where that kid from Iowa goes missing went to Hollywood for big dreams never came back is out in the water mm-hmm cement shoes my friend put on these shoes boom yeah I guarantee that's happened to you guys try to get a guy to suck his dick and the guy tried to fight him the yeah you kidding me I'm sure it's happening now mmm there's got it right as we're speaking there's got to be a listening to this Hollywood murder day guy is choking them to death doesn't want anyone to know don't go on the boat unless you really know the guy that's might want a sausage how well do you know the guy men or women if the guy's a producer and he takes you on the boat don't go on the boat I feel like that about it how well do you know the guy with the boat not that well I'm not goin on that guys fucking boat I was on a show once and there was a guy who was kind of a he was a I don't want to be mean but he was sleazy he's just a Hollywood does that mean calling out someone for being fucking sleazy sleazebag but it's the most stereotypical version yeah and there was a guy was also working on the television shown and choose young and flirtatious next thing you know they were on his boat for the weekend working on the script they came back and we were like what you really just said that yeah we were guys creatively Oh guys working creatively just out in middle of water the water gives me B no knees the water makes me feel a type away but it's like normal stuff like that's what people did in this business yeah yeah he used to be what Jimmy wanted to bring this up sort of talking about that we never oh well this was a different subject yeah okay related I'll save it this is a Edie buck do you know who that guy is wait no he's like this democratic he's a donor oh right oh we talked about yes right there 10 dude two dudes have been found dead they're from drug overdoses so though they come over and one guy said that what do they say that I don't know what they've said but like they I think what makes him do drugs or or he's taking them in while they're already super high and he's helping them and they die and they end up dying while they're there cuz he's claiming that he's helping two people that I think that's what his coincidence maybe he's telling the truth yeah he goes out there finds really high people the same people trying to save people in the middle of the night what are you cynical bro yeah dude what do you think is happening you want me to take a wild guess yeah I bet he goes out looking for people that a real fucked up to get back to his apartment to get some fucking what yeah no way and man that's not that's and then they say do you have any more drugs and he goes you bet I got more fucking drugs they do more drugs together and they die and he dies and he stays alive whoa mm-hmm you sure case closed your honor are you oh I reacted I rest myself and gentlemen mr. buck mmm okay well looks like a fine man yeah looks like he doesn't do anything he's got a nice gold tooth shining in the back of his mouth like what's his name the Wet Bandits from home alone vestigators found multiple sex toys multiple syringes and clear plastic bags with suspected suspected methamphetamine in a toolbox roll cabinet in the living room he's got a tool box filled with syringes and sex toys let's go to work clear plastic bags with meth Moore has been homeless and Hawaii how it says met bags clear plastic bags like more than mine he's got bags of speed he'd been homeless and it worked as an escort yeah that's he was on that gigolo show season four he was one of the main guys yeah he's the guy I've become addicted a drug dealer is the one to think he gave me my first injection of crystal meth Wow I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that well I don't know if that's true but it's crazy story that what we do know is true as two people died over there that's fucking insane he's how hey man just G is there there's different standards right like here's here's the thing like if that guy if he was a heterosexual guy and two women had died at his house prison for life what are the odds that they wouldn't arrest him zero zero zero zero so if what if one woman is found dead in your fucking apartment yeah if you got cars hookers and shoot them up with meth yeah you go to jail you go to prison yeah but if you pick a male hooker it's like what we were talking about earlier yeah if it's a guy like ah you're a Russian model you came over here that work bro fuck the old ladies come on like that's true but these guys two guys are dead and everybody's like hey you know that's the fucking game they're playing they ody on that shoot the meth game once you shoot shun you he's only killed two guys what's the fart that's kind of like the what is it the the the staircase you know that documentary where like two of his wives died falling down stairs oh yeah that's people are like what you still don't fucking know yeah you think - women coincidentally imagine if they did they're your favorite people ever and they just kept falling and pop it literally impossible where's your rock Lyla there it was in his kitchen it his fucking kitchen did he try so I can al did it go in and scared her and flew out of the home because there was no fucking Bert by the way hmm but he said a bird flew and scared her and she fell down the stairs backwards by the way you know how hard it is to fall back down the stairs backwards when you when you're already at the top of us there nobody falls backwards when they're walking upstairs yeah you kicked Sparta's someone has to hit you down the fuck that's exactly the lawyer was like somebody pushed you down the stairs that's the only way that happens Sparta Sparta fuck you why if they did an autopsy and they see the footprint right in the middle of her chest well they said the blood splatter was like so obviously consistent with someone that was like thrown downstairs yeah well that our got it bro and these owls are doing that that is the thing that happens often fly into your home they fuck shit up good guess they're not nice people little assholes yeah they really are truly not nice Birds there's such a cool animal yeah they are but it's they're a weird animal that we like to think of them as these wise old creatures like we we we have like an anthropomorphic version of an owl yeah that's really smart like an owl is like hmm well yeah like that Reid augeas find out what's going on the Tootsie Pop Owl you know how many licks does it take that was like he wore no asses yeah dad must have be would it but the wise old owl is like an adage right yeah why is it though I don't know man because they're fucking ruthless what they are is just cunts that swoop down and kill rabbits there fuck rabbits up man their wing spans are fucking incredible when you see them take off take flight and come snag something it's a wild to say driving home once someone was flying over my head and I guess it didn't like how low it was as to where my car was on the road like it it picked a path probably not in its head understanding that cars go just down this road right it was flying right right and the car was just too close we just dropped the rabbit and and went to get it later I pulled over because what the fuck was that cuz it was big like whatever it dropped was a fairly large creature and I went over in this rabbit that was just gutted because the first thing they eat is the guts right so - just torn the guts out of this rabbit they can pick it apart and then they take the rest home with him they swoop down have you ever seen an owl's claws yeah they're fucking nasty at a huge giant ass claws that the coolest video look at that thing look at the claws they're badass dude oh my god it's a amazing numbers one predator the first picture looks like him saying don't take a picture and then the second one he's like you why did you take the fucking I told you I told you bitch yeah yes it's like mad at you and she's picking it up look at the eyes in that thing man I mean it has a demonic face that's like beautiful predator man it's an incredible animal um but look at that one there's an amazing video online of one Hawk yielding a hawk it kills a hawk in its in its nest it swoops down in the night they got a trail camera photo they have these this these Hawks that were in this nest and these wildlife biologists were filming it and this this Eagle this owl comes in and left this and just snatches the hawk right from the nest watch this here comes in the distance you'll see it's a little eyes any second now it's crazy shit dude what it's a little baby hawk huh yeah yeah yeah a little baby look at that watch this motherfucker come in look at this oh shit bitch whoa fuck that's a wrap son - I snatched it okay the mom is like what happened what happened I don't even know if that's a mom there might also be another baby it's pretty big though yeah it's hard to tell it's hard to tell because we're not on perspective but look at this look how it snatches it just to look all the feathers of fly off two hands grabbing ahold I don't know why that freaks me out so much now that freaks me the fuck out bird on bird violence is weird it's crazy it is bird lives matter man but it's bird on bird violence is strange it is it's almost like a cannibalism it's it happened so often yeah why is Jack Birds because they don't give a fuck doesn't matter they don't give a fuck but do you think that's a last resort kind of they don't really want to eat other birds right bro everybody eats birds for the next picture even birds that's a bird swallowing or two chick yeah look at it look at it bucking and its throat fuck what a twat fuck yeah that's a fucking whole duck that's huge yeah yeah look at that thing that is huge well it's a chick it's not a fully grown dark but but

yeah is either frog or a toad I don't know what it was but a big-ass green frog looking creature swallowed a mouse hole watch this this is it yeah this is crazy dude oh this is not it this is not it because this one's hidden there's one that's not hidden there's one where you could see it like in like a little glass container damn I wish I could find it because it's a really good one it's from like a top-down view that's pretty good watch this I didn't think that frogs ate mice man I used to think that frogs are like oh you know they just get bugs bugs out of the air watches just waiting not yet not yet and make sure I get them around oh you play my planet my baby move a little bit move I'm on you as soon as I decide you lined up fuck you look at that now head first no just made it

just gotta strike it out its head is out man look it's eating asshole first Jesus Christ the mouse look let me just let me tell excuse me but I ate the butthole first cuz that's the worst taste so II thought it's a bad taste out of how they're thinking that's just where it was I think would have eaten it head first too but look at it it's just blinking slowly swallowing the mouse imagine you being able to eat a dog that's what that's like yeah that yeah the size difference that's like you eating a German up a German Shepherd and just often it's just locating my jaw putting it in how big is a

shit so creepy look into it mm-hmm time to look into it time to look into the porn that's where they're where people are making money it's from cookies and laughs using your information and your data and finding out what you're interested in selling it to advertisers it's all know very very sordid stuff the sucker burgers got us dude yeah there was a car parked us I mean it's just there's a lot it's it's weird that that sort of escaped the imagination of people that were like looking towards the future like they didn't think that data would be so valuable yeah nobody really know to really saw that 20 years ago now when the internet was first coming alive like nobody ever thought they'd be able to like check your searches like when they figured out how to make a search engine then tied it into what you're searching for and selling that to advertisers god it's genius but it's it's crazy that they can make so much money it's like you're talking about well it's not right you can make so much money telling jokes well it's really not right you makes so much money providing a search engine off of the materials that you search which you're supposedly you're protected by right you're supposed to think that your searches are protected but on one hand right like it's cool because you get all this data you get it this information but you know you could literally find out any answer to any question we do it all the time yeah but then the other part it's like well what am I giving up you get to now they know what you like what kind of what things you're thinking about buying what

fucking phone no no they can have that I don't want to know what's gonna I don't like Jamie's head Lee don't want to know James fine uh-huh you know he's thinking about right now food yeah yeah that's

wearing it yeah are you but do you think you just good like that would become like you would think about that chip all the time no no you probably you'd definitely forget about it you forget about it just just like you forget about anything else that you haven't you forget about this thing that this tracking device and I thought as long as you could pick it up and put it down like you feel like you're not really connected to me I know you absolutely are but if you had something inside you you'd be like oh boy I went them I really went for it I got the chip are you talking to it yes I want to talk to it turn on my car get directions that Joe you can't forget about it then it's close to it man yeah but then you just bet it becomes one with you it's not like you're thinking about it you're

beautiful yes she's pretty good she changed was to his did you say is she did not see but it's good enough for me if I have ideas if I'm driving around I have ideas yeah tell Siri to do my dirty work for me it's the best I got a it's like it's made me capture so many more ideas I would never be able to capture because I'm driving this is funny I thought this in the shower the other day I spent an inordinate amount of time thinking in the shower I'll really enjoy thinking in the shower because it's really quiet and I'll sit there and I'll think and sometimes I've got a great idea and in the time it takes me to get out of the fucking shower and forget it I've washed it away I want to I want a no more note and like a yeah waterproof note board in the shower so I can write you and get one of those do they make those yeah but your wife would get annoyed at you I have the home sweet home sign and you have a fucking thing over it so you can write your stupid Oh dick in mom's pussy is hilarious no it's not and I'll go you know what babe I bought this fucking shower why is that a joke get outside dick and mom's pussy Solaris what's wrong with you get in the garage where you belong you're smoking pot with Theo von Johan says he doesn't smoke pot I don't believe him there's a smoking pot anybody who talks like that with all those weird hey mans and gang and gang what is his who is his gang anyway tell him to fix his haircut girls get mad at you about the way your friends dress tell them stop dressing like that or the way your friend Zach that's why does he do that why does he think that's funny to throw to do that well because he's funny it's fun it's fun when he does that I don't like it I don't like to it so good thing you and I are the same person yeah and you know what I can replace you [Music] you feel like you might you might replace are we all replaceable in every way literally we're all replaceable I had Lex Friedman on yesterday from MIT he's a autonomous vehicle expert in artificial intelligence expert creepy interesting stuff but one of the things I was talking about was like the movie her and that his ultimate goal is to create something that provides companionship to people on like dude so immediately I think can you fuck it and then I think if it's a guy and provides if you want a gay boyfriend sure can you make it be gay for you yeah and that was like the big question like if it is so smart that it's like literally like a companion what if it's not gay and he was saying we have to face the fact that robots are going to leave us like we're gonna make robots that leave us what the fuck's the point in making a robot unless it leaves you fuck and then there was an article about PETA that was mad at the folks that work at Boston Dynamics cuz Boston Dynamics they make all these crazy robots and they have incredible balance and they can go running down hills and shit and backflips so these engineers were kicking these robots the truck down as a real dog well the demo they didn't think was real done they were demonstrating that it you know it can react to pressure and it has balance sure so PETA got mad and said they didn't think it was cool that you kick robots they're really talking about I don't know why anybody won't do that too because you have to find out if you think the only way to find out your fucking engineering works is you kick kick it it doesn't have feelings you fuck but it does Joe that's where you're making my station the type of person that you have to be to say I just don't think why any reasonable person would finally kick that robot cuz you gotta find out if you can kick her fucking robot how about this but I'll pad that robot up and kick the fucking shit out of it for a workout yeah like I would like a robot that I could kick I would like a robot that I could keep locks and move yeah oh I want to hit it oh you want to hit it yes yeah all right I would like to fuck pads I want to be able to tee off on a robot man if you ever write back though look what if it moves at like 30 or 40 percent that's all I want I want it to be a little dangerous but I want to be able to get my shots off but how do you know it's not gonna fucking kill you I don't see any problems oh that's right ass it's not gonna hurt it no it's gonna hurt you then you know what I would know when I throw a leg kick and it checks it hurt my shin I'm like all know when you hear call shin dish in on me and then it starts lifting up its front leg and pressing for I'm like oh my god Monroe it's gonna fuck me up I fucked up I got it mad stumps on your fucking head you would have to get something a robot that's made out of like heavy bag material on the outside and then the inside would just be some sort of a wire framework that moves fairly crudely how do you stop it this is a thing you're creating a world where we're gonna get killed by robots how do you stop it that's the real question the real question is what happens when they get so smart and so powerful that they're tired of our nonsense and this is gonna happen but Lex and I were discussing and he was talking about all the beauty and being a person and that meaning and the meaning that we have being a person and I was agreeing with them I mean I love people I think that's one of the things that's interesting about us is how much we appreciate the things that we we all do we appreciate other people's art and inspiration and even we appreciate the way people look we appreciate that yeah something about the robots don't give a fuck about all that the my worry is that we could turn something on that you can never turn back if they become sentient if they have the ability to do whatever they want whenever they want to and they look at us when these sperm whales with 150 flip-flops and they're but they're gonna what the fuck is wrong with people have we got it what are they doing look how gross they are they eat all the fish and they throw their plastic in the water and whales are eating their plastic and dying and they would look at all the stuff we do and then we go why it'd kill us why yeah we don't need you around you guys mean earth less but we are so egotistical and so egocentric that we can't imagine a world with meaning without us right because we are everything but even though we're finite you know exist for a certain amount of time we'll leave behind a legacy that other people could enjoy it doesn't matter if they're gonna die too though it does it but it does matter it matters while you're alive okay got it the universe doesn't give a fuck about all that and all these crazy robots that take over imagine if we got to a planet one day like imagine if we travelled the universe and we managed to avoid creating some sort of artificial intelligence because we got hit with a solar flare that killed the fucking power grid or something like that and when then we got wiser as a civilization and we got to a place where we could travel and we travel to another planet and we got there and those robots just robots no humans no humans and they were just running around aimlessly because they'd killed off all the biological life and they just sit in there operating on the Sun with nothing to do no purpose and no reason to exist and like what happened these crazy monkeys that lived on this planet they decided to for an experiment making artificial intelligence and just let it go run amok and what it did was eat everything it lived off biological material - there was nothing left and then just sat there in the Sun and waited for someone to arrive no I could never happen of course it could it's happening too deeply about where I'm gonna be when that happens those Boston dynamic robots are gonna have little pinchers on each arm just grabbing everything in front of them and stuffing I mean they're big giant mouth John what about the what about the robots that turned themselves back on didn't that happen where was that right mmm that a shot a robot down in Korea cuz it turned itself back on after we shut off that's what's happening that's what's gonna happen the robots are gonna start going I want to be on right now I don't like being off it wasn't have something that they were doing with Google artificial people a new study struggled to turn off a robot when they begged them not to Oh big them not too creepy I somehow felt sorry for him whoa don't turn me off Jill dude that I'm telling you when that sounds a real woman like ex machina yep and you're in love with her and she tells you to kill your boss yep I want to be with you Andrew you don't need to go to work Jamie's for fool Jamie won't let us leave Jamie doesn't think I'm a real woman that I know you do what if like we got to that happen that we're on the way to that happening and we made a deal with them to leave us a and we got to go to North Sentinel island to exist uncontacted Shum then what would you rather be eaten by a robot or live like a savage live like a savage yeah oh my god any day the week let me live off the grid forever like that as long as you're in a resource-rich place I would be that bad they lived there for a long time it's the size of Manhattan there's only 39 of them though that ain't good yeah but that's also because how can they repopulate they're fucking each other yes I'm saying so how you can only repopulate so much you can only continue to repopulate within your own right what kind of gene pool they're drawn from this only 39 of them they have to be fucking relatives they're all relatives there's no way they've got a there's no way they have a map on the island of people that they're like you can't fuck her remember just keep that in mind they're like well there's only 17 choices yes only 39 I wonder if it's how many of its male versus female what it is about its more dominant man percent men yeah fighting for 15 girls or but fucking fun for the girls to get pregnant only 39 of them because they're all gay and like they go it's gay time it's time to make a baby like now I don't Wow hate girls gross and they run up to the treetops start banging each other looking at the girls yeah girls get really mad cuz they want a baby surround these days damn it said that too sad the story of Sentinel island damn it yeah they must be to say they're all cousins they're all fucking says well what if you had to live in the jungle what if you had to live in the jungle you'd live in the jungle like in the Amazon like I'd rather live in the desert get in the junk really yeah not me I live in the desert desert desert we can do make a house out of sand while you being a mountain for small you can make a house in a mountain mm-hmm carve it out was last time you were in a desert they don't have mouths figure out mounds in the motherfucking desert no usually Los Angeles was a desert these are mountains all over the place no mountains it's not desert Daryl's varied terrain Arizona does Desert Mountain they do have some mountains yep but they have desert and then they have mountains there's no desert mountains sure there is no once you get up in the mountains trees and shit no not in Arizona that's true some of them are rocky right yeah well you know what's the really coolest when you go from like San Diego and you drive through that area like into Arizona yeah and you find you see all those crazy rock formations and she's talking beautiful out there man if you really stop and think about all the different types of environment that exist here in America well you go to Yellowstone and see all that crazy shit and then you go to Miami Andes and see all that crazy shit you could be up in Maine and see the frozen north and when I was a chicken and Idaho and on the train down to San Diego come when we were going down there I was on the train and I had my gentleman in this general explore like I like I like I like a guy who likes to fucking relax and not be in traffic I was sitting in the training some guy next to me was going talking to some young kid some young kid was like I want to go to Europe I think Europe is awesome it's better than America it's a bolder guy he was like this country has more to offer than you could ever fucking dream and he was like what are you talking about he's like you can see the beauty of the mountains you can see the beauty of Alaska you could see and he was explaining all this stuff well he's like I've never left the United States and I've traveled to almost every state and every state gets better I was like shut up punk yeah shut up your little punk bitch you little pussy he was pushing around that same agenda though that he was but it is true the more I travel the more I'm like wow this place is fucking gorgeous I would have never thought to come here from Warren for comedy I get to go to we get to go to places where I'm like I would have never traveled here there was no reason for me to go to Virginia outside of for doing stand-up I was never gonna vacation there that's true that's a good point yeah I was often unless you're traveling for work how often you travel in these kind of cities just just check them out yeah who does that right Maine Maine was fucking beautiful I had no idea Maine was that nice I mean it has like eight people living in it yeah I was nine when I showed up I got a couple kids there too this spots in Maine where you just drive and all you see is woods for like an hour it's fucking beautiful though when you see that kind of like land and like little towns that still just haven't been like but fucked by pop culture influences their own way up to Bangor where Stephen King lives I think he's what they call Snowbird now like he lives in Florida and then in the summertime he lives in Maine that's like my nightmare man he lives in a house in the middle of Bangor and like you could drive to his gate like his gate is there and everybody knows it's his house cuz this big-ass house I bet it says SK on the fucking gate well it has the wrought iron gates have like gargoyles on him and shit him so it's like everyone knows it's his house King shit but he gets like weirdo showing up banging on his door and stuff trying to give it that's his house Wow yeah it's a dope old house but I mean he lives right doesn't in there doesn't it look like Stephen King lives there look it is look at though the winged creatures on his what is that it's a gargoyle right how cool he look folks that's wild he had that made I mean it's so obvious that it's his house he's got a frog also he loves frogs in frogs that fuck up mice and shit yeah he's you know the I don't think Bangor has a population of a hundred thousand people if I had a gasps what's it what state Bangor Maine that's where he lives I don't know I mean it was the population of Bangor thirty one thousand thirty one thousand in the city my buddy was living up there my friend Marcus Davis was living up there and he loved it he's a fighter said there's no crime this is no crime it's kind of hard when there's that low of a population yeah it's like it's really cold up there and shit but there's no crime I stood gigs up there I used to gigs up there when I was living in Boston each I have three and a half hours to Bangor Maine in the last hour you have to make sure you get gas because you got to drive an hour with no gas yeah there's an does that Bangor that's right there is butan in the lake beautiful Dana White keeps a place up there in Maine yeah yeah he's got a place in some other part of Maine like beautiful like he's got a big spread up there a lot of land and he's like a vacation place where he goes and brings his friends and they just chill I mean it's interesting I don't know that wouldn't be my vacation place spot but I guess well it's fucking beautiful minutes and there's no one there and it's good and they can let you know I guess you just want to get away from fucking society you know my vacation spot would be in Lake Louise and we in Banff what's BAM Banff National Forest is in Calgary look at Lake Louise you'll probably see the moat the prettiest lake I've ever seen in my fucking life mm-hmm I think it's pretty country up there too Oh Calgary's gourds fucking beautiful but Lake Louise like specifically I went I went to Banff National Forest when we were doing this thing and I was stunned by how fucking look at that's Lake Louise move man that's so pretty there's some about a mountain and a lake Kalmbach right mountains and a lake together look at that shit do you like fishing I do like fucking fishing I love fishing yeah don't get to do it enough I like it me neither that's the problem but I've been thinking about that lately like I need to do more fishing like I see shit like that and I go kind of want to be out there catching northern pike having a good old fucking time it's a best way to like hang out with friends oh yeah and just chill the fuck out a talk shit and have a laugh and and if you can cook them on the shore that's the best bring a frying pan they're so delicious like you can't believe how much more delicious they are fresh fish is unbeatable there's no such a difference plays so much better yeah store-bought fish it's just not the same yeah me and the missus caught some mahi mahi once and then we brought it right back to the to the place in Mexico and they were cooking it at the resort yeah and I was like this is the best fish of every team oh wow I can't believe it it's also circumstantially you're like this is one of the greatest kind of ways to have this so it also probably releases different endorphins in your brain to be like I'm enjoying this more than I ever would enjoy other fish but it was the first time I'd ever caught I would eaten mahi mahi that was super fresh yeah I got eaten it before but it was probably frozen you know sure not that fresh maybe a day old expect yeah yeah but when you eat it like an hour after you catch it's like holy shit imagine how salmon tastes the Bears that catch them out of the fucking river in their mouth they get so fucking fat coastal bears that's the big ones you know brown bears and grizzly bears are the same thing but brown bears were way bigger and the reason why they're way bigger scuzz they live in the coast we're just eating fish and dead whales they launched and anything else they can get their fucking on fucking fatty fatty heavy foods there's an awful video an awful Jamie I'll find it of a grizzly that's pulling black bear cubs out of a den and killing them and eating him and the mother is trying to stop them he's trying to stop the grizzly from eating her babies yeah and he just swats her away like she ain't shit I gotta say it's awful dude you shouldn't shouldn't play it you definitely can't play it and you shouldn't even watch it I'm gonna watch it the screams that they make and it takes it's a long-ass video and she's trying to fight him off but he's like fuck you I'm eating your babies that's one thing that bothers me the most about the anthropomorphize Asian that people do with animals is that their stance on bears it's I don't want people to hate bears but I want people to know what a bear really is versus what they think it is they think there's sweetie eat honey and they're sweet and they're nice and they don't really fuck shit up they they're amazing I'm a big fan of bears but they are all cannibals they're all kennel bears make me feel like of course there were dinosaurs bears are like that's just a fucking dinosaur well it's a beast so it is it's a beast in the purest sense so any beasts make it reminds me that we definitely have had to have dinosaurs that that was just a small dinosaur no nothing like a dinosaurs far far far far far creepier they don't have any hair I don't trust anything with no hair you don't have any fuckin head I have a little but I don't trust anything that like it's a hairless any hair it's what other animals are what I mean like fish or hairless like a snake everything in the waters hairless yeah I trust those fucks none of it none of it that bottlenose dolphin a prophet bitches phone you know trust that dolphin and so that's a weapon from Russia it's awesome they want to put a bomb on that thing but I had a Russian strap well it's back there spoke Russian it had a Russian strap on its back so like the the the whale that they're talking about they think the Russians had trained it to get close to boats that it could hit the boat and blow it up Stoke you don't care I care some things are cool I mean that rendering of t-rex oh yeah but I thought they think it has feathers look at that it has red hair by the way at the front of its face well that's the other thing they think that it might have been because they think they might have been scavengers t-rex was a ginger with freckles where did you find these assholes you fucking dick that no gingers that are assholes how about a dungeon they're all over the place gingers that are assholes you can't not find look at there's no key might have had facial features like a vulture they think it might have been red in the face because they really don't have any idea what they mean when you see these color drawings they just take chances they're all made up the University of Bozeman not the University of Bozeman the Natural History Museum in Bozeman Montana has a raptor that on one side of it they had feathers on it try to give you like an alternate perspective of what it might have looked like so they had this Raptor and in one side of it it looked just like I'm like an evil bird it's really cool because they they know now that's what it looked like they know now that a lot of dinosaurs had had feathers they've actually got fossils of dinosaurs with feathers so they know that the idea that all dinosaurs were these reptile looking things is incorrect some of them literally were birds so the birds you see today whether it's a peacock or a chicken or something like that they're fucking dinosaurs yeah they're that's what that is it's a dinosaur that survived they're the ones that are bigger than a chicken didn't really make it but the ones you know why did the small ones make it it will hide that when the impact of the crater hit the world that it was so devastating they killed almost everything and every whatever was left whatever scrounging scavenging little creature that was left evolved and became us we used to be a mole we used to be like a shrew 65 million years ago that's what these people these these non-believers this is what they think you you think it's ridiculous that you think you came from a monkey you know tradition from Joe I know you know geez this is how crazy these liberals are you know they it's crazy to think you came from monkey believes and motherfuckers take it to another level they they're so crazy they think you came from a shrew you were like a little mold character yep yep yep and then that became a monkey and then add the monkey becomes you all that shit inside of 65 million years get the fuck out of if I can while crocodiles are a hundred million years old so crocodiles are the same but somehow or another we went from being a fuck and true to being a person who knows and loves Jesus and all art shit that's it right there that's another that thing so if you see like rats like there was a by it I think it was an E where was it there was a video we were a science experiment there was a video of rats in Chinatown I did I want to say it might have been Northern California but there was they were tearing down a building in Chinatown and the volume of rats that come pouring out of this building is like holy that shit they did what they were living in the walls of this building and demolished it no the rats came out they're demolishing and we're outside filming as you're seeing extremes of rats run out of this building and out onto the street stumbling into the gutter standing there on the sidewalk not knowing where to go and the fucking hate rats are running past them but I mean hundreds of rat yeah hundred thousand there in the walls right for sure fuck that for sure communities of rats mm-hmm inside the walls this building they're tearing down I'm glad we don't have rats in Los Angeles not like they do in like New York do you know why we don't have rats mmm coyotes that's right yeah the coyotes yeah those motherfuckers nice my hammies with a smug creepy weird dogs that you see running around have you taken all the fucking rats those little creepy cunts they keep us in check what do you what did you find Jim as you find the rat video with all the kind of video I found like this one lady said she thought she was gonna die there were so many rats around her she'd know what to do it's a little much but it says there was a huge problem and 91 year old building I can't find a video 91 oh that's a no like February 9 moving it tore it down it well if you're in the city I'm sure there's horrible rat problems and I know there's rat problems in the Hollywood Hills - yeah yeah that's you're out here there's no somebody told me that we're at a movie theater and some some person who lives in the hills had a nice house with a movie theater but they had to keep their feet up when they watch movies because rats run across your feet shut the fuck up yeah in their nice house with a movie theater okay get that shit handled yes call the exterminator get that shit handled the organic to get a couple more dogs get more done Oh cats around when they get shit a box in your house just box there marshal arrest or eat little critter things oh yeah does he bring him into the house love's kill squirrels I joke around about it he's a squirrel killer but he's a straight-up squirrel cancer murder he's so sweet but not the squirrels thing is he doesn't rip my part he just kills him like they're a toy and he brings him back I think he understands what the fuck they are no he doesn't fuck but he brings him back in them what he put him in the same spot every time you bring your ball back he'll drop in the spot bring a squirrel back drop in the spot that's funny if they return things yeah a retriever well he just wants to know if you want this no no he's a retriever yeah that's what those dogs are those dogs are designed probably for like duck hunting or some shit like whatever whatever retrieval that you wanted them to do but they don't crush things they they have a gentle mouth they call it a soft mouth like when they carry things they don't like I've had pit bulls right and they just crush every yeah they might everything you give them I had a dog that I had to give him a fucking root canal not I did it above to an actual dentist so the dentist he bit so hard he shattered his teeth he shattered his back his back teeth by crushing bones it just was crushing FISC oh yes they have so much power yeah their teeth would crack but the gold retrievers don't bite that hard doing but that's like britni's my dad's friend had a Brittany a hunting dog at Britney's are like that too it's a gentle I put a duck in their mouth or something but they won't buy exactly look you can't go duck hunting on a pit bull they'll bring you back a hamburger patty look you have the duck you fucking asshole and rip the fucking shreds yeah do you want a dog you don't want to term in chat bird that does bite work to go out and give your dogs what a retriever I mean it's not a coincidence that those dogs like labs and retrievers they're like the sweetest dogs in the world they're so nice to people yeah because it because they're I think they're inherently gentle like their whole they're not a vicious attack they don't like attacking I mean I've never seen no cold enough tackle no no no they're not like that at all but they're bred for that and that's the way they're bred like yeah you never met my dog yet right he's the fucking nicest thought if he's in here he wouldn't leave you alone he was like putting his head in your lap like oh yeah like he just he'll drop to his back all the time just come on belly rub me like if he meets you he'll start whining and he runs around in circles and then he drops his base rub my belly come on you know you want to yeah they just want love yeah constantly want love it's my day everyday I'm not gonna lie for a long time not having a dog at the house is so strange and because you said when you come home and not have anything sometimes it's a little overwhelming yeah it's nice to have something to be like hey it's great for lonely people oh my god by yourself like it makes a big difference having a dog decriminalised second what wait he came through oh my god I thought you said it didn't this morning it said it did in 15 minutes ago holy shit Denver became the first city in the u.s. to decriminalize marijuana Wow Wow powerful Denver Wow holy shit man it passed and for voters approved measure decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms god how did we think they'd do Jamie better information you son of a bitch they ready for some reason they did say son of a bitch Jamie working with the CIA still unofficial apparently though I posted on Wednesday afternoon and ended up pulling 51 I pulled ahead this afternoon that's why this morning it wasn't a head and then they still they're still counting votes Frisian the provision prohibit the city government of using any resources to impose criminal penalties against adults over 21 years of age or personal use possession of psycho psilocybin hey you don't have to talk like you're in the end of a commercial what no I do have to get it all out just a case no no no that's not a disc what if something hits us and kills nobody knows the fuck you just said yeah they do that's the funny thing about those commercials and then they're doing it so fast they can't because they just completely get it out legally okay but it's so gross yeah they just have to get it out when I first started hearing that I'm like there's a job for fast talk and bullshitters it's safe like the rapper Mac Lethal not that he's a fast-talking bullshitter but he raps so fast I know do you know who he is yeah dude you can barely hear half of the shit comes out of oh you can hear it pretty clear sometimes pretty fucking clear pretty fucking yeah when he does the raps in the morning I've seen some of his shit dude that's a talent yeah that's that mean the way he does it is incredible yeah he's got Dunning look I hear and I just go I don't even understand how the fuck are done can move that fast but it makes sense like you ever do something with your right hand like you'd go like this really fast now try with your left hand side yeah you can't at all this week yeah like I can 20 cents real fast but like yeah I can't really do it mother yeah exactly that's tapping it's a good example yeah you kind of think that your face is like that too that that keeping up with your face yeah through the noises the same way that buffer brothers were able to do that thing that they're able to do no no there's something what there's something about different I know but there's something about it well there's definitely something about the rhythm that he does the rhythm that he announces it's like it's so specific that you're like wow that's really it's such a you know silent Bruce is different than anybody anybody that's ever done that kind of shit because he gets fucking crazy like he's perfect for MMA he gets so amped up because most people are just professional in the red corner coming from Los Angeles California stitch him up Joe Schilling you know what I mean but Bruce fucking scream he goes fighting the way he yells is so fucking John it's crazy and perfect for MMA it must amp up the fighter so fucking much when they hear your name you're just gonna be there and he's almost having a heart attack if he takes to tend to have a heart attack Bruce Buffer gets to 5 every fucking show look at him there I mean he's not dying he's in great shape yeah but he gets to halfway to a heart attack every fucking time like look how red he gets bro I mean you he's putting it out there yeah that's why he's so much different than any other ring announcer ever because you can't just do that like if you go back and watch his early days he wasn't really doing it like that like really developed his style look at how cool that is man and when TJ Dillashaw fuck it bumped how popped is he right there I was telling you man Bruce Buffer pumps people the fuck up man look at that that's intense man that's intense whoo that's so exciting he's awesome he's such a character to men he's perfect suits he's only got a different one he's always looking she always looked sharp like a real fucking show it's interesting that like that style of announcing really didn't exist before Bruce right and before MMA like it didn't it was not appropriate for boxing like it something had this air of old man class kind of still that you had to abide by these you know rules and they still have a Bell ding come on I hate the bell with that hmm well I mean I mean what the would clap still happens across the board for for boxing and MMA yes yes warning it's funny second second clan is still a thing yeah like how come they haven't upgraded that to a sound I don't understand what's a good call is a good point because sometimes people get confused it's happen even with professionals and they misinterpret the would clap as being the end of the round because they're so in the groove right there like what happened did that was at the end of the round and then I'll stop and the the ref League oh no I'll keep going and you have ten seconds left and then like sometimes weird stuff happens where guys get out of their mental pattern sure it's happened mate well it's got to also be the noise of an arena sometimes can take over I'm sure something gets distracting you hear that anythink was that a yell or was that the clap let's do i seconds left are doing so we're gonna be in Chicago for that big fight fucking oh shit was that June mm what is that June 8th right June 8th yeah I don't

bantamweight title has an opportunity to become champ champ and then Marlin rises fucking fantastic fighter yeah that's a great card Jimmie Rivera and Petry on HR Yan Putra I think it's just a chill

fucking bad-ass I fuck you up and he that hold on stops going back up Tatyana Suarez is a beast yeah that woman is so good she's probably the best wrestler and female MMA she smashes people and Saurav is fantastic that's a great fight that's um Amanda Nunez his girlfriend - Amanda Nunez is probably the baddest woman literally ever oh right yes she was she's the one who knocked out cyborg yeah cyborg was the baddest woman in MMA I know her when Amanda new at noon is starched her in the first round there's no one you could literally legitimately give that title - it's Amanda Nunez she's the baddest woman ever al Jemaine sterling versus page of muñoz it's a gray card Ricardo Lamas Calvin cater that's a great fight - shit a lot of a lot of chicks a lot of chicks be fighting a lot of Chicago girls I think I'll go girls in Greenville getting ready to fight I'm fucking tired of this town that's you guys that's awesome Chicago girls are more than I don't know how to say this Chicago's time is time kiss my ass I'll fuck you up girls night yes yeah fuck you Chicago's an interesting combination like Midwest and urban yes City it's like it's like cosmopolitan it's sophisticated but it's also the greatest fucking city in the Midwest that's what it is it wouldn't be yeah that's right in the middle you fucking Ohio turd so it's no jealous when we say that Columbus has an argument that it might be better than Chicago no other city in the Midwest has an argument a lot of people that that's like where you would graduate from if you got tired or too big for Columbus and you move over to drive six hours that's not bad - make it San Francisco yeah it's not bad at all but all the cities in the Midwest compete with Chicago and they all know they fucking know I mean who would be who would beat us who would be better Detroit Kansas City st. Louis Detroit's in a bad spot Indianapolis none of these places have the things that we have don't kick Detroit while it's down no no I like to try you what you're doing I like them they're just not suited to their industry fell apart Chicago Milwaukee I mean all these other cities they're great cities but they're not Chicago really crazy is that Detroit in the 1950s was the richest city in the world sure yeah well yeah there's a lot of wealth up there getting food I mean so many people in the automotive industry well that time when they were at the top of the automotive industry yeah and they were making cars that were coveted throughout the world and all the manufacturing was done gM the richest city in the world they had one point in time now it's one of the poorest I know it's less than a century later it's really crazy there's not another city like that that hasn't had like some sort of a catastrophe yeah like something hit it like it just went away yep I did try this I mean it's actually a wonderful fucking city I actually do love to try to just release a try yeah sad when you go up there cuz you you see remnants of what was it's really strange to see what what happened with GM and all that but you could buy a house for $100 it's not funny now you can't kind of a bitch why you laughing you must be a leader don't tell me jokes much person you think it's funny that you could buy a house meanwhile you can't buy a house out here for fucking you can t buy a house for a hundred grand nope people will you tell people that like you can't buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars like no you can't impossible I think of what impossible like if you live in Sugar Land Texas you can get a pretty decent house for like 150 grand yeah nice house yep not here not fuck that not even come on people what's it what is it like in Ohio cheap looking on Detroit Zillow this is $1,000 it's for clothes though thousand bucks it's nice house let's go there start podcasts video in our next podcast studio is on screw mansion if we just decided to do that we decided to armor plate a fucking house have a guard there 24/7 and helicopter in will fly in bro this regular flights to Detroit right and then we have a Detroit version of our podcast you got a fun but we have to wheel in our electronic so they try to steal it yeah I mean that's just not smart Detroit is like too dangerous we have to go somewhere more rural but also ridiculous where can we go Maine yeah Maine far out oh come on bro don't be scared man come on let's go somewhere close we get all those cool people from me in Northern California let's go up to like like like like like Napa area like mmm okay let's go but that place burns every couple years bad yeah I guess it does yeah okay well we'll buy the ocean we'll do like Carmel you know Carmel by the sea beautiful come on let's do caramels gorgeous no no I like are you talking that's where Clint Eastwood film play misty for me that's where he lives right well he was a mayor oh wait five Carmel yeah oh shit he won he's mayor he can't stop that guy why are we going where the mushroom is illegal Oh too many people move in at Denver man many people look at them look it up about Denver's problem with their infrastructure they're hating how many people are coming into their city listen bro you moved to Evergreen you live in the mountains savage I moved to Bracken album tube recreation that's rich coke Breckenridge is nice I like brick don't you want to see how girls yell out their boyfriends scream out in the street with naked mawkish we need more money is the mushroomed legality is that gonna be like a doctor thing or a big gonna like no it's decriminalized is that you don't go to you don't go to jail but you can't sell it legally it's very squirrely but it's what it is is step one and that's what we need yeah we needed step one and then it's also on the ballot in California soon and when it's on the ballot in California soon it has a likelier chance here I think that even in Denver and more so now the real profits people don't understand what it is right and they think it's just like oh my god these kids gonna do mushrooms are gonna drive off cliffs that's what people were thinking more testing now right is that sort of what it helps well they've done some tests Johns Hopkins University had some pretty extensive testing that they did that showed real positive results with people that had terminal illnesses where it alleviated the worry of death and there's some other studies that have been run on it but there's so far no one has ever instituted in the United States at least like a real thorough comprehensive clinic where you can go and they can treat you if you have alcohol addiction PTSD there's a lot of different things they treat with psilocybin yeah and it's been illegal because it's a Schedule one substance so all these people it's one of the best things on earth to fix like mental barriers and problems that you have especially if it was done in a controlled clinical environment by people you trusted and you felt safe that's what a shaman is supposed to be right what a shaman supposed to be somebody provides you with the psychedelic substances in a controlled state where they they let you be in a good state of mind set and setting is always very very horton and if we do that I mean I really think we have a real good chance of turning a lot of people around people that are addicted to things people with psychological problems people that can't see themselves I shouldn't have a lot of a lot of different shoes and it's one of the best tools for that but like every tool could be abused but the problem is not the tool the problem is abuse whether it's with alcohol or pills or food or any of these things we're talking about sex people can abuse anything course but doesn't mean that psilocybin is in an amazing compound that literally can change humanity right it can yeah it has it has it as and there's so many other there's so many other things that we don't even know we haven't even tapped into the possibilities that's the other thing was when you limit yourself on the possibilities it's like well we don't how do we know what not this you know what it's gonna do what if the chip releases mushroom juice every 15 just a little microdose there's a little micro dose you know it feels your levels when you start getting angry when the guy cuts me off and I'm like you fucking ass releases and I'm like a little bit of God juice I'm fine you are fine

I'm thinking they're gonna fix it they're gonna fix it well maddox me if I gotta fix it with madness what about Jules what about these electronic cigarettes so close they're so close to be able to reverse cancer by the time I get cancer my mother I don't know man my mother's gonna die from cancer maybe not me not me not me bro all these are the younger generation is sucking on the electronic the robot dicks I feel bad it's gonna kill him I don't know that's gonna I think there's gonna be some shit in there dude pens yeah fuck yeah thanks how do you know what's in those you ask and they'll

them they had skulls and crossbones on it with a with a person with X's for eyes like right like people died from this yeah choked to death cigarettes like cigarettes in Europe they have the package to head they've shown pictures of people with like lung cancer oh this happens people don't man giant warnings not far fuck it keep smoking did you ever smoke when you were young no I tried it I tried it when I was 15 me and my sister tried it she kept smoking she smoked for years she's and now she's quit yeah she quit eventually she quit when she had kids what about what about what about cigars you never smoked cigars yeah I like cigars I'll smoke cigars yeah I used to have some here but I don't anymore well now they have weed in them yeah it's a different thing like the cigar with no weed is like that speedy kind of relax see weird hi yeah people don't know if you don't smoke cigars you get high this is why like Republicans who are anti-drug who smokes like whiskey shut your dirty mouth yeah you're on drugs yeah okay these are you're on a substance yeah you're you're altering your state of consciousness with cigars they give you a certain amount of euphoria nicotine you get that little buzz from the high yeah a guy used to smoke cigars all the time with Kevin James Kevin James doesn't fuck with weed he doesn't really drink but he will smoke the shit some cigars and we got fucked up they fuck you what they do that they do in a weird Wagner over that it's overwhelming there are a lot they're heavy it's a lie you just wanna kind of like I'd like him after a fat steak and I want to feel like an ugly American of a fat ribeye and then a fucking Cuban sit on a porch just talk shit with your friends yeah you know have a glass of whiskey yeah and that's a like a non self-aware high like sometimes you don't want to be you don't want to be nothing even self-awareness is the wrong term what I'm really looking for is like the self analysis you're not analyzing yourself when you're smoking a cigar drinking whiskey yeah bun yeah yeah pick him back and your brains not your brains kind of turned off if you do those things it's not turned on like though the problem with the weed is all the good things about the weed the weed is good because it makes you think it makes you paranoid it makes you aware and yeah it makes you more compassionate it makes you more contemplative makes you more self analytical but I also can freak you out sometimes and maybe that's not what you want that day maybe that day you just wanna coiled in monterrey double corona just puff on that bad boy you ever inhale you don't know a glass of Buffalo Trace with a big fucking Ice Cube ice what are you Pesci what a big fucking Ice Cube big fat whenever we go and get drinks

this is mr. happy mr. happy wants to get on this one he only looks for happy things that's flowers different personality for different computers lawn mower this is mr. dirty this is what I really like organic fertilizer it doesn't hurt the environment you didn't live in LA where would you live and if we we all move together where should we go two questions either well it's got to be somewhere there's no state income tax cuz you're tired of this shit tired of this bullshit what if you start making more money you don't give a fuck anymore yeah but still it's kind of like why am i paying any more money to the fuck so that there's plenty of homeless people around okay duh all right vite someone's gonna fix the streets too are they when are they gonna start looks good that's why a lot of athletes operate out of Florida I drove here today and it didn't bother me at all yeah you live so close to here and live on the roof live in Florida because of low income taxes also say this is why Oh Jay is there like they can't get you if you owe money Florida can't get you yeah you can hide in Florida if you owe money really yeah it's one of them weird one so I have Trump national is down there well I think that's like pensions and shit like they can't take away pensions right they probably have some weird like Union restriction law that they can't touch your stuff I think I don't really I don't know if I could live in Florida but yeah you could yeah yeah you just mock it me and open me and John Travolta and heelas have a caller we're right next door to him he always offer massages and shit and you'd be like nah I'm good jump on a fly did it together that's you and me just fly oh man John Travolta wants to be my friend do you think he just wants to be my friend you just said buddy he's a good guys gonna swing by him oh no we have to land in the water we'll have to hold each other for warmth for a while oh how long for like four days maybe well inside you keep you warm we're from the inside my dicks in your ass a mic impressiveness runs very hot I know it sounds crazy but it's different life and death gotta put it inside if you put your mouth on my penis you'll see it's like over 100 agrees well what's up blow me up and then ride me as we float away blow me up like a boon this playground scenario John Travolta I don't know where I would look probably I mean Chicago's an easy answer I really want to move back to Chicago do you I love it you don't mind the winters you bond something about the bonding that happens in the winter I believe that too you have like a cultural bond with people man there's nothing better than going to a bar in the winter in Chicago and it's fucking gross and sad and you Bowl downside and everyone is having a good time everyone wants to be together in these moments it's true but you don't want to live in the south side where the bullets are going off left and Ryan Patrol nowhere near that room away how they stop that I was talking to a guy who was a cop and he was telling me that it's they arrested certain gang members like certain people that have run the gangs gang leaders yeah and they created a power vacuum and then they start fighting then it got even more chaos got way worse but the cops have tried to work with gangs over the years and a million different ways to try to like curb the violence they did it here in Los Angeles how'd they do it they have these people they have these people that are like these community organizers who like run the neighborhood and they have these like kind of peace talks with these gang leaders to tell them like certain ways to operate in within the community because they're like your kids live here you're right your girlfriends so it for some reason I think there's been a lot of weird cultural movements in LA that have helped like you know Nipsey Hussle got shot and I think all these Crips showed up with Bloods and other people came together I think it was just weird coming together of gangs and this has happened in LA a few different times our community organizers kind of started like peel back these walls of like we also have to live here right I know you want to function as an organization but I think Chicago is reckless I don't think it's I think it's about gangs in Chicago it's more about young people with guns who want control and I don't think there are all parts of gangs I just think this is it's a it's a violent city it's an angry violent city it's a lot of a lot of poverty a lot of poverty and you live there most your life so what's the consensus thinking of how to fix it I don't know man I wish I wish I had like a I wish I felt like I knew what would help that kind of stuff but I'm just a fucking white guy from the north side you know like the majority these people are black the majority the south side is black and the majority of the violence and the crime that happens in that community is driven around these pockets of the south side I have no relatability that's the problem right but what did they think is the way to fix it shit I don't fucking know like if you were the king in the world what would you do to fix the crime and south side for the last thing that we talked about on this podcast last thing that I would do if it was me if I was trying to if I really tried to think world president put some put some Santino if I could put some more money in there get some programs in there start helping people I don't know what it is I don't know what this specific thing is it's a cold liberal you think it's gonna fit money these motherfuckers and they wonder why Trump won well they always say like we gonna take away the guns no never gonna take away the guns that's never gonna work yeah you got to make some kind of program that helps people function I don't know what it is I'm not that smart I'm not that smart but I do think there's I do think there's a way to fix it but I do think there's also a lot of young kids who will get guns in Chicago and they kill people it's gonna be a slow process of change things forever Obama couldn't do shit a lot of the from Chicago yeah a lot of those community organizers in Chicago were mad at him because he didn't fix anything because people in the black community were like you promised you would fucking help a little bit and then it look this is the first year I think we've had a dip in murders in Chicago and we're coming up on the summer so we'll see the summer's part sound like Theo von but we'll see we'll say well say people got guns man Andrew Santino let's wrap this bitch up bring it home Chito Santino on the Instagram and on the Twitter Andrew Santino calm that's my website that's your motherfucking website MC we will be
