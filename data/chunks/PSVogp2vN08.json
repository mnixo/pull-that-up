the gyro gun experience I don't know if you'd call it an o tropic nootropic how do you say it flutes nootropic yeah a nootropic so I've been saying them again it does say on the thing you know helps focus and I have to agree it really does wait to try this new tropic formula that we've come out with where we're finalizing it and they just finish the formula that's got Chris Marcus have you tried any of it you can try it I'm done with my supply to this this shit gives you the most fucked up vivid dreams ever I was in said I'm gonna get you some last night here's my dream Mike the house that I grew up in Arnold Schwarzenegger lives in it but it's not the house I grew up in it's some weird house that's on the rocks right in front of water that apparently is semi-public so Arnold Schwarzenegger is living there now and he's like swimming around and but all these people are staring at him because of his situation and because you know his scandal but he doesn't give a fuck not only did he not give a fuck but he's in really good shape now in my dream and he keeps wanting to pull his balls out and not as you pull his balls out but he puts his little bikini underwear on like you know like a Frenchman where I look and he pulls his ball somehow another through the back of his underwear and there where his ass cheeks are and they're giant these giant balls that he has hanging outside of his underwear by his asshole somehow other than that big and you know he's an old man but he looks spectacular and he moves like with confidence and grace and dives into the water and I'm like I gotta get my wife away from this motherfucker I'm looking at this old crazy man like he's just gonna fuck every woman within a mile radius and it's like he has no no inhibitions no whoo no worries about it and all these people are watching him and there's a family that's sitting behind this rock and they're like you know there's they're sitting there watching Arnold moving around swimming it keeps taking his pants off he keeps taking his bikini bottoms off and like washing it's like a rape show buddy whatever it is it's so crazy what I don't know what it mean fried would have a fucking field day with this chair like what is this dream supposed to represent well I'm terrified of arnold schwarzenegger face while dreaming and just like the little inches in your face would whether they were violence or fear well you have to look at it like this they say one way to analyze dreams is you look at every part of a dream as a projection of some aspect of your life so Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't that you're it isn't that your lower primal self some kind of like that that would be that the draw the the sex drive the like the drive the power drive so your vanity drive yeah look it he's a bodybuilder that's like the most vain thing you could possibly do and then the public Ocean you could say well the public Ocean that's your um is that your public life is that your doing the podcast and you kind of like have all your shit in front of everyone on the planet and so you're seeing like a projection of your it'd swimming through or reacting to like I think I'm thinking about all sorts of Negritude yeah we talked about Arnold yesterday no way I don't think it's me I don't think that represents me I see where you're going with that but no because what this guy represents to me now when I found out that he fucked his maid and shot loads and it was made and their parents doing it for a long time what he represents to me is like this almost like unbridled hedonist that regardless of the stakes of you know of whatever fucked up thing that he does sexually you know he's the governor okay he's a giant movie star multimillionaire married to a Kennedy basically Shrivers she's some sort of a candidate right yeah you know into this respectable family but yet banging maids fucking all sorts of chicks all over the planet I'm sure he just never pulled it back you know and that's it that - he's amazing what's there's something about in my dream he was just completely without without remorse within my dream he was owning it in my dream he was - you know this is me I'm this crazy freak I'm out here I bear that you see my balls you know I mean that was who he was in my dream we were smiling and laughing and waving to people and he didn't give a fuck you know but in real life I mean the poor guys falling apart your life he's a 60 year old man kicked out of his house right you know and his family knows he you know he had a child the literally two weeks apart from the his own child with the maid the maid that was their maid for 20 fucking years you think you'll survive all this anyway no no that's a wrap you say you think like if you made a terminal fire right now I'm done people are done with them how can you do this this is what I mean it's possible anything can happen I might be just talking out of my ass
