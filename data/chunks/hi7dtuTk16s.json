- one boom Andre Ward ladies and gentlemen how are you brother I'm good man how you doing thank you very much for doing this man I'm a big fan so I was very excited to do this you have you did it in terms of like if you're a young fighter and you've got aspirations what do you want to do you want to be an Olympic gold medalist you want to win multiple world titles to division world champion and you retired undefeated you you're the one you're like a unicorn man you have rare dude because you were tired at 35 right 33 33 yeah that's crazy like you're in the peak of your athletic abilities and you go you know what I did enough I'm out yeah I mean it sounds it sounds all neaten but uh but it wasn't it wasn't that easy like I didn't know how things were gonna go throughout the course of my career before ever reason like always even as a young kid I'm talking ten years old like I had this thought like you know I don't want to end up like a lot of fighters end up like I seem to go high really high and then all of a sudden they come crashing down like they start will but they don't end well yeah that's what that's what drew me to Roy Jones jr. country boy had swag and he'd always talked about himself in the third person you'd be like man you know Roy Jones I don't you know I don't love the sport like that man I'm getting into get out I'm just special at it and I'm gonna be fishing on my farm one you know one day and pisser called Florida I was like man this dude is different fighters don't talk like that and so he was the first one that gave me the thought of getting in and getting out and then again I just I just studied it throughout the course of my career even other athletes and entertainers like I just I was enamored by it so that was always a goal just as much as I wanted to win a gold medal World Championship I wanted to leave on top when people were asking why are you leaving yeah it's so difficult to make that decision though for something bro Jones jr. didn't even make that decision he said he was gonna do it and then I mean he had some rough knockouts late and it's hard to watch that some of them that people even didn't even see yeah yeah heartbreaking yes if you followed him and supported him like I have especially if you know his decision was based on Gerald McClellan a lot of it was yeah yeah when Jeremy Clow for people who don't know was a murderer man he was a savage light heavyweight but he caught he was cutting a lot of weight you know and you know he wound up having a serious brain injury and in in that epic fight with Nigel Benn is an amazing amazing fight would been got off the deck it looked like the fight was over because general McClellan would just murk people man absolutely Oh Chuck do it like a prototypical croc destroyer you know right hand woo tall strong it's fuck super aggressive knockout striker and for whatever reason Roy decided you know what let's just keep doing it yeah it's a lot of different reasons why people do that man I just didn't want to be one of them simply simply put but it is like the retirement is coming up on two years September 21st it's harder than I thought it was gonna be one of the most hardest things I've ever had to do but one of the most rewarding and the way I reconcile it and my brain is that okay at some point I might have to do this at some point I'm about to face the emotions in the pool to come back and you know trying to figure out if your body can still do it and just all the different things you go through whether I'm in my prime or whether I'm 40 45 years old so you can't avoid it it's just one day you want to take take on that task so you retired at 33 35 now so goddamn man you're right there I mean you've like four more years to be unless you're Bernard Hopkins then you have another decade but two Bernards credit he started late he didn't are started at 20-some years old and graded from state prison yes I started at nine years old well also Bernard developed this insane discipline while I was in prison the hardships of prison were so awful the feeling of being locked up and contained that he fucked up his life he was so bound and determined to become something special that I mean he's so disciplined well even beyond that like he opened up his eyes and he looked at the landscape and he realized that most fighters are not disciplined most fighters they like the idea of being a champion they like the idea of winning you know championships and what that brings not just the championship of what the championships and the money brings the the ladies that you know the party and all the stuff and he said I'm gonna do it a different way like these guys are out gaining weight 20 pounds in between fights i'ma live like Spartan he under he got the revelation and he just stuck to it yeah he ate clean he lived a clean line and he fought so disappear he fought so smart he was one of the best defensive fighters ever just and people didn't like that style man he would pop you and grab you pop you and grab me and people get frustrated they would get out of composure and they would start doing the things that maybe they shouldn't have done and then he would capitalize on those things I remember on he fought Trinidad man I don't know that was fight these try that was a killer and I love Tito I do too I mean he was a killer I got a chance to see Tito fight live in Vegas once was amazing but when Bernard started putting it on him I was like wow this is first of all this is like a legitimate middleweight fighting guys really a welterweight and this is also a really special fighter who just figures people out he fought Tito in New York City and Madison Square Garden which is his little Puerto Rico yes like you know I think it was the week of the Puerto Rican yeah great lights and previously to that fight in Puerto Rico Bernard Hopkins took the Puerto Rican flag threw it down caused him melee had to run out of here get snatched out of the arena wherever they were having a press conference get thrown on the plane like the the beef was real oh yeah and to be able to like like perform under that kind of pressure unreal one of my favorite fights when he was running away from the crowd in Puerto Rico you realize like oh my god he's on his own here like literally people are trying to kill him but what what's even crazier is he knew that was gonna have like he knew okay this is getting ready to happen in three two one threw the flag down and it was on oh man but it worked first of all it got so many people to pay attention to that fight yeah and then too it got you know it got Tito emotional if he lost that fight he was back to the back of the bus if he wins the fight which he did he moves on to become great yeah he moves on to greatness you know it's interesting when you watch his style as well that very technical very disciplined style versus ROI style which was so athletic and explosive and very unusual with that lead left hook that he would fire off more than a jab I mean Roy had a crazy style and then we watch Roy outpoint Bernard early yep but then Bernard comes back later in his career and really kind of like Roy down yeah and showed like when the athleticism starts to slip away a little bit Roy is normal he's a human either you yeah whereas Bernard was still this incredibly disciplined very well schooled boxer it was a real good lesson for fighters to see the d-league this is why you use the fundamentals this is why you fight correctly you can get away with being Roy Jones jr. but Roy Jones jr. with his physical gifts I feel like he could have got away with fighting discipline too he could have got away with fighting technically but you know he just chose to fight his way mm-hmm it worked for a long time until it didn't work but it worked better than anybody I mean it was amazing to watch in the day when he was on top yeah you know when he was knocking out Virgil Hill with body shots and putting his hands behind his back and knocking dudes out I mean that was the guy fell in love with you know but he could have could have he could have gone and had a full career and rode off in the sunset and been in Pensacola fishing hunting doing whatever he does and still not really been super fundamentally sound but I mean after he beat John Ruiz for the heavyweight championship of the world and I had been going to multiple Roy fights leading up to that heavyweight fight Antonio Tarver who have a lot of respect for you know they were rivals in Florida when they were young Antonio was following Roy around trying to get him to notice I'm trying to get him to take a fight and I remember clear as day in the post fight press conference after Roy became the heavyweight champion of the world after being the middleweight champion starting at 160 Terra Antonio Tarver interrupted the press conference he said Roy Jones you've been ducking me you've been running he's going on and on and on Roy looks at Tarver and and gives him the attention that he's been after and he said huh he said I'm a whoop you I'm a whoop you we don't make that fight happen and at that moment I'm thinking like no Roy no don't do you're the heavyweight champion of the world Tarver was still light heavyweight and sure enough right went down stripped off 25 pounds of muscle that he had built up with Mac ISIL stone to get ready for the heavyweight fight went down there fought a close fight but he didn't look like himself took the rematch now even after the first fight was Harvard man you run for the hills you know what I beat him I wet myself I'm going back up took the rematch and then got knocked out yeah I didn't that's where I thought to read the first fight was earlier now my brain scrambled here because I thought that that was immediately after the ruies fight that he got knocked out yeah it was he went back down yes so Ruiz light-heavyweight went down fought over the first time they fought the rematch they fought two times in a row they fought two times in a row and then they ended up fighting a third time like way down the road did they really I didn't even know they fought a third time in Florida the loss of the weight was a terrible idea and also let's be realistic about how we put that weight on it's most likely there's some Mexican supplements involved and if they are gonna put that kind of bulk on you know I mean I don't know yeah Roy Jones one of my heroes there's not disrespect no I hear you but and I've heard people say stuff like that but like um that's my guy like I'm a kid so I'm like not yet I get it I'm believing that it was just raw Mackie shield stone and hard work it's possible it's possible but I mean what is he like he was like 33 34 on it very hard to put 25 pounds of muscle on very well it didn't say he cut weight to make the light heavyweight limit right so you got to think he was probably like 185 190 probably yeah and so we really only gained maybe 1015 pounds still he was lean as fuck he was pretty lame it seems to take though - Roy had it Roy had that kind of bill oh he was strong yeah very muscular I mean he had crazy biceps and no tribe tips yeah it was all just was weird right he had a crazy body I didn't notice - dude his body was very unusual the way he was built like he was all biceps it was just whipping you know he's just from whipping punches we don't use Johnny shots ya know he was phenomenal you got a picture of him Jamie yeah that's my guy no I listen I'm a gigantic Roy Jones jr. fan but I mean I feel like like that's there's one example right there you see how gigantic his biceps are but you see it almost more while he's fighting I mean really had like a body built a hook you know yeah what if Jones remained a heavyweight I mean look he was so goddamn I mean John Ruiz just was within a tear in that fight but his thing about the after the Ruiz fight is you know we had the same manager James Prince there was a Tyson fight on the table and I believe I'm accurate when I say this it was somewhere around 40 million guaranteed whoa there's an upside to you stay at heavyweight keep the weight on it Tyson wasn't quite Tyson at that time we're still dangerous but wasn't quite Tyson I think they were working toward it from what I've heard Roy wanted more money James Prince was like bro take this 40 million there's going to be an upside as you and Mike Tyson Roy Jones on Mike Tyson Roy somehow said nope the fight will be there later on down the road put his attention toward Antonio Tarver the rest is history Wow I'm kind of glad in fight Tyson I wanted to see him fight Tyson the ride off in a sensei Oh No Mas one more well yeah but I don't think he would have written I don't think Roy was ever really gonna ride off in the sunset he likes me Roy Jones jr. like Tyson Jones had 2003 fight card mm see is that what around when he fought galata they were supposed to start an HBO pay-per-view and they were supposed to be the first fight on it would when I go to Mike Tyson's Wikipedia to his record cuz I think that was around the time where he fought galata he was still Merkin people I mean he wasn't the Mike Tyson of you know the later years yeah yeah he was still I don't think Tyson for galata did he oh yeah I stopped him yeah Galata left the ring he dropped him and hurt him yeah and Claude was like fuck this right is his trainer called him a coward he's yelling screaming oh he hit him with one punch and dropped him and coladas like fuck this and he broke something in his neck he broke his face and something in his neck yeah you gotta look at three years before this I was mm okay you never seen that I probably did I don't remember him fighting Tyson yeah Galata left the ring he dropped see it says well RTD what does that stand for retired because he quit yeah and so the next dude - yeah Mike Tyson was last thing I remember there's a lotta is his fights riddle know all those were using I remember of galata was crazy he just decided to keep punched him in the deck like I never saw anything like that in my life like he fought him well in the first fight was hitting him kept hitting him low like whenever things would go bad for him looking for where he would just look for a way out and that's what he did with Tyson Tyson dropped him see if he can pull that up pull up the the ko cuz Tyson hit him with like a perfect right hand boom dropped him and galata got up is like fuck this is his corner was screaming at him and he literally just climbed all the ropes and said see ya just walk back to the dressing room some-some was off with a lot of man definitely some was off well he was crazy like he had done a lot of crazy shit his bar fights and and stuff like that like he went down he just quit after the second round I watch my video I don't see well so we could watch it what are you watching it by yourself Estella I'm trying to interrupt the conversation he went down man I remember the fight very clearly he hit him with a clean right hand around one here show it yo he was a 1 round fight as a to fight but I think he was out in the first ok here it is boom didn't win there right yeah so Gilad went down and at the end I think it was in between rounds it was when he decided to bail I think that's why yes laughter the second here this is a second ending and he quits guys come in yeah he's just like no well we'd have to watch yeah I think I remember that bro it was the right hand fuck you I'm out of here he knew something was wrong too and he had I think he had a fractured orbital and I believe there was something wrong with his neck too yeah I get broke a bone in his neck I don't know bro that's Andrew Golota for you man yeah he was crazy yeah it was something it was something off with him I don't know what ever happened to him you know no probably not good I hope I hope I hope you got some help you know to me it's you know when you think about a career as a heavyweight fight or two and all the heavy blows that that guy took ever mental problems he might have had so it compounded but didn't help no no no you know you you had an amazing career but one of the things that I think maybe people aren't as aware of as makes your career even more incredible so you fought for a long time with a bad shoulder like if you go back and watch the Carl Froch fight I watch that you get ready for this i watch it again you box the shit out of him with mostly your left hand it was crazy 12 years old 12 my subscapularis which is 50 is responsible for 50% of the strength in a rotator didn't really know it at the time we were told haze to young you know he shouldn't have surgery just rehabbing wrong advice found that out you know ten years later but we just rehabbed it with you know bands and strengthening exercises but we never had surgery so that was always kind of my Achilles heel man like I it's been plenty of fights where I just fought one-handed because it didn't feel strong it didn't feel like safe I feel like any time I would throw it it could pop out of the socket like that's how it felt so it had popped out before it had not felt like dude got it fixed right around 2013 and it wasn't a hundred but it was better and I was able to finish out the rest of my career so I got it still non 100 now it's not a hundred but I'll take it yeah I'll take it bro like I probably gained about thirty forty percent with that surgery like they grabbed it because the subscapularis was loose it wasn't attached but it was an atrophied was still like a fat thriving muscle just wasn't attached my doctor was like whoa like this ever popped out of the socket dr. Michael Dillingham an in San Francisco I was like nah he was like how like your shoulder caps was like shot the subscapular thriving muscle let's get it attached boom he attached it like a four-hour surgery something like that one of those surgeries that you're not guaranteed to come out of the same and you had to wait for a month or so to see if the surgery took like if everything would mend and kind of get you know kind of get stronger it took men and like I said I finished out the rest of my career strong Wow so how long was the rehab how about eight months so you went from it was about 2012 to 2015 where you didn't fight very often is that was that very frequently yeah was that because of the combination of a lawsuit and the injury mmm yeah it's kind of like back-to-back blows so for eight months you're rehabbing in and just still like when did you know that for sure you're gonna be able to come back you kind of turn the corner in rehab you know three three-month mark you know four-month mark you kind of realize it do like I'm good like I'm not where I need to be but like I'm headed there so probably about that time about halfway through you realize that you're gonna be okay it's just gonna take some time to fully get the strength back but even my next fight against Edwin Rodriguez like I still didn't throw it and I didn't realize I didn't throw it until i watch the tape i watch to tell you one thing hey it was like a one handed affair and then after that think about injuries is weird like that 12-month period for me has always been like just like that sweet spot so I got to that 12-month period with the shoulder you know I've said my overhand right came back hand thrown over here right in ten years you know my the power and my right uppercut came back on my toe this is getting better so after that then you started to see that thing flying and started whistling and and ironically enough my last fight that was the punch that started all the trouble for Sergey Kovalev well it's interesting because you were so successful with one hand you know it makes you wonder like what how goddamn good would you have been if you had two hands or was it your left hand was so educated that'd be it had to be but one of the things you were so good at man was I don't have to tell you you know this was using your jab to shut down southpaw fighters shut down their jab and counter you know and you just had that you had like extra juice with your left hand because you used it so I had to like when you have one hand or went on that that functions really well like you learn to make that thing great like you know you overcompensate and that's what that left hand was overcompensation because I didn't have the right hand to fall back on you know but the whole southpaw thing shout out to my boy Nick getting ideas like in all the work we've done and can't like those guys got me ready for a lot of myself part opponents like you know midway through and toward the end of my career so a lot of work with those guys and specifically Nate at a certain point I stopped working with Nick because he was doing other things but Nate men and the volume and having to like deal with the awkwardness and heighten the reach and like that got me ready for chad dawson that's amazing that's my boy yeah he's a tough dude man you know watching him come back after three years out of the game yeah he Pettis like I shot him a message I was like bro you bad man bad man like three years really he's a bad man well I'm just happy that the UFC is finally recognizing the love and support that guy has from the fans too because for whatever reason they were so high on Conor McGregor and all these other people they didn't see one of the reasons why the Conor fight was so big was cousin Nate Diaz Nate Diaz is a fucking star when he when they put his face on the screen for the Pettis fight I mean the arena erupted it was chaos they went nuts I mean I don't know why I couldn't see I mean Connor obviously was you know he was a little bit different he brought what he brought to the table but probably would have been a good thing to try to balance him both out show love to Nate but you know he was like the rebel child you know didn't say whatever came it was mine and you know that the powers that be I don't like that I think he was a little overshadowed by his brother too because you know when four were brothers a superstar there's something about I mean and especially like his brother when he was fighting in Strikeforce in particular it was one of the best fighters in the world he was just amazing and then you know especially like you know during like his title reign like when he was at its peak and when he's fighting in Strikeforce but for whatever reason they just you know Nate just flew under the radar until that kind of McGregor fight yeah first one yeah then they recognized yeah I hope they capitalize on it now you know while he still has a few years left yeah yeah yeah it's it's that whole layoff thing and not even trying to stay relevant but just trying to keep your skills from eroding like that's a whole thing right there and then and then trying to go perform after that amount of time like it's hard you know me and have fallen from that yeah not coming back the same he didn't lose a beat it was crazy he looked as good as ever it was a good thing is though he seems to always be working yeah and that's what saved me when I was off like just always like chipping away in the gym you know he's got you know him and his brother got they got their own schools and they're always in they're grappling working out so that's what saved him if you take off three years of nothing two years of nothing a year of nothing that's when you come back and you look like a totally different person I always point to Muhammad Ali when Muhammad Ali was forced to retire when he took three years off and then he came back he did not look physically like the same guy yeah you know he who did he come back and fight it wasn't Chuck Wepner it was what the Foxes was Arif Ali no no no no no it was fuck the it's it's a tragic guy a white dude and then his brother was also like I cannot remember you talk about Jamie pulled up I know you're talking about to Cory yes Jerry quarry yeah Jerry quarry and his brother apparently who only had like one or two pro fights at all also had severe dementia by the time how many fights his brother his brother only had a couple I think you know in a couple pro fights as gym wars if I'm I think I remember correctly but Cory and his dad apparently forced them to have that kind of fight in style they just went to war all the time and yes and during the end of his career the end of his life I should say that's what I don't that's why I don't subscribe like here's the thing like for me this is my view on this you love combat sports if you love fighting if you love boxing like you enjoy it all like I love the guy that has to take two to give one but I also love the master and I'll just speak for boxing the the problem that we have is like we've ostracized the the master of the game instead of articulating what we're saying or trying to articulate what we're seeing and leaving it you know leaving it right there let it be what it is and let the fans decide what they like and don't like we tried to tell the fans what they should like oh you know this is boring hold on that's the guy that's gonna be speaking properly when all is said and done this guy hopefully he is too but the likelihood is a lot less because you take given two to give one but as soon as that guy gets knocked out and I've said everybody turns on ya so I'm thankful that when I walked into the gym for the first time my dad was scouring for a trainer who could teach his son how to hit and not get hit he saw Burge who became my godfather and it's been my trainer you know for my whole career said he said man I was a you know I'm a fan of Muhammad Ali he said I've had 15 you know amateur fights as a heavyweight can you teach my son how to hit and not get it in fire said that's my specialty but just think if my dad was on something else hmm what if my dad was gonna make my son tough yeah I want him to take it and dish it up I may not be sitting before you right now if you did it would probably a different kind of conversation your Virgil hunter is a special guy he really is you could tell when you hear him talking you know and hear him talk about the game and the way he would formulate game plans and strategies you know I'm saying you know I remember I think it was the chat five I think was that when you knocked out Chad Dawson when you know you could see the look in his face of happiness and accomplishment but also we got through the danger we did it it's over and but game accomplished you know when yeah we have a special relationship whether it's an MMA or whether it's in boxing those special relationships between a trainer and a fighter they're so valuable so it's in to me as a person who loves to watch the sport I appreciate them so much because I know that like you could get there on your own you know you can get there and have like feuds with your trainers great couple you can get like Kovalev does you know a Cove loves John David Jackson for a while and you know now I like that he's with buddy McGirt yeah but it's better if you have a real harmonious relationship with a master because that's what Virgil hunter is he's a master he understands the game he understands it inside and out yeah one thing used to always tell me and I never looked at it like that he was like some my sole purpose my main focus is to get you home safe to your family said it's not for us to win championship it's not for you to be all everything to get you home to Tiffany and those kids safely and when he said that it just put it all in perspective for me he's a competitor he wants to win but not at the expense of my hell and because he taught me the right way we got the wins and the belts and everything anyway and then I was also able to go on yeah Emily so that's amazing relationship you know one of the things that always stood out to me about you was how composed you are and you rarely get emotional you know even like I remember when you fought Carl Froch Carl Froch hit you clearly after the bell and clearly in a fight you were dominating and you just want like this mmm you said you didn't get mad you didn't go fuck you you didn't nothing you took that punch this one turn and just went back to your corner like it never happened like you just just wiped it clean like that's not gonna benefit me to get upset here how did you develop that kind of composure I think one thing to my dad and Virg did really well from me and my brother Jonathan who box with me for many years they gave us mental reps like like I'd be driving in the car or riding in the car with Virg on my and they'd be telling me listen man when you get in that ring when you spar today man listen I do try to hit you low you make sure you get your respect you don't accept this in the ring like this is these are things that I was taught I was like I was taught to be a warrior at a young age and oftentimes trainers will train the body but they don't train the mind so pleasure and also life experiences things that I've been through with my mom my dad and just just all that kind of stuff plus my internal makeup the way you know God made me all of that combined I never had to be the loudest talker in the room because I knew that all that all the stuff the real stuff is in me it's not on me so I'm the type that you hit me like that I'm a smile at you I got you we got another round to fight sir so my anger might might get back i'ma get it within the confines of these rules but you gonna feel me Kovalev knocked me down all right I got you smile you're embarrassed you're mad you're frustrated everything and then that eight second that eight count you again you feel all every emotion you could possibly feel but inside I knew like now you're gonna have to knock me out because I'm coming to get it so some of it is he Nate some of it was taught and then throughout the course of my life and career I was I was given the mental reps say so much him right here watch how someone so pushed his hand down and he got right back in his face not out of the room but in the ring teaching me and showing me in highlighting what a strong mind was and what a weak mine wasn't typically the weak mind was the loudest talker don't get me wrong I love a God I can talk to talking back it up it's not a lot of those in the game know MMA or box so I'm afraid of the guy who's not saying very much the guy that's hard to read the guy we're trying to figure out man as it was up with him that's the guy I'm concerned about the loudest talker I usually get excited when guys used to just go over the top other I'd like to keep talking I got him same thing with Kovalev fought the first fight close could win either way but from the time the first fight ended until the time the second second fight started I learned more about that guy in that period of time that I did in any round that I fought a man he said so much and I was poking holes in and I was crying I was just sitting back and everybody was miss reading the silence or it's Garrity he's not go check the read man I'm just sitting like you know taking notes man this guy's keep talking keep talking and he was just saying things I was like this is a weakness now if he would've said look I felt like I won that fight I felt like they robbed me I'm coming back to get it and then went silent went dark now I'm like man this dude was getting ready we got we got to tighten up kept talking man sometimes I talking to reveal a little bit too much about yourself what did you see from the talking just excuse my kid he didn't give me any credit he started I mean if it wasn't the rent and I'm exaggerating but just for the for the case of emphasis you know that if the ring lights weren't too bright the referee was against him if it wasn't the referee it was the judges like he never owned up to anything that he did wrong but if I go back to the research that we did about him before we even fought him the first time that lying devil will be heard the guy he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't take ownership of anything he blames everybody anytime anything goes wrong he's a front runner he's a bully he's this he's that that confirmed everything we had heard so you're the crusher you're Sergey Kovalev you knocked me down in the second round not the 11th the second round you were supposed to finish me sir the fact that we're even talking about a fight being close the fact that I finished the fight that's bothering you that that that's a chick that's thus chipping away at this whole crusher thing that you've been that you've been living on and he couldn't handle it instead of owning it he blamed John David Jackson he blamed miss got blamed that guy that's a sign of weakness man not strength hmm were you impressed with him getting through the eighth round against yard and his last fight I wouldn't say impressed I mean listen he he hasn't gotten where he's gotten by not being tough so generally speaking he's tough he's a tough individual to a point I wasn't surprised I was just I was like dude if you ever if a fighter has ever been saved by the bell you were just Saved by the Bell like you were a punch a punch or two away from getting you know getting stopped in your home country and in your home your home city hometown that was the only kind of like jarring part of it and then my next thought was can he recover is he gonna be able to physically recovered then psychologically come back and try to get back what y'all took from him in that round and he did that so he showed me that he still got something in the tank but he's uh he was the right way to say it he's fading fast like he's fading right before our eyes he doesn't have the reaction he doesn't have I still very good he still he still can beat a lot of guys but he's fading fast if there's a Canelo fight on the table I think he should take it and ride off in a sense a man go enjoy your life well it was interesting how you exposed him in the second fight because the body shots the body shots have been a weakness like since then everybody has kind of compromised his body they've found what you found out is that something you knew going into the second fight or did you know it in the first fight like when when do that in the first fight did you problem with me in there in the first fight the first couple rounds I was thinking too much and his Duke came out fast so I'm thinking like I'm trying to get my range and he's like oh and it's not that he's like this crazy power puncher it's just that he's sharp and he's accurate so I'm like catching shots I'm getting hit with jabs I'm trying to figure he didn't give me a chance to think and then pull him I got hit with the right hand I'm like I said bro so that was the best thing that could happen to me like I said earlier and then you saw the body attack get implemented so that was always the game plan I won the second fight with everything that I did in the first fight like we unlocked the code in the first fight and when people couldn't get past a knockdown right they failed to look at the you know the next ten rounds but yeah the next ten rounds you started to take over and you were solving the riddle it's interesting the the the difference in power puncher is like there's levels of power punch we always thought of him as this power puncher because the crusher he not a lot of people out but then it's like a Julian Jackson de level there's a George Foreman yes like Doc George could kill you yeah see hits right the Joe Frazier fight yes like Jesus Christ yes terrifying yeah yeah George was one of them I mean there was a there's been a bunch of guys like that but that's that that different level of power punching I mean Earnie Shavers it was another certain guys hmm you know I mean fuck man Thomas Hearns in his prime the way the way put away Roberto durán holy shit you you and also the torque you know there was so much the distance between like the the length of his arms the width of his shoulders and then black when that punch would come in geez catch your name you got trouble get caught and that last then last power area yes yes we just put the lights out Kovalev never had that kind of power it was like a snapping power I mean listen he did have power I want to take away from know yeah he beat a lot of guys in their home towns home countries like an it's a reason why like at a certain point in the fight you would see him hit a guy and then I was sitting there body language is different yeah I think one thing that was lost on my whole career that nobody ever talked about was I probably had one of the best teams in the sport of boxing over the last you know at that time 10 years like I I'd beaten the best the heaviest punchers in the game and in my weight class like if you look at kovalev out of all the damage that he's done in the light heavyweight division he had 20 rounds he had one moment he didn't have a wobble he didn't have a shit he didn't shake me up anywhere be one moment and it was a flash moment so just quantify that like a guy who his name was the crusher like he is who he is he had one moment in 20 rounds so a lot of it had to do with my chin a lot of it had to do with my toughness which is also underrated and and I just like I know this is gonna sound dramatic I know it's gonna sound dramatic but I didn't like to lose and for me it was kind of like either win or die like that's a felt like that's how I feel like it wasn't that serious but that's how it felt like I always thought about Sunday morning I dude if you lose it's gonna be a crazy ride home on that plane family's gonna be looking crazy feeling bad everybody's gonna be looking at you different like and you're gonna feel crazy like I remember being curled up like in a ball on a Southwest flight coming back from Lenexa Kansas losing my the last fight I ever lost against John Revis a guy from Baton Rouge Louisiana Howell team result 14 that is hilarious 14 14 years he'll retired never lost again and John was it was a 14 15 year-old bracket so he was a little bit older and he was kind of a stocky kid again country strong and we were watching each other in separate back and so you know it's like a five-day tournament you can fight four to five times and get to the finals and I'm looking at him and I was a little bit intimidating he didn't Punk me like I'm scared to death but like I was like a little leery and he was knocking guys out and I was decisioning guys along the way it could have went either way I think he want a 3-2 decision three judges went his way - judges went my way but that would but if I was honest with myself like I got beat before the fight and at that moment like feeling the way I felt coming home I made up my mind like do this as much as that's up to me like that's never gonna happen again like I can't control every every aspect of the fight - stuff happens but it's not gonna be because you beat me before the fight I can't live with this anymore so that was my motivation man that just to drive like it was like win or die and then and it here's the thing about boxing the only I don't know about MMA but the only sport that I know of where one loss changes your pay scale like if you have a minimum okay you win a title your first offense is their second offense is that these are your minimums will negotiate beyond that you know whatever whatever go ahead and lose one that's one you couldn't have so a loss literally takes food off my family's table I also knew that my critics and my supporters but namely my critics they had a front row seat every fight mmm - the writers they're looking down or looking at like a Dalek and I get in the ring you know before the first bill would would ring and I go around and kind of just feel the ring I don't kind of look out and I'd always see them looking it's tonight gonna be tonight so I had that weighing on me I had the supporters that believed in me and was riding for me now look you know first couple rows my family's right there my wife my kids I'd always blow our kids like all of this stuff was like tangible and real to me and that's the stuff that would drive me and so when I get knocked down by a covilhã like that's fight or flight time baby like whatever is in you is gonna come out if you got some turn in you that's the time you gonna turn it's gonna be self-preservation mode and you gonna be so you're gonna be more focused on surviving than you are trying to win and I thank God men that he had his hand on me that night bro and that what was in me was real and it was enough to break him and the rest is history the rest is history it isn't it is amazing how much energy people get from haters I mean I don't I don't recommend reading negative comments or negative articles but it's amazing how people with a certain kind of resolve a championship resolve will take that hater shed and you'll get up 15 minutes earlier than you're supposed to and you'll have more intensity and you're shadowboxing and you'll you just push harder you'll feel it but I don't want to give the haters too much credit back what's all you I don't want to get too much credit like they gave you fuel though but it was it was weird though and I don't even know how to quantify I only know I don't like explain it but like early in my career they got a lot more credit and you know I got great mentors man my pastor Napoleon Kaufman former Raider it's a great man of God just a great great man he I would always call my man pastor man they're hating on me and he'd be like this is son listen stop giving these people all this credit man he said listen minute God they can't do anything to you unless God allows him and stay focused on what you got to do so I started to get it as I evolved in my pro career and as I started to mature as a man so I knew they were there that element was always going to be there but I started leading that element work for me like I wouldn't like I wouldn't just you know just just be enamored with it and I wouldn't just sit there and read comments and stuff you know frankly the last three or four years of my career I didn't read a mention not one mention on Twitter I didn't look at comments on Instagram every now and again someone would slipped through but I knew they were there and I knew generally what was being said I knew generally what the articles in the headline would read so it was there but the real driving force was the people that were writing for me fighting for me supporting me believing in me that element was there and I was going to dress that element through my performance but they didn't I don't want to give him too much credit though they don't deserve that much they don't deserve that much credit but they're good that are good to have this than there but you were very wise in the way you manage their influence by not reading those comments not all the time but like I got the revelation like I said it a certain part but I'm done with this yes I only started to read comments again frankly I didn't watch boxing for the past three or four years in my career really and and I'm a boxing buff why didn't you watch I was burnt out the opinions the biased the the the double standards good stuff too but I was just burnt and it was so weird for me because I'm the guy that would break his neck to go watch Tuesday night Jillette fights as a kid you know how to get back dude you don't even know who's fighting it doesn't matter it's two guys in the ring I'm watching it Friday Night Fights for many years I was over it going through what I went through with the lawsuit going through what I went through with the injuries the highs and lows and everything in between I was just burnt can you refresh my memory the lawsuit was a promotion lawsuit yeah yeah it was it was a you know I can't get too much into it but it was just something that man I I just I fought for myself and you know but it was it was a long two-year journey um on my best day I'm like you're doing the right thing son stay stay stay in the race keep fighting it may not look it may not be going your way now but just stand like you're not fighting money's not coming in but just stay the course you're doing the right thing oh my worst day I'm like blowing it mmm you're getting rest on you you know people are right in our war we'd rather fight in the courtroom than fighting the ring and I'm like that's not it I'm just trying to I'm trying to fight for what I believe is true so it but I grew up a lot but coming out of that I was like man I'm done with all that stuff man like I don't know how many years I got left in this fort but I'm not focused on y'all I got to focus on me and it wasn't until I retired and got full-time in the broadcasting and commentating that I started to watch again I started to you know understand who was out there on the you know in the landscape and researching it but I didn't watch it for many years that's crazy yeah I was done it make sense I mean you probably in your early days were so hungry for boxing because you had so much desire that you wanted to watch it all the time excuse me the amount of effort required to become a champion but start to see the behind the scenes though hmm then you grow up and you see the business side and you see the dark side it's like mmm it's different the darkness dark side yeah there's a lot of that man in boxing I mean its historical the Don King Mike Tyson stories the I mean there's so many stories and Don King Muhammad Ali there's so many stories like that it's it's so sad it's it's an awful side of the business yeah now when what was this before or after the super six tournament which was that all this was going on we had lawsuits it was after shortly after so the super six tournament though was where people knew you were an Olympic gold medalist but that was where like coming into that who was the favorite the favorite was kind of like threefold but it was Kessler Arthur Abraham was dominant at 160 he had just moved up to 68 so everybody felt like it was a foregone conclusion he was gonna dominate at the heavier weight class Carl Froch was the WBC champion but he was still kind of like relatively unknown like you know you have potential had a belt but you know he was probably you know I don't know the third favorite and then you had andre derail obviously you had myself and you had Jermaine Taylor and the Americans or at least this is how I viewed it we were just like we were just there to make it interesting it wasn't about us it was the it was the Europeans party um and it's funny because I almost didn't fight in a tournament I was in Mexico on vacation and I've been hearing about the super six but internally me and my manager he was like hey I don't I don't think his things will come together these guys are fighting it hey man go enjoy your vacation so I did that you're right I flew in in San Diego we drove to Mexico and I handed up getting like a double ear infection I was messed up from the ocean I probably just something like that yeah just kind of came upon me I don't know I don't exactly know the origin of it something like a little bit of Internet access I'm looking at something like these guys at weight they're doing a kickoff press conference in New York so I call James I'm like Jay what's up he was like hey man you need to get there like ASAP bro this thing's going down like whoa I'm like you told me it wasn't gonna happen he's like think it was so but he was also like you know what though if you don't want to go it's all good we'll figure it out so I'm like I don't want to go with my family I called Virg I gave him the whole spiel and sorry like two three times in my life he's had this kind of tone he's like listen son you need to get on a plane you're not going back to New York press conference the next stop is Germany Arthur Abraham's home country get there I'm like man I mean my family give him the whole speech they get there so we pack up we drive two or three hours of San Diego get on the fly job my family back to the Bay Area boom drop them off get on a flight a red-eye that night double ear infection wake up in Germany and that was my that was their second stop but that was my first time and that's when I really got the revelation that man night this is a joke like like this they think that me derail and Taylor like we're just going like that's when I took exception and I was gonna really kind of like realize that dude like that this is either this is gonna be a sink or swim moment for you either you're gonna get like I could've got ruined in a super six I could gonna win a whole nother way or what I knew was in me was going to be you know displayed and shown to the world and so when you beat Kessler and you won your first title that had to be a beautiful moment unreal unreal unreal and it was in my hometown like the same arena Oracle Arena where the Warriors that play for many many years and I'm kind of salty they'll even masonry know I'm not happy man I'm not happy I surpassed by that arena on a highway 880 going to Kings gym and I said look and he'd be to be on the right side and I'd be like man fires I wonder if I'm a fight there one day really I'm talking 12 13 years old wow man I'm a headline and Kessler's arrogance allowed that fight to take place in my hometown he had more knockouts and I had victories my guy says dude I'm not gonna go beat him beat him in his hometown so we fought there I think was November 19th and just unreal man and like for a gold medalist like like people don't understand the pressure you have coming into the game like like everything you do you're expected to do well but if there's one slip-up now it's like you know everybody comes out the wheel box I told you it wasn't gonna be that so to get the monkey off my back to win my first title was just that pressure like that release a pressure was just immense I remember when I was a kid when the Olympic team had so many guys that went on to win world champions like Pernell Whitaker was at the 76 Olympic team 84 84 Pernell Whitaker mark Breeland you know there was uh there was so many guys from that area yeah it was Meldrick Taylor yeah you know who else who else the Holyfield Holly fit was there but I think Holyfield got disqualified you got a silver right something when you you think about the amount of pressure that mean so many people were looking at those guys and I remember when Breeland lost tomorrow in Starling mmm knocked up our monster I remember so many people were happy they were happy that he lost like uh another Olympic gold medalists you know it couldn't take him like first of all god damn Marlin Starling was no fucking piece he was a killer and the super-slick yeah you know just a real seasoned knockout artist in an excellent boxer you know I mean it wasn't it's that's just a great boxer beat another great boxer but there was a weird feeling to it like people were happy that Breeland lost I was like wow this is that's crazy pressure it's different yeah it's different um and people talk about pressure all the time I got to deal with this how did you deal with that well I credit my faith in God and just you know feeling like there was a purpose for me to be in the game as the foundational reason but the practical reason was - gentlemen pressure since I've been in mind you know since I've been a baby like having two parents who were drug addicted at a young age and one is a functional addict and my dad who raised me as a single parent and my mother was a full-blown addict for many many years she's clean now she's doing good like that's pressure started there ain't like coming up throughout the ranks and like dealing with haters and all this stuff in the gym in your private gym or not private gym but the gym that you train it and you got some people that are with you and this kid's gonna be the next and you got some people over in the corner mumbler you ain't gonna be other hand gonna be nothing he's I like you learn to deal with that stuff then then going to the national tournaments you're dealing with people from all over the US then you go into the world tournaments like that's pressure then you get to a point so when I fought a guy like Sergey Kovalev I had already seen him before I'd fuck over live 15 20 times in my career I read the big you know menacing guy who everybody's afraid of like I fought him before I fought him in the Olympics for three Russians in the Olympics so wasn't that odds I'm guaranteed to win but I had seen that before even the critics and all the people like we I've been dealing with this stuff my whole life and and it wasn't anything new that doesn't feel good absolutely not I mean you your hope is that everybody supports you but you know is as successful as this podcast is you got your boo birds you have your critics bluebirds I never heard of them talked like that Buber who birds you got people that as soon as you slip up I knew he was gonna as part of the game man you know that must have enhanced your relationship with Virgil it must have because he believed in you yeah of course when you fought for the world title in that very arena where he said you were gonna be headlining when you were like 12 13 years old what the fuck was that like that must have been amazing surreal man you're just trying to manage your emotions like I remember the night before the fight I had my god Jack Edward Jackson man who's a great coach great assistant great strength and conditioning coach boxing coach from Houston Texas he'd been with me from day one I said I gotta get out of the room man like we drove to Trader Joe's just to get some some some Clif bars I seemed to clear my head and I remember like talking to my Uncle Bob who you know is my dad's best friend who you know it wasn't my blood uncle he's basically like an uncle to me he was boxing fan I remember just like talking to him and I'm saying baby tomorrow's your day I'll be i'ma be there front row baby yeah tomorrow is your day your dad your dad always dreamed about this moment and like just tears running down my eyes because I was just feeling the pressure I'm like dude I'm getting ready to fight for a world title at home like the pressure like you could cut you can cut it with a knife but to be able to bear up under it and and and go get it done bro unreal unreal could you can you couldn't script it any better was the second fight with kovalev your second most satisfying fight I liked the first one better the first fight better really cuz you managed to survive and come back and then start out pointing and I just got it a different way mmm I got it a different way and like crazy that you like that fight better says a lot about you yeah I love the moment with uh me and Virg in the corner he showed his worth I already knew what he had but he showed his worth he said baby listen I'll even knock down Sugar Ray's been knocked down they got up now you get up like that's what those are moments you live for like you don't want to be on the cameras if you happen to find yourself there you want to know that your team has what it takes and you want to know that you have what it takes the second round bro I clawed back 10 rounds against that guy mm-hmm the biggest night in my life and did having to deal with everything afterward it built me man it made me strong like stronger and that was just that that that I won the second fight again with the first fight like I already broke him in the first fight something happened to him like right around a sixth round he was still trying to win to a degree but I knew physically I was like man I've got him he's not the same so of course he's gonna whine about the decision because it didn't go his way but I beat him in the first fight we only saw what that the second fight was the window dress and we just picked up where we left off but everything that transpired and sacrificed arted in the first fight the second fight it's it was stunning to me when it seemed like he just quit because it didn't seem like I mean it almost seemed like a premature stoppage but then you realized he didn't want to fight any longer yeah 20 weeks did a great job he saved coke he did I mean you know in hindsight you know you wish you were to land at the one shot and he went you know you got knocked out and it was clear but listen man all the excuses and stuff like I was thinking about this the other day every big win that I've had there was an excuse attached to it so you go back to Kessler oh you headbutt me he's fighting dirty no I'm fighting in a style that you don't know how to deal with if you look at Carl Froch oh it was boring good why didn't you make it more interesting you look at Chad Dawson oh he was wait drain d chad dawson called me out i was at home minding my own business and he said i want to fight andre ward I'll come down to his weight and I'll fight him in Oakland if you look at Kessler I mean you look at Kovalev first fight I got robbed second fight they cheated me come on y'all every big win that Andre Ward has cannot have an asterisk next to it like Sun either either I'm not the guy that my record says that I am or somebody's not being honest over here you see I'm saying but don't you think that's inherent with boxing when there's certain people that don't ever want to accept defeat no matter what and when there's a situation where there's a possible reason why they lost that didn't sort of fit into the rule books like he hit me low or they stopped it's too soon or the covilhã fight you know like the second fight in particular like the first fight maybe he could make an argument that he thinks he should have won a decision but the second fight you mean he wasn't he wasn't jumping up looking to beat that eight-count dust his gloves off and get back at it he was basically he's surrendering he was doing man those body shots was just everything people forget about the right hand and started on each other where he did the funny dance and then like the 15 unanswered shots after that yeah and I would probably sound up the body shots that land it maybe one straight a little low but I can't bro your name is the crusher like like white like if you hit me low like and I try to be as fair as I possibly can I'm coming to get that back bro like if it's if I feel like it's intentional like this accident you know it's all good you don't have but if you're trying to like like like dethrone me or beat me from from a foul like I'm coming to get that back why all of a sudden like all the people that said that that you know you're not gonna be Kovalev you you know look what he did to this guys and do the same thing to you you're too small those are the same people coming to the rescue of a guy whose nickname is a crusher and who's menacing and all the stuff I've been saying you know like like he should be able to defend himself he should be able to get me off of him a little guy I just moved up from 168 little o me was the thing about Kovalev too like he killed the guy early in his career right yeah and that was something that you know there's a feeling when a guy's done that is that there's a fear to facing that guy and I had to face that fear I had to face that fear I'm human um so that was presented to me mmm but that's where the mindset comes into play that's where my faith comes into play was like listen man unfortunately that happened to that guy but you ain't doing that to me like that's the mindset part like if you allow that stuff to seep in take root and start to fester in your heart in your mind you'll net you'll never get it past affect the other the starting line you you go out there black man who was that dude that was performing at night that wasn't me he was gonna have to do something to me because because I was coming to win man and and again it's not that I'm just I'm not the toughest guy in the world but like I just believed what I believed I felt like I was there for a reason and unfortunately that happened to that that young man but I just didn't believe that was gonna happen to me and that's what I had to keep feeding myself in order to get past that and then go perform now how did you make the decision you stopped him in the second fight how did you make the decision that that's it it was almost it for me after the first fight really yeah that's the closest I've ever I've talked retirement in the past like internally with my wife and stuff but after the first fight I don't know if it was I think it was physical like all the surgeries and Rehab just the years my different surgeries just about three with all in the shoulder I'm not shoulders knee yeah yeah meniscus or something yeah yeah and one ACL meniscus yeah I think it was the physical part I think it was just the toll of the sport and then maybe some of the reaction like like you know for a split second I'm like here we go again like like it's always something you know I beat the guy that you guys say I couldn't be mad now now you know people feel like I gotta ride like that's a fight that could have went either way you know by a pointer to you kid you can't have a polarizing opinion about you may say man I thought were lost I can live with it but all the Robster like so I think was a combination of just everything where I was like man man like I'm not doing this no more I didn't do anything for three months after that fight and I remember going to speak to my pastor about it because he did the same thing like he you know he was all everything at u-dub I played six years in the league and office in pone one day was like I'm done and never looked back so I went inside with him and I was like man pass him I don't know man I think I'm done he's just listening very wise man and so I'm giving him the whole spiel my man I haven't done in two three months I've never done that that's got to be a sign I'm done he said you know his son he said I think he's I think you'll be fine of you if you retire he said but I think you got one more left in you I remember just I thought he was gonna side with me that's it and I was a little disappointed honestly I was like really I was like yeah but I told you I hadn't done anything in three months he was like no no he said once you get going you know the fire will be rekindled wow so I took him at his word and I started to kind of get back going moving my body and then that happened I started to get that fire back and uh once we got the money right I was like all right I'm gonna do it again boom won the fight and I didn't know for sure but I was kind of feeling like okay we'll you know I felt like that after the first one this may be it after the second one but then the opportunity started coming HBO had a three-fight deal on the table and basically it was gonna be a gimme fight in Oakland at home kind of a celebration I moved to cruiserweight I guess Tony bell you probably in the UK did you want to move to cruise away yeah it was nothing else that like every way what about a rubber match that wasn't exciting for you know beat him twice did Kovalev ask for a rubber man no no he will probably put if somebody actually you want to read match the word yes of course he didn't want it he didn't really want it so that was a three fight exit strategy with HBO give me fighter light heavy I'll probably do a catchweight at home cruiserweight when you walk around back then yeah about 85 so you would how to gain weight all I had to tighten myself up at 85 90 you're probably oh wait yeah yeah it's cruiserweight limit is 90 it's 200 it's 200 yeah top probably when it got to to though probably been on 190 190 to something like that so that was a brief idea and then third fire was gonna be Anthony Joshua don't know if he would've been made we hadn't even gotten that far but that was our plan Jesus Christ right how much would you have gained to get up to heavy weight maybe two that's it maybe two I can't I'm never gonna be as big as you guys so why would I weigh myself down right yeah very dangerous situation you know but that was something we were talking about environmental oppose fight press conference with Koval is that guys fucking gigantic but we hadn't me and him being very sad and talked about like we talked about it but we didn't say we were gonna mention anything publicly oh and then he came out with I'm sitting you know I'm chilly not just one of mine he's like yeah yeah Joshua chill bro like he's so much bigger than you yeah it's all good though that guy's gigantic I've been fighting big guys my whole life I'm sure you have so 3/5 deal was on the table and Roman Gonzalez surrett Sakai or Switzer koi Cerreta Kai soaring visa we're getting ready to fight their rematch at the Home Depot Center I think it was September 9 September 6th that was a win today I was supposed to be in LA that you know announce the the new signing and get ready to call that fight that Wednesday I come home and I'm kind of like I'm not bullying but I'm in tears and I tell my wife I was like I want to do it anymore and even saying that sounded crazy to me she was like she was just real quiet I'm thinking like why she's not saying that they're like I hope that I'm gonna do this anymore and she said something she had never said previously typically she's like BAE look it's not time come on you got to get up I know you feel this way I know you're bi but come on you I feel like you still got time in the sport first time she ever agreed with me she was like I think the decision is already made tree was like what she I think the decision is already made she said I've been looking at you throughout this whole day and some of the stuff you've been saying and I've never really seen you like this she said I think it's already made I took that out bro started making phone calls call call my lawyer who was you know one of my good friends Josh Dubin say hey bro I think there may be it for me and he had been wanting me to be you know done he was like if you feel our way Brahma support you call my manager the next morning and it took us all when I went I went that weekend and called the fight we held off on the announcement and my lawyer just told HBO like look he's going through some things we're good give us a couple of days so I got through that weekend and he said do you still feel like that come Monday morning like brought think I'm done long story short we ended up announcing it September 21st it was like a two-week period we were trying to keep it under wraps but I was undoing all the stuff I was letting the necessary people know rock nation HB or everybody know and the night before I announced it man me and my good friend who's a director he's also directing my doc Deonte Thompson he we put together this video it was like a legacy video where I had my young son my middle son and my oldest son and those are like those were like you know that was me at that point in time in my career and we did this whole video that I was going to announce my retirement with and and actually had the doc that I'm working on right now is about this like why did the best fighter at the world of the world at that time walk away from the sport on top shot that video out man the day of my retirement bro and the response was just overwhelming you know it was over when like I just couldn't believe the amount of people that were reaching out and it was it was like good and bad like it was good because I was getting support but it felt like somebody died like I felt like I died from I'm looking at he's resting people like not literal rested pieces but like the comments were like rest in peace like bro I couldn't manage like Ward not you man oh my god man and it was just it was like just this huge reaction and it was overwhelming and in the two years that followed like I said at the beginning of this podcast harder than I thought it was gonna be one of the hardest if not the hardest thing I've ever tried I had to do and still like I still have to do like it's a daily decision to be live not doing it no more but one of the most rewarding man and it was a necessary evil and I hope that one day man the young guys can look up one day and say I'm gonna do the and rewards I'm done I'm out like how long do we have to do it before we feel satisfied look bro save your money if you don't you're not financially literate go get some help ask questions and as soon as you feel like you're not really there you want to do it no more I don't a sunset bro there's other stuff you can do hope to be an example in that area well it's so important I think for there to be a guy like you because people always have this narrative fighters always come back they always fight like Sugar Ray Leonard did when he fought you know later in his career when he fought doors on Iwo lon Danny went and fought yeah the Terry Norris fight was hard a wise man and then you know it Hector Comacho stop yeah yeah I mean it was like you can watch it come out token punch either it was this calf was all fucked up then the Billy Blanks were training them you remember that yeah I mean it's just sad when you see these guys to still try to do it over and over and over again until the same story keeps repeating itself when a guy like you it was only Hagler before you Hagler was only the only guy leverage Louis - oh that's true Lennox Lewis is a handful yeah it's a handful yeah Lennox it was a brilliant guy - you know it's like plays chaffs he's articulate he's it's like he's an interesting intelligent guy that just said that we're good as we did everything we need to do we did everything we need to do how having those guys like you is it's so important for young fighters because they get told by the by the assholes you know hey you know all fighters gonna wind up with brain damage all fighters gonna wind up going out on their back they're all gonna wind up coming back after their prime it's so important for guys like you to say you know no that's you can manage it correctly these are shark-infested waters but if you stay on the rocks and you do your due diligence and you put in the work and your discipline and you fight correctly I agree with you so wholeheartedly about appreciation of the masters of a real masterful boxer like what I always talked to people about Floyd Mayweather they talk all this shit he does this he does that he's got all this money I go save all that forget about his talking watch how that guy fights he fucking barely gets hit he's been rocked maybe twice in his whole career Maidana and Shane and Sugar Shane Mosley those the only two the only two guys who cracked him and he blonde up winning both those fights he's a master masterful boxer and that's what everybody should emulate this day I mean I love the Arturo Gatti making four fights as much as anybody did but if that was my son I'd be freaking the fuck out I'd be like don't fight like that it's not worth it I don't give a fuck how many these drunken assholes cheer you want they're not gonna be with you when you wake up in the morning your head is pounding in your head when you have a hard time looking at light when you have to have all the shades closed when the just a little crack of light coming in through the shade is hurting you it's giving you a headache they're not gonna be there with you when you're old surfer just always put it like this and this is shot a lot of people down I said man let me ask you a question he'd do this to reporters and stuff like I'm not like if there was an opening workout he knew it was a particular reporter in there that was you know Ryan you know talking down against you know guys with a box your question you got kids oh yeah you got a son absolutely if you want to just on the box and it was two guys at the gym and one coach said amen I'm a teacher so not a hit and not get hit period III know this art I've mastered it and I'm helping master it and then you got this guy over here to see like man I'm he may have to take two to give one but look he's gonna be tough he's gonna be durable and what you send your kid weight and they go ah the first guy well there you have it well I think there's a false narrative to here's the false narrative is that the guy who takes two to give one is tougher I think that's nonsense I think the guy who hits and doesn't get hit can be just as tough if not tougher it's art it's not talked about right it's a false narrative to the point yes like my lazy days in the gym would be and I'm just gonna fight today bro I'm gonna stand toe-to-toe and just get it in I'm tired physically I'm not trying to you know execute this game playing today I'm just gonna try to keep a tight defense just go to war those are mighty those are my like my lazy days that when you gotta like like embody a game plan and then round after round even when things aren't going your way try to stick to that game plan bro that's hard you know that's that's draining right and this is something again that I've never said cuz I don't I'm not I don't like talking about myself man I try to stay out the way and but bro I was one of the toughest fighters in the sport of boxing for the past ten years when I was active period no question about it it's just not talked about the chins not talked about you know the toughness part because it's not really associated with the guy who can you know do it a certain way but if you really think about my big fights and the big guys that could punch like I didn't beat them by moving away I beat them by being in their wheelhouse period and even fluid like people don't realize like we will highlight like visible times that we saw Floyd get hit man you're getting buzz and all kind of stuff is going on people don't even know right but we're chameleons as fighters we have to be because if we show weakness now it's water its water in shark-infested water I mean it's blood in shark-infested water sure even in the Conor McGregor fight he got clipped with a big left uppercut man you get but Bing and you just tighten huh and people die god I wasn't a hard shot yes it was just did you know it no Floyd Floyd has had to deal with that throughout the course of your course many times that we didn't know I like how Floyd changed his style too he's when it was a pretty blue Pretty Boy Floyd style early in his career I mean he was much more knockout oriented he was much more aggressive but he would get hit more than you do it and it also broke his hand a bunch of times you know and he just developed a smarter style but people don't remember those knockouts like when he do you see that fight with that Japanese dude I had so many fucking arguments about that five thing where they were trying to say that that was a fixed fight I'm like god damn it listen to me that dude is 126 pounds now he had no fucking business being in there with Floyd Mayweather ever ever forget about Conor McGregor Conor McGregor is a big man yeah that's a tiny dude that dude is 126 pound fighter he's fighting Floyd Mayweather who's arguably the best boxer of all time and Floyd didn't even have to fucking train for that guy he came in there with a little bit of a belly and he's just moving his arms around like this smiling at him hey you fucked you had never seen the floor looks like that but what you want easy and people were saying oh look how the guy went down that's how it happens when a big man who's a real natural welterweight hits 126 pound fighter that's what the fuck happened that's what Shawn I heard him too he was trying to hurt him it's almost like flu I don't know what the agreement would but it was almost like yeah exhibition wait wait yeah and Floyd's a competitor yeah like like like unapologetically he's coming to win every time he you could tell flow was opening up flow reach out flourish on heard do you think he's gonna go about it again cuz there's talk of other fighters his talk of I mean he goes through money like water and he's got a fuckload of it but goddamn he loves to spend it and he's had some financial troubles in the past because of his flashy lifestyle but his skill and his overall boxing ability and his ability to talk shit and generate interest have pulled him out of these problems I hope not 50 now 50 times 50 fights pretty amazing training camp that's enough pretty amazing this does if he does stop pretty amazing that's enough yeah he's retired on what three different occasions came back benefited from it I think he's good selfishly I would love to see it but but realistically I think I think he's good the only thing I could think would maybe talk him out of it is if there was something that could generate in a massive amount of money like a Pacquiao fight like a Pacquiao fight you know Pacquiao still I mean after he beat Keith Thurman like whoo what's the massive amount of money I don't know cuz he's had a massive woman I know my comp team times I would like to ask him like legitimately a man how much you got left I think he would do it for a B there was a B behind it or like like a strong like 750 million with outside like Floyd ain't turning down a B is that possible can you get a billion dollars why not right if anybody could do it right now it's Floyd I mean who would he fight I feel like float out to fight a young guy like he would have to be a like like he's he's he's done the Conor McGregor thing people like I you got us like he'd have to fight a real threat like do because people people to pay that kind of money to see that that oh go so like who like Terrance it we have to be it I don't know but I can I don't know commercially if it's Tara big enough I'm not sure yes spirit like but it would have to one of those kind of guys arrow you know Terrence before people would say job I don't care pay-per-view is 200 I don't care like I don't think there's any star on that level right now right I don't think there's any star on the level of where Floyd was when he was younger in his property there's no one who generates that amount of eyes okay nella fight could do something like that it could but can I was talking about fighting kovalev right but he would he would he would stop talking about finding Koval and start running marathons if it was come today would be in a couple of who-ville Floyd would make him drop down like 145 pounds or something crazy as he should what did he make him fight at the first I 152 or something like that he came with some arbitrary number below it was below junior middleweight I think it was like 52 Oscar De La Hoya did it to Floyd when they fought yeah cuz he was the ACE I yeah he picked the gloves that dorias he picked the size of the ring he picked everything you got to you know driver's seat yes so don't get mad cuz Floyd is doing it right now right Canelo great fighter he's the a side the majority of the time unless you fighting me so look right if you want this money this is what we're gonna do isn't it right now the a plus and the a side though it seems like Canelo so huge particularly the Mexican mean if they were fight again yes if they fought right now Floyd still the a plus but Canelo is kind of a or at least to a - hey buddy he'll always be Floyd will always be the bigger storm yes based on what he's amassed yeah his career and just who use but when you look at what Canelo does like when he knocked out Amir Khan he's that you know he that motherfucker could put some heat on some punches he can partnership and he could box - do you think he can vary that's one thing he really did learn from fighting flowing you know how to not be there you know and you saw that in the subsequent fights like he learned from that fight like that was a learning lesson and you could see in that fight him like like realizing as the fight was going on right now fuck I'm on another level of this video game and I don't know how to beat this boss like Floyd was just shot him down and just doing beautiful things rebels - a game for people who appreciate boxing that's one of the best fights to watch because you got this murderous young upstart who's a devastating punchers a big straw kid who's just tough as fuck he just embraces that Mexican style of fighting pressure a lot of power moving forward that's exciting to me yeah I people I don't like I get it but like on the other hand I don't get it like how do you not see what's happening right now you have a young dude who can really punch like we just said one punch can change it all employs a little bit older he's not old but he's older yeah and he found a way to neutralize this young bull this young lion and then expose him like he took away his strength and then you know exposed his weakness like tight like in a 12-round fashion like not one round not five not two but 12 rounds and left and left Canelo without answers like that type of stuff that's the way I was brought up yeah like man take away his greatest strength and and and and expose his weakness bro like like that to me I'm I can watch 20 rounds like that I think that's because you are you're not just a great fighter but you're also you you're a deep fan of the sport but it wasn't always like that when you were a kid weren't you a big fan of it yeah of course so you understand like the the the when you're seeing a masterful performance you understand that the general public really doesn't understand what's happening they don't see it and that's a job as analysts and writers to educate the people you're gonna have your diehards they're gonna pick and choose what they like and generally speaking the die-hard is gonna you know appreciate both styles and maybe have a favorite style but they're gonna tune in for all of them yeah it's the fight is over the casual right and we in boxing we kill our so we shoot ourselves in the foot because a there's so much infighting and then you have people literally like when a guy's fighting a master's fighter man it's not worth you it's not worth watching I'll give you an example I'll bring it to the MMA world I'm a casual an amazing like Gilbert Melendez he we've worked out with him Nick and Nate and a couple other guys like so I'll watch if one of those guys are final you know some of those guys don't fight anymore but like or Cormier or maybe a challenge owns like I'll watch those types of guys I've never heard maybe you can enlighten I've never heard an announcer like rip a guy like even if a guy has no ground game look if someone so gets him on the ground he's in trouble with it you stand up with this guy you're giving me a reason to stay engaged we unboxing a lot of times and we have in past times I think we've gotten a little bit better as of late oh this is terrible listen man if I'm a casual fan why I'm not gonna stick around the fight is over the casual not the hardcore fan so we make you know a guy who can hit and not get hit like it's some you know some super like this is it's some special thing that you know you know you gotta be really really smart to understand it's really not it's the fundamentals of the game like when you go into a gym for the first time hey man use your jab hey man you hit this guy take a half step back so he can't return fire it's the fundamentals of the game at the highest level it's not that deep it's really not it's being presented to people like it's deep it's nice hit and not get hit and even in the hole hit and I give you a concept you're gonna get hit you're going to get hit you can't avoid contact all the time and then you got a deal to see okay this dude he really doesn't like to get hit the majors got hit with that good shot man he came back many many responded wow a minute that dude does have heart if you're really looking at it you're gonna see a fight you're gonna see boxing all in one fight even against a guy who's a master you're gonna see the whole gamut well in Sports commentary there's a way that sports people right and there's a way that sports people do commentary where it's very negative and they like to call people they like to call people bums all right they'd like there's an appeal to a certain kind of fan and it's very profitable to be very negative and to talk about a certain way I made a very conscious decision when I started doing commentary to celebrate these fighters and to try to honor their hard work and what they're doing and to let people know how spectacular it is to me they're someone who loves the sport yeah and I stay away from negative as much as possible unless it's absolutely neck it's someone who have to make some egregious error yeah for me for me to say don't ever do this when I talk about these guys I want people to feel yeah how I feel when I watch if I watch like Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson is like one of my favorite of all time and one other thing about Demetrius to me that's so spectacular was that he was able to fight these amazing fighters and make them look like they had no business being in there with him his movement his arsenal his technique he could do anything he could take you down he could submit you he could kick you it could punch you he moved his footwork his movement it was masterful but he had a hard time finding an audience I did my best mm I did my best to let people know like you weren't watching a special person you're watching a magician in there I mean he's on the highest level I've ever seen in all my years of watching combat sport that's as high as it ever gets he's just 125 pounds excited about it but you did your part and dry you did your part and listen at this time you got a call fighters out for stuff I'm not I'm not opposed I'm not saying that you always have to be in alignment with a fighter you know if it's justified to call him out if he if he defeat if you put on a bad performance look bro he didn't perform everything Bradley did that recently and I think it was very justified which was there was a Russian heavyweight and he was on an undercard and it was fighting this other dude and the dude kind of laid down yeah and Timothy Bradley was like listen let's be honest that guy's mom yeah yeah cause he felt like he wanted a way out he wasn't really here to fight he was here to pad this guy's record I'm like man you know that's that's exactly true yeah you got to yes you know that's one of the things that's important about you like you are very credible and but you're also very positive and fair you're they're trying to be praised I try to be man I like I think also was hurt like and I think we do a great job at ESPN well not cool you know well you guys have replaced the best which used to be HBO HBO when HBO went away man I was like I can't believe they're getting out of the boxing game yeah I couldn't believe I'm still shocked I can't there was a flat with 40 years or somebody I grew up with uh yeah get it on my DVR every time like here we go who's fighting that's one thing that we try to stress you know our early producing Mike McQuaid Joe tessitura Tim Bradley mark Regal Bernardo asuno Christina pons are like we are trying to be fair and objective but yet truthful and if you and we everybody has a reverence for the guys that are getting in there and with all of that on the table then we try to call it from that point what's happening in what's happened in past times and even a little bit still today is personal agendas personal issues like spill over into the commentary or into the article that's being written like if you don't like Floyd's lifestyle I don't ascribe to Floyd's lifestyle but that's not my business as a fighter we're gonna call this the way we see it yes he is arguably one of the greatest of all time now wherever you have them on that list that's your decision subjective but people would take the lifestyle and things that was your artist you know Flik no man you're letting that spill over into this and now you're messing up this broadcast right now because Floyd's doing something and we're not acknowledging it and it's clear that you don't like him that's the issue keep those things separate lifestyles lifestyle you're gonna talk about that and you're doing a background story or whatever ok address that but if we're talking in the ring come on man genius well it's so interesting to to see a guy like you who is a former to division world champion and Olympic gold medalist who also transitions to be an excellent broadcaster because there's only been a few George Foreman I love him to death but he was odd doing commentary but he would say crazy shit yeah what does he say it I mean he spoke his mind that's why people loved him oh yeah so folksy yeah who's such a you know I mean and you knew I mean he's obviously a fantastic heavyweight and the oldest heavyweight the oldest guy ever to win the heavyweight title Roy was great as as a commentator as well you know but where the fuck is Jim Lampley I'm not sure what Jim's doing right now you know I'm surprised he's not out there to actually Oh Jim McCall um I don't know I don't understand it he was so good he is to me the gold standard of play-by-play I did hear that he was teaching somewhere you know that's one thing he's doing I'm sure just teaching you at a college somewhere really yeah what's he teaching I'm not sure I'm sure I'm sure yeah how interesting Jim could do whatever he wants to do is intelligent smart he's paid his dues I think I think he's gonna have his pick I'm not sure why we haven't seen him out there in the forum I'm sure he's doing something yeah I miss him yeah me too man like that's one of my mentors like I started off without burning is show time I was one of my first mentors then obviously Lampley Kellerman yeah where's Kellerman cuz Kellerman is doing other things for ESPN but he's not calling fight he works with us does he but he doesn't do every fight he'll do specific fights he'll be at the desk so he's not though he's not he's dying son right but what is that why isn't he doing I'm not sure MA he's got a lot going on what the fuck he's got a lot going on but we have what we have a great crew man like Joe territory man come on judging in the game yes legend in the game and you and Tim together a fantastic appreciation you know it's amazing manners we got our guy mark Regal you know doing doing the you know personal stories and yeah taking the guys back around like probably the best storyteller that I know that's out right now well it's so interesting this ESPN Plus thing in the zone and these streaming services that have come along that have sort of changed everything I mean I don't worry about taping anything anymore I know I'm gonna go home I'm either gonna watch like I watch him on my phone if I'm out like I was at dinner with my wife and I was sneaking fights in the bathroom my try to take a leak fights while I'm peeing it's like you that you can get it anywhere as long as you have internet service now you know I mean it's that's so fantastic I think that's where we're headed like exclusively yeah I think so too I mean the UFC think so as well they made this deal with ESPN and a lot of people freaked out but for me it's fucking great I mean it's great you know my daughter had this event that she was going to and you know as soon it was over I ran upstairs I pulled on the phone and I'm watching fights crazy it's crazy instantaneously you don't to go home you get them right there you know it's just a whole new world this world of what I want it right now it's funny though because I hear people with the you know I have the whole narrative boxing still to listen the the reports of boxing's demise has been greatly exaggerated I've been hearing this stuff for so long boxing's day like it's just like for casual fans just something cool to say no or white wires and boxing what it used to be listening the errors are there errors but in terms of like a veil content available fights like I think we're at an all-time high right yes I think so too there are other people doing what they're doing god bless them but what we're doing at ESPN ma I think it's unmatched yeah I think ESPN is fantastic right now and I appreciate the zone as well I mean boxing is in an amazing place right now there's so many elite fighters and there's a lot of hype on the sport right now as people that are very excited about it people that are casual fans look the Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder fight did more for heavyweight boxing than I think any fight in recent memory when Deonte knocked him down the 12th round and Tyson Fury rose like Lazarus and you're like holy shit he did and then after that he won the round like this is insane he looks like he's getting it looked like his soul left his fucking body I turned on my wife I was like that's a rat like what he got up with in the tank out like I'm trying to figure out if it was over and it would did you send away the do got up and when the rest of the round dude I was watching in my bed right so I'm sitting I'm laying back my feet are on the bed Deonte hits him I rock it towards the front of the bed I'm sitting down like holy shit he knocked him out in the 12th round I'm saying oh my god oh my god my wife comes in the room she's like what the fuck you doing I'm like he got up yeah she just walks with her hands up fury saved his career he did he put tens of millions of that that was the 100 million dollar Gator it was the greatest getup of all I don't know how much he got from ESPN is reported 100 million some people say no but that getup was was was a very very wealthy getup and then how about the fact that he gives his entire persuade men charity man I mean who the fuck gives 10 million dollars away to charity I love to give but I ain't giving home no way million everybody still love you yeah I can't do that not the whole thing he's an interesting cat man and the the will to get up mean the Deontay Wilder is it terrifying hunter he's a terrifying puncher but it's like I said earlier that those intangibles they're in you not on you yeah and he showed what was in them in their moment oh it's a hundred percent enemy there's not a goddamn person the world that can count out Tyson Fury that I mean that man is special the way he rose I can't wait to see the reman oh is that gonna happen it's going to happen there's all this talk but his is reportedly not official but reportedly February Las Vegas but doesn't he have to Tyson have to get past what was named Auto why Lane valine volley Moline he's got to get past that dude that might not happen I mean he could lose to that guy a weird shit happened Luis Ortiz yes yeah hey Robert put it on him in that first fight but you always are teased at least 150 years only right at least at least of Cuban birth certificates he's been like 40 for like ten years like bro come on you keep saying you forty years old you're older than that right now no but he's been telling us that he's been the same age for a long time I'm hopeful I think both guys know what's on the tape they're gonna rise man I think they don't get it then no guarantees boxing stuff happens but crazy hopefully they take your business and we get the rematch well I hope neither fighter looks past particularly Deonte and Ortiz because Ortiz hit him with some fucking bombs in that first fight and had him hurt man when he recovered he did recover you've recovered and stopped him what a crazy record that guy's got he's like 39 and oh right no 40 39 knockouts 40 wins one draw fuck 39 knockouts I know to just to fight yeah one draw in one decision - was it Brazil no no no rasili just knocked out Luverne Luverne right and then he came back in knocks tavern now the rematch but that's made him pay for going to distance like he want to go to distance with me oh I got something not only that the way he did it wasn't defiant hands down winging punches that come from Jupiter right I was like my biggest fear like losing was one thing but like just getting knocked out ugly like like my biggest fear was like getting hit with a shot I didn't see or even feeling and woke up like what happened bro no no no like that what happened you as an amateur knew never thank God but that was my biggest feel like you can't control it you can be a tip-top shape you can have all the mental stuff down check the boxes and I was in boom like if the shaba Kovalev landed a little bit left or right who knows right right that's the crazy thing about that getting punched right because in this day and age bro they're merciless yeah the Internet is barceló they're so merciless it's crazy when I was a kid I was a giant fan of Donald curry mmm Donald curry fought Milton McCrory Milt McCrory hit him with a left hook to the body and then a left hook on the chin and I was like oh no oh no Mike McCallum I'm sorry he knocked out Milt McCourt and with a left hook but Mike McCallum the Body Snatcher hit him with a left hook to the body and then one up top and the one up top starched him and he went flat on his back I was like no I remember I couldn't take it I put my shoes on I went running hmm I couldn't take it and I decided at that point as I was running down the street I was like I'm never gonna get emotionally attached to a fighter I'm never gonna like put all my eggs in it's too hard I lost too yeah yeah it wasn't just I saw Mike who I'm a fan of I'm a fan of Mike McHale he was an amazing fighter it wasn't just that it was just it was like it hurt me that's how I felt when Roy lost for the first time I was in New Jersey and it was like a us I'm still an amateur the USA versus Ireland duel and I wasn't fighting in it but I was just out there supporting the team and we couldn't get the fight and then all of a sudden people started blowing me up and like because I knew roar was my do you heard what happened what do you mean I got knocked out I ain't knocked up mr. so I'm like trying to look him or I got knocked out but I was I was I was done like I just like I just dragged I went to my room bro put the covers over my head went to sleep and I woke up and I just felt like I felt like I lost like that was so painful like that's my guy that's Roy Jones he's Superman you don't get knocked out he got knocked out he was in a non song the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones I mean that was when when he was in his prime people don't understand when you would watch him he'd the way he would just dice guys up and do it so unorthodox that a leaping left hook was crazy oh my it wasn't just the average like I'm talking tough I believe in myself he danced to the Rain Man he came he came in the ring in like a tuxedo roll yes I'm one of the little droids ducktail you had like there well like I wanted to do a Roy did I remember I wrote him a letter and Brad Jacobs who's the CEO of top ranked boxing right now but a cheat CFO excuse me he was over Roy's company square ring at the time and I remember Brad wrote me back and was like hey thanks for riding Roy Roy was getting ready for Vinny Pazienza next time you're in Vegas he wants to meet you and the next time ended up being John Ruiz I was it next time we were in Vegas but like I've been rocking with Roy for a long time he wasn't he fought Pazienza that was I believe the only time a fighter never scored a single punch in a round Pazienza literally couldn't hit him but the way he did it again like that he had passed he has it going he's looking at the ref like a man stop the fight yeah okay shrug like this and boom boom him like three uppercuts fight over I'm like who does that nobody nobody did it like Roy did it not in the you know it wouldn't it's hard for people to look back now because he's not happening while it's happening yeah well but when it was happening back then you would just go he played a full game of basketball the day of a fight who does it nobody does yeah against Eric Lucas on HBO yeah it's crazy Oh does Dan know buddy he did amazing shit man when he kept fighting what did that cement in your idea that that was never gonna happen to you yeah yeah yeah and I hate that he was kind of he was one of the ones I'm not gonna say he was the one because there's a lot of that stuff going on in boxing but heat like when I seen that I was like dude I can't man the Glen Johnson fight was hard I was there the Glen Johnson fight was hard because he was stiff he was deaf and that was right after the targa fight he came out with my gold medal on I just got back from Greece and Roy had my medal own he's rapping to the ring and he's got my medal on it and I'm sitting probably like in the third row or something like that and he got starched and these two boys who you know they've grown now but they were young and they're trying to like get over the little like like barrier they're trying to get in the ring and I was remember I remember it like a couple hours after that I'm walking around downtown and I saw one of Roy's guys and he's like I drink come in and Roy was in the back of a row Royce and it was just just him and it was all dark and he had his head down and you know he opened the door and here or I kind of looked up I was like man what's up boy like what's up baby I Love You Man I love you I saw like a telling us I love you i dapped him up getting my hug and then I was it but I'll never forget that moment never forget that and it just for whatever reason he just its weren't able to recovery man and I think you know that you know again the boo birds yeah you got the people - all right I knew Roy couldn't talk about listen bro you don't get as far as he got not being able to take a punch but when you strip off 25 pounds of muscle abruptly yeah right it shocks you you can't you can't take a punch like body's weak yeah the weak and your whole neuromuscular sisters all messed up yeah no it's it's I mean we see it in fights all the time or fighters lose too much weight it's terrifying to see that but to see Roy the targa fight was hard to watch but offers a great fighter he called me clip to me hurt him he knocked him down they stopped the fight he couldn't get up that mean but the Glen Johnson fight was much more terrifying to me because he banged his head off the ground when he went out and he went out stiff where one leg was up in the air those those ones where guys looks like he's getting electrocuted when they go out scared those are the scary ones and Tarver you know taking nothing from Glen Johnson he was a total total overachiever yes you know animal lunch-pail type guy blue collar fighters but she didn't expect him to do that right and a lot of people didn't expect Harbor to do it either but like you know Olympian you know like you could see the skill set yeah big left-handed guys so it's not like out of the question and something like that can happen but nobody saw that coming with Glen Johnson no do you think that he just hadn't recovered really truly from the Tarver knockout I think my gut I think it was that a and then be out I don't think he took me serious mmm I think he looked at it like you know it's cool I'm gonna get back with this guy and I'm gonna get back to the top I just don't think he took him serious and Glynn I was his superb oh yeah he's a road warrior that's his nickname yes he had to get it the hard way so I got Roy Jones coming off a knockout to tartar let's go he came in tip-top shape and I just wish Grover took a serious yeah that made Glen Johnson's career now literally literally you know Tarver went on to fight I mean all way up to heavy weight right I mean I think he was fighting fairly recently wasn't he he's got a fight coming up him and his son are gonna fight on the same Carter apology I think in Florida I don't know the details but yeah but he hasn't fought in a couple of years I think he's been trying to get a fight you know you'll see Tarver post of like oh I'm ready and I don't know why he hasn't been able to get a chance I don't know but I got I got once I got over the Roy stuff and I'll never fully get over it but learn I'm forgiven tar before it it took a minute but like I got I got an immense amount of respect for Tarbert respect him he had to get it the hard way too like he's a guy that didn't really get a lot of respect and love but did did so much for the sport and in the sport so I got a soft spot for Tarver because I know again he didn't get his just due but like he pressed his way man he'd beat a lot of good guy I don't think he got his just too after he knocked Roy out I feel like there's a lot of people that were second-guessing it they were saying well it's just evidence of Roy's demise like wait a minute Tarbert said at the fucking touch of gloves got any excuses tonight Roy and then knocks him out I mean if that doesn't get people's respect I mean he he did what he was supposed to do even more than that like to have the guts to chase Roy down like yeah he literally chased him down like when Roy fought Clinton woods in Portland Harbor was at that press conference and every fight leading up to the ruies fight Tarver was at that press conference he'd I was following up with his manager on the phone so they could hear what Roy saying like that takes a lot of guts bro to chase the best fighter in the world that seems invincible and say look give me a shot like cause if you lose that's it for you bro yeah you know he did it believed in himself the first fight was close in a second fire he said what he said in the beginning like what kind of guest does that take the view like with the whole world and you got any excuses tonight and even before the knockout buddy McGirt says something about respect he said man you don't have too much respect baby he said don't use that word in his corner he was locked in Wow he was locked in and then went out knock go out so yeah it had something to do with that but that's not Harper's fault don't use that word in this corner never heard nothing like that before Wow who do you when you look at the game right now who do you think who was exciting - obviously this Terence Crawford and Loma chenko but there's anybody that really stands out for you my little brother Shakur Stevenson co-managing along with James Prince and Josh Steuben silver medalist he's getting ready to fight his first title fight coming up at featherweight he he stays focused which I believe he will he's gonna be on top for a long time Teddy may Lopez he's a young up-and-coming guy he's getting ready to fight reportedly Richard call me sometime in December possibly he's a young guy obviously Terrence arrow spins they have to fight right it's tough man it's tough but for a fan listen God listen I want to see it but if you're on his side I see what they're doing and honestly what are they doing you can't even be mad at it will al Heyman and those guys over there they got all the welterweights so if you don't if you're not you know if you don't really like the other side or if you feel some type of way about ESPN atop rank and you know that Terrence is won this fight why not make him wait a year or two and let your guy arrow Spence try to clean out the whole welterweight division now he has Shawn Porter coming up and that's not gonna be easy fight for either guy not and I respect it and got a lot of love for both but they're trying to squeeze them out so they're looking at us like yeah I hear you you want that fight but we got bigger plans I'm gonna let my guy you know amass you know a bigger following he's got a big following in Dallas in Jerry's world Jerry Jones behind you no arrow Spence so that's what that that's what they're doing right now and as a fan I don't like it but as a businessman I get it I understand what they're doing but from your like what you're saying you know to your point my only thing with that and I've told both guys this like you can't say that you're the best and you may feel like you're the best you may tell yourself you're the best but you really don't know if you're the best until you fight the best and that's my only thing with boxing as it stands today like social media man social media tells a lot of lies like it's some young guys coming up I'm not gonna name any names but if some young guys coming up who who have a lot of potential could possibly be the guy but they're not fighting anybody but yet they'll go to social you know I'm the man I'm next Floyd's going on next and you get social media you right man you next hotter come on man if something call boxrec or fight fax punching and then you go to the search punch him first last night and you got to be specific with boxrec because if you're not if you misspell a letter in the word in the name it won't pop up so get the name right first and last and then all of a sudden the record pops up first fight to whatever that last fight was and then you can cross-reference the guys they beat oh this Duty beat was twenty and OH click on click on that dude's name I just dude ain't fought nobody so here's 20 and oh really ain't a real 20 you know and you're hanging your hat on the fact that you beat that guy it's a lot of that in the game and guys aren't willing to test themselves now listen it's a place for building it's a place for getting seasoning I'm not I'm not a fan of rushing like I'm not you know that's not what I'm saying but at a certain point in time if you're gonna say that you're the best and that you're the next flooring and that you regardless of what weight class you may be you gotta test yourself against the best because guess what you don't even know how good you are you won't know until you face another guy like I said this the other day when I was in the UK I said everybody wants to be a lion when there's no lions around mmm you can be a lion in them in the company of hyenas but when you're facing another lion now we're gonna see what you're really working with yeah everybody's a soldier when there's no wars going on but when the war happens now we're gonna see what you made it I would just like to see at a certain point in time I get making money I get the political stuff that's going on we don't know but at some point in time if your pupil is gonna say that they're the best you gotta face the best so we can really see who's who now if you're not about their life and you're like dude I'm just trying to make as much money for the least amount of risk I support it and at least you made your intentions clear but you can't have your cake and eat it too you can't say you're the best but not fight the best you face the best at some point in time I like what boxing does in that the managers dictate who the fighters fight in that they do build their fighters up correctly and one of the things that bothers me about MMA is I think there's some really good young fighters who get ruined mm-hmm because they get thrown to the Wolves too quickly and they wind up getting the confidence shatter they get knocked out and everyone they shouldn't be there fighting a caliber fighter they're not prepared for for every one fighter like that you know there's always the arguments of like a guy like John Jones youngest-ever light heavyweight champion lung youngest's every UFC champion fights a legend Mauricio Shogun who when he was 22 or 23 think he was 23 years old it opens up with a flying knee hits him in the face beats the fuck out of them and takes the title for every John Jones there's a guy who's coming up that maybe could have been a world champion but didn't get managed correctly and then the UFC doesn't give you any options Yosi says hey you want to fight tomorrow you smile okay here's your fight this is it let's trade off right your fans get the big fights but but but you know in the wake of how many careers yes that's the trade-off the fans get the big fights but I don't think we necessarily see the highest caliber of fighter fight the highest caliber of fighter with the the best case scenario at all times do you know I'm saying I don't I don't think we get to see the most out of some of these guys mm because I think that if they were managed if there was it was a ton of different promoters around and you weren't locked in any specific sort of an organization like the UFC has I think you could see more manager saying you know hey man you're not ready for Robbie Lawler Heyman you're not ready for this guy we're gonna take this this fight on a regional level we're gonna build you up we're gonna get you to you know 15 16 you know then we're gonna start challenging some top 10 contenders and cement your place but this way you'll have seen all the looks you'll have seen a great wrestler you have seen a great striker you you fought a Muay Thai champion you Father jujitsu God you know how to handle all these different scenarios and in MMA that is part of the problem is that it's not just your hands there's so many different scenarios that you have to deal with it's like the JD Wentworth commercial I need my money now that's what it is hey Chad anyways like bro I need to get paid now right now you had you up and coming I can't find a better matchup let's make it happen the UFC will throw a guy on his UFC debut against a guy who's a world-class contender and you watch them get lit up like a Christmas tree and I'm not a fan of that man I'm a fan of again seasoning make sure you're ready but it's like in boxing man and not everybody like if you look at the light heavyweight division is one of the hottest and the most willing divisions for guys to face each other I'm sold on Russian yeah they spit them out whoo they spit them out yeah but like as you look at some of these other divisions it's like man do like how many posts can you have where you're saying that you're the best but yet you're refusing to fight the best but there is a thing about social media though where these guys can self promote in a way that's never really been available there it's all good but like just don't expect everybody to buy it right well as a champion you you value that title the best so and also as they don't care about it then then we're not gonna bother you but when you when you bring that light on yourself right now we want we want to have you you know back up what you're saying well that's one of the reasons why the UFC takes this strategy they give a young fighter fight you look you think you're a beast okay we're gonna throw you into the beasts you might have four or five professional fights and occasionally guys get through and you realize wow this guy truly is special that's the philosophy of the UFC is put together the best fights all the time like every car they want murderers fighting murderers and I see that from a promotional perspective it's brilliant and from a fan perspective it's brilliant but from a person who values fighters development I would go if I was a manager I go don't take that from him don't take that fight not yet not yet not yet it's like Tyson Fury give me a fight out of valine another tuna fight are you was well listen why lean is a good fighter we'll see how good he is but you also have to look at like Tyson Fury and everything he came off of you know drugging and boozing and you know just on the brink of disaster personal disaster like give him a couple fights to get the rest off right so when he does face Wilder it's it's an even better fight yes why is water fighting Luis Ortiz listen give it some time so it's not that we're trying to like sell these fights individually but we're selling the package deal like support that you support these guys yeah you want to see the rematch yeah we're gonna get a better fight if you let them go through the the maturation process you know Wilders trying to you know stalling and wait for you know Tyson figure to get what he needs to get out of the way Tyson's trying to get a little bit more rust off so it could be a better fight than it was the first time and sometimes fans don't see that and like you said it to your point we as broadcasters and writers we have to we have to educate the people a little bit they still may not like it but at least we have to present the facts and say this is why we're seeing this right now so you do a fantastic job I tried man really do I try I try you know I'm trying to you know just continue to just keep keep on keepin on man but I can I got a dude I got a great team and I had a great team at at HBO again still can't believe they're not in the business and I still keep in contact with a lot of those guys and then we'll we have it at ESPN man it's just it's just different man like I leave producer like I said Mike McQuaid like we like in past times I would just show up to the to the site location on a Thursday night fighter meetings production meeting on Friday Saturday's the fight I'd go home Sunday now like we have a production call the week of a fight on Tuesday probably an hour long we're constantly texting and sending emails of information you know either Joe test is you know challenging us in this area or Timson in an article I'm sending something or Bernardo sending something or you know Mark crew like we're just on another level right now and I think that's why people get the production that they're getting no you can tell you can tell you can tell in the actual fight itself while you guys are doing the commentary that you guys are buttoned down and locked up I mean it's it's all your T's are crossed and your eyes are dotted so performers business but yes it is now you're approaching that the same way you approached your fight career no any other way I don't know any other way when you're doing it though I mean you're you're 20 how many months out of your last fight when you're doing it though there's two gotta be a niche sometimes yeah there's got to be a niche it's not gonna go away how you just accept the fact that you have that edge is you're a part of you that thinks like there's a 10% chance you might make it come back do you have a number in your head yes is that whatever percent it is and then I wake up and I start hearing a pop pop boom boom my knees in my back that's why so that discourages me quick man um do you still exercise yeah I got to stay fit hit the bag I had done a boxing thing but I think I'm gonna do it it's weird like part of me has done it for my whole life so I'm kind of burnt out and then the other part is like I don't want to miss it like I want to do something else so I'll do a lot of you know spinning spinning classic spin classes I take spin classes but then also have a peloton at my house I have the peloton treadmill and the peloton spending bike a versatile climber I love that thing yeah yeah so I do I do a lot of you know alternative stuff but I think I'm gonna get back in him because a great way to just keep the weight off and after two years I think I'm ready to start hitting back again man Mike Tyson says he can't he said he doesn't want to he says if he starts hitting the pads again and hitting the bag again well even at 50 he says his ego starts firing up and he starts thinking about I feel him nassim Richardson legendary train out of Philly he put it to me like this like like last year sometime he said somebody acting like man you think like we interviewed him for my doctor and my boy Dee I'll tell you the director he said listen do you think Jay is ever gonna come back he said you know what he said I don't think so he said you got to realize I enjoyed hasn't hasn't lost in a long time he said as soon as he starts looking at retirement like an opponent I think he's gonna be just fine and I never looked at it like that before but then when I finally understood what he was saying it's like that's what I'm fighting against right now so like just like a regular opponent I studied retirement right like I said earlier the highs and the lows the good the bad stories just like when I fight in a fight I got my supporters and I got my detractors I got people saying man a mistake on Broadway to get out on top I miss you but man amen I'm happy you did it like that then I got people said ah he's coming back all fighters come back just like I was in a real fight I wanted to win battle right this is a battle that I want to win - so I'm looking at retirement like an opponent right now and and I'll ask you know I don't know how many years I've been doing pretty good against opponents so I like myself I like your chances too and I think you're very important for the sport I think you're an important shining example of what's possible what's possible both with your accomplishments and also what's possible with walking away with you all your marbles and tiring man so thank you for everything brother thank you for doing this I'm pretty sure I really appreciate it oh thank you thank you man bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
