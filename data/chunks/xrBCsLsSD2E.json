was that freakiest a no no yeah I meant to wear it the panel yesterday I actually I was late yeah um what we're talking about here folks is he has a freak a cast and shirt and I just learned about this very recently from Jordan Peters I had no idea I didn't know what the deal with the Frog was and do you know that you can't have the Frog now what is it on iTunes Apple iTunes well again use the Frog it's great what the fuck people it's a frog it's a crown frog Hillary Clinton denounced it so she denounced you oh yeah she said something about deplorable what'd she say about the Frog oh it was part of an article on her website oh how they they were saying how this consoling frog this is the best we can make them well they look ridiculous on their own every means the day is we're saying that we're already like doing the bad thing lumping people in these groups mystically but it is a weird thing that they they don't understand like whoever gets upset at this does not understand how preposterous it is to freak out about a frog and who the fuck is over at Apple first of all what about the poor bastard that made Pepe the Frog for totally non kekaa Stan oh non-infantry red pill reasons this poor bastard just had this cartoon frog that he made feels bad man you know and then all of a sudden that poor guy has to say I'm killing off Pepe did she not shit nobody knows who you are but everyone knows who Pepe is something like that that's so crazy yeah it's silly to think that he could've achieve it isn't there he's well everybody's so well they're almost like they have to denounce it yeah you know otherwise they'll get lumped in with a support or like he probably does think that he's people think he's a supporter maybe well I don't think they do I think he's like you know I don't know what's going on so honest to have it live when he looked into much there's a weird man because like you know people think that being shadow band like Scott Adams had a big post the other day were sitting in shadow band yeah he's but he said he talked to Jack at Twitter and Jack said there's no shadow bearing I talked to Josh she shuts up Jack we know this oh this is Sargon speaking Japanese kids right jack tell me jack why haven't I been verified well she's probably super busy with the four hundred billion people that are on Twitter probably super full of shit that's also if you tried to go yeah three times and every time they just denied why I mean what is it don't have enough spending powers you have two hundred thousand that seems like a lot accounts about me my fans need to know who I am on Twitter don't you think that's the reason for verification jack isn't that interesting because if you were on a television show it would be expected that you would be verified by now with that kind of following that's a giant following and you're assuming 30,000 on youtubes yeah that's a lot of people seems worth verifying before yeah but it's no it's a badge of status which is why they do verified Milo I mean that's this one D verify you can't do that how do you verify someone and then oh it's not Milo anymore is it jack you you're that's the guy yeah you're a fucking lie you know it's a badge of status you know you're doing it to create some sort of privileged class on Twitch I mean they they even get like a different function don't they yeah well you can only see from other verified how every count on Twitter should be verified yeah that is a thing you do right you're allowed to only see accounts that are verified yeah it's a privilege and he took it away from Milo to punish him for being a dissident and he won't verify me to punish me for being a dissident and he knows it this is a stranger your fucking balls deep in this dude you I feel it you're like very emotionally invested yes oh yeah that's because I've never I've never had to play the game I'm we're now entirely on my own merits I've never I've never had any industry connections I've never been I've never been to America before I've never spoken to any of these people they only who am and they're all afraid of me because I think because if I can do it anyone can do it but why do you think it's fear at the well you definitely don't need them no one needs anything please but that's a good thing but you can't create a system of privilege without interdependence connections mm there is no system of privilege if you don't have to rely on other people to maintain a privileged class if you don't have to maintain the privileged class and you can't you don't have to rely on people their status goes away let's break this down for people who don't know what the fuck were talking about okay you're um may I call you Carl that's your actual name right was that cool he dead naming a dachshund me I'm dancing you you've already been doxed we were discussing this yeah now your YouTube account you have great videos you really great commentary a very smart guy thank you and how did you get in viola quizzes you an all right guy no you're not right yeah the only all right is an identity and movement for white people they're heavily nationalist protectionist anti interventionist they're not like laissez-faire free market capitalist I'm a liberal I'm I'm like an English liberal as in I want universal rights laissez-faire capitalism I don't mind I mean socialized health care and a well well first thing I'm happy with as long as its Universal and don't just apply to some as long as anyone could access it if I needed to just universal rights for all I don't I don't see the I can't see a reason to discriminate against someone when it comes to dealing with rights well whose bosom like defining all right is it been clearly defined not because it's so new it's actually relatively well defined now because the over I have asserted themselves I said look no we're for white people you know we're pro why are you saying that which which guys like you know like Ramsey Paul as soon as Spencer but as soon as someone like that says they're alright then everybody else just assumes that they either like allows them to define it because I think there's probably a lot of people consider the cells all right where they were right-wing but they weren't racist they weren't or right supremacist they just didn't like this old man right that was in there for I think they call themselves the ulta lights I don't know a light I don't know whether that's a determine disparagement or not but I over knew rights or something I like the things I don't run in these circles so I actually I actually don't really know very much about those guys either Watson's and Sena bitches right I don't find it particularly offensive I just find them to be like a modern form of conservatism I think Paul Joseph Watson is a very reasonable guy very articulate it seems pretty smart he he does the opposite of what the media does but the it's that's not that's not a criticism actually points exactly yeah yeah absolutely I think it's necessary for him to exist you know he's like you know hit because they both create narratives and it's not that these narratives aren't true it's just that sometimes these narratives sometimes leave things out but not always this isn't like a condemnation of either side by saying this this is just what they do and that's okay you know everyone's entitled to create their own resolve and I'm gonna use the word propaganda but again I'm not using it in derogatory sense right it's I mean you're like look I want to make this point I don't wanna make your point you know because you're making your point I'm gonna make my point and it these two points will both stand in existence and will both be true at the same time hmm and so it's okay for Paul Joseph Watson to exist you know it's fine I don't have a problem with him I don't have I don't really have any criticisms of it to be honest otherwise you know you know I mean I wouldn't do what he's doing but what is he doing that you wouldn't do it goes a bit harder than I would and he I don't think he is as objective as I would prefer a new source I prefer someone more like Phil Edie you know isn't that an interesting thing the ability is this is a real real problem when it comes to left versus right or any of these groups they get lumped into these categories and then you start defending your turf yeah and that that seems to be a huge issue today yet everybody just sort of digs her heels in the sand and besides this is who I am and those other people and you start using they and them which is what I try to avoid that bad guys yeah they and they what they want what the left wants and you know it's it's really tough phones because I'm that I've actually done like channel I've actually pulled my subscribers and stuff and I got like it was a bit like a year ago but my content hasn't really changed tenor and I got like tens of thousands of responses so it's a really good sample size and most of most of my subscribers are center-left liberals who didn't lost you know they're not identitaire us they don't want to sit there and go you know I mean I was at VidCon and they had so many panels they're like let me talk about me being a Latin ex let me talk about me being in Latino and it's a what a Latin there laughter next year the non-binary latina I'm not making this up I'm joking I wouldn't I would make anything up and I won't lie to you right I'm absolutely serious this sort but the thing is what really annoys me but identity politics right and let me tell you about my identity I look dude that's none of my fucking business I don't care about your fucking identity do not tell me how you identify it's not my problem it's not my business it's not political and if you want to make it put on shut up and fuck off cuz I don't care hey Joe let me tell you this yes plantino may vs. Latin X versus Latin II which word best saw Spanish gender problem really addressing the holiday thing is Susan Jesus Rachel Richard Rikard right when I say your name okay right right card right card right good yeah yeah what the best Spanish is gender what with gender problem exactly it is talking about themselves they're not spent real problems it's just what happens when you have too many vaccines I miss what happens when you have too much money Wow people are just too it's too easy to get by the lens oh yeah thinking hey people give a shit what I care what I think my own genitals mean already get out yeah unless you're sticking them in my face of real I give a fuck yeah exactly then that's an interesting thing it's not like a political problem no it's not a political problem well I mean what I mean the politics of human interaction I guess yeah a little bit most is when they say let me tell you about my blackness and I what the hell do you mean by your blackness and they're like well meet me as a black person so you're gonna start stereotyping yourself on you you're gonna tell you gonna give me a stereotype of black people and then you can say this is somehow representative not only you but other people but then you're validating Richard Spencer when he says hey can I talk to you about my whiteness what's your arguments say no I'm not allowed to do that exactly what's wonderful you'll talk to me about your blackness I'll talk about my whiteness and all of a sudden we're gonna both realize you know we're just talking about cells we're just talking about ourselves why don't we talk about something real you see that woman the Delaware professor who was talking about that kid that got killed in North Korea the kid who stole the propaganda poll I know about the kid I haven't seen the professor talking oh man well she just got fired today oh yeah which is nice it's a good sign yeah but what would she had said is essentially he had it coming and that she's tired of rich and blameless rich clueless white people who come to her class and then she just goes on these this series of straw man's who do coke and have no problem raping a girl at a frat party whoa whoa yeah where'd that come from this guy just got beaten to death in Korea yeah and I mean he shouldn't rape girls from he didn't rape anybody did coke like this fucking bitch well she's apparently you know racist I mean you can be that and that's entire that's one of the wonderful things about the social justice warrior movement is that they've made it so it's impossible to be raped racist towards white people they believe it yeah this is a real belief oh yeah then if you are a white person your personal privilege and racism is something that a personal privilege does to a person in a compromised group so you know is pretty funny about it is they they by saying it's power plus prejudice they make it they say right it's institutional and thank you but that means you're taking away the word for interpersonal racism so if like an Asian guy goes up to a black guy and says hey n-word that can't be racism because he doesn't have institutional power and there is no word for racism between individuals now you've redefined it to be institutional so what is the word for interpersonal yes I thought old Chris Rock bit about for every black dude thinks he's tough as in Native Americans as a more marginalized group it's just it is one of those things where it's like people are seeking problems and they're also seeking to clearly identify themselves as being from a more compromised group politics of victims yeah I'm the victim here give me some special treatment aside dude I don't want to be a victim you feel about trans racialism I think there's no logical argument it can identify as an Eskimo as far as they're concerned you can they there was a big hoo-ha R in academia recently because someone published a paper come in the name of the person published papers saying we look what's the argument against this if you can identify is another gender why can't you identify is another race same logic just apply to a difference not necessarily because the argument of you identify with another gender could be based on some sort of hormonal issue or some neurotransmitter misfire there could be some something that could be physically that could be if if their arguments were hinging on the idea that that mattered but it's not they say well you can identify as anything wrong because all a social construct so you can do whatever you want with that yeah that's where it gets slippery right where it gets really slippery that's sex and gender or social constructs it's like well clearly that's not true no no actually it is true they are social constructs but the thing is they're not sex isn't a social construct is a logical sex is based on your chromosomes rather your gender is a group of constructed behaviors around that but it's constructed for a good reason men have got a you know clinical superior natural advantage and things like strength and speed over women and women need protection when they are say pregnant you know when they're looking after kids they need society to look after them because they have something that the needs protecting right and so we've got a whole and each society the reason you can tell these are actually social constructs is because society's different I mean it's out of the Arabia the men walk in front the women walk behind him they keep their heads down again oh shut the fuck up that's a social construct that's a gender role you know right but that's a cultural role and that's my point you know for us we don't do that it's not necesarily and it's not like a like a social construct meaning that this is something that occurs all the time even in primates I mean there's a lot of behavior that males exhibit in nature well I'm not saying there's no relation to biology but they house it a social construct well it's a behavior that we have right it's it's not like something that's consistent like you know oh the almond pee through the dicks is not a social construct right right every every man on earth does this but not every woman on earth has to walk behind her man silently ten paces back because she's female right in the West it's actually you know the other way you know the man opens one goes for there's a gender role but it's not the same but it can be changed it is a social construct but that doesn't mean that there isn't a gender role there is always a gender role it's always informed by biology because men and women are fundamentally different and they always will be well that's where people get slippery with you right that's what they want they like in that way they like it that way what is that who's the one feminist there's one really nutty young lady who was saying that even physical strength is just because men are encouraged to do physical things are you referring to a woman is that her did she she's definitely said that did she say that yes I know she's loony but did she go that far there is a school of feminist thought that thinks this the the that's a fun one they really believe that the physical strength differences between men and women are just because of the way society treats women men are socialized to do sports I'm thinking come on that can't be real she really thinks that she said it I don't know that she believes I see if you can find that from a video from like 2013 or something she seems quite the opportunist well beyond the trust and verify Galactic Council she was he certainly was which is probably why she was the reasons Jack known as she certainly was which is probably one of the reasons Jack that I'm not verified you say she certainly was she still I don't know whether she's still but I know that she said he was at least a contact for them but there's been a bit of an interesting development with misaki's and if you like hear about it well Pete tell people who she is I don't even even know if I need to but a lot of people don't know do you live in a very insulated world when I asked my mom Wow Quincy yeah the area of course your mum I know okay nice takis in is an Internet feminist who decided after after making a bunch of videos on a YouTube channel in like 2009 through to like 2010 or something 12 she ended up getting a sort of you know favorable reception with the progressive intelligentsia were very feminist very Pro social justice and they liked her patter because it's some pretty stock pretty pretty stock in trade and it's and she was she came crosses being very respectable you know she's well presented she's attractive she's well-spoken she knows her pattern so they promote they you know they made a big deal ever she sounds like a total bigot when she's talking about anything they get yeah so because she'll just say well this is men I mean the whole premise of feminism is the men are oppressing women and if men aren't oppressing women then feminism has no argument and they also have a sort of thing they say to each other where you you have the right to hate your oppressor it's right to do this okay but I don't think there's ever a right to hate even if you want it this is something that she said personal I'm not her personal a she probably has said it personally but this is the the sort of ideological thought I mean if you read their papers if you read their if you were doing that they them thing again okay there's we are talking about like a specific sphere of academic feminists in her case sex negative six negative vacation titties sex negative yeah they don't like sexy women and the male gaze oppressing women raft that was part of the big issue right it was like synthesis of Lara Croft terrible terrible oppression I don't know how women can get over it but I need suck he's in stepped up and say you know it's wrong to look at these tits and everyone was like that she's wearing a really tight top for a reason and she's not real yeah but yes so basically any sarkeesian comes from a school of sex negative feminism and she decided that she would take advantage of all this now in 2010 there was a video I think was 2010 the video is recording black and white of a hurry University giving speech where she says I'm not a gamer I had to learn a lot about gaming to get into all this and then come 2012 I mean that but that video wasn't released until after she did her tropes vs. women in gaming Kickstarter 2012 May 2012 she starts this Kickstarter and when I was in within the first few days she starts posting updates on that I'm being harassed and said well yeah people generally react negatively to phenomenal bigots on the internet they don't like it people don't like it I mean like when you say men are oppressing women and everything she says is a arian of men are oppressing women you know the male gaze is highly oppressive to women toxic masculinity is highly oppressing women okay when when can men legitimately look at women Anita no answer what is what is non toxic masculinity there's no such thing so what you're saying is masculinity and men checking out chicks is just bad and you hate it and the men are all bad for doing this and they're oppressing the one when they're doing this well that's why I said it seems like she's a bit of a botanist she's got an angle and she realizes that there's a lot of attention that goes towards that angle and she runs with it I mean if I turn around and sell women a bunch of manipulative slags who will take your money and run they'll be like you're a fucking massage but I got to stop you there because I don't think she's ever said all men I don't think she said that she just uses the tournament I don't think she does I mean I really don't think she says inside she had that guy is her fucking head guy rights for doing now he's nothing basically this this terrible thing but I want to set the record straight a few things because this this is something that really annoys me so I went to VidCon recently and VidCon yeah what is that YouTube convention in Anaheim sounds like a good time it was a really good time for me it wasn't for them there their panels look like a bloody Death March when they spotted us sing in the car their life faces why they get upset at you yeah just cause we've sat there listening to what they'd say in fact dude I'm insulated Oh so any sarkeesian she spots me sitting in the audience and then she starts freaking out freaking out yeah she starts she starts saying things like there's a constant harasser of mine calling me you know she called me a shithead and she called me a garbage human a garbage human I did nothing to her I didn't say what I just sat in the audience while she's there cussing me out on the stage I mean this now so she's on the stage with the microphone yeah calling you a shithead and the garbage human and this was because you've made videos about her as though this is because I've made videos debunking her points like and she's under the impression that all of my videos are about her and I actually on the ride over I got people to like counter up for me I've made around thirty videos about years referring to and that's a lot no no it sounds no he did it sounds like a lot but that's less than four percent of the videos I've made I've made 780 videos I work hard I'm sure you do but that's still 30 videos I don't care if you've made a hundred million videos you still make thirty videos you know maybe it's a large number compared to Anita who hardly does any bloody work but that's that's another interesting point but what's what's interesting about it is if someone puts something out there you know you're gonna get expect that someone is gonna come along especially a guy like you that is very opinionated and if someone has very different opinions in yours you were going to have a contrary point of course that's definitely not harassing if they don't what can't be position is that's terrifying yeah so howhow are you harassing like what what was it that's the thing the worst thing you've ever said about her that she's wrong yeah well yeah I mean she's it shit you will never find someone who says she's a she's a good critic she's a terrible critic and she always has been she's always been but it's always been rightly pointed out to her that she's cherry picked every time no one stands by her work she's become like a symbol of feminism because of all the harassment she's received now that is a part of the problem right victim culture it's a very strange absolutely you don't get any props unless someone's sending you horrible messages and then because a lot of people's been caught doing it to themselves which is like the black lives matter activist someone oh yeah so basically she's her work sucks it's it's just bad work I mean nobody in the video game industry would turn around so you know what that's great criticism need to only only like the progressive press what black lives matter it was ages ago protests they basically have run around into the university's computer system logged into a fake Twitter account on something senator sells a bomb threat and the police tracked it data they're like we have the video camera so we're so funny what their need to be a victim well it's validating them yeah it really does when you don't have an argument you need to be a victim well does she expect that well somehow I know that she's going to be able to put these points out and not have anybody dispute these points well I'm guessing and she always she always conflates all criticism with harassment she's never addressed the critic and the first time she addresses a critic it's me and she's calling me names very good look she said she says that I'm responsible for all of the harassment now oh well at least not hers that's not her fault piñon and someone disputes it that person who disputes is responsible for all the harassment yeah well basically I've always I've always said from right from the get-go don't ever contact them don't ever contact them because for a start I mean it they don't want to listen she's not interested in hearing your fucking opinion so they bother she's got nothing but contempt for you but secondly don't send a harassment because a it's immoral and B she's got the victim card that gives her money when when you go when you send her a message saying hey neither I think you're a bitch she goes chi-ching you know and then she runs off to the next interview well that she gets paid I mean some of her speeches at university she's been paid 20 grand a speech just learn I'm not joking right and it's just and for her to go the Internet's being mean to me well maybe if you weren't being a bigger online they wouldn't be maybe if you actually did some solid work and didn't say video games are making everyone sexist which they're obviously not this wouldn't be happening to you but the thing that pisses me off most about the accusations towards me of harassment apart from the fact that I've never her ass her and if there was any evidence I'd harassed her it'd be all over the internet right now you know I mean it would mean nothing but Twitter chorus because they're trying to paint me as a harasser when I'm actually just a critic of hers and I've always been completely against it but what really annoys me is that her Kickstarter if you look at it now if you go to it you can pull it up now and you can see tropes vs. women and like you know she's got a spill and then all the terrible messages the harassment the harassment that was in May 2012 I didn't make a video on YouTube until July 2013 this has been happening to her her whole career is nothing to do with me instead with her it's because she's a dick and everyone can see it Gaga pussy yeah I'm calling her a dick you're a dick Anita that's harassment do you want to know something I've spoken to a lot of interesting people recently since I've been here yeah lots of people who know you personally Anita and they say everyone you because you're a dick oh this is again mean she put up about me today another one well yeah it's calling me a harasser call me all this stuff it's like no you're a dick Anita yes being it did you find a video of her saying that there's no biological difference between the sexes and that strain he'll be buried in the middle I really think that it was her now that I'm thinking about maybe she took it down something I remember seeing it I wish someone on the internet will be able to tweet her ass or something so hilarious it's so contrary to biology just an actual science everything she says is contrary to reality I mean she'll sit there and she'll pick out like like the game hitman in her video she said something like you're incentivized to kill the woman and then they'll stuff a body in a trunk and the footage she's using what she didn't take herself obviously and didn't credit whoever took it in the footage she's using you see like the guy go up and kill the girl you see them lose points like no that's a disincentive ization you know that right they're not incentivizing you the sanger penalizing you for this an eater ug I mean I thought my very first video was to an eater as well you know you very first night in like July 2013 and I started off because of her yeah I were inspired what kind of but I there was a lot of things that kind of you know they were going on I was like you know I I feel the need to say something just but I said apart from the quality being terrible I'm bewildered at her look I own listen to Italy update and I was just like wow I had no idea what was going on and I was just like looking Issa I think you're just wrong on this I think you I don't think you understand like that there is a lot to this that you've left out I should've said cherry-picked but you know and that's that's something that's dr. whole career cuz that's all she's ever done her Chris isms terrible and everyone knows it nobody likes her because she's a divisive bitch and all she does is play the victim she's got nothing she has nothing let's not talking about her specifically we're kind of beat her down here but this is it's hard to think of anything genuinely good about it let's not talk about her I'm what I'm saying is about these ideas instead of concentrating on her as a person what's the point had been debunked a million times all over the Internet by every mother at this point I don't like well what I want to get to what's interesting to me is like what about houses them what causes these people to group up into these weird sort of echo chambers they start reiterating things that don't really work or make sense like there's no biological difference between men and women especially when it comes to strength there's and then the the tropes about video games and also like here's the other thing like when that gamergate thing happened yeah it was it was really fascinating to me that everybody wanted to absolutely lump people in one or two categories and the two categories of people that are appalled to it appalled by it and that think that you know sexism is abhorrent and all the stuff is terrible and then the other people who supposedly if you if you wanted some sexy images and video games you had to be a piece of shit oh yeah like sex negative feminism yeah but that it got into this weird category where people like hey we don't want you meddling with with art and whether it's a frank visit of censoring it yeah I mean look if you look at some of roseto stuff with the girls the bikinis and so were not familiar but I mean how famous fantasy artists oh well we sort of like talked about like the 80s art yes beautifully painted like these oil barbarians it's a it's a celebration of the human physique of it yeah yes it's all Robert E Howard's yeah on Conan and Frazetta yeah was like the most famous of the yeah it was but it's very cartoonish depictions of women yeah you know like with giant tits and Brian blood all over the place and yeah it's it's it's it doesn't make you hate women that's what's gross like just like looking at Fabio on the cover of a romance novel doesn't mean you hate men Yeah right in fact it seems you're kind of lionizing look this is this is the perfect depiction of what the artist wanted seed like a man look like in a huge rippling hero carrying the maiden or whatever but it becomes this weird thing when it's a man people don't have a problem with it like no one says that it demonizes the male figure and that you know that you have set these unnatural standards so you fucked with the self-esteem of all these young men but you absolutely have in the same way you do with women like body shaming or you know having ridiculous standards for bodies for females that works with men too it's the same thing yeah they don't care because feminists dichotomized the world as women being oppressed and men the oppressors and it's okay to hate your oppressor that's that's the that's the root of all feminist thought look that's why I want to talk about this in terms of the ideas because I think it's kind of the same thing as the right versus the left and I think it's all like a symptom of human psychology right the right the right versus the left is tribalism it is tribalism but so it's female versus male it's it's these when you look at this blind allegiance towards anyone with a vagina it's very similar to someone who has blind allegiance to his anyone who's in a red state yeah true but the people in the red state do they say that the blue states were oppressing them oh yeah I'll do they for sure oh yeah the Obama he's a communist he came from Kenya he wants to ruin America he wants to kill it from the inside I mean that was the big narrative for it is it's not them saying he's holding them down well there was always like a thing that he was holding them down with the economy or that he was holding them down with Obama can he was ruining so many different factors in America he hates America it doesn't sound exactly the same to me because the the feminists are essentially what is called neo-marxists and they take the sort of Marxist dichotomy of the economy with the bourgeoisie oppressing the proletariat through their mere existence in their wealth and apply it to men being the bourgeoisie and women being the proletariat right which is highly ironic given the evidently privileged status in society women hold well that's when it got weird when everybody kept repeating that fuckin wage gap thing that was one of the most frustrating talking points even Obama ya the goddamn president the United States on TV reiterating something that he knows is not true yeah that was very frustrating yeah because I just I feel like human beings are inclined very naturally to form a group to stay tribal and then I think it works with I think that is a part of what's happening whether it's neo Marxism that's collect connected to it or what there's something that's happening with feminism versus masculine people yeah you know or an enemy but there's no like masculinist so you have to say masculine no there's but that's silly though yeah that's funny yeah there's a parody of feminism it's not what would you have men anism that sounds dumb doesn't it and they're like yeah well then that's how feminism sounds to us what's the most amazing thing that it's taken so long for male feminists to die off like that's finally like rotting away after a few of them have been outed as being creeps I was gonna say that it's not funny I mean thank the baby Jesus they got caught because lamb look man there's nothing wrong with being male and just because you're a human with a dick doesn't mean you're a bad person yeah but they think that something wrong bit male well you know we'll only do because they want to fuck those girls the other way to fuck well I mean that's probably the roots of it but it's not a percent about me you see male feminists yes they're gonna win any fights no they're gonna do they even need to shave you know they're gonna be they're gonna be nice they have receding hairlines of fedoras and they're like m'lady all over the place Jordan abuse is that the best you said they're sneaky no they are definitely not but if they're afraid they're afraid of like men like you you know they're never but they don't have to do that compete with themselves that's what they don't see that they got fucked by genetics um a lot and got fucked by genetics and so they're taking the only evolutionary strategy they've got you can hardly blame them but they just get to the lab and figure out CRISPR yeah we're at work on read wery engineering yourself to look like Thor seriously if you're a male feminist just shut up stop talking about feminism on the Internet look at yourself god I get on the gym and in a couple of years time you'll be a bit bigger if you're alive for a while anyway 80% you're fucked just keep eating sprouts I've got I've got a friend he's quite short guy do you know he did he did martial arts is a nippy little guy and he's nippy ya know they can get around he can get around he's an amazing there we go like a boulder it's not climbing he's amazing at it you would not believe how unbelief end is so attractive I believe you and he's so self-confident she's a I should host a seminar I mean this is how I did it it's just self-improvement you work yourself and then things work out you know I mean I absolutely think that that's a good thing yeah absolutely but I understand the motivation wipe someone becomes a male feminist because the word allies one of my favorite how I I just a lie I just love that they are now synonymous with creepy harasser well you kind of knew it all from the beginning that that was what it was going on everybody knew it like especially heterosexual men you're like I know what you're doing you fucking weasel you know you're putting women above all else one guy I've read his Twitter profile and he was talking about he goes Oh in his Twitter post rather he said I'm going to stop calling myself a feminist until feminists decide that I'm doing feminism right I'll make women respect you but the fact that he put it out on Twitter like you you put that out like this is just like this giant white flag yeah it's oh yeah that's the thing you know you know people in general women being people respect boundaries there's people who will enforce their own boundaries this guy's literally said hey I have no boundaries you tell me what to do I'll be your slave no one's gonna respect that you know I'll be a willing servant nice douchebag you know you have to say I'm gonna stop saying I'm a FEMINIST until feminists tell me I'm doing feminism right there's a reason that they call them Kooks it's a good word it is that's a word I didn't know what it meant I thought it always meant like a cock hold like a porn film I think it kind of did originally but now it's just kind of means somebody wants to end up themselves yeah and that's really good useful well it's also some it's not just someone who won't stand up for themselves someone who whose pandering well yeah like you're pandering to laughter pant you're trying to paint yourself out if you sell myself out yeah hoping that the person you're selling yourself out to treat you leniently see so instead of talking about individuals what I'm what I'm really fascinated about is the psychology behind what's going on now in this culture of free expression yeah the fact that a guy like you can not say anything wrong with you but I mean very much was just a gentleman from England who doesn't have a connection to the media can just by virtue of your ability to communicate and put out some YouTube videos and have some really good points you can have this massive massive following this is an and the these ideas that people are spreading back and forth even the weird ones like the cactus tan the Frog it's just a joke but it's but it's interesting to me it's interesting to see what happened like like what what I feel like is like Fox News and CNN and even major networks when especially all the ones that are trying to portray narratives all the ones that are talking about the way life is the inner they seem to me to be like these these huddled up executives at the top of like a giant pile of crocodiles snapping at them it's like they have completely lost control over what people talk about they're on a spire of rock and it's what the oceans slowly eroding it's nothing there there was no water there was no crocodiles yeah the only information that got a yeah I mean that was the only information got out was through mass media mass media was controlled by corporations and we felt like for the longest time that was the only way and they still operate like that's the only way it's really quite fascinating narrative hegemony social media has demolished them and we're not going back no this is not going it's not going back I mean I think the only companies that truly understand that or internet-based companies that are trying to manage it like whether it's YouTube or Google or even Netflix they understand it right now they're trying to manage it in some weird ways though like I did I'm really bummed out about Netflix thumbs up versus thumbs down like what you know what you should have you should have a one hundred percent thing so give them one to a hundred the more more range you give someone the better but up and down it's just fucking silly I mean if I were going to review things I would do it recommend it not recommended and yeah quite subjective to my personal taste it would be obviously look if you've been follow me for a while you know what I like and I'd give my reasons and I try and explain it as accurately and concisely and as objectively as I could so the the the the largest sweep of people watching the video could understand why I felt the way I did and so the inverted scale would I recommend it yeah and you know your mileage may vary or yeah you've got to watch this or something like that you know right but I hate the star system it's like well I mean you know it's not it makes it sound objective when it's not really you know sometimes its objective you know I mean it can be I mean it's not perfect though I agree with you yeah you again with a lot of this whole stuff it's about aesthetics and taste so for sure I mean I loved the movie hardcore Henry I mean I I liked and I realized I irrationally love this but that was the single person yeah the first person yeah yeah there was a lot about it I never saw that oh you'll love it I'm sure like it looks like it's crazy but it's it's not for everyone it's for its for the sort of guy who's got a lizard brand new like smilin lizard brain that's what you think about me no you an MMA fighter fighter kickbox I did Taekwondo and there was no MMA when oh okay did you enjoy finding other people um that's a very complicated question obviously I know did you enjoy it for many years so I know I mean it's complicated in that I did it was important for me but I don't necessarily know if I enjoyed I definitely enjoyed winning but it is it was such a claim it was a task you know you'll like it when you get when you get past the sort of I may be the beginning of it is more shaking the rest of it but when you get past the initial sort of this is weird to look at your it's fast pace it's action-packed and it definitely taps into that sort of lizard brain whether it's the male desire to fight you know you you knew this guy at the end of the film that he's literally in like a fist brawl with like 30 other dudes and it's it's the most insane it's you know it's all coming out and it's just Bam Bam Bam is get get stoned and watching get drunk or watching this it's just the best thing if you're into that sort thing but if you're not into that you won't like it at all into that like I like John wick you know like John women too how about that I've never good but you know it's it's for a certain kind of person in a certain kind mood but when it hits right it's I mean I it was the first film in a long long time that I was just sat in the Sun with just angel with a smile on my face I was just enjoying this this was great fun you know but I I appreciate that was just like tapping into the primordial desire to defeat your enemies I just thought it was interesting they shot it like a video game like quake first-person shooter and stuff yeah so this VidCon thing that you went to would who puts this together Hank and John Green and who are they the vlogbrothers they're famous youtubers and I find it very interesting look when Anita was calling me a shithead and garbage human that's a direct violation of that code of conduct and did they do anything about it no no because she's a feminist because she's she's one Xion oh because she gets special because she's any Stuckey's why did she get special treatment because at this point she's basically become the avatar feminism if she fails real though I swear to god didn't I mean is she respected in that world no no everyone hates her why do they still proper up because she's Anita sarkeesian she doesn't make any sense I mean well there's a mythos that's built up around her and it word yes it's and they've all propped her on they've all propped her up they've all said good things about her they've all defended her and if it turns out that she is in fact an abuser which she did according to the VidCon code of conduct which what is the code of conduct oh I can't remember the verbatim but I read on a video it's one of my last videos it was just a quick message to Hank and John Green and I know that thousands of people email them saying hey look she did violate your code of conduct from a position of institutional privilege at VidCon she was on the panel I didn't have a microphone she had a microphone she's calling me names she's accusing me of things aren't true she and she was doing that while you were in the audience directly looking me in the eye and it was like okay that's fine but that's not right and they've done nothing they have done nothing they've said not to talk and they heard it and then afterwards all I got from her fans and I mean like you know hundreds and hundreds of messages and I just retweeted them all night with exactly the same language she uses when she's displaying on look at the nasty messages I'm guessing of people calling the ate garbage human which is what she called me and so she has done absolutely nothing different and so I said right Hank and John she's violated your code of conduct her fans she's incited a cyber mob of her asses exactly as she claims I do but she has actually done this then on the Saturday she was due to be on a panel about cyber harassment see but it can't be harassment when she's a woman and you're a man because you are the oppressor so it's the same thing as racism like a black person being raised against a white person yes impossible but the only reason to do this then to not to take no action right is if you are highly ideological and interesting so you feel like they're Heidi I highly idealized oh yeah incredibly biased but why are they if they're youtube stars I mean aren't they like don't they understand yes if they're very programs very progress but you're fairly progressive too now I'm a liberal what is the difference between a liberal a little rules courses opportunity a progressive ones cause you're welcome quality of outcomes yeah complete nice and day every day what the problem with liberals and possessive Wow this is by definition is that the most thought progressive means that you support gay rights you support the outcome of games with non gays they want gays have the same rights I'm in the room I won that tune this is what was gonna say there's a lot of open overlapping magisteria when it comes to these things where he's not that great word Magisterium and i've never heard that before really use the areas of interest things that they want to have amazing areas so much better than areas of interest though write that down Jamie so yeah basically you know liberal that there's no real argument against gay rights from a liberal perspective because liberals want universal rights of course if some people can get married gay should be able to get married so what's the argument are the unchristian gift fucked I'm an atheist non-argument right where's the progressives they want it because someone else has it someone else has this therefore they want this because they want and then by whose definition by theirs are yours you're defining them that's what they define as you know no one's saying all this I mean like affirmative action is the example of this okay a liberal would never ask for affirmative action because in the liberal worldview people should be free to pursue their own goals now I mean the you know liberals are usually very anti-racist that's not that's not a category on which you would judge something same at sex you know I would never turn around say right okay well you know your CDs really cared I mean you know you clean know you're doing but you've got some tips so get out you know that would be ridiculous you know what that's not a not a reason to do that but the progressive will do that if you're a man the progressive will say well I'm sorry we've got you know we want equality well and this this is what we define equality different yes I call it equality of opportunity they call it quality Malcolm because they'll turn on and say well you know what we've already got like 70 percent men so I mean your CV might be great but you got a dick so we can't take you we're gonna take that unqualified woman instead because we need to get to parity because they want a quality of outcome there were 50 ten men fifty Cent women I have a friend who was a bigwig at a big internet company and they had to deal with that shit all the time where they would have men who were far more qualified who they were getting pressured to push out yeah to make room for my leak that were specifically looking for a qualified black woman they were like going out of their way because they wanted to give out the appearance of diversity exactly but that's because they're all so scared of criticism right so they're scared of being attacked by the Esav activists and by race pimps there's there are a lot of raised pimps which is like spin class yeah it's not mine it's they used it for Jesse Jackson back in the day that's a good time and he's been outed as a raised pimp I mean they don't talk to people's like yeah famously come to organizations and said I'm going to give you diversity courses and you're gonna pay me a certain amount of money or we're gonna produce particular religion isn't it and their leave priesthood well it's people who like done criticized and they don't want it to hurt their business and you get fun especially if you're dealing with an internet business internet-based businesses you know like like like Google for example Apple classically liberal right you would say progress if they're the know yeah that's all very living in England liberal actually means a liberal in the United States lipomas progressive well I hate all these fuck yeah it's a nightmare it's taken me a long time to really be able to hammer out the you know the ins and outs ideologically of it and so I can explain it quite efficiently now because it's difficult well it's really dark about something like progressive thinking not progressive thinking but rather affirmative action is that you're going to create a certain amount of races by putting someone who's unqualified in a position just because of their color it's racist you're being discriminatory on the basis of race yeah white person yeah that's racism by our racist but you go to the deep root of it and you got to realize well there's some people that just they're they're given a terrible hand of cards we've got to be able to figure out how to fix that hand of cards how to make it a little bit more balanced than our in our cities how to make how do you do that that's a good question one way to do but that's what's really crazy worn in these crime ridden communities and they get no assistance whatsoever from the the very government that's sending billions of dollars overseas to assist these other come against helping them absolutely not against her I mean like the you know I'm not saying you know you go hang okay no but anything you do has to start with them saying I want to change sure and if they can't start that if that's not damaged they're gonna start with then you can do nothing for them well they're happy where they are how they are right now then you can't change anything all you'll do is throw good money after bad and they'll know it I mean like think about people who win the lottery do they are they happy some of them mostly they are in their lives doesn't that's what they say I feel like the people who write those articles are always sad they didn't R in lotteries maybe a lot of dudes out there kissing awesome that are just straight ballin having a great time given has no value it's anything you want I don't know if that's always true maybe if it's like a lot of money will you maybe you just gotta ease into it maybe it's one of those things if you win a hundred billion dollars and you just like pretend you only won a hundred grand spend that but it's low don't worry I'm not saying we don't have a Camaro you know you've got to help these people but they have you have to begin from a position where they say you know what look I won't help because if there's something going I don't want to change well then they're not gonna change well I understand that but I mean a lot of them don't even understand how they would go about changing and they're constantly surrounded and reinforced by all these people around them that are in jail or committing on black youtubers occasionally and a lot of maleic you know they do blame a lot of stuff on the white man they say the white man must keep you down and stuff like that I see but that's it's not no okay listen if this was a white guy and he was like the black man hold me down you better shut up shut up you wouldn't accept it and if you're gonna accept that from them that's you being a racist treat them like you would treat white people if this was white people sitting around going I'm not gonna do anything I'm gonna join a gang I think what you know black man's all the Jews are trying to hold me down something yeah you let me finish I wasn't saying that white people are in fact holding black people down I was saying that idea of the white man like they have this man we got to hold the black peoples I apologize that's all right it's a standard argument I don't I don't think there's a coalition of white bones no no I mean yeah it's a sad thought perception I think that there absolutely was certain times I mean there's absolutely neighborhoods a black people were not allowed to buy real estate there's absolutely systemic races and there was still a lot of racists around you know I'm not I'm not saying it's not just a fact that's the thing right I'm not saying it's not justified and that's I think that I think that's where like the argument goes off the rails cuz they go what do you mean all the stuff happened yeah has happened and there are racists but you don't have to let that hold you back no you definitely don't that yeah I think they need examples you know I think more examples and more role models in that direction I've actually I've seen I can't move the guys name I remember seeing this this black doctor doing a speaking tour at was he a real doctor or chiropractor well the difference is that chiropractors aren't really doctors really they don't go to medical school yeah enough fucking crazy I didn't know about that dude they kill people he died from that need I know some there was some recent thing that red van sent me about some Playboy Playmate who died because the doctor the chiropractor adjusted her neck and she fucking died people die every year they do it to babies man they had just babies there's people that do like chiropractic adjustments on babies their bones aren't even fully formed their bones are soft these assholes are manipulating them I'm really glad well two and a half year old son I mean nothing wrong ladyboy model Katy Mays death caused by chiropractor autopsy finds scroll up so I could read that fucking this nonsense I thought they were doctors I thought when a doctor tell them yeah we say doctor Mike I thought it was a doctor who died you went to medical school and learned how to be a chiropractor no I can't believe you're allowed to do that doctor settle down ready for this the guy who invented it was a magnetic healer okay the guy invented Kyra there's all this like subluxation as all these words they use did he have clearance totally yes entirely fake not only that but the guy who invented it very possibly was murdered by his son that's a suspicion his son ran him over for sure and they think he might have done it on purpose and then his son ran him over with a car and took over the business and his son was totally Shady piece of shit a fraud isn't fun well you could have been acts in a tragic accident you loved dad but the allegation is that he ran over his dad's to take over the family business it is not real at all it is not a real science there's no science to support it there's no men it's but the crazy thing is it's so accepted that insurance pays for this shit she had some clotting and went to the hospital where they tried to do some procedures but she passed away so this guy adjusting her her neck and they tore her vertebral her vertebral artery did locals know man when you're adjusting you you gotta understand there's bones in there now there's violent jutting if you're a tender person or if you have some sort of vulnerability yeah model they tore her fucking article or artery rather than article and subsequently cut off blood flow to her brain her death was ruled accidental what in the fuck I mean can we get these people stopped somehow yourself a doctor This Is It this is what confuses his shit Edmund all these guys that have called themselves doctor when I talked to them I thought they were an actual fucking doctor like I went to a place like this is dr. Pete dr. Pete's gonna work on you dr. Pete's not a fucking doctor mm-hmm it's a hundred percent fake what does the article pull up that article like chiropractors are bullshit because want to give that lady props she's gonna come on my podcast oh she's a she calls herself the science base that the science babe I I don't know no she is this I babe she sounds awesome yes first signs I'm very excited they're very excited to have her on the site the article was it was actually synchronicity because it was a conversation that I was having with Steve Rinella there's a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago when he was talking about his brothers get some issue with atrophy and of his arm he's been going to a chiropractor and I said I think chiropractors are bullshit and so after the podcast I smoked a joint I was thinking about it was I being too hard on the chiropractor's I'm being a dick so then I started researching chiropractors yeah and I found all this crazy shit about the fucking magnetic healers and all this stuff here's the article chiropractors are bullshit you shouldn't trust them with your spine or any other part of your body and what is her name that she wrote this so we can give her some honey events that we go D at Tremont in Tremont it's deal ' capital a low low level D what is this bullshit non-american spelling possibly Canadian yeah québécois low lowercase D ' large capital I'm in favor of banning Commission's won't I like French people no no the language the food you know the French but we could language sounds like this there's one acceptable form of bigger training limits against the French so fuck French oh really you're allowed to yeah how come you can do that because we lost loans reducible oh so it's an England thing we spend 100 years kicking the shit out of French and then God intervened just say yeah Frances let me finish this talk about the basically like I know they're probably gonna be a lot of black people this other gang war holy shit my whole life I've been like I know that the white man's keeping me down and stuff like this but this is this this isn't all coming from me that's the thing I'm not the fucking expert here this is coming I wish I could remember this guy's name there's like a couple years ago that I watch this guy doing the speaking tour and he was on a black doctor but he's like a PhD in Business Studies or something it wasn't like you know he was no chiropractor but he I was I was I was absolutely loving his speech to like a bunch kids in school because he was just saying look if you drop out you won't get to where you want to go I mean you've got a look at just look at sensibly you still get it through in like an Aristotelian lens you are what you do okay what do you want where do you want to end up you will end up as a scientist okay well if you drop out of school that's that goal off the table you can't scientist okay that's cool so no matter how much you hate school you've got a fucking stick it out if you want to get if you want to get to a scientist so you plot it on your okay so I've got to get to college again you know University get PhD then I've got to make sure that I've you know done all the right courses to get to the right field you've got to plot this out and you if you drop out any point well there we go that's you screwed your life plan there so you're gonna have to figure out something and I know because I did exactly the same thing there's just no getting around it no one come no one can give that to you you've got to give it to yourself that's what empowerment is if you want to be empowered you've just gotta go you know what let's let's just assume the white man hates you let's just assume he does every white man just assume we're all fucking racist why would you assume that this is worst case time let's think that worst case scenario every one person's racist they won't hold you back but legally they can't so you might be thinking where I came there's gonna be some bigotry so what you can do you're gonna work harder that's the only way you can do if you get what if you want to get to where you're gonna go you've gotta live in a paranoid world I'm not just you should actually do that let's bring it up because that's the worst case scenario for them that's what the white man is try to hold me back okay let's say yes premise right okay but does he actually you know he's not gonna mean they do actually have affirmative action for your University and stuff so even if we still assume that this is somehow oh him being a racist and hating black people you can still go I can still take advantage of that if what I need is these grades and these subjects go and get those grades in those subjects in fact you missing off Christ I'm actually good for the grade up just in case the white man tries to screw me even harder you know I'm gonna work even harder you think well Christ that means gotta work hard yeah you gotta work out I love the term the white man as if they're you all right man the white man they're not unified in anything other than keeping black people did yeah yeah like there's a brother down because you know I mean why except when he gets to the presidency and dispute over everything yeah like everything from top to bottom hmm didn't the new center be the new thing that keeps getting the woke centrists the centrists the new center the extremes of cancer and we should yeah yeah well that's the center sounds ridiculous - it all sounds ridiculous I know but ask yourself would you run through the bench peril of Richard Spencer bench bureau exactly we'd rather talk to me or Anita sarkeesian well maybe not knees I'd like to talk to her okay she's a bad example roomie or someone who says that you know all white people are probably oppressing all black people I always want to talk to someone who like has these extreme beliefs like I believe she does people go on I want to know like what goes on in her head I want to know why she thinks that there's something wrong with being mailed to the point where like every male has toxic I mean I'm talking up for political candidates you know would you rather would you rather have two people who are relatively moderate relatively close to the center oh you're talking my political yeah sorry oh yeah sure dispose how'd you get there because that's the the whole the center is the political spin oh is it I see I feel like it's an ideology more than is live your life more than how you vote yes it's not like an ideology in and of itself and you're like center left center right they've got similar but different ideological traditions and I mean it's like it's basically the problem is when you say it's someone else's fault that's the worst thing you can do what are you disempowering yourself except when it clearly is someone else's sometimes it is yeah sometimes to do most time is not her own fault yeah like the victim mentality that you were talking about we're talking about like hardcore feminists that are constantly laying man for things but the problem is like what is it like being a chick it's probably fucking terrible it's probably enough when the term debt let me finish fuck what I'm saying is when women are constantly worried about being victims right like women are worried yeah yeah I've talked to some the talked about like driving home or skip they get nervous when they're walking to certain areas at night in a way that a man doesn't this interesting cuz that's the same opinion the Saudi Arabians half of the West you've given me the feminist narrative that women are constantly afraid of man no I think a lot of women are though I'm not but like you know I mean you know when you say right the other one majority of women are afraid of men that's a feminist narrative that's also the the Wahhabi narrative from Saudi Arabia and that's why they have to go well that means I women aren't allowed out they go wear burkas they can't they've got to reflect we become invisible so men aren't gonna predict well they have a very ancient culture and in that culture which we didn't ridiculously different what do you mean they don't well huh BISM arrived in the 18th century with Abdul Wahab let's see 1700 that's a pretty ancient to an American yeah not to anyone I'm American man okay but I'm not it's nature and culture it's not my point it's old as fuck my point is okay the point its 1776 1781 it's like four years before seven seven six no I'm saying existed it's the same some people here a bunch of fucking campers hundreds of years before people that walk the Appalachian Trail yeah absolutely but this is way Neela and way more cancerous as well okay there's a lot of great stuff at the point being there is a very different classification of women versus men in in Mohave ism right it's the same theory behind it they say exactly the same woods what do you mean yeah but some women are I mean in certain circumstances not walk through a group of women and worried about being raped a man does not walk through the streets at night and worry some woman's gonna come out of the darkness and grab his ass so but a woman doesn't walk into a course proceeding and think I'm gonna lose everything that's true that's true unless you're Rosanna and you're dating Tom Arnold yeah whoops she's still paying that except from the proves the rule that 90% of the time the woman I mean no I mean you hear horrific so he told some of the girls you get some horror stories where I mean the man's right those terms I'm immersed in all day but people aren't they listen people that have listened to us a lot of them are not gay myself the sofa stop watching TV or not go online and just be immersed in that world no go outside no y-you don't have to be an opposed to come here to tell you an MRI this thing right this is this is and I say this with the greatest respect from the more venerable generations than mind who are more used to the television people don't watch TV anymore and they won't go back to it yeah I think you're right but we've got the statistics to prove I've done videos we've gone sources in the sense it's only the older generations I mean like in Britain all the TV channels channel 4 was the young hip cool TV channel when I was young the average age of the viewing has 44 once they found out that old dude had been fucking kids for all those years Jimmy Savile Savile you know I think that lost a lot of no that's not the reason it's not the reason the reason it's not Jesus Christ so yeah you guys I've been dealing with some people who are fucking idiots I get it you know I know I've had to be like really really specific there there is a group of people online who know that I'm right and they don't like them right they don't like you right oh no they hate that I'm are we talking about Nina stock using again her family they hate me and I don't give them any more ammunition necessary bad that she's not defending herself or she was never the amber to know she when she when she called me a piece of shit in a garbage human I I had said nothing happen till that point so just yell back I just want to talk and she was at Oh whatever dude and it's like I came all this way to hear what you had to say and all you could do is insult me that one interaction aside but rehash this I know it's a I've been personally slice it no I mean I think I'm being defamed all across the internet there's that there's a narrative going around the progressive journalists there has already been debunked by an actual journalist called Tim pool and the video evidence of the event that I personally took that I stormed the stage and started screaming abuser they're saying that they'll probably who is saying that journalists and like the actual journalists they pull up of an actual article horrible that said there probably aren't any yet but I bet you tomorrow going on there are articles about me and some of them will say something like I abuse though somehow it's in pause do not understand the irony of we're talking about people labeling themselves as victims and you are labeling yourself as victim you've got a crime that has not occurred no I'm asking about articles that are being written by journalists and videos that are being made but they have not been made yet and then you're saying just watch they're going to be made yeah but that's cuz i've been those Roedean okay do you not see come on you gotta be able to see that well III mean like I'm not like a victim this is something that happened to me right but do you get that oh yeah well that's talking about right here who is saying that you were stormed that you storm the stage you tell me journalists and I say where are these articles and you say just wait I don't watch the moment of the moment we're talking about like rumors you know for example like Tim Poole said that a friend of his I think she's an actress but you know it's it's the same sort of okay that's not LA circles that's someone gossiping doesn't mean that someone actually a journalist wrote an article dorming this yeah how you why do you think they were social media why would it even concentrate on that if it has not occurred I mean isn't this sort of like a black guy complaining about the man holding you back when there is no man I mean it is you're talking about being a victim of a crime that hasn't occurred no but I know what these people are like I've been dealing with them for long enough now I know what those white people are like man I've been dealing with them my whole life yeah but and we actually have a precedent from doing this as well right but they're not doing it right now and you're saying they are they are their own social media right now I mean like you got like journalists like Ian miles Chung who said right so the prevailing narrative among journalists at the moment is that Sargon stone staged and abused Anita sarkeesian when video evidence says the exactly this is something that's posted online so there's no articles but there is a Twitter it's you can tell that it's coming up there going this is how these rumors start and then someone starts reporting it and then suddenly you get a narrative going on victim of this cuz I've got a large enough reach to be able to say let's video is because I think people listening to this who have no idea what the fuck are easy news and don't even know you are they like there's a lot of people listening to this I would like to get to more interesting things hmm okay cuz I think you're an interesting guy thank you I think you were a little wrapped up in this right now okay you know I'll tell you it was but you're a very smart guy your videos are excellent you know and you know so great thank you I can't wait to Russ who's for us your friend yeah he's a huge fan of yours do you like now that you have this gigantic audience do you feel certain amount of responsibility yeah I always have you know intellectual integrity is the most important thing and the great thing about this and the great thing about the way the internet works is that I mean it look at the look at the people who are at the top look at like something like PewDiePie mm-hmm man of outstanding moral character using oh no I'm hanging on them I've spoken to him a few times but yeah I don't need to hang with him to know look what he does he doesn't remembering people don't go around lying about people doesn't you don't you guys want to in carrot II and being like hey Bros you know and being nice to people and being inspiration what happened with him you know okay but let's go over the actual this is by the way this has affected me and it affected a lot of YouTube people who wear their YouTube videos used to have much freer monetization meaning that for people listening say if Sargon puts out a YouTube video you could have ads on that YouTube video and your YouTube's videos get a lot of downloads man I mean it would be very lucrative for you yeah and then with us our YouTube money was cut by more than 60% I think that reason to retain 40% if your income was pretty good as well yeah well do anything controversial anything having to do with anything right-wing is deemed not it's not friendly for advertising anything that has drugs in the title is deemed not friendly for advertising it's like we've literally been able to change the title of things and re-upload them and then the ads the exactly that's awesome just yeah so the same content so what all this came from is PewDiePie who an enormous YouTube presence right it doesn't have like 50 million followers holy shit and he made some videos that what is it the Washington Post cuz I was a Wall Street Journal yeah Wall Street Journal can I tell you about it please do yes please do because you I'm sure I did a bunch of videos on this and it was the funniest thing the world I love the language they use as well what's a scoop a scoop is a news story that other people are not aware of yet okay so you got it first so if if tens of millions of people have seen something and then if I'm a Wall Street Journal and I come along and I find something that tens of millions of people have seen can i rightly call that a scoop well you can definitely call it a news story and you can definitely say that people in the sea that's this goes bable we're talking about before whereas they have a hierarchy of viewership like what what is what is a real network what is a real newspaper what is real journalism like in their mind I'm sure the Wall Street Journal considers themselves to be in the hierarchy Oh versus someone who has hope but they don't have fifty five million downloads they don't I mean there's no way if the journal puts out a video million yeah if they put out a video if they got a vid a million hits on their video that would be a big deal yeah that'd be thrilled if pooty-poo how only a million hits someone in video could be super depressed he is a much bigger entity than them but in their mind like a scoop is them the legitimate media so pointing out something in the illegitimate this new weird video yeah so basically PewDiePie he's a comedian and he makes jokes right but he's a like I said he's a man of good character and he's parents should be thanking PewDiePie for being a person he is because he's talking to their kids and their kids are gonna grow up being decent people because of his influence but the Wall Street Journal Ben Fritz and Roth Winkler and there was another one I remember his name of the moment they decided what the women do is and I don't know who put them up to this obviously but they were gonna watch about six months of his video go through and find any anti-semitic jokes that he made well I mean by definition is a joke so I it's not six months yes it's a SAP to give us video every day I mean they got about another two minutes of footage or something with him making jokes of the expense of the Nazis effectively and they were like wow this guy's promoting anti-semitism read about them and I don't know the actual jokes that he said that they were saying but we're here to it they were saying that he is making light of being a Nazi or pretending to be a Nazi and that this is what's fucked I'm not like he was promoting anti-semite but parodying the Nazis yeah I don't understand trying to explain to people as hot as Hogan's Heroes work that exactly isn't Mel Brooks a bit yeah bit of an old auntie Christ he must be yeah even oh god just yeah I mean springtime for Hitler you could say was somehow or another humanizing and I created a lot of Nazis made the argument that Mel Gibson created Nazis that's how far we've gone over with our Mel Brooks what I said Mel Gibson yeah when someone says Mel Gibson drunk I think of him yelling yeah well he is he's seriously 9/11 conspiracy believer and yeah where's that wrong scene Oh probably lumping them together I think I might be so these videos and one of them was the funniest thing because they were taking like and the you know the the jokes were like you know like and they're like 20 seconds of joke taken out like a 10 minute video you know where he's just it's just like it cut away doing a parent you know skit you know what I'm like you know what one of them was a joke about how the media takes his jokes out of context to try and frame him as something new right and they context and used it and it was just like what is it which is amazing it's incredible it's amazing that they had the balls to do know what they were not only proud of what they did they call it a scoop and then they went to advertisers and said look at this hate speech but how did they get away with doing that how come no one from The Wall Street Journal sat them down and said well listen this is definitely not him saying that you're gonna take something out of context and then doing it is it because if it is and then you took it out of context and did exactly what he's saying you shouldn't do that's kind of crazy it's mental it is mental it's absolutely so they feel like they can get away with it because they're in the hallowed halls of actual media and they're putting this stuff out there GCD define it so you would see what you can roll jokes that pudy pie said they're supposedly the funny thing that is if you look at their numbers they look like the Wall Street Journal if you look at his numbers they look like that and what's so strange he's making hand gestures down for The Wall Street Journal up for pudy pie yeah and what's so strange about it though is that pewdiepie isn't their competition you know all right here we go here we go let's put what some of them great let's see what we got here my name is Peter bath whoa okay so and 27 year old playing video games on YouTube typical Nazis okay 53 million subscribers well 55 now Jesus the biggest star in the site by far you know inside the stories let's get into the latest scoops so it's him this is the I think this is the one recently some of his videos a brief including Nazi messages images of Edith Hitler and explicit anti-semitic so this is the Washington Post version it was fought the Wall Street Journal rather sorry following a request for comment from The Wall Street Journal Disney said the videos are inappropriate and cut ties to pudy pie who ran his business most of millions of dollars of Disney subsidiary maker studios cost PewDiePie millions in a January 11th video mr. Vova below featured two men holding a sign reading death to all Jews after hiring them from a website I like the editing see the the jerk is his reaction to and the fact that you can subscribe to keemstar who's like another big youtuber he's mocking I think they would actually do it I feel personally responsible but just I didn't think they would humor but I think there's something funny about that and that'll fire back at the media for mischaracterizing humanik thing about it again between a joke an actual like fucking deaf - all juice if I made a video saying hey guys PewDiePie here deaf to all juice I want you to say after me deaf to all juice and you know Hitler was right I really opened my eyes to white power and I think it's time that we did something about it that's essentially how they're reporting this as if that's what I was saying or some shit like that it's amazing how popular it is with such a shitty grasp of English these Swedish apologies can camouflage messages that may still be received and celebrated by hate groups the Southern Poverty Law Center says yeah so if the Southern Poverty Law Center condemns you it's becoming a bit of a badger one of these things in the video since removed he posted a video of a man dressed as Jesus Christ I love how they have like since removed is bold and then Jesus Christ is old the Jesus guy act upon God's will don't worry them he stands beside God now he isn't happy wait that's all folks Jesus out and I wasn't the one who made him saying or was it no it wasn't I don't think so he set up a GoFundMe page and his own website so you can take orders from Jesus himself and also can I just point out that isn't hold on stop this is not what I'm looking for where where are the actual videos of him doing the Nazi shit that's it that was it that's a hundred percent that's it is there article that led to all this yeah right but what we're looking at here this is the Wall Street Journal's version of it yeah so this is these are the clips they son this is the actual clips that they're saying are the thing that shows him to be anti-semitic yeah holy shit the they thought it was I thought it was way better name than I thought was just uh yeah we got Madoff Fiverr yeah it's just him prancing around on the internet it's just it's just silly childish jokes and it's obviously I mean how many nurses do you think this made three really stupid doesn't take a lot there was the really bad thing about this though is the fact that they didn't put this on scroll out until they had like taking these clips and dobbed him into Disney and Disney were like Disney obviously news shit there was gonna be a shitstorm about this why do this why would someone but why was go back but why what is in money his politics are not very Allah ticks as well yeah he mocks like an you know he mocks feminism you know smoke social justice he's not he's not he's a liberal he's not progressive that's the difference why would they think that they could just do that though because they've got the power to do that no one can stop you couldn't but they did it cost him millions of dollars I'm sure they did but it's now costing them their reputation I'm Cellini yeah I mean you can't just do that let the Wall Street Journal's they they took a big hit from this I'm sure that unbelievably arrogant well actually in general it's really interesting right there was a author after all of this shit show blue over there was a bunch of polls done of like thirteen to eighteen year olds and it was really fascinating how you had like favorability and what how well known things were and like YouTube was really well known really favorable with kids you know and then you had the Wall Street Journal which was really well-known but really unfavorable with kids how do how the kids know what the Wall Street Journal is because of PewDiePie so now they think of The Wall Street Journal in this way the millions of people that are his fans exactly well that's a big mistake to the exam a guy with a platform like that it's time when they're voters and they're though reading consuming News The Wall Street Journal will continue being that they'll continue to go down Peter Pan still be doing well but what's the what's crazy is I never thought of the Wall Street Journal is that what I thought of the Wall Street Journal as being like informative objective information about business well if you asked me like what is the Wall Street Journal that's how I've always thought of them so to see to see this video looking isn't it well it is disturbing because there's nothing there they make the death to all Jews thing the fact that did he pay those guys to hold up that sign like five dollars to write on a sign so you could go because you know it kisses to be right he's just breaking it's a big Zach exactly if nobody had said anything nothing would come it's in poor taste and if you're representing Disney you can't fuck with that stuff that's all that is understand it's not my point is I'm defending him it's not evidence of a know he's just saying something fucked up because that's he's trying to be shocking yeah he should think that Hitler stuff like holy shit is there was nothing there I'm not so stupid it's just the stupidest thing in the world and it's I mean this is the thing where like extonic like what I love about this is it's a parody of the Nazi flag right of a swastika what is that stuff but okay in there yeah yeah but it's it's yeah okay can't see when yeah when you have to explain any of this to someone it sounds like a stupid thing the Volks is internet you're planting that you would Jima fly I know isn't that great isn't that great supposed to be exact because that's how they come across everyone else it's like guys you this is how it looked to us yeah and you see that thing that somebody put up about a it's you and Milo and a bunch of other people and you've got a red pill yeah and it says get in the car Normie were gonna save civilization someone's gonna do what who the fuck thinks that's really if anyone takes us seriously they're fucking idiot yeah but that's the point isn't it it's about people who can't live for themselves if you can't laugh for yourself then I've mean what's the point well there's also so many layers to this thing you have to be paying attention to it all the time like you to be able to keep up like even I have to ask you questions like wait what's that what's going on here because I'm not paying attention it's it's a complex subject but what thing is the idea of it listen England the Southern Poverty Law Center of course came out condemned kickstand well I like because they're fucking it but it's not real exactly Stan's opposed to is that is that supposed to be all right no no no no of course not it's actually it's an identity for people who don't want an identity because where I'm not an identity right now he's very non-binary it sounds like lateen X kind of yeah well that's like no no that's but that's that's exactly what it's supposed to sound like right when they say I'm a Latina X I'm like let me talk to you about my work blackness let me tell you about my work blackness one of cool things we never say but that's the but that's what it is though because when someone comes to you about the identity aside okay but this isn't a conversation I want to have with you it's not politics as you throw yourself and it's like well I don't have an ethnicity or like like a identity you know I don't play identity politics they play the entity politics caucus town is a parody of identity politics and every identity politician hate it everyone who everyone who gets into bed with identity policy yeah my blackness or latina or Y whiteness or my Jewishness whatever it is okay well I'm at my kick astonished us you know and they're just like well shut that's not real well done you finally got it right I didn't give a shit about your fucking identity you don't give a shit about mine so let's talk about the issues the issues don't like pudy pie so um where is it what how does he stand now like so he lost this Disney deal oh yeah cuz this Wall Street Journal very final but don't how many people were actually aware of the real content like what he actually did but what I'm saying is how many people are aware versus the magazine article oh it's it's about the type of people who are well cuz I wasn't aware of course I knew who he was I heard his name and when I heard the story I had heard a bunch of different accounts I tried to sift between the two and the middle seemed to be that he was doing like typical internet stuff being silly but none of it was really anti-semitic but that's even milder than what I thought it was that's insanely milder especially when you're using the clips of him saying if I was taken out of context yeah it's it's absolutely pathetic but it's obviously the the audience of Wall Street Journal is the elites the intelligence here smarts will reach people people don't have a good interaction with them exactly all the best with no connections but they're not going to live very long because there aren't PewDiePie audience is coming up they're going to be the ones who are essentially taking over the world and PewDiePie is the one who's showing them that look at the things these people are saying they're bad and you know because they're attacking me and you know me I'm not doing anything wrong so you know you can't trust these people they are going to come after you if they can go off to PewDiePie the biggest youtuber in the world then they can go after anyone but it's really dangerous to frame things that way because it's dishonest well and as soon as you do something like that and you make a dishonest representation of this guy of pudy pie immediately every other thing that you print I'm gonna go well suspect guys already made that thing about pudy pie and that was bullshit yeah like you had it to a lot of work to make that yeah like to cherry pick that that hard oh they went through six months of video and got like two minutes of footage is just arias and he does a video every day so it's just like cuz it's getting you saw the quality of the video it's just yeah funded that the Wall Street Journal funded that Madonna that cost a lot of money right well these guys by the hour they're working watch a bunch of YouTube videos maybe millions of people have already watched and then go we look at the scoop we've got and try to find one or two Jewish jokes see if he was Jewish he could have Mel Brooks his way right through that motherfucker I've been fine but unfold to be for PewDiePie he's got white male privilege so he found their thing well you have to recognize your privilege suchan port and check your priveledge at that door it's it's a wonderful way for people to control you original sin to tell you but yes it is it really is these people are creating a new priesthood if you look at the diversity officers I mean like in Britain the BBC is the prime example they've started I mean they actually have job positions where they hire on the basis of race and against people on the basis of race for example I if it was like in front of the camera I could understand you know I mean like I mean I I don't like the we need more black people we need more brown people whatever but I mean I could at least go well I mean like you were saying it it's good to have examples I can't I can except I don't like it but not not because I don't want see brown people because it's discriminatory on the basis of race but I can at least accept it for a good conclusion but for this it's just a research position behind the scenes 18 grand a year you know making nothing but all you're doing is typing into Google and finding things and they're like white people can't apply oh and I have to fund that with my TV license it's crazy that widely you can apply I know no white sand mouths racist and they're wondering why the alt rights are doing so well why so many people just like you know what yeah but the idea that you could say that like your melanin content is going to prohibit you from getting this job I'm sure you paid attention to the Evergreen State College with your ask Oh Bret Weinstein did you listen to Bret when he was on this podcast I'm that time I've been busy he did all this he's a very shockingly progressive man yes he's he's a super liberal essential really Nepalese call you man he's a really nice guy oh yeah he seemed that he seemed good and the poor guys in hiding now yeah he's in hiding he's he like literally had to remove his family from from there and kind of put them in hiding he does the schools essentially almost shut down yeah they took over I mean the thing is chaos and now they're voting to remove funding and turn into a private school good because we can't have tax dollars yeah they told him that he should stay home because they wanted a day of absence where white people were not allowed to go to work and he was said what the fuck are you doing I'm Jewish not only that it's like that's race your race that's the important point well that the woman one of the women who was responsible for it called his wife a racist and that was saying that white what he called she called for it on a Facebook post she called for white women to take this racist white take her rice wait racist white ass out or something like that the thing about this old call her out maybe calling out the thing about all of this is really dangerous because it's something white people go yeah okay but she's calling her white she's calling her racist white yeah damn it just because someone doesn't agree with you on something that's really racist doesn't mean they're a racist no of course not but it's dangerous to do this because I mean if you're gonna use this as a weapon against something that's well this is this is an attack yeah he's refusing to cooperate so they're attacking him what's a control it's without a doubt it's about control this is 100% about people trying to control other people it's political in total it's cool and this is a political attack and if you're going right you don't wanna be a racist II at some point the white people who's gonna go I guess I'm racist did you see where they had the president and they were talking to him and the president was addressing these students they were being fucking completely ridiculous yeah and they told him to put his hands down because his hands were a microaggression and then a kid stood up next to him in like a threatening manner and told them to put his hands down and he put his hands down they started laughing they started laughing it's clearly game they're playing ping-pong they're playing checkers I just believe they're booing him it's not just that it's not just bullying it's like them grouping up its support each other there imagine how he feels well he was saying that he believes it's like a mass psychosis that literally it's like a mass hysteria it's like people losing their minds in this loren losing their minds so that's being given undue power that they don't deserve they haven't earned all of this power but they're doing something with that power if they give you an hour you wouldn't so it is some sort of a psychosis so you know absolutely these people are and they've never been hunting that they're not being held to an account right they're not being told look when you earn power you generally have a nice crowd circuit isn't it you have power you have to be responsible of that power right and that's what a good leader is these people are just being given power they haven't earned it they're being given it and they are being told they can't do anything wrong and so they hey well fuck whatever the fuck I like them they're also told that like you can always step up and talk about your blackness or whatever and everyone has to kind of shut the fuck up like you you have like there's these car launches yes there's these subjects that you can sort of like intersect or inject your your race into or your gender or the fact that you're trans or the fact that you're marginalized marginalized in any way Latino and you can kind of shut down discussion and it's one of the things that you see when this president is addressing the students and students step up there ask what this is long it looks like a hostage negotiator it is they get up and they start talking about their own individual identity then you told you about the color of my skin that's not my pistol whatever it is the fact that I have a vagina the fact that I already and it's that my wife's gonna complain to be honest it's it becomes the thing you know it becomes the thing that you're discussing rather than whatever the actual thing you're discussing is yeah that's the problem of identity politics it's not a form of politics it doesn't go anywhere is designed to grind the dialogue to a halt right and to give the person making the argument control of everyone else around them that's where it unjustly this person hasn't earned this yeah that's where it is right it's like the couldn't you have a total control of the conversation now and you have set like these very clear parameters and there's a lot of that man there's a lot of that answer it is not it's not healthy it's just bizarre that that would fly in a university setting and I feel honest or agrees with it yeah some of them but also they don't want to lose their jobs students coming in you know they're gonna change the world or walk like a mob look at that they like an enemy faction an army within these things and this this is this is the reason I'm so good at identifying this because I'm well really well read like power politics maybe only if you'll know what's going on what you need to do is read the prints read alinsky and read Robert Greene that'll teach you how to understand these people and these people are I mean everything they're doing is about power and control it's about it's about influence over what's going on and at any point you can break this influence by just simply understanding how they're gaining it I think Jordan Peterson's got some pretty unique insight into it because he's been dealing with it several years and in a very high-profile way but one of the things that he said that he believes it's about revenge he says he thinks that a lot of these people that are so active on campus and then they're in this fever pitch he goes a lot of them were bullied and pushed around when they were younger and they were socially awkward and not in the good cool groups and now they want revenge and this is why they want to label everyone who plays sports as being some sort of a misogynist woman raper you know I mean that's really what it is like everyone who's in a frat house is a misogynist homophobic rapist like there's no way around you're in a frat it's like they're full yeah like that woman who thought it was okay to say that that guy who got killed like that they would do coke and rape girls at a frat party like what okay this is a caricature yeah this I mean get imagine if someone did an equal caricature about a black man it's already scary I don't believe in the racist it is racist but it's just it's also every different racism I also mean dead fucking taking a poster it's all he did but you're you're putting all these strawman definitions on this guy but all this guy did is the young guys dumb thing I'm gonna steal this poster yeah and he's dead now like that's it the fact that a litera regime you don't know sympathy for him whatsoever what the fuck would you be cool if he was caught ambien if he was a Colombian American they beat him to death like how would you feel them would you would you come up with some sort of a Colombian influence that he's got that you don't have and so he's got some sort of a Colombian privilege I mean how is this not going up being hideously oppressed anyway he's been captured you know taken by the North Koreans I mean being to death yeah you know and they will literally I'll prove that you're white male privilege isn't universal it's like you know if you're gonna say that I mean you'd have to be a fucking moron say that because everything about the ideology itself is contextual its power plus privilege therefore it must have a context there must be more white people around for it to work and therefore if we get a Zimbabwe why people are hideously oppressed by their definition in Zimbabwe when the white farmers getting the funds appropriated by black African pound Marxists or whatever they are then that of course they're being oppressed of course it's unit non-universal of course it contextual it's the most asinine thing to say yeah you know oh it's not universal it's not universal what you were talking up because I'm really dehydrated don't worry it's hydrate myself apologize for drinking water I'm consistently doing don't worry about it man thing I go but I think it's also what you were talking about where they want to make it all about them like here this woman has taken this situation which is horribly tragic and now she's talking about students that she has to deal with that her white men that are doing coke and raping girls at frat bars and just like this guy but it is this horrible generalization they can Amaro they keep making the stories but she's making about her and her classes and the guys that she had the clueless guys that she has to deal with in her classes and she's just deciding that this guy is that without any personal knowledge of him at all but she's a future we've come and she's turning it on herself and she's a victim because she has to deal with these students yeah and these clueless white rich male students mm-hmm fuck man I'm not saying there's no twats out there a bunch of dudes who are shitheads and for sure there are just like there's women that sucked - let me those humans that suck it has nothing to do with gender or race or if that's racist to categorize them in that particular there's plenty of humans that are that happened to be white males that are great that happened to be black women that are great that there's plenty of people that are cool across the board in every single gender race of course where you treat people as modules you're treating content of the cab slightly I'm okay we sent mean that's the right way to do things disturbing thing about this is a fucking professor who's teaching young people is generalizing this horrendous way and she thinks it's okay because this kid stole a poster and what did he think was gonna happen what did he think was gonna happen Jesus Christ when you're 20 years old you're not thinking how the fuck does this dummy not know that how does she not understand just just the science of the development of the human brain which has been clearly established over the past twenty thirteen mid 2025 the frontal cortex it's not even developed kids do stupid thing of course of course unbelievably stupid I have it I'm sure you have to especially if you have a deck there's something about being a do dumber do dumber shit my missus like look you know I don't I don't sound like a bigger bass always been always impress women or something the Knights Wow but let me let me educate you on something please do say the word aunt at now put the wood we'll put the letters TW before it twat yes that's how you say it yes now if you get appropriate our language listen American now that's why we spell tires you say wow it's twat nice 20 No you can say that any way you want do but I'm saying twice my language if I say there's more amount while her our view language god damn it man it's ours now it's American okay so in the future you know it won't be English anymore but like latin became spanish so i've got like another 10 minutes or anything else to talk about anything man what do you want to talk about besides I need us our kids yeah Jesus Christ bro she's gonna be victimized by this oh yeah um by the way I need uh I got no hate for you alright I talked to you you should come on you should come on and jonathan mcintosh yeah grow that there's a lot of those guys a lot of those vampire familiars you ever see the movie blade remember the vampire familiar hangs around with the vampires and thinks it's gonna get in and they eventually kill him yeah same thing with 30 Days of Night except the the vampire familiars don't usually sexually assault the vampires they reminisce guys they really get that off I look at Patton Oswalt without Denis is like you know the the male feminist sexist sexual predator is the sort of you know Catholic priest molesting children of our generation it's so true it is fucking true in a lot of ways I love Mel famous that's like the creepiest looking motherfuckers and then it turns by the way if you're not that way and you identify yourself as a feminist no I'm not talking about you I know what you're saying there's a lot of people out there that really want to they get locked into it because it sounds it sounds right you know like oh are you for equal rights for women yeah then you're a feminist okay then and you say it and then people treat you differently because you say because they know you've done a good job Billy I'm gonna pat you on the head you called yourself a feminist yeah why'd you define yourself man are you a human like every good human wants equality are we good you like many labels as well you know something you're denying sexism like you know you don't have to be a pro black Ally or sound an eye or to rather deny accepting any form of racism or not that's a bad way to describe it then it's how they define these things if they have a different definition if they say we're a structural it's you know like you know institution will talk about racism is an easier way of framing it and you say well you know I think racism that I don't think the structures are actually racist I think that the individuals certain individuals within structures are racist then what you're doing is undermining their entire philosophy and if you're undermining their entire philosophy by they said effectively individualizing it rather than collectivizing it then they have to consider you an enemy because what you're if everyone if you go yeah and then someone else goes you know that's a good way of looking at under look at that too and then a lot of people get you know that's a great point then suddenly their philosophy is just gonna collapse no one's gonna believe what they're saying and they're gonna like no but this is what I'm being horribly oppressed and everyone's like no really there are some racist but we deal with them we've got laws you know we've got laws against racism we've got laws the affirmative action laws to bring black people and you know I don't think the system is actually as racist as you're saying I think that maybe there are a few bad actors and when we see one we can spot them and get them get them out you know then what how these people gonna play the victim play the victim there's real racism and there's also real people playing the victim yeah there's Bowl of course there's real racism but we're vigilant for that well what a racist just tolerated well oh the president that's now right exactly that the president that company is a racist yeah well we're just gonna leave him because you know he's just like you know Easy's all right he's doing good job of course he's not they just gonna be out of the door for sure they frame PewDiePie as being someone who may have been spreading anti-semitism which got him like millions of followers though well they did like 2 3 million but they cost millions of dollars yeah but I think ultimately it'll probably balance itself out he's already gone in his favor themselves but that's only because there was a credible turn to media I mean like PewDiePie there's there's me and another youtuber called Kraus on TV we both made videos about what's-his-name just talking so fast you want adderall no it's just there's so much I need to tell you okay I'm probably not gonna be here again and there's a lot you need to come on man you're coming back I'd love to you know you're like I looked and what I've had a bit more sleepers off anyway a youtuber called Crowson tea growers and TJ's a German guy kraut and tea Oh like T like that seventeen yes he's half English half German okay oh I get it and he did a video about this as well I did a video about this and PewDiePie did a video using the information and statistics we've compiled to be like to do his own video and used us as sources say look this one got this information and he tweeted out I was like holy shit that's really nice of him but it's really interesting how we helped him fight back because he's not he's a comedian you know he doesn't do all this professionally he doesn't know what to look for you know new one why would he you know would you would an expensive but luckily this was how speciality we've been going is the media since they won because we know they're a bunch of liars we know they are some of them are like there's got to be not all of them right there's gotta be good journalists that's no excuse though you know a platform at The Wall Street Journal if you want to maintain your reputation you don't publish shit like that well how does he own except what is their response they don't care they don't address it that why should that seem so crazy they can't risk they should address that absolutely no I don't think you see them why I don't know I don't think he wants the trouble if you sued the mug back him I believe dude I think you would win I can't see how we could lose yeah what can you prove they cost you money easily yeah is this actual anti-semitism obviously not yeah did they take you out of context clearly in fact what if the jokes was that they would take him out of context how could he lose this yeah you know um well some it is possible what you should do is find out how much the Wall Street Journal cost to buy and and crowd fund it and I'd donate to that I'd spread it around yeah what was it there was a lawsuit recent lawsuit that I couldn't believe was thrown out goddamnit I can't remember it now yeah inoculating a few hundred million dollars but like I mean he's got 55 million subscribers he's a very influential man and there are a lot of people who like him who would love to support maybe it's possible maybe he could maybe he could speak to I know some nice wealthy benefactors who are like you know I hate these people like that Peter Thiel guy what he did with Hulk Hogan versus exactly yeah why not wouldn't it just be the funniest thing the world see PewDiePie's the owner of The Wall Street Journal arias yeah anywhere these billionaires who happen to be obviously wealthy how many watching this and think you know what we could get one over on these bitches and that we don't have to just let them win we don't have to just let them win we could I feel like the New York Times feels incredibly challenged right now I know I was gonna say with you just you're just so ready to go I am just so much words unfortunately I know your time but about Donald Trump I was gonna say yeah is there any way you can reschedule or schedule your flight yeah I could just like I mean if you want to carry on I could just count 10 if you I just want to make sure you don't get stuck here la can just buy another ticket tomorrow are you sure that cost me a full chrimbus fine well a fortune for an hour of podcasting seems whatever you've any gone out I've got another hour Sanja pounds well no probably more it's probably a thousand pounds oh I probably shouldn't what's a thousand pounds program hasn't all your dollars will take care of it really yeah we'll put it on the budget the first of the day we're gonna hang out man you're gonna go to the movies yes sir have an ice cream well I'm not gonna do it I don't know what you're gonna do dude if you want to do another hour of podcasting we can we should just say we're supposed to start at 9:00 we're a little late cuz traffic yours in say my wife's gonna kill me your wife's gonna kill if you don't come home then go home man she'll understand me you sure yeah mixed messages she'll understand she's gonna kill me as she lands all right so we keep going yeah go okay go so where were we find the wolf sir general piece of teals money yeah well what I was saying is that the New York Times feels very challenged by Donald Trump's dismissal of them as fake news and all these different attacks and because of that they sort of doubled down on the ethics of journalism they've tried really hard to be better at yeah yeah I saw yeah they actually but that's a real indictment of the state journalism and then when they have you know we're going to recommit ourselves to actually being journalists good thinking whilst in Houston New Times called out in a way that it is what they've never been called out before of course they did lose yeah I mean he's the president they became political activists they weren't journalists arised and they were on the losing side right getrekt you know of course you've got something go well okay hold on okay let's let's try not being Liars anymore and you know what is that trickled down from is it from the editors who lost sight is it the writers themselves that they hire is it the ethics behind the business of the magazine or the of the newspaper unfortunate I don't know the ins and outs the water thing but I mean if you had aspect I don't know if I had speculate I would probably say it's coming from the top and they just like what the fuck is happening right like we're seeing with these tech companies yeah like we're seeing with these people that are like uber progressive in Google or wherever the fuck they are yeah yeah that's a weird thing man we're we're dealing with a real I mean I hate to use the word but it's the real word culture war yeah I mean that's the terms exactly blood culture warriors yeah I mean and and this is why this is why I turn this in like power politics because they are attacking people you mean like attacking PewDiePie they're costing him money I mean they didn't even publish their article the Wall Street Journal didn't even publish their article before they had gone to Disney and got them to pull their money from him Wow first yeah how do you think it's because they heard that he was getting this big fat deal from Disney and they're like fuck this guy yeah this cuz PewDiePie doesn't play ball with them does he set ball and how so he's not a progressive oh he's a liberal he doesn't sit there going oh well you know feminism is a good idea guys he's not he's red pilling the the new generation about feminism he makes anti feminism fazil videos every now and again and they're actually quite funny people should check them out though he's just bragging on this cuz it's stupid shit you know it's the sort of stupid shit like we've been talking about right and rightly so this is bollocks and it's good that he's telling kids look this is crap just treat people well you know like just treat people as an individual not you know conversing but is correct it is crap but don't you think it's being sort of like it's eroding the same way mail feminism is eroding like that term is a very derogatory term you know you call someone a male feminist most people just go if you call someone a social justice warrior I mean that is a masking term now that term is not something someone carries there was a while where people like I read quotes like yeah we are warriors like what yeah I mean the beginning they were like embracing it yeah I mean it's not an sjw on the Joe Rogan podcast on you like the number one podcast in the world it's probably up there yeah it's not an sjw sign yet I mean listen let me tell you let me tell you how to check your priveledge show no I haven't had one of those on I would be I would be fascinated you should get one on just just up in the brain know where my studio is and you have to talk to them for an hour yeah but I mean I can tell you what they thinks I've spoken to my I mean that's a cop-out because the people of you like Cubans show both bullshit always like no actually I shouldn't I should just talk I'm just not interested in you yeah well the creepy and weird interview probably he'll ask someone so there's some there's some merit to having these volatile discussions and people that you disagree with oh yeah I like it that's all so people can pass me to Richard Spencer it's like yeah but I've told to sjw's already I know what the identitarian think I mean whenever every time like someone like a black is something you know let me tell you about my blackness who was that a youtuber coke a black deep in the YouTube world oh yeah of course I am if you were to him like we all know who you're talking yeah yeah yeah sorry but she she's actually she's Karl Rove yeah she's black trans you too but she's actually great and people are gonna be surprised to hear me say that but I've never done a video about her because she's not full of shit she's just an identity Rhian but that doesn't mean that she's bad or anything like this that just means she talks about herself a lot but she's actually got this really great streak in her that's really fair and so when I mean these people run like lemmings off cliff when they get an idea in their head that oh my god yes we should all you know jump on you know like Laci green when she abandons their community or something there was Laci green she's another youtuber I'm socialist Christ you're on YouTube usually who is Laci green well she's a feminist who realized how toxic the community that she was part of millions of subscribers oh wait a minute she the girl that was it turned out was dating some sort of a some guy who is busy in the Anansi no what are you joking around yeah he's probably well I don't give a fuck if he's watching but try to follow this yeah but I'm gonna talk to Jesus Christ but isn't he like he's just a yesterday whe blimey okay okay so he's an anti sjw person that's what he is yeah but basically disaffected liberals mostly and so he identitaire people got mad at her because she was dating this guy yeah who they don't agree with yeah because he's a gangsta feminism and black lives matter why do people give a fuck who people date why is it because then controlling psycho cultists hmm and they drag tour all across social media I mean some of the worst things I've seen really oh yeah absolutely and like what did they talk about Oh like just you know I mean like one thing that noise me is that like you know six months ago everyone was like yeah we love Lisa green she's great sure feminist she's you know she's a sex ed stuff brilliant blah blah blah right and then as soon as she's like you know I I kind of I met this guy I like this guy and he's actually making some really good points they're like your sex ed stuff sucked you suck everything you've ever done suck get out of our key and then I mean it she gets death threats and things like that and she used to get them from like I guess like all right so types who were in the basements or something in theater but now they get guessing from the STW times oh I wish people just not send threats on the che it doesn't do anything it just makes it's just nasty for people well definitely is that but it's just it's so sad that someone can't just date someone that they don't agree with likes the guy you can't change your opinion either can't evolve they can't leave you be a flip-flopper yeah you know can you even control what you believe I believe that you could but then what did I just say believes that I believed I could control what I believe now you don't believe right because you've just decided I don't believe that no I'm gonna believe I can change that well I believe that people do change for sure I know no Pete yeah but they live with their ideas it's not like it's not like a conscious choice to say you know what one day I mean I'm an atheist so one day I'm gonna like actually yeah I'm gonna choose to believe in God you either believe in you don't believe I don't think it's a choice well I could see what you're saying but I think that when you're when you're going over the possibilities of any subject in your mind hmm you are you're influenced by a host of factors as well how you physically feel where you are in your life what what kind of relationship you have with your family like where your job is right now like where you I know a lot of people that hit the fucking bottom and then all of a sudden they became religious do you think that's a set of coincidence no it's like at that stage in your life you needed to believe something yeah and that helped you and it helped you to believe that thing and maybe I mean how many dudes find Jesus why they're getting their dick sucked in the jacuzzi yeah exactly it's probably pretty low Yeah right yeah unless it's like a really bad blowjob you just feel sad you actually like guys yeah but you know people find they find love and happiness you know in weird places they find the depression in weird places so it's really a lot of like what you believe depends on where you're at in your life it can very well be influenced where you go one way or the other and then once someone has an opinion whether it's God is real or God is fake they fucking fight that to the death like that is their stance and they can't change it they can't move it around and if you do you're off flip-flopper well if you didn't reason yourself into it then you can't be reasoned out of it yes right well that term flip-flop or Solaris it's so stupid because it's a moronic political term and really only existed because politicians did not have a form to defend the evolution of their ideas but now they can go online Britney Sanders has a fucking podcast you know now they say it does listen they can go on YouTube or Facebook they don't need to be in some sort of a you know political forum and some sort of a formal gives ages yeah they don't they could just talk about their ideas like this is what I used to believe and this is why I changed my mind and they could do that over the course of an hour in a YouTube video and it's clearly as the mind could decipher state their opinions on things but because people couldn't in the past like he used to be tough on crime now he's a flip-flopper you know it might not be what happened he might used to be tough on crime and then he was given evidence of systemic racism then he realized how corrupt the police department is and then he realized that they have mandated quotas where they have to arrest a certain amount of people and this is probably the best place to do it because those people don't have the money for legal representation and like so that's why my opinion evolved but you couldn't do that in the past so someone would just call you a flip-flopper yeah the Internet has changed everything and for the better by a long trial I mean like by the way it's not discrediting real flip-flopping well no obviously if someone if someone's of the ena doesn't really hold a position and they're just doing it because it's a popular thing to do like Hillary Clinton for example perfect Clinton and Trump on gay marriage yeah that's the best yeah Trump has been consistent on that for decades now Clinton 2008 was I why I believe is men and a woman till 2013 2013 finally came clean and when went gay marriage in 2013 I believe this video of her from 2013 in fact saying that marriage is between a man and a woman of coal she would you know and then suddenly all know you've got to change position that she's on yeah whatever I don't give a shit because I'm Hillary Clinton have the money yes you know I'm here I'm a careerist I'm I'm gonna be the first woman president because I had to fuck Bill Clinton alright I would love to read what the crazy shit she said to those bankers and those quarter million dollar speeches I would love to so now the transcripts that she won't release no I did not know that dude she want some crazy stuff like she wants some this is borders like like hemispheric open borders where like one hemisphere is just you know free and open and another one is free and open and to eventually get like a United globalized world and that's just as she saying how she holds a public service to the bankers she said that in the the speeches she holds a public in a private position yeah look I did not know that they got that there's I didn't Bernie Sanders ever discussed those pieces he's he's don't even cook oh no he's not your son sir Bernie Sanders seems like a very nice man he's nook he's been well I mean you saw blacklivesmatter take over a stage right oh yeah I did yes I know it was fucking sad Bernie these little bullies have got no right to your platform and they're literally screeching him we are being reasonable screaming in his face side Bernie as soon as some of the proteins there - I've lost me I didn't approve you know I was I was at that point a supporter of Bernie I like Bernie yeah you know I thought okay he's maybe maybe a little further left I'll be gone after getting a chance and having them go up there and then I like that though I like that he took the chance to let them Todd and I gonna get I don't think they should be able to do it but I think it does give you a sense of who he is that he's like alright tell me what you want tell me what you're looking at he's just like standing the side yes and it's fast Ernie you're not leading me well if he moves his hands they're microaggression exactly we've learned that on every date you should have had your boundaries I mean you didn't immediately capitulate right so that was your boundary just didn't stick to it that's a point you should write should have said listen no I'm gonna call security you're gonna be escorted away maybe we could discuss it in future if someone comes up to you and starts screeching your face that they're being reasonable you draw the line and you stick to it you do not let that person bully you out of your podium it's yours not theirs they've got no right to it don't get fucked it's being investigated now financial dealings with his wife and him and a small universe in where she made some decisions that ultimately didn't pan out financially and it caused the university to go under they acquired a bunch of new land and they were gonna expand the university and they got a lot of loans and they started construction all this jazz and apparently just wasn't sustainable and so now I think there's allegations which of course whenever something fails like that there's allegations that someone mishandled something so they've been foresters ranged um I do not know it's been the news you know I haven't really deeply gone into a store but the the the basics of the story are she worked for this university she wanted it to expand they got spent a lot of money expanding it didn't work out so it doesn't sound on the face of it like malfeasance was necessarily involved the worry is that he used his influence to make some certain things happen that allowed it to take place perhaps well that's the allegation I believe I I still think Ron Paul can win to be honest he might he's old yeas way too old Bernie's way to up there always yeah but if a politician so old it takes that long fully trust you it's sad that yeah isn't there like some guy in his 40s who's basically saying the same thing as Bernie Sanders who hasn't like yeah we still still gets boners we don't trust them creep because she fucks this thing i bill clinton man they really piss me off like people do it's weird it's because they can find out about it and they couldn't find out about it before so you got a guy like JFK was a total pussy hound do people here is a great great sir okay yeah supposedly yeah in this thing why he's here yeah that's a problem with him and his wife you know that's nothing to do right you know and it doesn't surprise me it's all great men always get women flinging themselves at them and okay they're only human if you've got some really attractive woman flinging yourself out you're going going we can just nothing's gonna go wrong you know be great normal no no fucking surprise right it's not a judgment on their character either that's just them being a bit weak in the moment you know I know they know it's wrong they know they shouldn't have done it all right well the culture me is very very very different the culture of politics was very afferent back there oh yeah people knew about the president's affairs like new what was that uh who's the president that had polio who's the president of polio another one you had a wheelchair what is it was it Roosevelt he the guy who he's got a little round glasses and smile was a polio um anyway it was yeah Teddy Franklin Franklin Franklin Delano Roosevelt he had polio and the press knew it and they hid it from everybody they just know one yeah yeah I mean that was the thing with JFK that was thing of Lyndon Johnson famously held a press conference while he's taking a shit he was literally taking a shit with the door open in the stall when he's talking to the press because there was like boundaries you know yeah I was taking a horrible stand shit no well I also think that once watergate broke once you realize that hey it's pretty obvious this president is a fucking liar and a crook and we need if we have any responsibility we need to expose this well once you expose that man you open up that door woo people find out the genies out of the bottle and then they want to know everything yet want to know as soon as it becomes permissible well the thing is it's up to people not to care it's up to people to understand that look at the end of the day you are the person who is making the difference and it's a small difference but if we all agree they will make a small difference and they're working I'm going to act in a way that I find personally responsible if we all say rectum ways we fund person responsible we'll just end up with a better world without having to change anything right yeah myths that's all no heads don't you think that today is probably harder than ever to manage like what you're paying attention to what you're not oh yeah well if yeah if you're thinking about like fake news and like parts and I mean that that's a real problem with social media like there have been studies done that show like and it's it's more on the left but it's also very much on the right you know like yeah like 70 60 or something like that you know but it's slightly more on the left where people just ascent if they essentially get one political viewpoint and so that the the social media is just a stream of content that's all telling you the same thing what was the story that just came out about a fake news story that cost some company some untold millions of dollars might have been even been they might have even said a billion dollars in stock really and it just came out today like the sound that a company was extremely devalued because of a fake new stress that is a danger yeah oh it's a big danger especially if you trade in the stock market and then all sudden it causes a cascade of panic and you just start dumping their stock and you're fucked yeah I mean the idea would be that would bow out eventually but if it was a fragile company who knows yeah it missile damage that could have done to them did you find it it's a really recent news story it just came out like it's the it's the air yesterday flipside of like being able to hold people accountable you know yes it's it yeah you can hold the Internet's fantastic in social medias fantastic YouTube fantastic and you could mean I think you could make real arguments that these things are now but like critical to free speech I agree I mean land and there should be like this should be understood but on the flip side someone could say something that's not true that's free speech yeah well that's unfortunate but it's amazing when you really think about it how rare it is I mean you know it's fairly common you're talking about 7 billion people yeah okay I mean even if I only happened once a day that's definitely one thing a day that's nothing but I mean it is up to I mean like they'll probably have to educate kids in school you need right when you see something going on social media you're gonna have to thank check it I think there's going to be much more sophisticated ways of understanding whether or not someone's being honest and I think what we're looking at now is just like when people started reading books that were written they never imagined that someone was gonna have a printing press and when people had a printing press no one was ever going to imagine that you're gonna put that on the Internet so I think there's probably something around the bend right now for us that's going to radically change the factual interpretation of information like you're gonna know what's real and what's not and it's probably going to be something that you're not even going to understand what it's about now like that as technology evolves this bizarre and exponential way they're gonna reach some new critical way of distributing information and then things gonna get very strange this is the way they're strange now where we have this radical new ability to put out content like you do or I do I think in the future that's going to be another change that's just as monumental and just as huge and it's probably going to deal with how we interface with that data like some sort of a wearable thing or a mind thing where you can recognize patterns as being true or untrue recognize humans as being honest or dishonest like you're gonna be able to see you don't you're gonna find it man you we're gonna get to you know people are really worried about the lack of privacy now I feel like that is just step one this ultimate very bizarre symbiotic relationship we're gonna have with each other and Technology where we're gonna be inside each other's heads in a very easy way it comes by it's kind of wow thing about racism like the sjw's and like the Evergreen college students gang hey if you do this you're a racist eventually I just go yeah camera racist they'll just say okay I'm like yeah but you're erasing them but you I know what's next I know but you're supposed to do something because otherwise I'll call you a racist yeah okay I'll just be a racist then it doesn't mean anything yeah I have to get consent to give that power yeah and if I don't consent like that you know if you it like what was i can walled or whatever who caught with the tentacle porn mmm you should just owned it but yeah fuck you you probably watch some shit stuff too yeah and you look at what don't tell me what your porn watching habits are go on tell me about your Puritan at the puritanical porn watching you just watched two people in missionary for 20 minutes and then that gets you off does it shut up well even if it doesn't get you off and you watch it like what if you just like what in the fuck like if you look through my youtube lists or you looked at my history online you go is that something you likely know I don't like car accidents but I watched that motorcycle kicked that car and then the car spins out and hits the barrier and then flips that other car yeah I saw it everybody saw it doesn't mean I liked it no you know something about that makes me skeptical Wow you should have just owned it it's such a sin who is he I don't know who is he I don't know I think he's a right-wing journalist or something I don't know on they caught him into tentacle porn yeah I guess it was in his search history awesome did you find that story about well there's someone you don't know I know I have that devalued story like someone said yeah yeah there was it was definitely something but but it didn't I you know and the thing is this this is the point is like if we're going to a future where literally everyone's going to know everything about everyone then nothing is really gonna matter about any person I mean there's some like well yeah everyone does you know you know you know exactly who does this so it's not gonna be shameful nothing be shameful nothing be shocking everyone just know everyone ever everything about everyone all the time yeah that's the real worry right and they didn't become okay no okay the fake news here it is I'll tell you I found it so easy Jamie so sad your skills it says fake news of fatal car crash wiped out 4 billion in here's the company III um II th re no that's Bitcoin that's like a crypto currency oh that's why you didn't find it yeah I didn't know what that was that's a new one yeah Oh God okay so fake news of fatal it's on quartz koozie calm yeah wiped out the four billion dollars in their market value yesterday how the fuck they have four billion dollars the market value of a crypto coin that I've never even heard of no idea I see so that's I mean still I guess as legitimate as stock Jesus Christ I mean if there's four billion dollars in value to it that's as legitimate as a company some legitimacy point being that a fake news story wiped out the value of it but maybe now's the time to buy all right well yeah it's got no value and it's probably gonna go back up because this wasn't the real thing about it get on the ground floor dive in take a chance on well what is the big story about the guy that created it died in a car crash oh so everybody found it was yeah and then everyone panicked because the Creator God it's controlling the money in the market of it suppose they died well that didn't happen okay but still by the way your starts going down four billion dollars that's the other weird part it's not stock it's a oh it's a value of market of rice that's another one of my favorite stories of the last year the Fano story that woman who was pretending to be the news female Steve Jobs and she had the look so everybody went with it and she had this blood testing procedure that totally didn't word in the context it's a great story I don't think she was she was touted as being the next genius she dressed exactly like Steve Jobs she wore black turtlenecks and was really hilarious and she gave the speech to like women in something or another but the speech was so like jumbled and shitty and there's so much poverty of words in her sentences like though the content was just so bad I was like this is a genius like maybe she's like super awkward and nervous and maybe she just didn't prepare this speech at all but no turns out she was a massive fraud her things a massive fraud and her 34 billion dollar company vanished so the company had a product that they were using where they were doing these blood tests and a whistleblower from inside the company said this person they're ignoring all the bad data they're ignoring all the failed tests that they're pretending it's much more efficient that an image didn't work do not only did did not work hundreds of thousands of people who took these tests were exposed to potential health threats because they thought well this is tested they know why I know where my blood is now so you could have gone you know more cautious or less cautious based on this or you know got treatment that you didn't need based on this or didn't get treatment that you probably did need based on this so they imagine the kind of person who does not look she's standing that bullshitting I'm so she was at risk sociopath and in some sort of a way some or unless she was lied to to I mean who knows exactly what the actual story is but the the whistleblower saying no she's absolutely aware of it and so now she's she went from being like the number one self-made female entrepreneur ever where she was worth like thirty four billion dollars or something crazy to massive debt now our company is worth nothing it doesn't work so she fired a shitload of people and the company still exists as an entity but it's it's like one of those really tortured things because lawsuits are flying around lefted right now but the whole story is a cautionary tale and like what what we're looking for we're looking for this thing this new image you know here's this woman she's fitting the part she's got a black turtleneck on Conal just came along and played you dropped out of college at 19 to start this business I mean she doesn't she doesn't even have a background in medical science she's not which isn't have a degree something she's a PhD and some sort of bioengineering or blood testing or whatever the fuck it would be yeah yeah it's uh it's a crazy was Doron because she was saying hey exactly this is Jurassic Park look apart said the right words confidence trickster comes around and says hey you're interested in a woman doing this I'm a woman I'm doing this I remember before she get exposed watching that video of her talking going this not see much yeah if she's just like rambling along and kind of disjointed or something it's just clunky yeah like pull up see if you could find Elizabeth or is that her name stano's what the fuck was her name I forget what her name is Sarah knows was right what was her name but no I did I did hear about but I'll have to check it out some of the time yeah it's but it's look again this is what's that Elizabeth home yeah okay so no it's not discrediting women this is not discrediting the idea of a genius woman this is not discrediting the idea of a genius entrepreneurial woman what this is fascinating to me is a person who fits all of these categories that people are clearly looking for right and they just born to exist without any power Tom confirmation bias and we love the fact that it's strong woman who's doing this it's amazing it's a strong I'm with her hashtag they went with the marine lepen though when they lose that oh the French woman oh that's right yeah well well I'd say that's the thing isn't it oh well you know I mean I know she's the woman but I'm flood leaf or Alexander macron yeah but Europe I'm with her on yeah right oh you know I'm with her when she thinks wrong so it's not that she's a woman it's the way she fucking thinks why can't we just be honest about this you know that Merkel lady's a trip to our Merkel's cancer she's I can't believe the Germany get rid of Merkel what are you doing what are you doing she's a trip when I know about her if I know who's running Germany the Germans just can't help themselves what are they doing over there with what with her dad today Merkel's I speak to again my friend kraut who tells me about these things she's famous for her and I don't want say flip-flopping but her I would like I would actually be a lot more charitable and say her I'm her navigation of the political winds she's Hillary in that way I guess where she's an opportunist another one I think there's some third calm opportunist because that sailors really really it's being a smart politician isn't it saying well okay what what I mean where are people going that's a thought that's smart anymore well no I think it I think it means you lack credibility it makes you look like you don't stand for anything but look as much as Trump lies and he lied six hundred plus times in the hundred plus times that he was in office they did a count of all the times he said things that weren't true publicly right as much as he does that everybody knows it's what he does like they know who he is they know what he does they know he tweets all the time so even if he tweets something ridiculous they know who that is that's that guy that's him that's what he really thinks that's why saying it you never got that with Hillary Clinton what you got is these weird boiled down messages it seemed like they were put together in some sort of a the writers room yeah it was I mean she doesn't control her Twitter account no you know undoubtedly but Trump undoubtedly is in control of his own quarter percent it's so hilarious I thought it was hilarious she wrote to him delete your account yes that was good yeah got to give it up to her there but I don't know who wrote that was probably some twenty year old kid somewhere she probably wrote it yeah and some girls work at for guys who knows Ashley the social media manager of Wendy's tweet to that Pepe of the Wendy's icon as a Pepe oh no oh shit storm absolute system they were forced to delete in who knows what that job but Pepe is alright and you're saying Pepe is not out right they all try to use Pepe but everyone uses Pepe Pepe is a ubiquitous internet symbol of sort of dissidents and chaos more importantly disrespect but isn't Keck like the god of chaos leader since aid up this little made a mini job it was I think but what if you die and you meet Keck would you be feeling bad because you said he was made up I'll be quite surprised because let's be honest would you have believed it no but yeah that would be so shocked if you a gold robe was a frog and you guys have no gold yeah and there's there's literally looks like Pepe then that he's got a gold robe on can I piss off like literally everyone who please in a religion why would you want to because what about hope doesn't it just strike using this childish fucking thing that depends die I'm gonna go someone's knee no not Scientology that that's starting to make sense to me I can tell I just like but I like I said up watching but the no sir see it's obviously what you're thinking and it's office kids you're afraid of dying and it's obviously that you just want to believe it it's not true you fucking I just want that gold medal that this isn't true I want that Scientology gold medal they gave Tom Cruise the big one like a laptop it looks like flava flav up there that fucking gold medal on but isn't it so arrogant to think that humans are so important that they're gonna get to an afterlife it might be right you know the afterlife isn't isn't that arrogant to me because it's the idea is that like you're trying to pass on life right and the mind understands that this is sort of a futile effort your temporary you have a finite life you know like what what are you doing why why even bother constantly suffering just jump off a building so no no no we can't do that because there's a greater good waiting for us there's a greater thing there's another level doesn't make sense video game doesn't make sense if if you're going to go to heaven when you done right kill yourself right that you can't that's a loophole so you can't kill yourself you make the people around you that loved you suffer so you don't go to heaven when you kill yourself that's convenient or that's God what if they kill you where's your part of the cult ritual like you know we're all just gonna you know drink the kool-aid the poison cool kill ourselves well they answered that with Jesus Jesus on the cross that's why we still do this we literally make her make the cross sign the the thing that killed him bill that bill hex had a great joke about that he goes it's like going up to Jackie Onassis with a rifle yeah he was just thinking a John Jack imagined it feel like a pagan or something back in the 7th century or whatever and you're you're you know Northern European Lithuanian or something and then these Germans come on go hey we've got this religion about dead guy we think you should join it why well it's it's really sad it's a really sad story but he died for your sins but yeah everywhere you go there's a guy just being killed on a cross like you know my religion is way more fun than that yeah you have the original sin - that's the great thing that you brought up earlier about being white I mean it's sort of like just being a human the original sin the only way they can have complete total control over you is to say that you are guilty no matter what you are just being born guilty yeah yeah yeah it starts from that that this is all-knowing infinite thing that looks over the universe is incredibly petty very jealous have you if you yeah if you don't worship anything else any other false idols death you wear two different types of clothes death yeah you know it's it's some really interesting because there are there have been religions in the past that thought that that was an evil God that created the earth and everything in the earth is created by an evil God and there is a loving God beyond it but you can't pray to it it has no interaction yeah the only you gotta get past earth yeah basically you have to live a good life and eventually okay well maybe it's true maybe it's like this is a level the video game right maybe you get past this you get through and I'll put money on it and if I see these not were things in the afterlife okay okay well put look whatever you want on it right and then they'll say if it's true in the afterlife but you're you're like an ethereal being you're like so death experience man I've been there man it's obviously such wishful thinking well anybody that says they know as soon as someone says I know what happens even if you say I know that you die and there's nothing well you definitely don't you definitely don't know don't know but if I'm gonna put money on it I mean like I wouldn't put money on it because money's useless when you're dead but I mean like now you know tomorrow it's not for me it means that tomorrow they might be able to prove it tomorrow you know that if you get to beg agency it's like well actually scientists have discovered that God is real and it turns out that there are 72 virgins waiting in heaven so maybe you should convert to Islam now you know you blow shit okay and did you ever see that priest that got in trouble because he took photos of him in heaven and he was selling photos of him in heaven is wonderful it's him like waving and he's in like this pure white background and he said I put it on my - it's on my my from a while back as such but you you can find it Jamie it's hilarious his face I mean he it's it's it's adorable because he's so fucking stupid like the thing is so fucking stupid that it makes you just go are it's like that I just found out about this - the other day Geron Horton told me about the 18 year old kid that was running a medical practice and he did not have a any medicine guy they busted him and he sat down and gave interviews and said that he's being persecuted and oh the true facts will come to light but it's the way it's edited is so funny I mean it's really really funny I mean this guy's a loon this kid place NZ you find the photo of the guy in heaven areas there's a full version of it we could see like more of them with yeah it's like that but it's all just it's not that it's white is that a fake one oh it's what's out of 5,000 dollars for one yeah he was charging people for the photo of him in heaven and he was I guess he was gonna sign it quote I just want to bless everyone with the experience I had talking with Jesus he's a great guy it showed me a lot of love I can't wait to get back up there with him that's it that's it you met the King of Kings you met the son of God you met he says he says he's a great guy he showed me a lot of love oh well for sure it sounds like you had a real transcendent experience with Jesus he's a great guy he pictures on a Galaxy smartphone he brought his fucking Samsung up into heaven it was basically all hybl stories based on a lot of time you know someone was you know like Enoch was taken up into the crystal ship of God or something yeah well it's just horseshit it's just horseshit made up by idiots thousands of years ago I don't know what's going on they can't explain what's going on but they are kind of scared of getting killed and that's because it might really happen really fucking soon let's get me eyes you know and they're talking about an oral tradition because Todd talked for thousands of years and by the time someone wrote it down yeah it wasn't the original Bible like a thousand years old by the time anybody wrote down uh well undoubtedly that was I mean we don't know how they don't even know come from anyway you know well so when you hear like the similarities between like the Sumerian texts or is like oh yeah the Epic of Gilgamesh is really similar to Noah's Ark oh yeah yeah pushed him who you know survived the flood and whatnot and in fact it's like really so similar it's like there it's almost the same words just replacing God with gods right well they obviously placed gods with God and and the things we can even pinpoint this whole time that's likely to have been adopted into the religion yeah during the Babylonian exile when the Assyrians conquered the nation of Israel and left Judah they undoubtedly the the they took them back to another series of Babylonians and a Nebuchadnezzar took them back to Babylon and then they're there the smart Jews were the elites the the educated people and unsurprisingly suddenly their mythos includes loads of Mesopotamia my Diaz right that come from genius you know and then they go back and saw some of okay is caught Incorporated okay yeah it's this is a horse shit it's all horse shit and there's no benefit in to really trying to include the their stuff that they find in there and try to like to figure out whether or not these are connected it's just like I mean it's just like there are so many gods why that one by one you don't know probably cuz you grew up with it right you weren't reasoned into that but let's see you went you you weren't reason that I'm position you didn't say I think you know I've had a think and I think it's mardik that's I was thinking about it I was thinking TM up yeah it was a wild it team out you couldn't really have such like a primordial God but that's how I like I like the old ones yeah but they don't then Tina you couldn't pray the tear mats like prom no prayed Akram listen listen Mary doesn't but no no I mean I like Asha to be honest you know Ishtar but you know it's it's just like it's nonsense it's all nonsense well it's a myth and it's fascinating and what's interesting to me is the historical idea that these people were living by these stories like thousands of years ago and like what look you try to put it in context imagine what it would be like living thousands of years ago with no science with no education and the understanding of the world around you and then there you are abiding by these ancient stories and it's a fascinating thing like the Dead Sea Scrolls that's really fascinating stuff they've been stayin deciphering that forever but they don't incorporate it into the Christian doctrine you know it's not it's not already codified becoming a revisit huh yeah what do they do about that because if they know that that's ancient religious texts and it's as old as anything that they've found right it's the oldest version first century or something it's old as fuck yeah and these you know they don't use it what are they gonna do yeah it's weird but that's cuz they'd have to change their beliefs and they weren't reasoned into these beliefs so they're gonna be like no I don't they just ignore it they've got a narrative they just ignore I wonder what they did what the official position of like the Catholic Church is about like the Dead Sea Scrolls I don't give a shit what the Catholic Church says Oh fascinating well yeah but one thing that um one thing that bothers me about it is just before you brought the Catholic Church yeah there you go you blew a fuse yeah just just out about them yeah no it's the Catholic Church is horseshit oh it certainly is this is my problem and it's like I mean I get if someone wants to believe in stuff that's fine this is why secularism is important you know it's like but it's like identitarian politics you know it's just a tener but let me tell you about my ex you know but you're just talking about yourself right you know you're not talking about a problem that's external to you you're saying I have a problem I believe something you know I believe in God I believe the black people of this I believe of white people this yeah but I don't care you know tell me tell me about the things are external to you that actually are affecting things you know in you rather than things that are in you they're coming out I don't care about that you've got this the wrong way around I just find it fascinating that there's a certain level of like when you go back in time there's a certain level of history like will you just ignore those ideas like when you get past 4,000 years old like epic of gilgamesh is no one just trying to live by the Sumerian texts there's no one is treating that as a religion right the ancient Mesopotamian stories are basically thought of as purely myths yeah just like Odin and Thor think that's all abandoned but at one point in time that was the ideology to live I like the way that gods never really get resurrected and I yeah I don't really believe the neo-pagans and stuff of this so I actually believe in this no you don't you just think it's cool they think it's cool I'm all bacon yeah mm-hmm and that wicked wicked is not like old either that's like I knew that was like you know 19th century or something like that I was invented oh that's even dumber yeah I know the oldest version of the Mormons yeah yeah yeah dies in a gunfight or something like that in a prison that's my kind of prophet well you know he's dead now he was 14 yeah there's gold in place and no one got sauce good stuff I mean who do you know that's 14 that isn't full of shit yeah this boy has wisdom mm-hmm where did you learn this wisdom a golden tablet come with me I'll show you where it is the Angels knew we were coming and they took it away well I'm persuaded what's your magic seer stone oh no they took that as well it's so close so close yeah but they did tell me before they left that I could have nine wives so bitches once get one you know one of my favorite thing about the Quran and the hadith says is that Muhammad basically used to pull these fucking dictates from God ABS ass and at one point his child bride turn around to him and said you know paraphrasing but you know these are coming at surprisingly convenient times for you Muhammad it's like he got called out by your child bride Mamet because it's obvious you're pulling this shit out of your ass for your own convenience it's just like and there are some really gross things about Muhammad as well I better go and take some will probably kill me it's not amazing the really would have to worry about that yeah legit yeah yeah I mean people who have marked sin some time anyway we're on the subject okay I think it's worth talking about huh BISM been learning about that okay it's crazy and Muslims hate it it's like the sjw's of the Muslim world imagine if the country was taken over by rabid sjw's who had access to weaponry very scary right yeah imagine if they had in every city like SJW police who went around saying right blacks over there White's over there men over here women over here and if you were even caught in you know fraternizing with the opposite race or sex that's how you're gonna get the lash maybe you get your hand chopped off for me you know whatever punishment in sectional social justice would meat out if given the option that's basically what was like in Saudi Arabia under Isis so it really is in a lot of ways a lot of things we've been talking about today they're very similar and I think these were deep grooves there is the human psyche to it might imagine the kind of person who wants to be the person who enforces that right piece of shit that's why this social justice whereas a piece of shit that's why control freaks yeah control freaks being moral busybodies have got no real morals at all and people who lack a certain amount of objectivity which is why that certain lady you kept talking about earlier feels like she can say those terrible things about you but she commented about herself yeah yeah and ironically everything they're saying is projection I mean who's who's doing the abusing he's doing all of this yeah it's not me you know it's none of this is really true but yeah the Islamic world the the Wahhabis it was really interesting I read force and fanaticism by Simon Ross Valentine English professor who went and lived on Saudi Arabia for three years to learn about their ideology really really really fascinating one of the one of the most fascinating things is how much other Muslims don't like the Wahabis and I'm using the term a hobby but what it's it's a school of Islamic thought called Salafism and it can best be described as autistic screeching it's like taking a really hard line interpretation ignoring other arguments against this hardline interpretation and going you know what just now not even listening and then just carrying on and seeing what that train of logic gets you and suddenly gets too religious police only gets the thrown gaze of buildings it's something that regular Muslims don't need to do because my house you know they'll be like well not pro-gay I mean this is another theory entity but Mohammed says don't kill people you know at one point at some point in the Koran he says and so they kind of say right well I'm not gonna kill someone you know I mean maybe the gay thing was wrong so a lot of Muslims are actually pro-death centers for homosexuality but you know you know they'll have I mean everything's reasoned everything is argumentation right and so the important thing is to understand that they are persuaded into becoming jihad ease and it's not and this is one thing that West has to understand it is not that we reward them right they you can go to Isis's like they produce magazines there was one called dabiq which was a city they owned but they lost it so they created a new one called ramaya which is Rome what they arabic for rome though they have conquered before not isis but islam and want to conquer again and in them they literally say in i can't man i think was like su 14 of dabiq or something they literally turn around and say we do not fight you because you bombed the Middle East we fight you because you are not Muslims and no it's not because you bomb the Middle East even if you stop bombing Middle East we will fight you until you become Muslims this is why we do it don't get me wrong you bombing the Middle East doesn't making us like you anymore you know we're gonna keep doing it we fight you because you insult Mohammed we fight you because you don't believe in allowing this prophet in the last day this is why we fight you do not misunderstand they literally address the liberal other progressives or you know whatever you'd like to call them they're literally talking to these people say don't think that we're crazy we don't know we just this is what we believe you are cancer and we want to explain it externally basically and you you get the s.a.w saying well I mean it's kind of went Boeing the minute me American foreign policy no it's nothing to do with that it's all about the argumentation even if we were just peaceful peace-loving people who did nothing they would still be like well last time you cut your head off me but again this is a small minority who are and widely despised by other Muslims I mean the like for example if you went to a Christian school and everyone would probably felt a chill you know you know you're still going to like you know Catholic school or something and most people you talk to you they'll be fairly chill but in every group of people you'd have a couple of people who'd be the sort of people watching you and if you start doing something they're gonna get the nuns you know they may go whack you know they there they are those people it's just for Islam they end up going and killing things because in Islam you're told right if you if you die and this is another thing that drives me crazy like oh the 9/11 hijackers were drinking and carousing and and doing drugs they're obviously not real Muslims no you fucking idiots they think they're having all of their sins expunged the second they die in the service of Allah this is what martyrdom is no matter what you've done you go to heaven and get your virgins so why wouldn't you do whatever the fuck you like they have a free pass exactly so that's what they do and so and one they're like Oh Isis aren't really Islamic because look at that I do who's an Islamic things know they know they're going to die and well in the logic of the theology that they live under they think that you're their gonna die and that they're gonna get it off rescinded a listen remission of isn't that the most fascinating part of it it's just the things that people are willing to believe been reasoned into it by if you take like say right I believe that the Quran is the word of God and I believe that hadith and the Sun are the actual sayings and doings of Muhammad and you believe these things are true then then you're building from a certain base and you need to and basically it's how you construct arguments and if you start leaving out parts of what otherwise is like a regular Muslim sort of theological argument then you end up building like a weird tower over here this starts going off you know and the arguments are constructed themselves off to the left rather than staying reasonably central I mean like most Muslims are never gonna become terrorists because they don't autistic we believe that a bunch of things just aren't true just because they don't want them to be true you know they don't they're not cherry-picking from the Quran as much as the you know to the extent that these Wahhabist source alle Fister and they all believe in john oh well they they hate that you know what the watchword is it's the dumbest thing in the world what there will be no more innovations what no more innovations Muhammad was the perfect man we must live like Muhammad therefore I mean like you you would not believe how dumb this is you know this is really part of their doctrine yes it's called bida now that'd be ID a I think in my own nature I'm not sure but I don't speak Arabic and the idea is that there are no decision not have any innovation no what about the innovation that they are to use like Toyota trucks yeah like for example the King of Saud had a hell of a time right okay so Saudi Arabia was founded by the eben salled family in conjunction with Abdul Wahab he was a known and in like the late 18th century he was a known theologian and he was he was a brilliant man but he was I can't think about worth putting at the naught is thick because he he was very focused hyper focused on a single sort of shred a strand of thought and everything he thought was either black or white there was no gray in between right and I mean I literally mean he may well have had autism well not just use it as an insult he may well have literally had awesome service out of this or nothing at all you know and so he ends up building this theology and it's not it's not bad well I might no no that's not wrong with some that's not it's not bad it's not that it's not like it's not there isn't an hour in there there obviously must be an argument there otherwise people wouldn't believe it right but you're getting me really confused okay what might be an argument otherwise people won't believe what he's saying his interpretation of the Quran and Islam and you know all of this uh-huh he's got a particular interpretation and he says to someone hey you should follow my interpretation of Islam cuz I'm actually got the right interpretation of Islam okay and and most people were like no you're ignoring almost everything you know and that's fine but what does that have to do with innovation right well that's the thing like bida is hot you know harmful innovations and but and they don't run harmful innovations are bad by definition but there are also good innovations so right you know the telephone you know the cart sort stuff these kinds of good innovations and so other Muslims are free to use them the wahhabis I imagine now at this point they've been persuaded that they are okay but some when like for example even Saud first try to explain them look we need guns and you know we need a maxim gun we planes we need when he bombs and bullets and cars all these now televisions and satellite dishes and on the source thing they were actively resistant to this because they didn't have this and he had these things called i quan warriors I'm probably pronouncing that horribly so apologies anyone who knows how to pronounce these words cuz I've only ever seen written down but these guys were like Isis the the I mean it's the way Saudi Arabia was formed is exactly the same way as Isis as being the Islamic state is being formed now exactly the same these guys were the most brutal men you've ever seen and they were just going in murder entire villages right he had 150,000 of these people like that he used to conquer what is now Saudi Arabia and eventually he was like on a car I think planes a good idea and they were like no no and so they revolted against him and the British seeing him as a useful client decided to help him out with a few Macs and guns if you like you know buy planes or something so they revolted against him because he wanted a car yeah because an Islamic Mohammed had a car right and the British killed milk honestly there's probably a good thing for the world don't get me wrong because these guys were nuts they would regularly just I mean and this the thing that it's another thing they've got is the tech theory doctrine you're not a real Muslim that's an interesting thing isn't it and it's it's interesting how we do that to them we tech fear them you're not a real Muslim either one on a position to tell anyone who's real Muslim or not you know if they can see themselves and they're Muslim and I think they're like literally they are the most Muslim in their poor opinion in their opinion nobody else's a real Muslim and therefore it's ok to kill them you can only you you only have to give a shit about actual Muslims under this doctrine again this is not what most Muslims think this is the antithesis of what most Muslims actually think and so these guys used to making a huge raising have to qualify that like yeah I'd say I know you know the other nutty shit that's not as not as this nutty shit yeah and just just while we're on the subject right Islam is totally in liberal a Western liberal country should never defend Islam in its misdialed very Islamophobic of you exactly and it's absolutely I would never out hate you would hate to live in Sharia law well you might not want not you personally but as a man you would to entirely benefit from living in a sheriff or real house well girls have to walk around like beekeepers right not always that's actually not how do you know what they really that's actually not in the Koran it just says be modest right you don't you know you could just wear head scoffs if you're like an Internet ho Manas tis like trans short yeah and if you're if you're an autistic Isis member that's full-on burka with a grill of your face so that's what's interesting about this application the the thing would be like for example in the legal system directly out of the Koran women a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's legal system in the legal so do they use that legal system like the use the Quran to enforce the laws no it's based on charity so if a woman says something like Sargon raped me and you'd be like bitch we need to do not witness he has to point we didn't you need more than one view with another female witness to testify yeah and even then a woman is entirely entirely possible the judge will punish her for tempting me yeah because like if she has a half an opinion and then the other chickens in half an opinion that's still only like one person's a woman yeah this one's for the whole thing I mean my women are entitled half of the inheritance money a man is entitled to any brothers or your fine obviously but like you've got a male sibling you'll get half of what he goes yeah and this is just like the most mild thing and like the legal system is basically about about as useful as Hammurabi's code of laws where you know an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth I mean that was outdated 2,000 years ago in the West yeah you know with the advent of Jesus but not in this it's really brutal stuff and it's just like okay well I mean any progressive whoever advocates for anything positive about Islam is an idiot and doesn't understand Islam they've got I mean like I've seen them going Islam's the most feminist religion yeah if you want to be made a second-class citizen it is absolutely if that's what you want feminism to be the installation of a systemic oppression against women sure that can be feminism if you like and that really is revealing about feminism isn't it what is going on lately with this weird sort of acceptance of how do you say hey job how do you say that the head here hey John you know offends me more than anything right but what's going on with that there's this we're seeing where women are like being a better coward they're potentially fucked up but they're pretending they're empowered by this and that this is their own choice this is a feminist value I'm really bleep it but it's not very common have you seen it yeah I'm seeing a lot one thing that I've never I never really thought thought of myself as so pastor gets offended but when I see an American flag hijab I find that fence come on they have those oh yeah yeah I don't know I let you know this the antithesis that seems like something a biker would work sounds like a parody but that's really what it is maybe like one of them duck dynasty face maybe maybe I've maybe I've been fooled it's not just the the symbol of Liberty cover yourself up so real Wow cover your fucking hair up you know she is she wearing that to show that she's very American yeah when the saying that he wants to shut down mosques yeah did you see that whole megyn kelly thing with Alex Jones I saw that he scooped but to be fair I mean Alex probably did say hello crazy shit and he probably said little I buy a little crazy shit didn't he well he's in the past he said definitely crazy shit about Sandy Hook yeah and but she was saying he never expected to ever be famous uh I've known Alex a long time it's not that it's just that he's just the Builder buddy he's always looking for conspiracies like when you think you know for sure that something's for sure that something's a conspiracy when you don't really know for sure you're just saying it and then you just run with it when you're talking about children's lives it's very dangerous it's a horrible you better have some bloody convincing proof and he's abandoned it and apologize for saying it he's like the what he's done is like made this sort of like he's sort of like made some some some video where he was talking to the parents directly and saying that he couldn't imagine he feels their pain and I'm terrible for I feel very sorry for your loss but it doesn't go saying I'm sorry I supported a hoax yeah that's not true that says you were liars and your children were never killed yeah you know there's a really crazy story that I read about a guy who was a conspiracy theorist and then his own son was murdered and then he realized holy shit in Sandy Hook he realized like oh my god this is how insane these conspiracy theories are there's people that are that are there's a whole movement right now where they think that polio was a massive hope and that what polio was was them injecting people with the polio vaccine because there was no polio and then injecting them with as a vaccine they hurt all these people as someone who has been fooled before I can tell you the only solution is education you get yeah you can't just you can't just tell these people they're idiots and never talk to them because the other thing we you don't have anything about me with flatiron right yeah exactly flowers you've got engaged with these people I mean that's maybe popular these days weirdly it's like what the fuck do you think the satellites are for why put that Elon Musk thing up and they seen any one last thing I put on inside check this out pull this up Elon Musk posted something about SpaceX you know they're they're they're sure they can shoot something into space now and then land it on a pad they figured out how to do that and so they sped up a sped up version so instead of taking an hour or whatever it takes to get up and get back but check this out like look how beautiful that looks we coming down the earth but then go Quach but why doesn't the world full of joy I don't know the water it does and so watch how this thing lands this is really kind of crazy boom fucking alright yeah that's incredible dude Elon Musk for president Wow I didn't advise politics but I mean that's evil must have built shit it's amazing but look at that fucking video of the earth you saw all these dip shits in the comments I knew it when I played fishbowl Island I was gonna put it up cuz it's awesome yes it's awesome I'm gonna put it up whether or not dip shits think the earth is flat or not but it's you clearly see the fucking circle there's the curve of the earth and there's so many people in the comments like it's CGI it's fake you really believe that bro you're such a sellout sellout bro why do we have satellites what's the point I mean the point is no salads they don't think there's satellites but you can see them launch another nice no no no no they're flying around the planes okay why can't you see the Sun at any time of the day or night why can't you yeah because the Sun goes around behind the Flat Earth like like you're looking for a rational explanation oh yeah but that's the thing isn't it because let's say like vena this is the Flat Earth that ice wall they say about it like it's like a I don't know like a fucking like a spotlight right and it is for some reason rotating around it but it's like well any point I should be able to point over goal and there's the Sun it's just shining downwards you know you have a poor understanding of Flat Earth theory sir I think I probably do I think you're absolutely right but yeah the only way to anyway to get rid of these things is to educate people you can't ridicule right because they're not they're not necessarily being irrational that you dumb but it's like everything else we've talked about what people have an idea in their head and then they dig their heels in the sand and here's the thing once you've publicly said you think the earth is flat and once you've said that like you have to sort of stick with your guns well if you come out and say I'm sorry I'm so stupid I really did believe these fucking idiots on YouTube instead of believing actual astrophysicists actual people who were involved in the fields of cartography airline travel shipping routes i mean jesus fucking christ you can go on and on and on about satellites aerospace engineering all the different people that probably would have to be in cahoots let me tell you about the wall of ice the walls of there's a photo of someone sent to me you fucking the wall it's like it's ten feet high I said shit I watch the video buy something buy something youtuber about the problem man fucking youtubers is a lot it is a part of drama but well he was like why do we believe in a flat earth great I want to know you know that was legitimately vaccines chemtrails actually it was the hope big it was like this it gives us a it's a hope they get it home give them hope like hope beyond the the ice wall the matter land exists and it's like why would it be any better than what we've got now dumb cunts it's not one guy leaked a fucking camera over to that show me the edge showing the outside its what why why and it's a conspiracy to keep in knows what it is people love to know things that other people don't know they love when they uncover truths when there's a secret that someone is hiding about something as monumental as the shape of the earth people love to be the people in the know they love to be hashtag woke mmm-hmm that's what I mean they don't like to read books no no no they don't and I think for some of them though like I mean this guy who saying that it gives us hope and it's like that's because you don't have any hope you need something and you're also no religious person and so you take on this as kind of a religious please no no no you're wrong listen a lot of them are religious that's part of the thing well part of the whole thing is that evolution is a lie that's one of the big parts of Flat Earth theory is that the earth is flat the firmament breaking the condition today yeah man listen there's a big religious part of this whole thing evolution is a lie it's a huge part of the Flat Earth movement is a belief in creationism a belief that whole space is not real and that above us is heaven that we live in a dome no this is there's a lot of different factions to the Flat Earth movement I'm sure yes I have but no this is a big a big part of this is it belief in in creationism oh so it's an American Christian thing oh yeah the ones who believe in it also don't believe in dinosaurs I think dinosaurs are fake this is wonderful right the main guy believes that dinosaurs by the way thinks nuclear bombs are hoaxes yes nuclear bombs are home Oh bomb just a bomb not a big deal just a really sick bomb nuclear it's a hoax this is a massive hoax they spent it's a bomb just a really big dinosaurs or hoax - yeah I believe it bro chemtrails are real though of course they're chemicals probably could be real geoengineering as a thing oh yeah like and so like it could actually be written I could see the rationale from the government's point of view if they're like all the global warming's happening and if we like but extra clouds in the sky then they'll deflect an excessive amount of the sun's rays and cool the earth down well it does do that yeah exactly so but it doesn't mean there's a conspiracy to do that that's why they're stupid oh yeah it's not it's not they're not trying to because they yeah I've seen the chemical thing they think well they're trying to like poison people understand that that's what happens when a jet engine goes through condensation in the air it creates these fake clouds and yes these fake clouds can cool the earth down a little bit and yeah but they're not putting them out on purpose it's just a side effect of air travel like they're making these assumptions based on seeing something the sky thinking someone's spraying some geoengineering thing that was actually something that doing or planning to do there is definitely the possibility of one day us having no real protection or no ozone layer there's a possibility and one of the things that scientists have speculated is that suspending so sort of reflective particles in in our atmosphere like satellites yeah that that would somehow or another protect us from solar radiation something that people have thought of yeah but they're doing but for sure someone has thought about doing if that's the issue if we're missing some sort of an atmosphere I'm gonna kill we created an atmosphere yes we can how would we do it we'd spray chemicals in this guy okay but that's not what you're seeing when you've seen those clouds behind jets it's really simple science yeah the heat of the jet engine yeah Craig them line with a constant yeah the condensation in the atmosphere it creates of a these artificial clouds they look like clouds because they are clouds but to the armchair conspiracy theorist who looks up there like they're spraying us man death spray guy man I might come on defend Alex Jones for a minute I love Alex Jones yeah I know but I mean you know defend him about Sandy Hook no no I'm gonna defend about the frogs what about the frogs it's true they are turning the frogs yeah oh they turn frogs you know I was really ironic as well the globalists are tending the frogs game well there is I mean I'm actually being literally serious right in that well there's pollution yeah yeah pollution actually does make the fries its corporate malfeasance and it's only a certain kind of frog and a certain kind of pesticide I actually read through the study has you played my video on this channel before my video was on my old channel got taken down by a man your channel got taken down that's the it was just a little ship hosting channel door about it but I'm the jet post each hour we just poke ball shown there Oh bullshit I found funny and one of the funny thing was looking into this study Alex Jones a sighting so I thought I'd go and get the study actually read it and he's right kind of right here for example these people are actually globalist it's like a multinational corporation people who are actually open borders they are prone borders they're pro pro in a corporate influence around the world because they run a giant corporation the chemicals they're putting in the water technically were actually he wasn't even going far enough these chemicals were making the frogs trans like it would for 90 percent of the frogs and it was only a certain chemical certain pesticide and it was affecting a certain kind of frog so any it doesn't make em trans well I I don't know the process obviously I'm not a scientist but like but I mean for 90% of them fine well it literally for 90 percent of the frogs that were touched some of that Alva after dinner check the numbers but for a large for the majority of the frogs touched it would make them behave in like the feminine wave male frogs it make them behave in a feminine way and for 10 percent of the frogs touched by this chemical it would actually set them through a process to transform into a fertile female frog holey shirt so wasn't make him gay it was literally making trans right that's not even trance right but that's literally like changing your your actual sex yeah yeah it's literally like transitioning into an actual female that's actually first also has been for human beings but there's this this was actually a real thing it wasn't like an intentional plan to try and turn people into gays or trans or whatever though and it wasn't it was done by people who are globalist probably but it wasn't that as part of a nefarious plots it was young because it was cheaper to just dump the chemicals you know obvious and it was just it's just it's just ironic own Alex Jones says you know the the globalists are putting chemicals into water than make France gay well you he's right well you know during Desert Storm there was a project that they put together where they were trying to figure out a gay bomb yeah you know about that like these soldiers were about stuff like well okay I'm not feeling very horny but no just I don't like men they would they would blow this stuff in the air blow it up and it would land down on them and it would transfer them and to gay people and they would be so ashamed if they would stop fighting and lose morale this was a real consideration I spent millions about the Greeks didn't they yeah exactly these guys were fearsome League a family that was a superpower Thebans scientists developed gay bomb to make enemy soldiers stop fighting and make love do-do-do-do-do-do scientists at Wright laboratory in Dayton Ohio working to make America's military even mightier made the discovery in 1994 according to the detailed pasted papers on earth through a Freedom of Information request and last night they were finally rewarded with in what is that IG IG rlg ignoble awards a Nobel Prize for Peace a spoof of the Nobel Prize okay due to be announced next week mark Abraham's editor of the annals of the improbable research and the man behind the ignoble awards explained we don't know if this document was aren't an end of it or whatever in fact this project continued and perhaps continues to this day santé so to this day they might be working on a gay bomb do you think Trump puts a stop to that he doesn't necessary spending he's Pro gay though more gays too complicated to change people what if a regular guy like him gets bitten by that spider I really like the gay spider do you know about how that tick that turns people into vegans tick you bite this tick bites you and you develop a meat allergy Oh ready yep it's called the lone Star tick where they live where they live probably Texas because it's called the long start a I shoulda guessed right but I think they're spreading I think it's but it would be ironic if it was in like the meat eating capital of the world Lone Star tick making people urge ik to red meat I need to fuck out of some chicken now I'll tell you that directly was engineered by the government I just think it's the nature deciding we're tired of their bullshit look it's been recorded as far north as Maine and all the way to Central Texas and Oklahoma Wow the ticks are found in the dense undergrowth and wooded areas as well as around animal resting areas you know I've been thinking about this man because I run in the hills where this ticks I saw it tick like re and I did a podcast the other day that we were released on July 18th which is the day that Ari's Netflix special comes out but we did a podcast where we went on a hike and I put on a weighted vest and we went through the woods and did the whole thing that I do when I run and a tick landed on re and we knocked it off and then we started talking about it and like going like is there a way to stop ticks from coming on you is there like an effective do they have a spray like ticks are not like mosquitoes right no is there an effective tick spray no idea should know do you're so smart know that ticks there's tick repellent oh there is how effective it is though hmm yeah mosquito repellant doesn't always work I get there the fucking works I get blue you know what works thermos el you reuse a thermos el oh man I don't know if it's bad for you but it's amazing don't you know that this thermos sells in a piece of equipment that people take on hikes and camping and hunting yeah kid it's there's this chemical that screws into the bottom and then it has an element you click it and Heat's on and it makes this fine mist through this element and this fine mist it doesn't smell bad to people but mosquitoes cannot fuck with it well they just did just vanish like what is it it's not poisonous to long time I don't know man that's the problem yeah I don't want to be doing this and then five years later you got dementia and yeah shit some things I can't remember so I wait for them yeah what about human oh no I definitely have it but I went looking did you yeah I did a whole TV show about it yeah did you well I did this show that I used to do on the Sci Fi Channel that made me this has get made a lot of people mad at me and it also made me realize what conspiracy theories really were all about and the show was called Joe Rogan questions everything so I would go and I would embed myself with these people and hang out with them and I embedded myself with these Bigfoot people and what I said at the end of it was here's one thing that you don't find when you go looking for Bigfoot black people you're more likely to find Bigfoot than you are black people for Bigfoot unfuckable white guys out camping it's a goofy white obsession it's also um there's no one that I talked to this like one lady that had a pretty good story she believed what she was saying but here's the thing black bears are huge and they you know you can get a black bear at seven feet tall easily and they walk on their hind legs sometimes they just do everybody knows they do there's video of them it's not a mystery okay black bears walk through the woods on hind legs or seven feet tall you'd think that's Bigfoot this is really just telling myself upside down I mean there's if there's no Bigfoot but the earth is flat will do I believe well I don't think the earth is flat either I think it's a just everything's a lie man this is all sigh ah that's it the Bigfoot thing it there are so many like pretty convincing stories that's the thing the first one sorry I haven't heard one of them well convincing story of Bigfoot no I've had loads well they're like you know I was I was like you know five feet away from and it's like you know you say and it didn't have you know it didn't know better I said a man's face I know you known it was it was looking at me and stuff like this is that okay but nobody's ever got a good picture of a new things you know yeah nobody really goes to the woods on a regular other than Les Stroud Survivorman he believes it yeah thanks one but there are never any bodies there's never any feces I've heard bears make a fucking monkey noise - I heard him say that he's like it made it sound like primate sound but I've heard I've seen in my own eyes in the woods a bear do that with another bear yeah they make that when they fight with each other yeah it must be bad it must be because I mean you can't have like you can't have like a species of Australopithecus or whatever it is supposed to be gigantic so yeah giganticus whatever is supposed to be and just like I mean doing wrong is America's a huge place you would find something you find a dead one or something after a while there's enough people looking but the thing is when they found out that like the about that Hobbit guy do you know the halitosis yeah I know yeah island of Flores yeah in Indonesia they found within the last fourteen thousand years there was absolutely a little person that was like two and a half three feet long yeah but they look a hundred percent human oh this thing's did not look 100% human it was a new car it was another type or an offshoot yes classified yet I don't know it's a relation of humility yes it's a type of human them but it's not Neanderthal and it's not Homo Sapien and this thing was 14,000 years ago so they know that Gigantopithecus was a real animal man it lived on hundred one hundred percent yeah alongside human beings as recently as 100 thousand years ago okay but this this is just nonsense those big four thing well that orang pendeks is much more interesting the orang pendeks is a small hobbit like man that lived I think that might have been Indonesia as well but Vietnam maybe it's Vietnam well I think it's these some of these tropical jungle climates where there might have been as recently as you know 100 years ago or whatever there might have been a few of those fuckers raining they don't know I mean when someone dies in the woods man you know how many people we lose in the United States loads thousands every year that I watched David Pilates all the time on like art bell and stuff oh yeah I think he's great he's I love these like such clean coal American guy and he never gives them to like the wild conspiracy theory angle of it but it's it's it's always hinting that well that was a never it's like Bobcat Goldthwait made a movie about Bigfoot eating people oh wow it's a great move everything it's called Willow Creek it's a horror movie modulation Bobcat Goldthwait made a horror movie dude he made a great horror movie it's like a sort of like one of those Blair Witch Project Titan movies about a couple that go up looking for Bigfoot you know it's just a film like where the original Patterson footage was taking place yeah it's a person people love they want to believe this person to fucking say Bobcat once please but what yeah but why do they put tits on the same because it's a girl anybody looks like a person to suit it I said whenever you see something that looks like a person whose suit it's a person a suit yeah there's not a fucking animal I just know the conversations I like if we if we get a male so and they mean it's gonna look like person to suit but if we get a female suit they can be like why would they put it on it welcome a real big for a dead female because a female be smaller being an eight-foot-tall thing you get a six-foot-tall thing that's like a regular size dude with some nice tits you know like it's chick bro meanwhile it's a big guy I mean like I love the Bigfoot like I love the breakdown videos all over YouTube the great and it's always like that a student suit there was a WikiLeaks that was just released today about NASA knowing about aliens ready yes pull it up Jamie NASA knows about aliens they have in WikiLeaks knows and they're gonna spill the beans I tell you when it comes out tomorrow that it really is true and then there's like an alien ambassador a little White House lawn honestly gonna be like oh okay I was a you look like a proud oh it's anonymous I thought it was no leaks oh not it was much more likely to be pranksters yeah yeah much more like anonymous a global hacking collective believes that alien life exists and thanks NASA is about to confirm it the shadowy group oh yeah I love that it's a shot of Altis that you can be in you could join oh I have you know no I mean I'm into exactly you know twelve and a half minute video published an unofficial YouTube channel on Tuesday the video centers around recent findings by the American space organization including the discovery of 219 new planet candidates ten of which present similar conditions to Earth by NASA's Kepler space telescope team in June as well as comments made by a senior NASA official but here's the real thing right you believe and I believe as well that it's entirely possible that some life exists somewhere in the infinite universe I can't believe it doesn't of course I mean we're on the same patch why are we so skeptical about skeptical about it visiting us this is very difficult to visit right but if it's like way more advanced than us shouldn't be able to figure it out just like we could figure out how to get a probe to Jupiter but why can't I figure out how to visit but then we've got government conspiracy and coverup do we or are they just people and they don't know any more than you or I like we don't know shit why would the what if aliens came here do you think they would like go oh that's an elected official clearly that guy is the mayor let me talk to him no they'd look at this fucking anthill and they'd be like which one of these dipshit should we tell I don't know it just picked that guy up it sticks him stuff up his ass and run some tests on him we got a friends online forever and I've got a counter-argument to that we can we can distinguish between from one item to another we see the workers we can see the soldiers we can see the Queen they can they can tell they would surely be smile yeah wieners physically shaped different they're different things like this big one makes all the bay it's pretty obvious that a queen baby she has a giant stinger that doesn't detach and she goes and kills all the baby bees what can't they speak English they probably can yes mr. president the blood are we have to think that if something is alien that it could be so alien that all of our concepts of culture are so bizarre that there's no context for it to relate how can they understand a language they just know what we're saying it's fairly if they can understand our language then they must have relatable similar concepts in the road or no translation necessary language that's not necessarily true that's putting them into a limitation that we currently have like we understand dolphin language but we know they have a language we can we can appreciate the dolphins probably have a concept for eating like if the dolphins in terms of like who's the queen who's the mayor hierarchal you know they'll have like an alpha dolphin and people the dolphins will have some like you know clicks that mean the person in charge I mean they must have some concept of hierarchy because they have a concept Farzin operate under right but you don't really understand dolphin language well no but I mean we can surely pick out like the concepts themselves I mean they must understand the concept you know there are they just continents and the concept of later I don't think it is widely understood what dolphins are saying dolphin to human we can't even recreate it no no I'm sure that I mean we can't recreate their sounds like we don't know what their sounds mean maybe if we set a bunch of shit to a dolphin like I'm not saying we can talk to dolphins or anything but like like with with a dog you know you can dogs have got certain kinds of and very very primitive methods of communication but like a dog whimpers you know it's in pain right you know and so I have to have a concept of being a being in pain to understand the dogs go hmm I know that that means the dogs hurt I must understand that the concept of hurts right and so if the aliens if they can understand English and then to understand the concept of what president is or they must and they must have sort of the same way of analyzing they for sure if they can take you know superior to us yeah well if not superior technologically far more advanced yeah in in that they've been alive longer but when you consider the possibility of all sorts of different weather conditions different life conditions maybe different solar systems where they have zero concern about being hit by an asteroid always bipedal yeah because they're supposed to represent us yeah in the future surely late to I think it's a relatable that could be that too but that was my point is that I think that aliens could potentially be so alien that they can't even relate to the concept of our ability to communicate with noises yeah like they might be fair with smells yeah exactly they might be using some telekinesis or some shit psychics man yeah maybe yes so do you think if you had a bet all of your YouTube money very much i've alien will be gentle okay aliens been here or no i probably been no no i mean a lot of the ancient alien stuff it's total bullshit yes whole horse shit that stuff is really fits mosquitoes I'm looking it's Graham Hancock Randall Carlson mode of there being an ancient very advanced civilization that probably was wiped out just like we know there have been civilizations that were wiped out it's much more likely that someone like say in Machu Picchu someone was able to construct things you know that we're like really confusing classes today yeah it wouldn't come from a new world it's really interesting because as soon as you start going down this line you think I care what do you need to have high civilization you need some series of things and there are a bunch of books you can read - mmm abundance of food agriculture it's not just nice so you need a lot more than that as well but like he's you you can you can read a Thomas Waller thing as wealth power or poverty and politics coming but and why nations fail and what's the guns generous deal yes red gun please do you read these books and there's something you understand what what populations need around three-quarters of it I should be honest it's really good it's it but you know there's a whole slew of things you need as a civilization for humans to develop to high this sort of standards right you know population density and on this or thing and so but it's not just population densities lots of other places that have high population densities so in Africa for example you've got very few areas that have high population density and so you don't have great civilizations like in sort of sub-saharan Africa because there just aren't great cities dense cities to trade with and then and then you get here well what they had is difficult rakers in Africa and this is something Thomas all goes into is that look the rivers very navigable you know they've got lots of Rapids lots of rocks they're not very deep you can't carry huge barges down they're not like the they don't like the Danube right you know this thing goes for you know hundreds of miles and is deep and you can get barges all up and down it and stuff like this I mean and traveling traveling goods by water is so much more efficient like you know like 20 times more efficient than trying to take them over the land right and so if you don't have specially free large machine yes and so you'd need that innovation or to create the large machines in the first place exactly and and you need someone to take it I'm not trading with anyone if there's if you're the one like Atlantean civilization no one else is buying your gear yeah right like it's it's it's all horseshit it just couldn't happen based on what you need for this thing to actually end up existing right in order for at last to exist you really have which is more likely that there were some sophisticated civilizations that were hit by asteroids of evidence for that there's a lot of iridium yeah there's a lot of actually physical evidence yeah there's also the stuff another glass well it's the best evidence cuz the video comes from space you know iridium when you find it in large quantities indicates an asteroid will impact iridium is very common in space and extremely rare on earth so when there's a whole sediment layer of iridium it's almost entirely proof that's when it was hit by something wouldn't there be some sort of ruins underneath this and yeah they found a lot of rooms and this is what really fascinating about how old Gobekli Tepe is 12,000 plus years old oh yeah but let them get that didn't die because it was hit by an asteroid well they this is what Graham Hancock and Randall come up with it speculating that was really primitive okay you don't know that but before we go in it's a massive huge stone columns of a 90 feet tall some colonists don't know that our hunters and gatherers it's pretty impressive you know for the thing but it's not like a technological achievement well okay what is a pretty impressive Machu Picchu impressive it's pretty impressive right that's not very alter well it's thousands couple thousand years old object 1,400 okay I don't think that's true and I don't think they know that for a fact and this is one of the speculations that Graham Hancock and Randall cross would have presented is that the evidence of this nuclear glass which only exists on impact sites before you go to your phone listen to me so you can understand what I'm saying impact sites where meteors hit or where they've done nuclear tests so they found this stuff and micro-diamonds evidence of massive impacts when they do core samples they found it at 10 and 12,000 years which is essentially the same time period as the end of the ice age did a huge podcast on it with geologists they don't know though here's the thing when you talk to an expert this is pure speculation there's no carbon dated evidence that points to that age you can where as there is with the Sphinx so with the Sphinx or excuse me with the Great Pyramids the great period of Giza they've done some tests on some of the sediment and some of the stuff in between the stones and they brought it to about 2500 BC and found like great specifically yeah they found a bunch of stuff that shows without with a very high high degree of possibility or probability that it's around 2500 BC yeah what they've done with this we haven't seen the massive impacts yeah with Giza right yeah but there's a width um rather around the great parent yeah but there's there's plenty of evidence that there was some sort of a massive eventually around 10,000 and 12,000 years ago and what their belief is that this is all the stories of Atlantis come from this is where all these stories of these great civilizations that were wiped out come from is that most likely we experienced a big die-off and a lot of people were affected by these disasters and catastrophes that coincided with asteroid Olympics maybe but I mean we know where the stories of Atlantis come from Plato right but he gone to Egypt and and been taught this but it's all I mean it's not like a real thing it's not I mean he he said he had 9,000 years before the present and that they but the thing is then he was that's what's crazy is this does coincide with the time of the impact for example 9,000 years ago there wasn't in Egypt you know from Plato's you know from like 2,500 years ago from now like 500 BC 9,000 years before that there was no Egypt there was no Athens and yet the story involves them that's not necessarily true either Robert Schoch was a geologist out of Boston University has done a lot of investigation on the the temple that the Sphinx was carved out of were they the Sphinx is the walls of the temple and he believes it's from water erosion there's this these fissures and these deep erosion marks that they believe indicate that the temple of Sphinx or the area that's carved out of is far older than the same like they know that the Great Pyramid of Giza is 2500 BC yeah but they always attribute the Sphinx of being the same timeline dr. Robert Schoch from Boston University says that's not the case he said what you're looking at is thousands of years of rainfall and they have hundreds of geologists that have signed off on this this is not like and there's he goes over the physical evidence of these fissures and how they're made he's like as a geologist I can tell you you are looking at thousands of years of rainfall the last time there was serious rainfall in the Nile Valley was about 7,000 BC so what he's saying is it's entirely possible that there have been many different civilizations that lived in this area and that Egypt is a civilization that might have gone back many many thousands of years longer than just the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza I wasn't talking about the Great Pyramid of Giza really but that's Egypt well no that's just a monument in Egypt right but Egypt is a place that did exist ten thousand years ago twelve thousand years ago because I like is but don't say no it didn't because you don't really know well no well but you're saying no it didn't so you are you in Egyptology do you lose on the ground and talk to the people over there we don't really know right well you don't know what I'm about say but you said no it didn't well you believe this state of Egypt okay okay like as all right I'm not saying they want people living in the area there undoubtedly would have been people living in the area right but I was calling it Egypt you're saying yeah they would know when did they start calling in Egypt oh I'd have to look that up I don't know but they like we we can tell archaeologists can tell like like when when of grains were first domesticated and things like this and you're never gonna have a state without farming you're never gonna have right you're not gonna have like a hunter-gatherer state where they have a government and you need a surplus of food to be able to support pre-term priestly class layers of bureaucratic class right so you and to get something built you need these things right which I mean not necessarily carving out stone like if you're gonna build a pyramid yes you need these things maybe carving his things that's something tribesmen could do you know Bell Tepe out of his plans to go back link the a chemically that I can easily believe that like you know nomadic hunter-gatherers you know they could they could have craft legs basically sanding and chipping a stone well they moved them to yeah these are huge chunks of stone that were done back when they didn't have a surplus of resources this is the hunters and gatherers but the I mean I'm not saying it wasn't like a monumental achievement you know for the time and the resources it obviously was but we we know that they weren't farming well might be right about that but we might not be right you're talking about an incredibly long time ago 12,000 years ago is a long time and whatever evidence would be left is really probably being absorbed by the earth by now maybe but I mean we can't sit there in speculate about something that might happen if we've gone about but that's exactly what we're doing if we're saying that they were definitely hunter and gatherers we don't know we do know the sums but we do know is they were capable of making these incredibly massive complicated structures 12,000 years ago for sure is the Sphinx in incredibly messy but now I'm talking about that we're talking about gobekli tepe but yeah this big it's fucking huge and for you to say that it's very disturbing because they've only uncovered five percent of it or ten percent it's massive the probe you don't know a lot about it but you're automatically jumping to this but you haven't if you didn't think that's the problem but you're so convinced in your argument but you're not really that you really spent a whole lot of time thinking about the coughing stone man that's not very it's not just carving stone there are we to stern with three-dimensional objects in the stone meaning like lizards that are on the outside of it 19-foot halls tooks tall stone columns and concentric circles is there huge structure technology today it does to move those things look at the image on the far right that's what they have figured out so far by using radar underground look at the size of this in primitive it's just stone it's not that primitive for someone to make something out of it sorry impressive in primitive it turnbull like they don't have a TV is that what you mean isn't like like for example I'm sure if the I'm sure if they went and did some sort of I can you know I super high-resolution scans or something like that they blow right here this has been carved with other stone tools you know they can tell there's because of copper tools or whatever this that won't have been carved by stack op tools you know we know they don't even know that when it comes to the Great Pyramid in fact there's a lot of people speculate they figured out a way to make some sort of a diamond-tipped late drill in order to make the the King's Chamber and some of the sarcophagus it's not friends they don't really know how they carved out some of the stone in that there's a simple there's a simple Vaz in Egypt they don't understand because it's carved completely out of one piece of stone but it's so intricate and so hard that they've made this incredibly thin lip on this Vaz and they've gone deep inside of it and the whole thing is entirely smooth they really don't know how the fuck they did it probably some paper rubbing patience they can't get your fingers inside of this thing I'm talking about an actual Vaz yeah it's very very confusing to modern archaeologists this is not like engine anyway I don't know but I was talking about what I'm saying but what is an ancient advanced civilization like don't you agree to the Parthenon on the Acropolis that's an advanced civilization particularly for the time for what they for what they accomplish is amazing it's a great massive stones that are cut in place the beautiful century okay well then what civilization if that's not addition to as a the glorification of Athens over its empire right right it was not that these things didn't already exist it's that he wanted to make Athens look special in the eyes of the rest of the way but what do you can I just what I'm confused like what year did this happen and when do you consider people to know there's about one before price DP civilization come on man if that didn't exist anywhere years ago yeah but 10,000 years ago something like something like the Parthenon and the Acropolis if we could prove that 10,000 years before anybody had done anything else that that existed you'd be blown away by that right yeah shocking yeah stunning the path or maybe 10,000 BC that would be incredible right right would be great but a bunch of upright stones have been nicely carved to have the animals on them and stuff like that that's just that massive stones 19 feet tall in concentric circles all in this struggle Stonehenge in Broome we know how they made it we know where the stones came from I know haven't gotten there you're one of those dudes well you're one history that no not just read history because you don't know anything about gobekli tepe and yet you're so you you're adorable you keep going with these things you really don't even know anything about this area and yet your hunters and gatherers there's a lot of argument one way or the other about that it's entirely possible that they had discovered farming I guess I mean that that's the area that farming was that is part of the problem right when you get this 12,000 years ago who knows what the fuck that's the end of the Ice Age isn't it and we think they new things and then we find out that they knew more you know when Martha is mostly covered in ice how could you get an advance it was heart of the earth yes mostly covered in ice like when you're dealing with North America right north as you go big parts of it right but on the south - yeah I mean we're what do they think Turkey was like back then because this is where gobekli tepe is in Turkey what they think Turkey was like 12,000 years ago and the problem is of that if they can carbon-dated absolutely to 12,000 years ago they know it was covered up it was intentionally covered yeah 12,000 years ago this is the story of Gobekli Cathy um when was it constructed that they don't know because stone you can't carbon date like the way they did it with the Egyptian pyramids they got the material in between each stone so I can completely you know like say many maybe thirty thousand years ago twenty thousand years ago I could I could believe in a certain area of the world that a bunch of tribesmen who hunter-gathering maybe maybe seasonally nomadic you know for a hundred years you know maybe you know there's a religious duty they considered it to be I mean that let's think Stonehenge was built over a period of like like thousand years I mean it took a long time to just put these fucking stones right you know so I mean we don't know how long this would have taken but to have a bunch of carved stones upright even if they're big that just requires more people that that's not a great technological feat that's the thing it's nobody's attacked and logically denying the Acropolis like it is not a technological feat it was a technological feat but it wasn't particularly unique to the world at the time in fact the Persians and the Babylonians and Assyrians they've been doing for thousands years before that the Greeks were catching up when what doesn't that then support the idea that Gobekli Tepe is even more unique because it wasn't that is an advanced civilization then well no well yeah I mean it's advanced for the rest of the world but it's it's pretty advanced for today if we wanted to build something like today would take massive resources it would take huge machines it would take a gigantic group of engineers that's a huge project I mean you mean out of convenience right that's messing that even though is it out of convenience when you get 19 foot tall stones that are because you don't really get loads in a people zoom in a circle I mean it's a lot of work of course this yeah that's why we'd use machines it's not as simple as you just use machines like you'd have to get very specific massive machines that are incredibly difficult and trays and these people did that without any of that shit yeah they do pretty logs the prominent pulleys actually believe ropes and logs who knows how the fuck they did it that's what we're supposed to be there was no wheel back then no probably wasn't that's pretty spectacular yeah yeah okay yeah okay so let me so I'm not trying to take away the amount of effort involved in building this thing and the willpower to do it and the manpower to do it what are you trying to say there's not an indicative of advanced civilization what when I think I think it's a definition of advanced for example like I would consider an advanced take a civilization path writing I would consider them to have metallurgy I would consider and the I wouldn't even call this advanced this mean this is this is this puts them this puts them where we were 4000 years ago you know as a species so advanced is like assuming it's all it's all well yeah well I mean it's all relative isn't it so it's like I mean what I mean yeah I mean if you want if if you want to speculate them up in a civilization like pre Ice Age or during the Ice Age that had writing and metallurgy and you know great cities and international trade agriculture that's all the sort of stuff that we would if you look at the Roman Empire we see if we take them as the model of an advanced civilization right but when I say advanced we mean not as advanced as we are now very modern right right well that's what everyone speculates about Atlantis as well no one ever thinks that it was like today they think some crazy things some people really oh yes some people some people are yeah but yeah this is we should have been more specific but yeah I mean I'm sure that for the time like when a runner Brandon tribe came over the hill and they saw a Buckley tepee and it was incredible ah the gods have built this you know that's what they would thought I'm sure you know to them it would have relatively been incredible you know I'm doing wrong and I don't take away the achievement for the people who made it because it's unbelievably good you know especially for the time but like if if they didn't have like Mel tools didn't have writing they didn't have agriculture I wouldn't call that advanced I just call that a loss of work for a primitive civilization and the same way this Stonehenge would have been the real problem is we don't really know what they had and until more evidence gets uncovered they're just guessing they have some carbon dating they know that the stones exist they don't even know I mean they didn't even know about this until 1990 something I mean they found it in the 90s yeah but I mean that all over Northern Europe there's stone circles henges me yeah well they find more of those now than ever before with satellites right yeah they're finding now in the Amazon you know like what the fuck is this they're finding all these structures and channels and yeah well that's the loss you know about that right there's a there was a guy who went looking was an explorer went looking for the lost city of Z in the Amazon it was like a mythical lost city and he got eaten by cannibals apparently there's some movie that's coming out about him right now that's racist no privilege it was um it was speculated that before the M well that's the other thing that came out recently the Amazon was covered in an ocean somewhere around ten million years ago or someplace oh yeah but they think that these people had some sort of you know for the time again what is an advanced civilization yeah they probably needs to be defined yeah I think that's the first stuff but yeah I mean like this interesting sale of it isn't the path London advancing no no really you know it was a beautiful thing it has a great construct and it cost the Athenians a lot of money and they did it to beautify the city and make it the jewel of Greece but it wasn't like what's more impressive is it's more they did for political reasons the Parthenon is built the speed ramblas they did it the Acropolis is what's a really a trip what it's cuz giant fucking chunks of stone they have no it you know how big they are yeah open they're huge like what they don't even know why they're there there weren't even built at the same time the Acropolis is just a natural stone formation not necessarily there's stones under that natural stone that like the the the actual platform that the Parthenon was built on existed before the Parthenon right I'm not sure it follow what you saying it because as far as I'm aware they quickly the crapple it's just a large stone formation then they I guess they must have level it office on something but then there's actual physical stones actual monstrous physical stones that are involved and Moltar and cesium so up Jeff oh let's see if you could find that there's a bunch of the other all like what's the thing in Malta where they thought it was like build by cyclopses or something giant so he's like three thousand years be cities that Baalbek no that's in Lebanon there's Baalbek in Lebanon they found these enormous stone carved things yeah but yeah see those stones which one's the there's there's some stones if you could find some images of the yeah some of it does from that side I'm pretty sure that's just a natural stone up I mean I mean this sort of like fortifications around it you know you can probably do ghulam find out mmm put up is put on a sixteenth century or something you know there's nothing mystical about the Parthenon it's just a really useful defensive fortification will not missed a call to saying ancient I think they are the speculation is that the the crop which one's the Acropolis not as bottoms the Parthenon to the top know the powerful know is only Acropolis the Parthenon is on the top and the Acropolis is on the bottom that's what I'm saying that they the thing that they think okay all together yeah and the part that I was just a building yeah right okay the Putnam was a temple and so when you say the Acropolis the Parthenon is Kontest cities had an Acropolis which is just a raised rocky bit that they built you know so find out where when I read that see if he could Google man-made stones in the Acropolis there was some sort of weird speculation that the Acropolis was a part of some structure that was far older than the Parthenon oh not not not persuaded by Russell that's a bit fringe stuff for me you're not into friendship not when it comes to history I like to know accurate stuff you know ya know makes sense it's just fringe is always more attractive though it's interesting isn't it yeah because you never know and there's like oh you might be able to find out for yourself but it's also like undeniably it has gravity yeah towards me at least I love the old stuff they're like no no what they found out man they were werewolves you know there's always like something that you find out yeah I I went through all of this in my 20s right I went through literally all of these family bloomer they're really all right you'll end up eventually where I am oh I definitely wanna end up where you are you will you know they are you know it's it's a good place to be it's um you go through all of these fairies and you're dismiss things no you don't immediately dismiss things then you have to start reading about why things happened that's the thing you have to start reading the source to build the bill the Parthenon right but that's also why you just just flippantly decided because already tapi was small yeah well no no it's not the size of it's irrelevant it's the sort of technological advancement you know it doesn't take much to carve stone they still you know just other stone to break against and then it's smooth at the hands of sand you know it just took a lot of work for a long time and I mean dang wrong must been fucking Athena get out hide a leather and put sand on it you can spend ages smoothing out stone do it yourself if you like it's fucking boring you know but I guess we've got nothing else to do all day because you're a place right here Jamie but that's not carved that's like uh this is bass relief I believe it oh wow this is what most of the art gobekli tepe was it was like yeah yeah it's a 3d and moved away not carved into right yeah that's what was interesting about it's more difficult I mean I don't want to take anything away from the artist because that must've been a lot of work what was the man-made stones in the Acropolis finding that there was evidence of these enormous chunks of rock that were moved my be conflating Baalbek in Lebanon with the Acropolis it's all fascinating to me because we don't know we just don't know what these people are up to and we see what they left behind we pieced it together and people studied it for thousands of years and it's just it's amazing just I mean you I'm sure you've been to Rome right you haven't right so my list the Colosseum is fairly recent right you know the yeah I mean in terms of like ancient civilizations a very recent but it's it's so crazy when they show you the history of it how they used to that whole thing was like Nero's backyard I mean that's really well and then they sided to once they into bad yeah well then then decided to build this this thing to sort of entertain the masses yeah and this thing has gone through all these different various stages and when they show you all the different things they used to do they're like have these boat fights where they would water and they would raise these lions all these animals through the bottom of the cage and they would fight against I'm like you fucking crazy and not that long ago yeah yeah I mean like people you speak brutal let's think people forget is like what we're talking about Isis they still are yeah well they are but but now I mean that shocks and is well you know to most people but I mean like in like the 15th century 16th century kids used to do cock fighting you know they they do it here in Mexican and Mexican everybody yeah I'm just watching these chickens killing one of my old dumb this guy that he's to use as a gardener like six seven years ago he stood cockfight no no sympathy no compassion for anything that wasn't human basically was like gold definitely not for chickens yeah they put razor blades on them they would spurs on them they fight each other yeah it's fucking crazy yeah they went to this guy's already had like a hundred roosters in these like pens and they would have this carved out area and a pit and let the roosters go it's super common it's super common in many parts of the world in fact it's really common in the south of America not South America but south of the United States it's it's real common like cock fights it's not thought of the same way as like dog fights like dog fights horrified people yeah but chicken fights people like yes their arms the afterwards maybe the dog well still they still do bullfights in Spain they do all the amazing it's pretty comfortable these days they just lost another Matador a couple days ago you got fucked over his own cape tripped over the cape got Jack yeah you get torn apart no since he was well no no it's a foolish way to you wanted it to die and risk your life and the whole thing is crazy but a Spain is an advanced civilization well I've known too many Spaniards how dare you in general there are modern Western civilization and they have bullfighting yeah do you know what's really funny about Spanish Spanish because I mean like in America you've got a terrible history right we have a terrible history of being terrible that we're saying yeah yeah yeah okay so the Spanish Spanish history is highly Islamophobic obviously and I won't spend a few years ago and everything everywhere it's a white guy killing a Muslim on every portrait on every oh yeah yeah because they spent 800 years kicking the Muslims out of Spain because the Muslims came along and conquered Spain and so everything is totally Islamophobic because that is their history they can't get away from it they wouldn't be a Spain because the Maus came over and conquered it and they were like right everyone's a Muslim now are you gonna have to pay the jizya you're gonna be a dhimmi and they were like no they spent 800 years whatever loss resistance or whatever they the Spanish before it would be like you know just the Reconquista and it took several Crusades it took you know hundreds and years of gallons of blood but eventually Spain became Christian again and then and the Muslims and they're like the the Islam of files will sit there and go oh well you know how Andaluz yeah they was stolen from someone else and these people took it back I've got no fucking sympathy for these people who got kicked out who came in originally and won't even supposed to be there I'll tell you what the Muslims are fucking lucky that Columbus discovered a new world because the Spanish were basically will roll up all of North Africa I was gonna they were planning to take it all fucking back because this was all Christian it really annoys me that people are all know that's Muslim know wasn't and it's because they took it and so if the Spanish you're gonna take it back that's just as valid you don't have an argument against them doing it yeah once something's been established though we don't want you taking it back oh yeah I'm not just seeing now of nationalism but I know I know justing it but it still yeah but like you know when we're looking back at history through the lens of having a moral judgement about it and the Spanish kick the Muslims of Spain yeah good for them they have every right to you can't really have moral judgments about history what people do this whole time yeah I mean like the Crusades like Jimmy Dore there's nothing less no Chris I shut the fuck up Jimmy you do not know what you're talking about just shut up Jane stop talking at the Crusades Oh unless I tell you what you're right let's call them back bring back the crusading armies let's call it Baldwin Baldwin of Jerusalem come on you're gonna have to come home you come on Baldwin this is wrong we shouldn't be creating Oh what that ended 800 years ago but done conversation over it pisses me off man they keep bringing up the shit absolution but what about the Crusades what about the fucking Crusades where are the Crusaders Genk where the fuckin crusade are you talking to JQ I'm sure he knows they're talking when you say his name but I'm saying you're saying it just because you don't know you know a lot of people don't do you know I do know how do we get out of bullfighting - this cultural relativism basically look like things that happen in the past we don't have to apologize for right you know these things just happened we don't need to do things but don't you think white people should apologize for all the horrible things that we've done what about the Native Americans should we apologize to them I think that if they're prepared to apologize to the people they genocide it well that's you're going a little too far hope it don't exist anymore no you go too far back that's a problem who decided like once we have done that we've trespassed on their land you don't bring up them doing it because that we're gonna be Native American of favor yes it's not our place yeah it's our place yeah see this the whole thing it's all bollocks and then this whole relativism they piss enough and it really actually makes me angry none of them will ever listen to the light of the counter-arguments it's really annoying and so she's like no like you know nobody's got any respect for you when you turn around see a board above the Crusades that's the I mean what a battery is the dumbest damn thing anyway because you never addressing the point it's like you didn't even give a context we you know there's you know and they they for some reason think that Christianity is as bad as as long as I know it's not I mean like the Crusades were distinctly on Christy and I supposed to historian Tom Holland about this and I was like look how did they come to the conclusion that they should have crusade and he was like well they didn't get it from Christianity and the Orthodox the Orthodox Patriarch in Constantinople was just completely against their dicks there's nothing in the Bible that justifies it you know in the New Testament you know Jesus was a man of peace he turns right cheek he lets his enemy strike him so you can't pick up a sword and say I'm gonna kill someone through Jesus it doesn't make sense when people have massive amounts of power here with the Aztecs it goes weird with everybody it was entirely temporal it was about like in a concrete Middle East but it was also about like making sure that they could get to Jerusalem is it like an ideological thing because the Turks were basically preventing pilgrims from getting to jury sinks Muslims had owned Jerusalem for 400 years and everything was okay because the pilgrims could travel along a pilgrim trail and you had people make money doing this you know they'd sell things and then the Turks came in were like hey we're Muslims I'm fuck everyone because were the Turks and that was that the pilgrims couldn't go to Jerusalem the puttin Pope thing was it was innocent ii open the second you never remember which one it was whichever the pope was a he terrorists hey i could create a spiritual Kingdom or an empire an empire of faith on and he's like why don't you all rather than fighting each other in Europe I mean Europeans were not very advanced but they were very very warlike and wanting to get the middle east and they did and the crusade was actually it means a real thrilling thing to read about now what people you know you see sit like historical films like all the time it's always the Roman Empire which one just every historical fucking brain okay and it's like no someone needs to do a film by the first crew sex the first crusade is one of the most thrilling things you can ever read about it's just the most it's insane what these men did you know marching I mean they must like thousand miles from northern Europe and just they muster and just did so much stuff like the Pope first calls a crusade and it goes kind of wrong from because everyone's like the the page of the the emperor in Constantinople Byzantine Emperor coughs and he says the the Pope look do me a favor I'm getting thrashed by the Turks I need about four thousand Knights professional soldiers good fighters so I can beat them back and the Pope's like hey great idea why don't we all go over there and beat up the Turks for Christianity and loads of peasants what I call that's a good idea and said like 70,000 peasants led by Peter the Hermit turn up on the the Emperor's door something he said what the fuck is this you know why have you sent me the scum of Europe they can't fight the Turks so he just gets them across into Anatolia and they'd gone and they'd just get massacred by the Turks absolutely butchered and then the crusading armies actually arrived Peter home actually managed to survive but then the crusading armies arrived and the Turks think well this would be fine the Emperor is like shit look at all these really and these guys were totally disrespectful gets them across and they end up smashing the Turks and the Turks are just expecting another bunch of peasants and they're not expecting what we've got the men of iron which couldn't be broken and that's why they both fight in Paris the history of human beings as fast like we have learned and how long it's taken us to get to this point the regressive left will always talk to you like this is like a one-sided oh the Christians sullying them out of the blue one day saying no there was an established order there were things going on there was really detailed political landscape and you get someone like Jimmy door goes well there's nothing where some crew say it's just shut up just you don't know what you're talking about just be quiet all right fella angry I've had that on the tempo a long time listen we did an extra hour past that we thought I could do it Stu now this is when your flight so let's get you another flight yeah and thank you brother really appreciate you coming thanks is very fun it was fun fun time it's nice that I can beat some people I don't need to be bitched out definitely did that all right folks we'll be back tomorrow with Chris D'Elia see ya [Music]
