hello freak bitches its societal standards and culture is a big part of this the way people decide what's acceptable what's not acceptable so these people I think for us growing up in America it's almost impossible to understand what it would be like to be living in like one of the most radicalized you can the world can understand the radical behavior which is why I have no problem saying that a guy who went and did nothing but became radicalized like to me that's that's a rote mathematical equation right there like it's uh you know it's a hard one because you know people still say to this day and age like you know you shouldn't you shouldn't kill right we need to the counterinsurgency strategy is based off winning the hearts of mind of the people that we're going in into the countries that we're going into and I think the only way that I can describe it that makes sense to people with it might at least allow them to think outside of the education aspect is that and you kind of you you alluded to the point a little bit but I mean you have daughters right do you love your daughters yeah like how much though like articulate for me how much you love it's impossible for anybody to ever express it in a way that someone who doesn't have daughters would ever understand or sons or children totally and so love is a good analogy because if you can understand how hard it is to articulate that then you understand that there's another side of that coin and that there's a community of people somewhere in earth that hates you too the exact same degree that you love your children and can't articulate and would do everything they fuckin can to and our way of life because we let women go outside and have their skin exposed you can say what you want you can think what you want and what's the solution to solve that it's not books there's not a sit a single I could I could put you in captivity for 14 years Joe and I could never convince you not to love your daughters right so what I'm saying is though is that people think that there's just like oh you don't have to go over there and you don't have to fight well fuck that at some point you have to stand up for what you believe in right and when it comes to those people that hate you as much as you love your kids again there's a small segment of that the you could probably turn with books in captivity right which is what's happening to the guys who get radicalized in Gitmo but for the other segment that would like nothing more than to end your life and everything you believe in what's the solution it's not fucking books yeah what is the solution to try to turn a guy around once they've reached that level of radicalization you can't so you either have to find something or believe in something to the point that you're willing to fight for it because here's the deal we're X people and then there's Y people and regardless of what your ex is you're Christian Catholic whatever your next person there's somebody is a Y person x and y people are gonna fight if you believe in what you believe enough then to protect that at some point you're gonna have to go beyond the educational aspect of that and then by x podcast starts so what's up man you know you learn you learn a lot about yourself like listening to you listen to your own podcast I listen to the good one I don't at all I can't I can't stand this I have no desire to listen to myself the only time is what I'm going through mastering the system my tutorial I do sit there and I am interested in how I'm teaching and when I said and how I could have made the point clearer in my teaching so I I that's the only time but when it's a podcast and I'm not talking about jiu-jitsu and I'm just talking about like just bullshit so I don't want to hear myself it's good to hear though but for the same reason like you realize why you're annoying to you like I've found things that I didn't know I did like little little tics a little weird things like people do like a big one is saying like people like there's like Tom Segura I love him to death that motherfucker out likes me he hurts me sometimes like like there's like God way like if you got like a guy like and there's like a way like uh did he say that or everybody does and I'll do we know guys are telling this story it's hilarious and he's like she came up to me and started mad dogging me and I was like what the fuck you looking at I paid for all that shit and you didn't say none of that you just said I was like that I had that look on my face but I didn't say shit and if you don't question did you actually say that like no I was like I was thinking ask you you would have made it seem like you just bad motherfucker in this story saying shit it was like fuck you that shit who said that no no you and where you came from bitch did you actually say no another one that I did [Music]
