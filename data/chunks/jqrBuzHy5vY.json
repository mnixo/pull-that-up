gonna wait for the greenside okay boom good okay we had some tough technical demo let's try together okay so anyway brother welcome thanks man thanks things so what we were saying before we actually said this already but let's say it again because the people didn't hear it you were one of the pioneers of stand-up comedy in Brazil yeah yeah it was I started with like four or five guys we started doing like 16 17 years ago and nobody knew about stand-up it was something that I found out when I came here to live and play basketball I had a scholarship to play basketball and I watched Jim Gaffigan oh wow and Brian Regan ah I know those guys and I thought was so weird because those guys were like that's I was questioning is his does he call is his name Brian Regas he is actually him because we used to have characters and impersonators so it was kind of weird but at the same time it was interesting because I'm not a guy who does characters and I do observations and I write I was a journalist I have degree in journalism so it was interesting for me to see those guys doing comedy and I thought we could do the same in my country it's so crazy that it took that long for it to get to Brazil yeah you would think that because everything else I mean you guys have movies you know I mean City of God you have action movies you're always you have so much that's so similar the fact that stand-up comedy made it there is so unusual it took it took a long time it was I don't know why but the image of a comedian speaking like with a blazer or like a suit or something was very sign for me it was very American you know and those jokes did they actually connect that much with us like oh I have those pockets and it was something that we have bigger problems than oh I just have a pocket or whether I put my pen I was like it was it was something that I could we couldn't connect that much but when we when we saw there was a lot of people doing other stuff and there was like this huge role that we could actually explore that was when it becoming true for us so comedy in Brazil they would basically be like like say if I was a Brazilian comedian I would come up with a fake name if you would and I would do a character a wig a wig I wear a certain outfit outfit like very over-the-top screaming and and that's still this new exists in Brazil this is like a popular part of the people mm-hmm stand up I'm not saying that is for everyone now I have my Netflix special it's becoming huge because we have some other options right now with internet everything changed the game changed completely so we have what is good has his own space right now it's not only what the TV wants you to watch it so the game changed a little for and for all of us so how did you start out did you start out by going to music clubs or it was I actually starting a a BDSM Club a sadomasochism Cox in the back like vaginas a huge vaginas and we had that show and he was it wasn't good but it was an experience for all of us to go on stage and try to to show them our opinions and our jokes and some irony and sarcasm we wish which was something that people wasn't watching but then it becomes it becomes something huge and we got chances to go to TV and everything else but at first it was difficult because people could not understand is here character he's he playing a part right so that's why I had and I still have a lot of problems with the law because like I did a rape joke which I'm not proud of I'm saying it's not something at all I'm so over the over the line but it was like does he does this guy wants people to be raped what is what is he thinking what is because with all those jokes was taken out of context and put it on newspapers and kinda killed you kind of killed my desire to do comedy over that as well yeah it was it was difficult man because he was like journalist journalist in the audience waiting for me to say some shit move out of context and then guide like fucking like billions of clicks on their websites because or joke I did yeah that's how we the controversy was starting over there no no it's the same thing here so they knew that this was a new thing yeah they and then so they would come to see it and then what were they criticizing it before this he was he was huge everybody loves to that worst but when big when man when we start to have money and TV shows and we kind of ran away out of the underground I was being shows at midnight like packing at three 300-seat theater at midnight in Brazil that was my thing underground in Sao Paulo in the middle of nowhere but then people out this guy's talented let me give him a chance so they put me on TV and I don't know where I was on TV doing the same thing Wow so that would be the country was not that prepared for what I was doing at the time what kind of laws do you have in Brazil in terms of like the language you're allowed to use on television you know that I'm not saying there's like a government censorship about what you can say what you cannot say but sponsors and and even TV stations and the media is very sensitive about everything because it's to a poor country it's you know Brazil to a third-world country so we are we are like we have a lot of people that don't understand oh this is comedy what's what's comedy so right it was my duty to explain a little bit what was stand-up and kind of an open a road for all of us that's how I felt so you and you said three others it was like three or four guys yes so who are these other guys they're still doing comedy yeah yeah they're still doing this - Hugh what are their names Marcelo Mansfield Donny losing chilli Oscar feel you there was a small group of guys that we started doing Brazilian Portuguese beautiful language I love it I love it's like a song it's like it's see I've been doing jujitsu ever yeah 23 years so it's like to me that sound is like it's such a cool sound what do the weather's Brazil say in Jersey says that is that a word or something that they're still repeating that you know well I mean you know poha we just come is that fucker come but sometimes although sometimes you say it like damn yeah but it's come it's come but so that's funny cause like that's like the word shit yeah like shit could be like you could look at something go shit yeah that's good in Portuguese this matter but shit can also be bad yeah you know like well fuck - like fuck could be good or fuck could be bad like you could stub your tongue go fuck or you could you can see a girl with a beautiful body go fuck yeah yeah but Paul has the same thing that's so crazy you getting a chalkboard so funny man language is difficult man yeah me so to speak in English but I was I wasn't a you know I was thinking about it that black people has to stop using the n-word in rap songs because B becomes a trap for Medicare yoki I was singing karaoke at the end of the song this guy came up to me was like don't drop the n-word man but he wasn't the song so what should I do not sing so that the language is something that is I'm feel like learning there's it's difficult man well it's very tricky I mean it's obviously in America there's this sort of acknowledgment that black people were slaves for so long they are allowed to do more things in particular gotta use that word okay there's no other word like in terms of like a like a bad word about an ethnicity know that people use for them selling like a Puerto Rican person would never call himself a spic in like a good what's up speck like to another puerto rican wouldn't its vid the n-word is a very unique word like there's no word really cannot say in any situation i could say it if I'm explaining it like this guy called that guy a nigger okay say that but even saying that people some people wouldn't do that I'm not I would never call someone that okay but I will use it if i if I'm quoting someone or if I'm explaining okay word itself because to run away from the joke is even yeah is even harder because your knowledge that that's up forbidden word so yeah that's Chris Rock had one of the greatest bits of all time with you that there are black people and there are niggers this was his joke but even for me to say that that was a joke and to say it that way is dangerous and it's one of the greatest comedy routines in the history of stand-up that's crazy yeah but a white person could never quote that Chuck you can't do the joke like if you try to do it a joke to your friend like you doesn't look around Chris Rock is so funny when I tell you the bit you'd have to be really careful there's no way you could do the whole joke on a podcast no let's just you say the word the n-word too many times people get mad at you that's crazy you know racism is crazy the fact that there's still racism that's what's crazy the word is just sort of like a it's it's emblematic it's it's like there's a there's a thing there that connects it to the feeling of racism even if you're not using it in a racist context yes so for me I'm a foreigner so I was never so aware of racists like I am now living in this country yeah brazil's no racism is very mild very different that is racism i cannot say that there is not racism of course that is but here is like when there's election they even say how the white folded and how the black folded yeah that's kind of weird because for me that's racism you're you're like dividing people races and it's clear on TV mm-hmm and sometimes you don't even stop thinking about it it's like it's part of the whole thing well it's because the black community doesn't feel like they're represented and they felt like they were represented finally when Obama became president because finally we had a black president but other than that you know there's a real distinction like with Obama it was like almost universal he was gonna get air quotes the black vote you know but with Trump I mean it's or with anybody else it's it's very tricky it's very it's a very different thing they want to make sure that their community is being represented and that their needs are being represented I completely understand and I agreed that there's not some acknowledgement to make the history but at the same time and knowledge II make divided you can for divides you a little bit as well yes it does and it's also used as a weapon by some people that you know and are not they're not being honest they're just using it as a tool to divide people or to force their agenda through or you know again the real problem is not the words the real problem is not if the real problem is actual real racism that's the real problem it still exists it exists less than it did a hundred years ago and far less than it did two hundred years ago and a hundred years from now it will probably be almost non-existent but it's a real problem people are tribal they differentiate by town people differentiate by what part of the country you're from they certainly differentiate by nation and they differentiate by the origin of your ancestors it's it's really stupid as what it is you know unless you're just celebrating the differences and how interesting you know there's different food and different music and different culture and literature but the you know actual real racism the fact that it still exists in 2008 is crazy I got a in that is of racism Brazil was I'm not saying that there's not raising more mild Yahoo's there because interracial relationships are much more common if you see like a but a black guy with a wife wallet it's not it's nobody that's gonna say shit it's normal it's not something that people write like pointing or something I don't think so but there's parts of this country where it's it's a real problem there's parts of this country where there's real racism on a black man with a white woman is in danger you know they have to be careful they go into the wrong bar or they have to be careful if they go into the wrong play it's fucking great that's crazy yeah it is crazy there is a some fan of a it's not it's not a hundred percent of time that I feel comfortable here yeah there's a lot of situations that I have I feel that I can say the wrong thing because I don't understand cuz you don't understand like yeah you had when did you learn English I play basketball here oh so you learn to be in order to play he was yeah III ed were you at the time was this was 1999 I was 23 at the time I'm 42 mmm so it was 1999 I play basketball here and I learned English and that's when I got a first time I saw stand by me man I was like fuck that's that's so easy wow that was 1999 so when you brought it over to Brazil when you brought over stand-up did you guys get together and say hey let's try to do this over here where can we do it I had three friends that knew about it he's a kind of a cult a secret cult of people who knew about stand-up and we were like let's try it but the only the only image that we have was signed for at the end of every every episode that was the that was the thing for us that's the only reference I still remember that the first video that were like talking about what we were doing we were like oh this is stand-up now we'll d-do you did you ever see every episode of sine flat the end he does like a new routine oh this is what he gonna do on the theater right now so that's when we wanted to do it and and it took some time because we started in 2002 2003 and YouTube just came on 2005 but when YouTube came there was like a lot of people posting stand up and little like 30 minutes Comedy Central specials and Natalie Lucy and and it was difficult at first because of everything that I was writing I could see people doing on TV my jokes it was hard for me to explain to people this is my joke like someone stole your job yeah it was not even like stealing because they didn't just joke right it's just a joke how can I explain to people okay this is what I wrote I'm not do jokes that other people wrote right this is it's mine yeah people thought I was a little crazy oh that's funny Wow because you know I don't know if you have this anecdotes that everybody saves you you have here oh yeah okay we have stand-up where people write their own stuff and we have anecdotes sure and that's what we had like little books with animals so when I say a joke people think that I was doing from those books yeah there's stand-up comedy and then there's jokes like that people tell we call them Street joke Street jokes oh yeah like two Jews walk into a bar those jokes are so interesting because I don't know anybody who's ever written one of those jokes I do I don't but but if you think about it that's a good timing it's something that every time that I see like one of those good joke good Street joke I was like fuck I wanted to fucking I want me to create that thing yeah but it's it's interesting because there's so many of them and no one knows anyone who wrote them there's so that was one guy in Brazil was doing those three jokes and he created like 10% of what he done interesting but for him was like this is what I created it denied the 90% that I didn't create it's kind of in the same chunk I don't know now when Seinfeld airs in Brazil I assume that it's translated to Portuguese is dubbed it's dubbed and when it's dubbed is it dubbed well does it make sense no no no does the jokes translate yeah stand up wise now no series works nice now we got much better dubbing you got much better I really but it's crazy we have subtitles as well like my Netflix special has subtitles here in America so subtitles for English yes Wow so you do it in Portuguese yes have you said do you do much stand-up in English yeah I having to say I'm here for for eight months like all the clubs and being The Improv and factory and now but here I do it in English I think what I do on stage now is something that I wrote leaving here like 80% and 20% I translated for my act in Portuguese Wow and some of those jokes don't work when I translate and it's always a price yeah always is the culture so different yeah what people think is funny and what they find ironic but Joe a joke is a joke man yeah if has a tie me if I now I'm able to do at the same pace that I do in Portuguese I feel comfortable doing in English so I feel the same thing and it's easier for me because I actually write jokes mm-hmm I have some friends that just like has some crowd work and interact with the audience and there's a lot of physical comedy in it so to translate that to English is difficult yeah I write jokes yes so if I translate in a right way if he if people understand the context and people understand that I'm talking about like the pregnancy of my wife right and marriage and I don't know being single and everything or maybe that he can work now when you what was it like the first time you did stand-up in America the first time in English I actually have a clip on YouTube that the Laugh Factory posted Wow he was it was very surprising it was very surprising because some jokes that I didn't think was that funny worked and the ones that I was actually pretty sure they would work didn't work you know it's so frustrating completely lost man it was like is this is gonna be a huge role for me yeah and I have been doing this is what I'm this is why I'm here you know to stand up in English now what now stand up since it's been you know you said 16 years or seniors in Brazil is it accepted now that a normal part of the culture yeah have they had comedy clubs open up here I have my comedy club really where is it is in Sao Paulo last comedians is a 300 seat place just like The Improv Wow is a great place I have in Brazil and there's enough local comedy yes yeah that's incredible it does now I have like like on a Saturday I have three packed shows night back shows like of them I'm getting some polish you yeah he's a huge city there's like 15 million people yeah that's Wow that's 15 million people live in Sao Paulo it's so cool in Portuguese yeah there's no setup in English in Brazil because unfortunately that's not that many people that speaks English in Brazil yeah I know they were trying to organize shows like Jade was trying to get people to come to Brazil to stand up when I was like yeah good luck with that that just seems like it doesn't seem like there's enough people Jade open for me in Portuguese in Brazil Wow and she helped me a little bit of the beginning here opening some clubs and getting me some gigs she's a very good friend and for her it was a little difficult in Portuguese how to translate English to porch it was yeah first because what you guys there's a culture that there's a stand-up culture here mm-hmm if you're this freaky and a little crazy and hippie that's something that does not translate to another country right you have to actually write jokes yeah yeah yeah and and for her it was a little difficult because she has this way of doing it like interacting and it she's like and if you mess up a word in Portuguese it's in English if you mess up a word in English it's kind of funny oh it's a foreigner they accept you there's this likeability mm-hmm but if you mess up on your Portuguese you're a prick really yeah oh so you don't speak Portuguese oh you just speak English I see yeah that makes sense because America is such a melting pot there's so many different languages out here someone well that's you know I've read something the other day like if you see someone and they speak broken English don't make fun of them that means they speak two languages yes yes and you don't of course I mean most of us don't in Portuguese is similar to Spanish so people who speaks Portuguese speak Spanish so I kind of just beat reeling that's that's that's that's a lot well that helped Fabricio Werdum in Mexico because he's so fluent in Spanish that you know when he was over there fighting you know they were like holy shit this guy speaks perfect Spanish he's from the same city that I am which is Porto Alegre city in the south so we kind of have some Spanish in the city it's close to to Argentina oh I see it's kind of is our thing there okay cool so now when you were doing stand-up and you started to get in some trouble for bits a lot of trouble a lot of how much trouble yeah a lot of money I spent a lot of money really yeah I lost a lot of sauces I lost a lot of lawsuits because of jokes really awesome yeah so I cou was suing you the people who felt offended so people in the audience artists when I make fun of a celebrity they would sue yeah they can they can sue you they can get money out of really well the TV shows they can get out so who sued you you know I got this this loss so that really put me in trouble it was because of a singer it was she was a singer and kind of I was cute my career you actually did that's why I'm here yeah I got on a huge lawsuit and it looks dumb when you explain oh it's just a singer but it becames all this talk about freedom of speech and what comedians can say and what they cannot say are you allowed to feel offended and now there's like law schools talks about the lawsuit that I had Law School discussions discussions a case yeah because I made fun it was a shitty joke that's the problem you know it's not because the lawsuit I want to be sued by the good ones because known by a bad joke of course yeah it's just like I was saying this was it's just like you meeting uh Eddie Murphy one of the greatest comedians I really think oh there's dr. Dooley do you don't want that right now this is the same thing with me that joke was a shitty joke and she was like bragging on TV as she was like doing a story on TV and I was the host of this huge TV show like The Daily Show like the Daily Show meeting the view it was something like that and and in the middle of the thing she was shows there and my friend asked me oh she's pregnant and do you think she's still hot and I said she's so hot that I would fuck her in her baby and shit but it was life it was like right on time everybody left and there was no problem but next week it was this huge thing because she was like her husband was very influential and her husband was managing run out which was one of the biggest soccer player ever so that was this whole thing the TV show Lost sponsors and and they want to suspend me from the TV show because the fat joke that I did mmm she didn't tell they didn't tell me to apologize at first but he suspended me so I quit the show they didn't know so you just apologized and I decided not to apologize because I felt that after like ten years don't standard or twelve years doing stand-up it was important for me to like put my feet on the ground and say you know if we step back right now yeah what am i what am I gonna do in like two years this is important for all of us yeah it's important for comedy so I lost Lhasa to las movies Ella's so what did they what did they rule in the lawsuit like what was the ruling I offended her honor or the I was something like that she is like the people can sue you the suing is part of the democracy it's okay to sue you but a lot to lose a lawsuit is that's the problem I lost like one hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more in Brazil was three hundred and fifty thousand reais oh right if you're a lawyer and you get ten thousand dollars a month you get ten thousand Eisenmann so he's you don't translate money so I lost a lot of money but the thing is got me a huge headache and uh he was it was it was bad it was bad just from that one just for that one but you use another lawsuit yeah how also because I did it like a rape joke and and I got like this women movement like trying to break break into my bar and break my the door of my comedy club and there was like that was but the discussion was more important than the problem itself I kind of fun it was is the discussion about freedom of speech and that was that was huge what is freedom of speech like in Brazil is it the same mean obviously we have the First Amendment do you have something that we don't we don't have that we don't have that in Canada we don't have that I had Mike Ward on in Canada do you know his story yeah I know he's the guy who he made a joke about a sick boy that the boy was still alive you know I thought it was and you know it was just a bad joke about this guy still being alive and can he get his money back cuz like because they donated money this fucked-up joke but it's supposed to be a fucked up joke who's doing it in a nightclub situation where people are drinking you say things that are inappropriate and that's the art form he got sued and he's still in the process of it right now there's another case in Vancouver where these women were heckling they were yelling things out during the show and then the comedian went onstage and berated the women and then the women sued and won because they were lesbians and he made some lesbian jokes about them at their own expense and so then they took him to court and they won and they won what they won some judgment where he had to pay them I wanted Jimmy how much was it I want to say it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000 yeah when and for this gentleman this comedian I think that was a lot of money I don't know forty to forty two thousand dollars yeah that's a lot of fucking money for opening comedian I mean he wasn't a famous guy so you know that might be two years worth for him who knows you know yeah lost a lot of money so Canada is similar can't Canada does not have freedom of speech the same way the United States does yeah so that that's why I feel what I do comedy here and I feel that people get uncomfortable about a joke or two that's when I get a stress it's like you have the Feder of saying those things yes like I have this joke that I say it is about the n-word as well I might maybe I have to check but I have this job that I do it's like when I arrived here someone said to me you know don't use the n-word what people are gonna kick your ass but they never told me what the n-word was so for the past six months I have been avoiding all wars and the other day a guy came up to me and said can i fuck your ass smells like maybe when I say this job is like I have to set up it's crazy because when I first did he was like a fucking thing everybody got uncomfortable yeah but now I set up as a misunderstanding because I'm a foreigner yes and now I'm free to do everything yes yes yeah so I kind of fire I found the way of yeah so that's it's crazy and I watch you a lot and I see a lot of people here I saw the other guy this guy this guy did an interview with you and he did this show in a college and he did a joke and people took him out of a mesh the mesh Patel yeah yeah that's crazy because you built the freedom to do that yes and now you're discussing if you can or you can it's only in colleges though children today and I'm gonna call them children they do not understand the danger in suppressing free speech and so they think that what they're doing is by suppressing free speech and changing the way people communicate what they're doing is making the world a better place they think they're they're signaling their virtue and making the world a better place at the same time but it's just ignorant so just don't understand that you can't you you can't necessarily you can't control people and to think that by just getting upset and silencing someone and removing them from the stage that that ends the conversation it doesn't it reinforces their position it says okay look I was right about you fucking snowflakes and you little babies like you can't even understand when things are uncomfortable that it doesn't necessarily mean it's negative and that like you're like try to put yourself in someone's position and see what he's saying and in the mesh's kids this case it's actually kind of funny first of all he's very open-minded guy very progressive he's not in any way a racist and his joke was that people say that being gay is a choice and he said I know it's not choice cuz I have a friend who's black and gay there's no way he would choose both of those things just him being funny it's a funny joke and they they like cut get the fuck off the stage like what come on man you don't think that's funny that's crazy I mean and it's also coming from an Indian man who I'm sure has experienced racism so the whole thing is it's very fascinating to see young kids who are growing up in this PC culture bubble and you know what sometimes people say on this podcast that we talk about it too much and maybe they're correct maybe sometimes it's annoying if you're listening cubicle and you hear me talking too much about this yeah but it's because it's an issue that's very dear to my heart because I understand the dangers of not being able to communicate freely and I also say understand what happens when if you suppress free communication the people that you're suppressing they're going to get more and more angry and radical and it just makes their position that they feel more justified and then perhaps even people who are racist could perhaps be more racist or people who are angry about gay people will become more angry about it if you suppress their ability to express themselves that's when borns those little movements and neo-nazi movements little groups and little moves on the web in the deep web when discussion it's like when you for when it's forbidden I think is you can forgive them the power that they didn't have I think so and I think this is something that we're really just getting to understand now you know I have had a few conversations about this recently with the head of Twitter and with an independent journalist Tim Poole last week and I think what people are just starting to kind of understand even though everyone's uncomfortable about this is we're still trying to figure this out social media is only 10 plus years old this is an incredibly new experience for us and I don't think everybody knows exactly how to proceed and this idea that you could just ban people and then just ban people for life if they say something that makes people uncomfortable if they say an opinion you don't agree with ban them for life and we're experiencing that right now and we're trying to figure out what to do and how to how to fix this and how to mitigate it without endorsing people harassing people and the dorsum people you know threatening people and giving out their address and their phone number and things along those lines so it's it's a process that we're all going through right it is it is a learning process for the the the whole country but the thing that annoys annoys me a little bit is that I I live in another country and I see how things are difficult and how much time I spend explaining people what I was doing and for you guys it's like I was having the same problems that Lenny Bruce was had like the time ago yes and you guys built that yeah to have that discussion it's like it is important because that's the way the world evolved but at the same time it feels old it feels old because you understand the history of it yeah in America yeah it feels old because you already have that discussion long time ago yeah you know you gotta keep having this conversation when you think that well you finally feel free to say whatever you want now there's people trying to hold you back it's crazy well it's not really effective see there's there's people that are angry about I mean there is on social media there's certainly people that are being effective with it but in stand-up comedy it's the there's blowback and pushback but it's not very effective like for the top guys for guys like Dave Chappelle and you know bill burr it's it actually makes their standup better because people are so tired of all this shit they're so tired of PC culture they're so tired of being told what they should and shouldn't think it's funny and what is acceptable and not acceptable and you know there's a there's a lot of weird shit going on right now did you ever have problem with that oh yeah don't ever leave your show because of a joke your deeds oh fuck yeah what was the subject my god I don't even remember how many have so many times yeah I mean people just get angry they get angry and you're allowed to you mean it's fine it's look everybody has their own sensibilities and the problem one of the problems with stand-up comedy is if you go to a club to see music you know what kind of music n' to go see salsa they have a salsa club you want to go see jazz you want to go see rock-and-roll or you want to go to a rap show you know what you're going to see but if you go to see comedy you could see fuckin Barry Manilow followed by Guns and Roses followed by Run DMC I mean it's it's it's unless you're going to see a specific comedian what you're going to see Jim Gaffigan you don't necessarily know what the fuck you're going to see you go to the Comedy Store on Sunset you're gonna see if you get there at nine o'clock in state till two o'clock in the morning you go see 1015 different fucking comedians and they're all different and you know some of them are men some of them are women and some of them are gay and some of them are black and they all have different points of view and some of them you're gonna think of the best some of them you think oh when is this guy getting off stage I mean that's just that's just part of it but for us what's really important about that is that when I work there I know that it's not my crowd there are everyone's crowd see if I go to do a show if I do a show somewhere and San Diego say and I advertise it the people that come they bought a ticket to see meets York row yes but if I go to the Comedy Store they might be there to see Neal Brennan or Chris D'Elia or whoever but there's to your crowd Joe some of them are the Comedy Store I steal your crowd they still this you we went there to watch you they know who you are if you go to maybe the middle of Utah they are not gonna know like ah that's great usually you'd be surprised yeah wise guys glass shout out to Salt Lake City oh yeah I live in Nebraska so I couldn't imagine someone lived in the brush yeah that's what I get getting a scholarship for basketball Jesus Christ Division two school it was crazy because I had a chance to meet the American people right it's not the people who lives in LA or New York that's different I remember farmers yeah and I was like hanging around with black guys because there was my people that was I was a foreigner we were minorities and they were playing basketball with me so I felt it was a completely different experience Nebraska was he was it was awesome how'd you get out did you walk I actually no I got injured I got into a fight man and I broke my joy my cheekbone no way a fight playing basketball on the court used to fight a lot of us fuck yeah I didn't I know I'm not proud of that age but I used to fight a lot I like to fight but I never knew how how to do it which is crazy because you're Brazilian yeah and where valley to dos started it's where Brazilian jiu-jitsu started it I always wall fights but the one that I lost I broke my cheekbone and my jaw and I had to do surgery here and the surgery went bad oh no because it's praise that's specific but they don't have a doctor who does mouth and bones at the same time they have a neck and mouth doctor and they have dentist they don't have the one who does both mm-hmm this is them doctor at that time I were at that place right so my surgery went wrong I had to go back to Brazil and I had to do the surgery again oh no and and I decided not to come back so this is how this is why this moment for me is very important I never thought that I had my dream was to play basketball that's what I was dedicating my life for and I never thought that I would have a second chance in America and this is and that's it that's the my second chance and I can mess this up so what made you come from Brazil to America for stand-up comedy was it all the lawsuits it was a little bit of the lawsuits I'm not saying that it was not but my friend it's like if you wanna play basketball do you wanna play at the NBA right if you wanna play soccer you're gonna go to Barcelona stand-ups is here man that's the place that you gotta be and we never had a Brazilian stand-up comedian in in in here just like Jay do the ones were born here but not the ones who actually was like doing stand-up in Brazil coming here I think was important for me for all my colleagues and all my all the comedians Brazil as well to start something here it has been a very good experience a little hard yeah but he has been a lot of a lot of fun as well now are you working over here did you save up money and you live it off your money faces we have my comedy club there I saved and I saved some I got some money yeah yeah I lost some of those losses kept some Joe fuck but I'm saying you're not working here necessarily I'm just like going and doing stand-up I'm focusing on stand-up I have my agent and I have manager everything is happening last year I did jfl I'm Hannah like I'm headlining some clubs right now because in those places that has like a huge Brazilian community okay I'm doing in English but I'm throw a little Portuguese in there with ya yeah so that's that's Noom and it's I did everything that I wanted to do in Brazil I did a talk show I did movies I did in my own series I directed a movie directed a series and I thought was like I'm 42 it's time for me to try something new so that's why I came here and I miss my son that's that's the bad part okay yeah we were talking about that before that is a that's a crazy situation yeah my kids there and last time that I was leaving and he was like if I'm the most important in your life why are you searching for something so far away mmm and I thought yet I told him this is important this is very important for me but it is selfish yeah this is something that I wanted to do and and for my career was important because I didn't I don't I lost a lot in my country as well with the lawsuits and a lost TV shows I lost a lot I lost money I thought was a little dangerous for me to keep doing it over there and I got a death trap there was like that made me a little then I and I didn't actually went public to talk about the death threat and I was the death threat it was because one of my lawsuits I cannot be that specific because it wasn't open so if I say as a coroner who he was I will be sued again right because you know yeah Sood okay now I'll be offending someone's honor because I but I knew what happened and I felt I I didn't feel safe that for a little bit mmm I'm not saying that a runaway but I did seem smart to come over yeah and spend some time and build something and and maybe be here it was it was hard for me that I could get hurt because of the nature of my job now when you're over here and you're trying to do stand-up dr you do you structure your act out do you have like how do you do it do you write it out on paper on a computer do you put it up on a this thing over you put it on your phone write everything over here and then I keep rehearsing and I go on stage and I have to toe and I say it that's what I do I memorize everything that I'm gonna say not everything but it gets natural it's the way you do it yeah I just memorize everything that I'm gonna write because if I mess up a word or two I can kill a joke and I want everything to work flawlessly so that's why I memorize it looks natural but I memorize everything but it's very hard for me to interact with the audience mm-hmm because every time there's someone like I called me all joke all jokes comes in Portuguese on my head and I have to translate right at the time and I lose time is very frustrating oh yeah like collagen and I even say this on stage like I was doing a show the other day in this guy just scream you suck it was like a bad shows a marshal and what I say to would I want it when I am stressed out I just mess up words and they always happen and heels I you say I wanted to say go fuck yourself and I say gonna fuck myself it's very hard to interact with the awesome whose tiny man is ethical yeah do it in another language it's not my natural thing so everything is on your phone yeah you don't write it on the computer or notebook do you write yeah yeah yeah I write in a computer because I can write and it's easier to type you know like its first of all it's bigger right you're looking at a big 15-inch screen and I can type without looking at my fingers okay and so when I have ideas I can get them out really quick and I don't have to say them okay I just look at it on the screen and then I'll write many versions of it and then I go over it chuckles weed and then start editing twisting it around the best and the first version dude that's the first version what I basically do is I get it to a point where I know that I have something to talk about and know I have a framework and I know where there's some punchlines and then I write it out on paper so that when I write it out on paper I can see it better in my head I remember it better then I bring it to the stage but I don't have a rigid structure I'm loose with it because I want to be able to feel it in the moment whether or not this is good perfect you know so when I go on stage I was like say if I'm doing a joke about a coffee okay whatever I'll go you know I drink too much fucking coffee I got a real problem and here's how I know I have a problem and then I'll go into it and then I'll start talking about all the different errors and then I'll listen to the recording and I'll go oh that part's luck so I got to fix this part and this part stupid and this part is sloppy but that part got a laugh okay but you know what it'd be even funnier if I set it clear like maybe I need to say it this way you know and and then I'll just and then it's this constant process of writing writing it out going onstage recording all sets listening to the recording and then writing again do you when you listen to those sets do you keep the funny ones or is there some time they should do like a funny joke but you don't like it does that happen sometimes yeah yeah yeah I don't it's it's it's few cheap cheap cheap yeah yeah yeah he was funny like you got a laugh but it's not good yeah that's sure yeah absolutely yeah you got to be careful that you don't you don't want to be a hack you know that's what that's a hack is someone who tells like obvious stupid jokes that only make dumb people laugh okay or someone who does tired beaten-down material like the jokes that you know that other people have done already you know you know that you just would know based on your okay like here's a perfect example it's Stephen Fry do you know Stephen Fry yes this is famous he used this recently he said something about I would I would love to come back to life as a drug sniffing dog you know could you imagine being a drug sniffing dog at the airport just smelling everything no no getting high like he was saying about how that is such an obvious stupid joke and so many people have done that and that's a joke where man I bet probably hundreds of comedians that don't joke about that it's just like an obvious premise and you know like you were saying earlier that sometimes people would say jokes that you've said and you you have a hard time explaining that's my joke and to them it's just an anecdote or then it's just something funny that they heard sometimes people go on stage and their act consists of really obvious premises that they have probably already heard someone covered before that's a hack yeah that's why it's difficult there's a huge challenge for me because I have been doing for 17 years but in another country so you guys you guys there's a huge road that you guys already followed so if you hear something out that's old maybe for me it's not right you know I wanna be that guy right and I don't in what I realized that people don't point that out to you well you could ask people yeah yeah if you're friends with comics like okay you get ass okay and they'll tell you yeah yeah that's why like the other day this guy was doing a joke and I kind of thought about a tag line the tag line yeah and he got uncomfortable for me like telling he all what about this it was like it will it's difficult man to connect with comedians it's not that easy they all have huge problems they all have one I was like in a group of guys one was like ex-drug addict the other ones was a drunk and they do have like huge problems and I was like I have friends it was bigger yeah you gotta be like oh you got a deep and you've gotta fucking go into the bottom to search for something good and I understand this process but at the same time do I really have to go through all that now we found something great no you don't thought you just gives what ideas and yes Chris D'Elia actually has a bit about that I don't want to do his bit but it's basically a bit about how good his childhood was and how close he is with his family and everybody thinks that you have to have a fucked-up childhood to be it's not true you just have to be funny people are funny for different reasons some people are funny because they always enjoy stand-up I mean if you if you grow up enjoying stand-up comedy and then become a stand-up comedian there's nothing wrong with that you don't have to be a drug addict do you and I'm not gonna be because I I tried marijuana yeah we did yeah once two years ago and I stayed hide for 14 days Sarah god man did you eat it 14 days no no it's smoked it wasn't a vaporizer is that yeah vaporized vaporizer yeah yeah and I say hi for 14 days but I thought it was like disconnected for reality well sometimes that does happen and I know a story about a guy who is a straight-laced guy who took some marijuana edibles so that he could get to sleep and he had a real problem like he got suicidal and freaked out and became just irrationally anxious he had crippling anxiety for some time for some time for weeks and he's a confident guy and a very handsome big muscular guy like just like you would never imagine this guy have any anxiety I think some people have just the the chemistry of different individuals I wasn't bar for that and that's what the doctor told me because I went to the psychiatrist I swear to god I'm that week that week with the psychiatrist man and I sold him me know I smoked that thing like 14 days ago and I still high and he looked at me and he gave me some some psycho one he gave me some pills and I was like if you stay high into tomorrow take those pills because what he told me is something that I didn't know that he can be a trigger if you're has some tendencies of schizophrenia and a psychopath or if you have which was not my case in his toe this is very rare but he can't happen which is not your case and I was happy because he said yeah and the next day I was okay and I felt okay [Music] and I remember that I decided to record I was like let me let me record what I'm thinking at least let's get some good experience out of it and I remember that I started to record and I said now I'm going to record everything that I'm thinking and when I looked at the cell phone it was 45 minutes 45 minutes of talking and I didn't realize I just said that I'm gonna record now and there was 45 minutes and when I listened like for 15 days after that I was like I'm so crazy I'm so crazy I'm never gonna understand on my son's talking talking to me right now Wow one hit of a person no it was more than one a bunch of him he was a bunch yeah oh you're too tall you're big you're like 250 pounds so fucking use it a lot also they were saying keep hitting it because you're tall because I wasn't feeling it oh no when I felt it I felt for 40 people that's one of the big problems with people when they first tries they try too much yeah someone just says take another hit this is a rapper man I tell people view thinking about trying marijuana go I did a little bit that's it yeah I don't feel anything shut the fuck up leave it alone it'll you'll eventually feel something something yeah leave it alone wow that's crazy man if there's so many people selling weeds and stuff and this it's not even cool anymore weeds not cool it's like people are so poor when I do shows there's a lot of people talk about I smoked this and I smoked that it's like man it's legal now yeah this is like juice it's not dangerous yeah I think it's good he has to be there yeah well it definitely should be it doesn't affect me that way for me I've been smoking in a long time it's pretty easy okay I just it chills me out makes me it actually makes me nicer makes me like a more calm person it does that makes mom more sensitive to other people's feelings did you ever smoke because you felt that you're nervous or like stress the house and no I'm gonna treat I'm not gonna perform well in this meeting or something you're smoking no it doesn't work like that from me like if I'm stressed out and I work out I'm stressed out that's that's my best for alleviating that marijuana is good for me for thinking for contemplating and going over things and it's not it's not good for me for stress like for straight what if I feel like tense tension I workout that's that's what gets it out of me I always wanted to ask you one thing hmm it's completely different when you're doing interviews at the end of fights mmm did you ever feel threatened somehow know what at least once thanks no no no I one thing that I hope the fighters realize is that what I'm trying to do is only get them to express themselves mm-hmm I want them to shine I really genuinely want them they won this big fight I want I want them to express themselves I want them to maybe maximize their marketing perfect their marketability and just like tell the world how they feel like that's a incredibly unusual experience to win a big fight in the cage on pay-per-view in front of millions of people my goal is only to try to get them to communicate better and to let them know that I'm there to support them that's all I'm ever trying to do for it you know yeah like I was saying before before we started talking to I have a lot of friends in MMA mm-hmm sweetest guys as people yeah consider what they do for a living crazy so crazy yeah damn young from the lay ninja Shogun their house ninja doing these days man last time I talked to him he got some he got some I don't know if he was because of the fighting yeah I cannot say that but his speech it's a little slow yeah it is already hard to understand even Shogun they have this what they call the hoenn ace which is the way of speaking they come from this state which is very hard to understand what they say from QWERTY yeah Concord Chiba and people we don't forget chip sometimes when they speak to too fast you don't understand that much but a ninja I think he got some some injuries and subscribes in his head I think he got some surgeries yeah I think he had surgery and he was fine at the time people are kicking people in soccer kids soccer yeah bro and he was one of the best he was good yeah he was an animal he was really young to an idea and he was like getting knocked out with slaps yeah that's the scariest thing is when you see the chin go oh when their ability to take apart what's crazy a Shogun seems to be making a resurgence it's crazy he amazing he I I used to be very good friends with one of his coaches and after the fight with Henderson the first one which was like a great fuss that was the chaos and I was talking to him he was like you don't even imagine how talented this guy is but he kind of focused if he was focused he would kick his ass in like fucking two minutes so he just that's the way they do it and Xiu Qi box they like to fight they like to fucking just go at it yeah p.m. and Cyborg and fun delay and same thing but the way they do it's just like let's go to war yeah and sometimes the game changed yeah and but Shogun is like learning you can see that he's like improving still improving and like I think it's like 36 34 his last fight he looked sensational I mean he looked like a fucking killer he can take a shot again now it's weird it's like I mean he got knocked out by a few different guys and he's lost some fights some tough fights but his last fight he looked as good as he's looked in years it's it's sad for me when I see like I don't know he's always with Brazilians but when I see like an old an old fighter getting his ass kicked too quick yeah I remember his fight with Sun and that was that was yeah well he got Carnegie he got caught in a guillotine but his fast he the guy trained for like six months and that's very frustrating remember when Royce he went back to fight with huge stands like yeah well Matt Hughes was in his prime then you know and he was so strong and hoist just wasn't he wasn't physically capable do it right he didn't look the same you know he just didn't look like he was physically capable the same way in and you know Matt he was his fucking talented unbelievably talented when he when he got on top of who he was smashing I was like oh yeah that's hard to watch it's not a wash yeah but that's the life I mean that is the life they chose you know when Chuck Liddell just got knocked out by Tito Ortiz if that was hard to watch cuz you could tell he just can't take a punch and I wasn't that fight that way in there to watch it it was it was bad it was I wasn't moving right the thing about when fighters take a lot of knockout losses one of the things it's very becomes apparent is their balance looks off and their movement doesn't look the same like their neurology they don't the body doesn't move yeah he can look the same but they'll react the same right right I mean even Anderson when he lost a style bender I think style bender would have been a tough fight for him at any point in his career because style bender is just fantastic super technical but Anderson looked like he was a step behind the Anderson of old like the Anderson that knocked out Vitor and the Anderson that you know you go back to the early days Anderson that knocked out Chael Sonnen and that Anderson was a fucking he was just an assassin yeah he was so good he just knew what to do and when to do it and when the style bender fight he just looked like he was a little off little office but he's also 46 you know he's I think he's 1 1 year older than 43 he's only 40 yeah we did we did we did a show together we do a show this show on that was called the ultimate beast master which is a Brazilian Netflix know is here as well Terry Crews did an American we did we do like all hosts from different countries and we meet and it's like American Ninja Warrior for Netflix ok and we have like hosts from different countries and we have two Brazilians and Italians and the French guys and and I didn't show it and they're so he's a sweet guy he's great it's a great guy he's a great guy I mean he's one of the all-time greats I mean I had the honor of calling a lot of his fights and it's crazy because yeah and it's crazy when you're talking about the god the guy is getting older I remember I talked with Minotauro it was like three or four I was like two to two fights after he actually retired and I asked him why why you keep doing it you don't have to do you know right you don't have to prove anything to me know what and when he said of me I think was so fair he was like I fought when this thing wasn't giving me any money right so just give let me lose the fight or two and get some money at the end of my career because I deserve that right he wasn't like of course he was going there to win but it's like I wanna take the risk yeah because I was fighting in Japan getting I don't know five thousand dollars and now that the game it's like bringing you so much money I'm gonna retire let me just do a couple more well Minotauro not not only was he a pioneer and one of the great MMA heavyweights of all time but he's so important for MMA because he showed that heavyweights can fight off their back and that heavyweights could win by triangle like when he triangled Mark Coleman and was tapping guys with arm bars when he beat Bob Sapp Bob Sapp was fuckin crazy that's what that is one of the greatest MMA fights in the history of the sport 375 pound Bob Sapp Minotaur only probably weighed 230 and he wound up happening with an armbar it was fuckin critten after he gets spiked on his head which still apparently fucks with him Tuesday his neck was fucked up Herman because of that yes I didn't know that 375 pound guy who doesn't even look like a human he looked like a like a comic book yeah he smashes him on his head and Minotauro recovered and I mean he was one of the toughest guys of all - yeah but she was run by a truck when he wasn't that's that scar and it's run by a crazy yeah that's crazy I mean he's he's one of the most important figures in the history of the sport and then I think Fabrizio took it to another level because Fabricio Werdum probably has the best guard in the history of the sport its history the heavyweight division I mean when he caught phaidor when he had him in his triangle and he had him locked up like that you don't get away with that guy like you might get out of some people's guard not Fabricio that motherfucker locks people up yeah yeah and I gotta thank him I'm here just because of yeah well my respect for him you know when he reached out to me he was like okay I'll get your friend on thank you and he is a great guy and that's what I well that that's why I asked you if if you kind of feel threatened because when people get there in the fight yeah you don't know what's gonna happen right and when you go over there to talk with one you can say a wrong thing at the wrong why don't know maybe on that you can make mistakes you should stay so my intention is always to just to make them look good that's all I'm trying to I'm trying to do is just get them to express themselves and and and and also put some emotion to how great their performance was yeah but it's a weird job you know to also be a comedian you know it's a strange combination mination yeah do they go watch you sometimes sometimes yeah yeah that's good that's very good and for me now it's like I'm here to try this comedy thing and so you're getting up in Los Angeles and are you traveling anywhere yeah yeah I have a gig on Rhode Island Rhode Island these people yeah I have a gig dad I did the Gotham comedy club last last two weeks ago I have lined the club so it's time to get a lot of Brazilians that come to see yeah they want you to speak Portuguese they do and some of them don't speak English really there's like always like two or three at dinner shows in Portuguese but they're so good to see you so that happened but it's it's hard me because I have to build an audience yeah here yeah and it's gonna take some time do you do a podcast I don't you should sure yeah definitely definitely it's a good I think every comedian like every comedian has a Instagram page but every comedian officer should have a podcast it's very simple to do it's not something that we do that much in Brazil so maybe you could be the Pioneer that appear on the podcast you're a pioneer for standup YouTube is something huge in Brazil well that's a great way to start because with all you need is a webcam and you can start your podcast just on you too easy I do my I have my my channel YouTube got like 2 million subscribers really that's like on Twitter I have 12 million people following this a lot man that's a lot 12 million people following me my Brazilian Instagram I got like 1.5 million people people people are very active in social media in Brazil it it's something that is from our nature to connect with people in Brazil so that's why social media got huge and it was it was like an alternative for the traditional media what is this the most influential person I look at you motherfucker New York Times he's crazy New York Times Magazine saying you're the most influential person on Twitter that's incredible now what were they saying you're the most influential what were you doing that was influencing people I have no idea I was surprised when they I woke up and I was story on the New York Times saying that I was the most influential profile Twitter and in the second place the Dalai Lama Dalai Lama [Laughter] I was the first one so these they did like a huge story about me Wow incredible he was man Twitter was something huge in Brazil what is the difference between the way people use Twitter in Brazil in America is there a difference no for for me I just used Twitter for jokes that's what I did for quite some time it was Twitter lost a lot of his strength in Brazil because people like to connect Facebook is huge and Instagram is huge so you have your family over there you have you have have everything you have you have your people but you feel talking you should just like Twitter feels like you're screaming and someone is gonna listen well it's not like on Facebook that people yeah follows you and then if he likes you your post is gonna be like in the in the top of this page but it is just something that is there some right it lost a lot of power in Brazil but one thing that is happening right now is our new president and we have a new president now that is a right-wing guy who was just elected and he got stabbed he was like when did he get stabbed it was like two months ago during the process of the election holy shit that's happenin in a gut yeah did you see that yeah and he's like a very wide range he won the election and he's trying to do with Twitter with Trump did well he's doing him here like run instead of going to press conferences and and everything he's just going through there and say what he wants Wow yeah Twitter is unique in the way people just use it to insult people and so angry it's so angry like if you just only if you didn't know anything about people and you just looked on Twitter and just like saw how you like what people must be fighting in the streets it must be just a bloodbath out there if you really thought that people interacted in the real world the way they do on Twitter you would think that everywhere is just weapons and clubs running people over with cars which everyone dies but I think man there's a difference and I think we have to knowledge that there's a difference between your behavior on the web and outside of the law for sure and sometimes you don't realize that yeah oh the world is boring everybody is sensitive and everything else if you go outside it's not that much it's the same this is same it was always it's a distorted lens that you could see humans through it's not how people really are and it's also it's not a healthy way to communicate because you don't worry about what the person thinks about what you're saying you're saying things that you don't necessarily even really mean because you're trying to be inflammatory you know to get some attention yeah I mean that's a lot of it a lot of is just screaming screaming for attention and insulting people I mean and then you look at people's pages that's the most disturbing thing to me someone say something shitty to me I'll go to their page and I see they're just saying shitty things all day long like kind of life is this man some fucking terrible life what I'm doing right I have this series that I do on Instagram where I just I get like the guy cursing me or saying some shit about me and I just show his face and it's enough and it's funny because it's it's funny to see who is actuates me right then I call these the people who hates me and then I put what he wrote and then only his face right its thumbnail it's enough for you to see how that's fucking you don't have to take things too serious because if you take a look of their lives its you can see why they are so mad yeah there's there's a lot of that a lot of anger and though most of them have private accounts like you can't look at their pictures they're hiding yeah they're hiding who they are they just talk shit in the comments I shouldn't bro yeah it's weak shit just ash it's giving people a chance to like throw blind shots that's crazy I think that the be anonymous on the web it's a good is a good thing because it allows you to be free at the same time yeah it's good for whistleblowers for people like reporting crimes reporting corruption scores report you know like that for that it's critical that is that is a there's a way to do it and don't expose yourself yeah but at the same time it creates that but it's you know it's the sign of the new era bro it's just a new thing that we all have to navigate it's just a new thing and it's like we were talking about earlier with social media being so recent in human history there's never been anything where you could just talk to the whole world and do it from your phone while you're sitting at a red light you could say something there's a story about this woman was the name justine sacco without the woman's name who said something racist i went to a plane yes I said she said I'm going to Africa hope I don't get AIDS just kidding I'm white lol so she was fucked up on ambien and she was or xanax or ambien I forget what it was she was she was on some sort of psych medication and something that affects your brain and drank to she had a couple of drinks just thought she was being funny and then wakes up sixteen hours later in Africa and her life is over that's crazy and it was just one of those days where there was like a slow news cycle and people just jumped on that tweet and the thing about it too is that they don't want you to recover from something like that and they want that's that's you've at rest of your life that's what I felt yeah that's what I felt I'm the baby fucker yeah yeah so everything that I say right now is like wasn't you like fucking babies and I fuck the baby I don't think they're attractive I don't fact it at all do you foresee a time ever where you will go back to Brazil no I do I do go back to what I mean go back to do stand-up I I don't see them and the challenge is here and the freedom that I think I have here and maybe I don't maybe I will face this this this whole thing the same thing when I get famous or when I when it's when I get no no you want it's way easier here from what you're explaining to me but look at little Louie or Louise a different case because it's not what he said on Snitch and you know I mean it's a he got caught up in the wave of the me to movement to where as if this same exact instance happened in the past it's not the same thing it wasn't that comparison but I got like Daniel Tosh did a rape joke and then I was gone that was over in like like that and you know it would happen there with a joke no he was like improvising with the audience yes he was improvising with the audience here's the deal he was at the Laugh Factory he wasn't supposed to be there dom i rera who is his friend said hey why don't you go up and do some standard because I don't have any materials just go up and fuck around just they'll be happy to see you guys okay so he goes on stage he's I don't have any material so what do you guys want to talk about some guy yells out rape and he goes what what what's funny about like he's like making fun of the guy like what are you talking about what's funny about rape he's like there's nothing he goes like what's funny about rape the humiliation the violence and some woman yells out actually there's nothing funny about rape so he goes wouldn't be funny five guys are great so he's just the end of Daniel Tosh so it probably would have been just one of those moments in a live crowd with drunk people but she wrote a blog about yeah where she was the victim she was this huge blog about him calling for her to get raped which is not exactly what he did is it's in the context of being heckled do you understand what it is and he kind of had to have some sort of an apology for it but then all these other people jumped in and then it became a moment where people could show that they don't support rape and where they don't support what we call rape culture they use you as a plataform yes yes that's what happened and that's what happened with me as well people don't want allies context anymore exactly and we are very we are available we are we as comedians we are talking we are ourselves we are not playing a character so if you take if I take your jokes Joe out of context from your specialness yes I can get some some clicks oh yeah for sure if I want but I think people are getting tired of it and now they understand the process yes but what I felt was the beginning of that mm-hmm especially in your country yeah where you don't have a long history of stand-up yeah so that's why I lost money and that's why I lost a lot of money you're the motherfucking Lenny Bruce of Brazil yeah man you know someone who gave me the back credit in the future but no now you want to be now Rafi in America no no not only that but that's why what people say to me and what I felt was that there I was a lot of people said I was using this freedom of speech argument to offend people right will you hear that in America too and which was not the case but there is a matter of freedom of speech yeah because we had a law yeah in Brazil a long time ago where people are like trying to regulate comments on the web oh if I feel offended I can ask someone to delete that so the Gov the government was trying to regulate that yeah and and the law was approved well like after it wasn't approved but the law was like changing after the voting but when it becomes at the end the government was when it was getting the time of the voting the governor was like okay what about if I takes some tweets as well that offend me so the government tried to get into the weight of things so it is a matter of fairness which when this is gonna end it becomes with the joke but maybe can end with the government shutting you up yes I have a friend in Venezuela a comedian friend his name is nacho he was he was kicked out of the country because some jokes he did whoa he can't go back he's living in Miami right now because if he goes back to Venezuela right now the government's gonna put him in jail or maybe kill him I don't know Wow what was his jokes about yeah I don't know well his joke was about but he was making fun of the government but then like one year after that he makes some jokes about people with Down syndrome and then the government felt that he hear the when he has to go to jail because of the Down syndrome joke they were using that thing to take him out of the streets so it's dangerous out there man it's not that easy to do comedy outside of America you built that freedom yeah you hear about it all the time people in other countries that say jokes and they get in trouble like there was something in Thailand there was something someone made a joke about the king and they locked him in jail and it's it's very dangerous where it's very dangerous very dangerous to speak out against the government yeah we're really really fortunate here so like for you when you see Americans complaining about freedom of speech over here not not being able to say whatever you want it's kind of a joke that's exactly what I feel it's just like if you want to be an asshole just deal with the consequences oh yes that's what I feel I'm an asshole right but when someone stopped me on the street say you're a piece of shit I was like yeah right but that's okay let's end there I am a piece of shit and that's what has to end you know yeah don't take it personal that's what I feel that is is difficult to do comedy out there and here you have this freedom of doing it and I think is is beautiful it's beautiful something guys built do you think that it's going to change in Brazil and then maybe the the stand-up comedy could actually see cuz one of the things that happened in America is that Lenny Bruce because he didn't just tell jokes he actually talked about social issues on stage it actually expanded people's ideas of what these social issues are and and how critical they are it changed culture in a lot of ways and jokes one of the things about stand-up comedy that does help to change cultures say if you have an opinion and I have an opinion if your opinion is different than mine you say something I'm like well I don't agree with that I think this but if you say something and you make me laugh even if I don't agree with it it sneaks in my head like you have a point if your point is so good that it makes me laugh even if I don't agree with it like god damn it he got it he got in there so you can propagate ideas yeah inside someone's consciousness you can you could sneak them in we have a few people doing it in Brazil some only I used to have this TV show called CQC and we used to do comedy in Congress we used to go and interview congressmen and make fun of them and we got a kicked out of the Congress and we again then people brought me brought us back to the Congress but all you all reach the point when it's about money and if the and if someone is not willing to put money in your product you don't do it and money is connected to politics and politics and brands and the TV stations for you to have a TV station in Brazil you need authorization by the government so you're not that completely free to do what you want to do it but but you have some people doing it and comedy is getting is getting big stand-up is getting huge in Brazil you disconnected to YouTube I have a lot of big comedians doing like huge theatres I used to do like 5060 eaters in Brazil so it's it's becoming it's becoming an option Wow 5,000 yeah theaters yeah Wow do it man you do it yeah Wow she's - like 10,000 - but what I'm saying is it's crazy that you started out doing like a sadomasochistic that's pretty amazing that's what I built with some friends and I feel that I'm proud of that to open this this this discussion and this chance because I have a lot of people doing it right now getting money out of it my comedy club we pay well comedians every time they go on stage like here they get like 10 bucks yeah but it's ok we consider that as a business over there and that's that serious and this is awesome that's fantastic that's so cool you started that I mean that's got to be really a good feeling to know that all these people that are doing it now that are professional comedians like you you took the first steps yeah yeah I feel proud man that was a lot of people that throw that I probably have all of them watching this right now I don't know anyone who has ever done it in one language and then made it over in America afterwards I'm trying to think I can't think of any I don't think anybody in English oh yeah I don't I can't think of anybody that started out in another country and then made it in America what is the name of the Russian guy they always do the cool doing the communist thought they used to say Yakov Smirnoff yeah yeah great guy he I think he is Russian yes he's Russian but I think he's been over here most of his life uh I don't think he started in Russia I think his whole I didn't deny they say yeah his whole thing yes so he was doing like a character no no no he speaks I mean he definitely speaks Russian okay and he definitely is from Russia but he definitely plays it up too and he you know he's been over here forever he has his own theater in what is that place where those old folks live Branson Branson Missouri yeah it's like one of those weird like super religious places yeah yeah like they it's a strange area just very strange like like you talk to people about it and Branson Missouri people go you're like it's it's not a place where like Dave Chappelle goes to play do you go through those plays no I do not there's only so many places I go I don't have any time to I don't want to you know I'm not trying to run uphill No yeah you don't get it that's alright I'll go to Chicago okay yeah yeah this is just I don't have time but now what I like concentrate on now I mean the grounds already been broken right I'm not breaking any new ground all I'm trying to do is write good stuff write good material do good work and I'm just trying to make people happy I'm trying to make them laugh that's all I'm trying to do I just try to when they go and they get a babysitter and they come to a comedy club I want to do my best that's all I want to do so that's all I think about do you see a lot of like movie offers and anymore I tried it a little bit it's just not my thing okay it just takes time it's not necessary and all my friends that do it you know I got my friend Brian just called me from a movie set the other day goes he goes you're so right fuck this because I'm sitting in my trailer for 16 hours he's like a fucking hate this shit I don't want to do this I just got another offer for another movie that's not that good and I don't want to do that either you know you could you could do a movie and put so much effort and time and do it no one will see it like maybe it'll be opposite some fucking big Avengers movie and nobody goes to see your movie and it's out of the movie theater and yeah I spend so much no one cares no one the thing about movies - that's interesting is there's so many of them it's not like you're ever gonna see all the movies there's so many movies in every week there's new movies if you really stop and think about how fucking insane that is there must be thousands and thousands and thousands of movies you can't possibly see them all like if you just want to be entertained like you could see movies to the end of time you could just sit in front of your fucking Netflix and just till your eyes fall out of your head watching movies it's crazy it's almost no need to make more movies we're good in this crazy yeah and it's busy because movies are getting bigger and bigger and bigger because they have to bring you something that takes you out of your house yes yeah people don't go to the movie to watch Adam Sandler anymore you want a fucking superhero kicking your face and coming in your neck yeah they was fucking huge stuff yeah there's that but then people do need comedies like Kevin Hart movies they still sell really well like people still want to see something funny you know that's people still need it's one of the things about stand-up and one of the things about funny movies too is that people need a break from the grind of life life is a horrible grind you know it's fucking hard man it's hard to pay your bills and get up every morning to a job you don't want to get up to and maybe you're not even into being married anymore and you got to fucking stretch through that because maybe you have a children and you decide that it's better to stay for your children and you're fucking living in hell and your neighbors a cunt and the dog won't stop barking and and then you just need something just something give me something give me something funny my friend that's why I'm so optimistic in life is that what what a chance I have of pursuing my dream yeah and doing comedy making people laugh and having fun and don't have to sit in a fucking fucking share for eight hours a day and then with a job that I don't like because if you like to be an accountant that's okay yeah be happy being an accountant sure but he was never for me yeah he was never for me you know it was never for me either or any comedian that I know everyone that I know was like doing something and living in hell until they decided to be a comedian or the thought of doing something else but you know that's that's the path of life right the path of life is for some people what we do would be hell you know for some people that are introverts or that they don't like attention and they they don't like public speaking and they don't they're not necessarily funny what we do is hell they if you're wearing a funny person you don't know how to make people laugh and you have to go onstage and make people laugh every night that's your job like I'm and you have to try hard or there's some sort of pain involved fuck that be hell see that was that wasn't me the last few shows that I did in boroughs ooh I felt I felt heavy heavy if everyone's watching you yeah I fell I fell that the energy I still have very lawyer artists and I'm law they love me and I love them we still have that connection but I felt exposed not exposed and that's when you this is after the baby fuck Joe yeah if after me becoming a baby fucker but at the time that was funny right when you said it many laughs they laugh a lot yeah that was not the case my friend if you take this joke out of context yeah and put it in a newspaper even me when I read that I was like this guy is fucking smashed up the rape joke that I did when I read on a newspaper my rape joke man do you really want me to go to and he was bad he was something like I was watching TV and I don't I'm not proud of that okay but I was watching TV this woman and she was saying that she was raped and it was bad it was a very bad experience you she was crying but the camera wasn't showing her face he was just showing her mouth and she has a huge mustache like a huge mustache like fucking a lot of hair and I made this joke about this guy he was it this was this was the kind of a gift because she didn't she wouldn't have another opportunity or something but I did once I was just testing the joke right I was doing at 1 o'clock at night in my comedy club it was like 20 people in the audience so you're just fucking around I was just fucking around well it was what I saw on TV and so they were waiting for you to do something like that and it was like this journalist was was there and he was doing a story for the Rolling Stone oh and I was doing yeah we were sorry about me and then the cover and it wasn't in the cover but the picture on the whole new stone was me dressed as Jesus like bleeding with a crown in my head and there was the in the in the text was this rape joke it was a rape joke I didn't even write the thing I was just like talking with the audience right but when - that was taken out of context it was hard for me to explain it I'm ok this is was me fucking around with like 20 people but the people couldn't see the difference between me doing and it wasn't a good joke at all it's not as something that I'm proud of but when you're on stage and you're testing sometimes just shit comes up right and I was testing boundaries as well I think was my duty to test some stuff yeah there's things that you say where you're not thinking them out because you're ad-libbing in the moment they come out even you disagree with them as you're saying horse but this is part of the process of creating material especially if there's 20 people in the crowd it's late at night like you do things just to see you go down doors you open doors if you don't know what's in there and sometimes you'll say something and then you'll have the fucking perfect line and it comes out of nowhere and the only way you find out is if you take a chance to win it yeah that's why I think it's so fair and I was having a discussion with two great big comedians about the Louie set that he did like instantly yeah and I think he already talked about this but the guy was testing stuff yeah so how can you judge if the work is not done it's not even close done he probably maybe it did that bit once before if that you know and the judgement was like oh he has to address what happened with him I'm pretty sure he will but not on that set maybe he didn't address on that said that's not his special right when he has a special that's when he framed the thing okay that's my work yeah but if he's just testing stuff you cannot judge by that but the problem is now everybody wants to judge everything he does and they want to find him and watch him and so now he has to institute this cell phone policy that all the comedy clubs he works out what you have to take your phone and put it in a bag so that no one can get ahold of it it's just it's a real problem he's got a real problem and it's also a real problem for creating comedy because if people don't understand that that's this is what comedy is about that comedy is about improvisation and then boiling it down to what's good and then figuring out what's the best way to express an idea because sometimes you have an idea and you know there's something there but you don't know how to say it so you just take a chance on one way and then you go offensive that's disgusting but there's got to be a way to do it when they find a better way yeah of course yeah there's many bits that I did like not my last special but the special before where when I first started them they were not doing well at all they were not doing well at all I had to figure out a way to make them funny why did he was ceased on them because I knew there was something there was I noticed something there like for instance I have this one bit on women and inventions and that women don't invent a lot of things and it took a long time for me to figure out how to do that and the best way to do that was to talk about all the great things about women first so I just had I had to talk about you know like the concept that women are supposed to work that we should that women are supposed to work as well as raise children which is fucking crazy because raising children I'm not saying that every woman should raise children and that they shouldn't have a career but if you if you think that it's easy to raise children you're out of your fucking mind it's one of the most difficult things in the world to just to have the patience you're dealing with these little people you have to teach them things you have to Rick you have to give them love and constant attention and it's very very time-consuming it's difficult and these women are making people in their fucking bodies it's the most incredible thing that anyone has ever created humans you make you make humans in your body I mean that's insane and I would go through this whole thing and then I'd say so ladies I love you I think you're amazing but let's be honest you don't invent a lot of shit - this whole thing about women inventions and then I just talked about all the great inventions that women make okay you saddle different yeah figure out how to do it took a while to figure out how to do it where the women thought it was funny okay where I gave them enough honest legitimate credit and said funny things about them that are positive first so then they feel free to laugh yes I'm not a dick I just have a point that women don't invent a lot of shit to say I don't invent anything that I had to get really clear about that let's be clear we're not talking about us I go look I'm a fucking moron I'm never invented shit and I'm guessing you're probably pretty dumb too which is why you're here listening to me talk okay I was like we're not talking about us we're talking about inventors and so I was trying to remove people from the tribal male versus female dynamic just to talk about the fact yeah that in history there have not been like relatively a lot of women inventors got it and so then they fell and then they laughed then it was funny it was like it worked out great it was my closing bit is the same thing with this the joke that translated from Portuguese to English and I didn't have any problem doing this in Portuguese because we don't have that much she's talking about race and stuff it was not that one the n-word but it was a joke that I used to do that I was like I saw this guy with a t-shirt written a 100% black must was proud of his race run but I pointed to the palm of his hand and said 99% smile that's a 98% and I hid this joke just translated it's like this little right yeah yeah so this is a case of joke that I translate it works yeah because it's where reading has a good punch line it's is everything but people feel very comfortable who not the black people the people that sit around the black guy that was that was that was he was like laughing do you think it's funny because all of those people they didn't feel that they were entitled to laugh around you this kind of funk it was uncomfortable right but when I sat up as you know what you talk about race too much and we don't have that in Brazil so sometimes there's some misunderstandings with right I don't so when I put myself in that position then I'm just just a mistake that's what I when I when I'm free to do the same thing that you did yourself in a different way well that's that's a really interesting angle to that really only someone from another country can pursue that this angle that like you have the America is a different culture than you used to so what's probably so many differences oh yeah there's a lot of differences in Kardashians I don't know how you guys squashed that shit it's just like Sonia is like for cheeks fucking hanging around then we are like they're so silly nothing to it the celebrity thing yeah fucking that's that's amazing do you have Instagram celebrities and YouTube celebrities in Brazil same kind of thing yeah yeah we do have a lot of and people playing video games and kids my kid watch three people playing video games right yeah same thing it's huge over here yeah I know people make millions of dollars playing video games crazy like parents tell their kids don't be a loser play video games but like wait what are you talking about these kids are making millions of dollars what is a loser you work all fucking year for 50 grand and this guy is making five hundred thousand dollars a week planned YouTube yeah playing fucking videos using Twitter it's fucking crazy and YouTube gives give you much more money that it does in Brazil but we have the same speech of like I have my Jesus YouTube channel called you Barbados in Brazil and we are having a lot of problems with we are getting not monetizing your videos it's the same thing we are suffering to the same problems that well they don't know exactly what to do because advertisers are very wary about certain content and so they have these deals of these advertisers and so they're trying to suppress content because they don't want to minimize they don't want to lose revenue mm-hmm so what they're trying to do is make advertisers happy but then the content creators feel like they're being censored they are being censored but they have to understand what's happening here like this this all this stuff costs money do you get some of your videos all the time yeah all the time yeah they get D monetized they get D monetized if we talk about specific subjects or subject yeah no yep yep but not even showing images just talking about the subjects just subjects and we've talked about them and we've we've complained about a little but basically I mean Jamie we kind of take this attitude was nothing we could do we just kind of keep on truckin you could just go in it yeah because you're building much more danger yeah that money it's not the euro I mean it's something it's money and you know it could be thousands of dollars for each one that they don't monetize but that's not how I I don't think about it that way I think about it like well what's important what's important is just say what's on your mind and whatever I'm not gonna change just so that I get more YouTube ad money said that would ruin whatever I'm doing so I think they're gonna work it out in a better way eventually but is also a thing called YouTube red and with YouTube red even if things get demonetized the people that are paying for YouTube see you pay for you to read so you never get any advertisements and the you still like if you get a certain amount of people that are I think 50% of our revenue comes from YouTube read that somewhere yeah it said to vary the video to video yeah the time watched kind of cumulative okay yeah so there's there's a lot of people are saying look I'd rather pay X amount of dollars per month and don't don't put any ads mm-hmm so I think we're moving towards that that sort of that model what do you understand the process as well that is brands yeah and they're paying the bills you know what Google is not a Tom free isn't a free cause it's all all of it is expensive and they're trying to make money too so like the only reason for them to allow someone like you or I to put a video up is they want to be able to profit from it so it means they're not providing a service just because they're they're good people they're trying to make money yeah but the thing which is it is easier for us is that our revenue comes for shows and we can do a lot of different stuff they actually get their money from you too yes and that's the one that are getting hurt well in the United States the real issue is conservative speakers because all these tech companies whether it's YouTube or Facebook or what-have-you they all lean left they're all very left-wing so right-wing people feel like they get censored off of all these platforms before other ones maybe less on Facebook right because Facebook they they actually make money off of people paying attention to shit so the more people argue about stuff probably the more more eyes they get there were the money that they get the most of their money is people paying you paying Facebook to promote their company yeah it's not like yeah and Facebook doesn't you don't make money off of Facebook right is there anybody making money off of Facebook blog posts or yeah yeah there's people there's monetizing videos videos very recent but not like writing like say if you wrote an essay they wouldn't pay for that specifically right but that's where like there's a lot of a lot of people like to comment on things and argue about things and so if you have something controversial on Facebook that's probably value in because you're gonna get more eyeballs right there's a lot of value in controversy it's just like what kind of controversy so for YouTube the big thing is they like if you have like well specifically Twitter Twitter's been they've had big issues with it Instagram not so much with conservative people right you don't hear that as much I don't think so no it's more of a Twitter YouTube thing and it's conservatives feel like they're being pushed out because almost overwhelmingly all the tech companies are liberal they're all very left-wing and very Pro gay rights trans rights like there's a there's an example this one woman who's a feminist who said that a woman is not a man or a man is not a woman so like a trans woman she used to be a man and turn into a woman her take is a man is never a woman okay this is just and so they told that you got to remove this she removed it and apparently took a screenshot of it and posted it up again she's like okay I'll delete that and she took a screenshot and then post it again like fuck you okay and so then they banned her for life and now she's suing that woman Megan what is her name I forget her yeah I got it right here cuz someone just sent me something the Sam Harris just sent me something about it today her name is Megan Murphy so she's a feminist and she's just like look you can't just become a woman fuck off no and so they're like you're banned for life and then everybody's like well you're crazy you can't ban her oh she's got an opinion mm-hmm how come she can't have that opinion like if that's a biological opinion I mean it might be controversial it might be rude it might be insensitive but it's the same process Joe is the same thing that I lived in Brazil's like the sponsor doesn't want you to say that how can you argue it I don't think that's a sponsor issue because this is Twitter because I don't think that's a sponsor sure I think this is a left-wing corporation okay they've decided to censor certain type of speech that they think is offensive and she was apparently saying it to the person who was a trans person like a man is never a woman and by saying that to the trans person they're saying that it was like targeted harassment but don't you think that the end of this process it is about my because you think Twitter cared that much I saw the Twitter guy here for me did a look that he care about much about about about the speech side of things because there are companies so they they have to pay their bills and they have to bring sponsors and even brands are more left side here in this country because that's where it's sensitive right because that's where you can you can get boycotted I think there's definitely something to what you're saying there but I think also well yeah if you're a CEO of a major corporation like Twitter or something like that you're responsible to your stockholders you're responsible to all the people that work on the board your truck your if you want to stay CEO you gotta continue to make more and more money every year you gotta bring more people to the platform make the platform more popular and make more money and in their eyes the way to do that to maximize that is to limit harassment limit thinks this these are our social decisions but they're also business strategies there's two different things together at the same time yeah so it's it's fucking complex it's tricky yeah and they don't know what the fuck they're doing this is uncharted territory though there's never been a thing like Twitter before there's never been a thing like Facebook before we're complete uncharted territory in 2019 but it's amazing man it is amazing to see people like you and me creating our own channels we are all NBC's oh yeah so we don't have to depend on that that much you just you feel free that's when creativity comes up that's when people are is start to be creative that's when new stuff that's so it becomes a threat as well well when you stop and think about the sheer impact like what what was the number that our channel got in terms of minutes watched what was that number looked for for the year for last year it was 16 point 1 billion minutes watch that's more than every human on the planet watching a minute think of that isn't it way more that's more than double every human on the planet watching for a minute yeah I guess you have some fans but that's not even that it's just that's the the impact the impact of that is insane you know negative and positive prone on all of it the whole thing it's like the amount of content that gets put out there and the amount of interactions and the amount of debate that comes from that content it's just it doesn't make any sense and for me the only thing I could do is just walk away I don't know what the fuck's going on I just throw it out there and get the fuck away from it you don't read anything you read shit I couldn't you know you get caught up in all of it you would get caught up in the negative or maybe even worse caught up in the positive yeah people kiss your ass you start believing it so I just put I try to be humble and if there's an overwhelming negative reaction I hear about it having to try to adjust and address it and and respect the I'm in this unique position where I do have this weird sort of platform also talking about the that you thought that you were in that informed to do the the Twitter guy yeah that's why I brought Tim Poole in because T seems like he's a good friend as well I met him in Brazil yeah he went there to cover our protests oh really yeah now he's a legitimate investigative independent journalist and a real honorable guy and honest and intelligent and well-informed so I knew he was the perfect guy and we're gonna do some other things he and I we've got something that's gonna blow people away when that happens yeah yeah it's the message that you're going all wrong as I was like yeah yeah yeah I can't talk about it right now but we've got something cooking that might you have changed well they're in school right now see the thing is yeah this happens while they're in school and then comedy happens while they're asleep so have it down to a science you do yeah so what it is is they go to school okay I get up with them say either I take them to school or my wife takes from school and then I go either work out either I do yoga or lift weights or jujitsu or whatever in the morning then I come here I'm done in the afternoon then I hang out with them until it's time to eat we eat dinner and then after dinner they go to bed they go to bed like eight o'clock I don't do a set until 10:00 so I leave the house after that and then you know my wife is happy to get rid of me come to the comedy store hangout and then I so it works I got it down to a science nice yeah I wanted yeah that's the life that I wanted unfortunately my wife left well you were talking about that if you want to talk about that I do I don't because it's kind of a crazy story I actually saved these all stages on my Netflix oh really yeah yeah my wife left before a cult she joined a cult it was crazy but it's like one of those self-help call yes but it is a cult there's a lot of cults it's very dangerous when one person starts telling another person how you must live your life these are the principles this is what you have to do you have to leave your family you have to quit your job you have to change the way you dress you have to change the way you talk you have to do this and do that when someone tells you that and they get a mass group of people to do things like that it becomes very dangerous sometimes this is not that direct right sometimes it's just like okay what was difficult is that her cult was teaching her that you gotta love everybody the same which is awesome if you think about it Jesus did that I think was the only one who did that right Jesus was the only one who was like I don't care I'm not gonna have kids right I'm gonna date this prostitute over here and that's okay that was his life and for my was she she got when you learned that you when you learned that you have to love everybody saying why are you going to focus is just one man in a marriage and you have to go home and you kind of leave your life to yourself mm-hmm or maybe she didn't love me anymore and I'm fucking buying the baby there too that's what some people are very easily influenced you know that that is a real real issue and I worry about that sometimes when I talk to people because like some people say hey man well they say hey you changed my life I'm like listen motherfucker I didn't change shit you changed your life they're like oh I don't even know you I did not change your life don't listen to me all I'm doing is talking to a bunch of people all these people have something to offer everyone has something to offer but it's not me I'm an antenna okay I mean if I'm saying something that resonates with you and it helps you I'm very happy but don't listen to me like I know everything I think is awesome that you do that but you because you'll know the power that this have and how you could actually influence if we be influenced in their lives very careful of people that do tell you that they have the answers and they are the one and they're the smart ones yeah and you need to listen to them because that those people are fucking dangerous because they can get you to do things that are irreversible they can get you to leave your family they can get you to you know to join this fucking commune and give up all your worldly belongings then you realize years later where they're fucking crazy like that wild wild country documentary that we were talking about crazy these they didn't rely mean these people were Hollywood fucking executives and producers millionaires no people that look like on paper they have their life in order and they want to go and wear the red clothes and the beads and and and be a part of this fucking movement people need a reason to leave people needs an explanation for things that they cannot explain yeah and when there's someone that have no thinks that they know the answers they can they can lie because it's the easies it's not gonna have someone that is going to say if it's true or not yeah that's also the danger of a platform and that's a danger of something like even this podcast a danger of any platform any time we have one person that's talking in front of a microphone and everyone else is listening it's a it's it's a weird position to be in and you hear this person through your earphones or through your computer screen and you start thinking that that they're making sense and that they're right because there's no one to counter what they're saying in front of them there's no one with opposing opinions there's no one and you you can get written they can get wrapped up in this position of being a leader as well people get intoxicated by being a leader you know being I mean I've seen it with people that just teach martial arts a lot of martial arts classes turn into like very cult-like places I noticed that especially before the UFC came around because everyone really legitimately believed that their martial arts instructor could kill everyone on the planet everyone really believed that in there like the 80s and the 90s Royce teach them that it was not through boys boys Gracie changed the fucking world he really did he changed the whole world and he changed our perception of what martial arts are and what's effective and what's not but before that I mean I grew up in a Taekwondo school which was very discipline and everything everyone was sir like you would call everyone mr. Smith or you know mr. O'Malley everyone mr. Kim yes sir if someone said something to me I would always say yes sir yes sir and it was always bowing it was very strict and very disciplined and I came from a very good school but I was around a lot of schools that weren't good I saw a lot of very cult-like behavior there was a lot of men who would take advantage sexually of their students and they would you know they would do weird shit to their students and they would be almost like running a little sex cult talking about your karate school articles kung fu schools that's crazy we all knew about that and some of them wound up going to jail I knew I knew guys that went to jail they went to jail for rape yeah and they there was people that like they were in these positions of power where their students looked at them like a god and they took advantage of it and this is uh this is the same thing it's the same thing as what we're talking about here when one person has too much power and influence in a platform one of the beautiful things about jiu-jitsu is its informality like when like my instructor John Jacques Machado he's the friendliest nicest guy he's a world champion I mean he's super respected by all but when you beat him was like hey hugs and claps and he doesn't ever pretend to be any of any roles with everybody it trains with everyone so it's like the informality and the brothership and camaraderie in the family environment that is fostered by Brazilian jiu-jitsu is very unique in martial arts and that I think is very important because the respect comes from their their ability and from leading by example it doesn't come from some fake position of being some master of the death touch in some all-knowing person who top of the mountain we all thought our instructor could kill everyone on the planet we really did and when the UFC came along for a lot of people that was a just a bucket of cold water thrown in your face like whoa that little skinny guy just choked out all those big giant people what the fuck man so and they were doing that for a long time in Brazil like in beaches and going to houses and going to gyms and just kicking people's faces okay yeah I mean look they changed what martial arts are they really did they boiled it down to what's most effective and they they took ground fighting and they turned it into this perfect sort of blend of leverage and technique and knowledge and repetition and training and and they just they revolutionized joint manipulation and strangling people they revolutionized it they changed it it - it's a totally different thing there was always submissions in judo there was always catch wrestling which had a lot of great submissions that are still to this day but to put it all together like like Elio did and Carlos and all the the gracie clan I mean what Brazil did for martial arts is probably one of the single most significant things that's happened in the thousands of years of people fighting each other pretty amazing yeah pretty amazing but at the same time that was those guys will shoot your box just fucking meat and I shit out of each other the shit out of each other there was a an article that I read recently where Wanderlei was talking about the you know he's having difficulty now because you know he's had so many war as he fought for so many years and that he went to some sort of conference on concussions and CTE and he had 13 of the 15 symptoms yeah yeah and he was talking about I forgets things is he's impulsive all these different symptoms he had and then the very next thing he said is but I want to fight Vitor Belfort like it fun delays crazy he went my dog show in he's crazy he decided not to go like two minutes before he goes and has changed his mind and he's sweet but at the same time he's right-wing now he was just he tried to go he become a politician really he went to be elected but no nobody voted oh just like him wouldn't no one can you see on like Congress that's good brazil gets it yes America it's dangerous happens in Brazil to celebrities forever one of our one of our most famous congressman's it was a big brother oh no that big brother show so ridiculous it is the worst way to become a celebrity one of the most watched shows in Brazil that's crazy nobody why don't people watch that much here the due date I don't know anymore they don't think so for sure what crazy thing was Omarosa Omarosa who was one of the big she was a big statue the White House Brandes yeah before that she was on fear factor I when I was the host I didn't know I had a fucking altercation with her on fear factor not a bad one but she accused me being drunk oh she was like because I was asking her questions like that doesn't make sense you joke you're drunk I'm like I'm not drunk you can't just say I'm drunk she was ridiculous she was the fear factor before The Apprentice no she was on something else first before the apprentice I think that was it was she on the apprentice and then fear factor come on yeah was fear factor before the apprentice same time just before she got famous for being on the apprentice she was like the second season maybe yeah did I think she was on another show first and then the apprentice she went to another reality show after different is I don't know who I remember that yeah well the crazy thing is she went from the White House to Big Brother she was actually on the first season of The Apprentice Oh what year was that so she was on Celebrity Fear Factor we we had a thousand three two okay so she must have been on fear factor like 2005 yeah she's nice though she's just but I would she stole me I was drunk what she wasn't elected right she wasn't on line she was appointed by Trump but Trump gave so here's what's fucked up here's what's really I was reading an article about the what the problems with what she did when she was in the Situation Room and these secured White House rooms she had her fucking phone recording so she's sitting there recording shit in the middle of these these like totally secure rooms she's record like Trump is talking she's got her phone there hmm interesting and she's recording everything on her fucking fault and she's like hours and hours of footage of record recordings rather which you're not supposed to do it's like you could be literally Russians and Chinese and the Iranians and all the anybody that wants to tune in could hack into her fucking phone turn the microphone on and this is absolute proven technology and they're using that to listen in the middle of the Situation Room so if there's some sort of top-secret shit that's going on some foreign entity could be listening in through her phone while she's recording I don't think they I don't think they need all that they just called Trump and asked what happened but I mean he's he allowed her this you know I don't know if she's unstable but she seems a little hospitable to that's a such a very dangerous thing to do you're not even supposed to bring your fucking phone in those rooms and for her to be recording recording everything it's okay this is so crazy but so selfish to like if you are acting the best you're in a position when you're working for the White House you're working for Donald Trump he's the President of the United States the biggest superpower in the fucking world and you were just recording things god I know that you want to serve yourself I know you want to help yourself out but god that seems so crazy you do I mean if you were Trump and you hired her and you found out she was recording everything in the Situation Room he must be like oh like in conferences with like like they're talking about important policy and she's got phone recording and anybody could be listening but if you think about it like it's crazy for him - he - give her some some credibility yeah because she was an apprentice seal I didn't think about it okay the president of nine states is a guy that was running a friendís so he liked her maybe not like well look she's very articulate she's good-looking woman she knows how to speak well she's got a lot of confidence and power he probably figured she'd be a great politician perfect I'm a great politician he's probably I'm the fucking president I'll make her she's gonna be my left hand lady or right hand lady it is not that it that difficult this in Brazil is not that difficult for famous people to get elected in the one they were running for a congressman cuz there's so many options if you're known and you get like one person of the voting you're already elected but if you go run for like a mayor or like a governor a governor or something it becomes a little tricky because there's like five options and now you're running against real politics real politicians who actually have a plan yeah so if you're running against like two hundred people you can shine a little because you're famous yeah we're starting to see a little bit more than America like Cynthia Nixon she was on Sex in the City and then she ran for which ran for governor in New York right oh yeah yeah so this there's a few that few that are starting to branch off into politics now it's I don't mean did it happen before Ronald Reagan because he was famous he's the most famous he I think he was a movie star he was a playwright yeah he was the first guy joking back to the future you mean like Ronald Reagan the movie star yeah yeah that was that was the first he was the first he was also the first that introduced the option or his his cabinet was the first they they got the people that his his team got the people from the religious right involved religion was not really a big part of voting before Ronald Reagan but Ronald Reagan and though that sort of kind of Republican they got all these Evangelic all Christians and evangelicals okay yeah as a same theme Brazil yeah what is going on with Brazil now with your president yeah if there's a huge connection between politics and the church right now the evangelical it wasn't that way before it was a little bit it was always something because Brazil is a very evangelical country right I don't know if you ever watched like watching in the middle of the night and return on your TV and there's this guy talking that he was like there's a demon that is running over my soul and there's like those TV shows called stop suffering yeah a sufrir okay it's more like for those Massacre audiences this churches everywhere so it is a Joel Olsteen in America he's a big time of Angelico Christian he sells out these giant arenas like 50,000 Peters yes yes but it's very it's it's it's huge in Brazil and they have like I don't know forty percent of the people is evangelical in Brazil I don't have the numbers right now but they sure the religious something huge over there mmm so it was something that's why we didn't evolve in a lot of different discussions like talking about abortion illegal in Brazil not legal not at all just if you're raped just if you're raped or if your kid has like a deformity deformity then you can have an abortion the woman's life is threatened yes yes that's the only cases and that discussion was never never happened because everybody's religious if you do like how do you say when you go public and you ask something to the people like do you have this here it's just like you have a kind of a test we have this in Brazil I don't know how do you say this in English a test yeah it's just a test are you against abortion or your whole a poll poll okay we can opinion poll yes if we do a poll in Brazil people will be against abortion against the legalization of abortion and against drugs like seven drugs and everything what about a morning-after pill now it is you can take that you can't get that I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know you I bought some so I didn't yeah in pharmacy so it's okay I think though I don't know I don't know but you can abortions not legal right so we are not having that discussion because now the president's connected to the church mm-hmm our ex-president call Lula he's in jail right now he's in jail was in jail he was involved in a huge corruption scandal scandal and he was like our hope because he was a poor guy so he was a government they actually helped the poor in Brazil he happened with him was he was involved he he had connections with different companies and different industries was giving him money and they have this thing called cassia boys is when you're doing a campaign you need to say how much money you're getting from all those different brands and everything so there's thing called cash alloys which is you get money you spend the money there's never went on any banks or anything like that so it's kind of a you hide that money mmm that were had that happens a lot in Brazil I don't know how to say this in English but it's something that you hide the money that you're getting for a company but if you get elected you kind of forgive them favors right you help them get like involved in a construction a huge construction they're gonna be the stadium then you help them somehow right that was what happening in Brazil so he's in jail now he's in jail and then he elected a woman in Brazil and she was impeached and now we have this right-wing guy called bosun ro he's our new president and a very right-wing and connected to the army and connected to the church so there's a lot of discussions and abortion and drugs and everything that we are not gonna have she's he popular yes yeah is he popular and also like hated as well yeah of course there's the left hate the guy you know did the things that he said he was like he was kind of crazy but you know people people loves him how long has he been the president he's gonna be for four years he was just elected he started just January okay you just started and we don't know what this is gonna lead us but the thing is at the same time he's more liberal because the left in Brazil all this talk about freedom of speech and everything else was in our left was running the country now we got this guy and he is more liberal and even talking about the way he's gonna run the country the economy and politics and speech and everything else so there's a little hope in their area as well so it's kind of tricky because it's danger in one area and it's kind of a hope in another one I wish I was saying this in Portuguese it would be so much easier but listen brother let's do a show together my friend any time listen I'm doing a lot of shows at The Improv The Comedy Store I'll have you all want to thank you my friend I want to see you do stuff like a little show at you that's cool and I just want to say thank you for
