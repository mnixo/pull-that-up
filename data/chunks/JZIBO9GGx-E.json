or four times not on and I yeah you crying who's so beautiful and your honey clothes okay Freddie took this fuckin tire hey don't be afraid okay what's happening to you - you're becoming a very different person I don't know baby it's much your very different person from when I met you you're much more thankful I just talk about energy and karma usually thing was all horseshit but you've you've kind of changed your tune all that you're like the idea that other people's experiences and life might be true even if it's not for me hmm is that what it is there's a lot of that and also like you know other things are out there I started seeing it sometimes it's just like it's easy you can you can you can cut somebody up in traffic not let them in that's my daily con I fucked that guy over or it's almost harder to fucking fit somebody in sometimes and you're like all right I could do I could fuck you over what is that good right but that doesn't mean you feel good makes you feel they let people in yeah sure it's me feel good to see this fucking wedding I'm not even into marriages but they had this wedding on stage live on stage and I got the lead singer Wayne Coyne he's just so fucking into it it's like by the power of the Flaming Lips I now pronounce you husband and wife and then I got really married right afterwards they got just as a piece there oh that's hilarious yeah and he's fucking loving it and watching and then he gets inside you to go get his one of those guns and shoot off confetti so he goes and runs behind I'm waiting for them to get married and shoots it off and wow this guy after he gets finished playing an hour and a half I'm sorry I just I'm changed by this fucking concert really he has his people these girls dancing in like Dorothy outfits and these boys dancing in Scarecrow Tin Man and lion outfits just sort of dancing and having fun us both sides of stage afterwards they get out of their costumes table very regular clothes these are people who gigs up in the audience right he talks to each one of them signs of TV more than one talks to each them for like 10 minutes he spent another hour and a half to two hours just long these people helped him out by dancing on stage that's cool and says like thanks guys have a good night which anyone would do right he's just I don't know it's Amit I'm gonna see them every time they're here it's an amazing concert that's cool man and what what is what turns you around and made you this real super positive person because you know deep depression was a lot of it a really good depression yeah that helped a lot it just started saying like what's going to make me happy I don't care about things I supposed to care about it's just like what's gonna make me feel good right now what happened somebody over doesn't it's hard being a comedian man in that sense that you you know you kind of are on your own you know you're kind of making your own destiny and you kind of you know you don't have to think and behave the way everybody in the office does because there is no fucking life yeah they're kind of out there trying to sort out what what is acceptable so many of what so much of what we think of as acceptable is just patterns everybody just follows the pattern and that's what's supposed to make you happy I have a beer at the ballgame that doesn't make you happy well your fuck good luck but yeah you know so do something else that makes you happy so also know they have no idea what rest needs you just really focus on what the fuck it is that I like not what everybody wants me to like but what do I like yeah what and it's like if someone's gonna think I'm an asshole for doing that somebody's gonna think I'm weak for doing whatever it is like that's cool I don't care I just care about making me happy they used to even joke around about stage about being a terrible person else now I don't like that joke because you're not a terrible person I used to say like you're just kind of playing it up to make it seem make more sense the the state joke I talk you not to yeah absent some of the two is like I feel like a terrible person when I do these few things because I'm a good person so I feel horrible about a few things you might do right but even then the terrible things yeah whatever would they were never terrible things it was it was just sort of a method to get to them was to call yourself a terrible person but you can always be careful about how attorneys audience people go to have a good time they don't want to think they're having a good time it's terrible Cantus just viewing is fucking evil venom so it's working this took my ride what is the best I love I close in on me man Triana sting huh I know it's fucking because people know is editing that one of the beautiful things about the podcast that we have with Duncan is even if we cover the same ground we it's always differently never run out should to talk about there's always something you know there's always something to talk to can totally man I'd always goes it goes to crazy places and that never happens anywhere else yeah and you know there's something that went on today that I've been meaning to tell you but I never brought it up to you before and how much you've evolved since you've had like this real serious relationship man it's really interesting it's really interesting because like he's like you know when you're around a person and they're in this constant state of turmoil and doubt and then all sudden a big chunk of their life you know who you spend your time with who's your your love interest who yeah who's your confidant but also know that's been established in a good way it's like you're so free in all these other areas you're free to look at things a little more discerning eye all right well and you have really found your voice I think in you know since that it's really interesting thanks man that's really cool yeah it's really interesting to watch you know because I mean we've been friends for a long time and like you know everybody has relationship issues but you were always particularly disturbed by them like you would have them and you could sell you could tell it was just a crush on you just couldn't know it's so loose it's so hard to get over and then see the big picture you know when especially when you know someone breaks up with you or you know you thought it was going to work out that it falls apart you blame yourself it's like fuck so hard to like come into your own if you're alone now you know yeah that's true but you learn from that stuff man it's good to get completely disintegrated from time to time sure and then by the time you actually find someone that you really truly are compatible with you have a character you've gone through a bunch of different things and you understand the cause and the fact yeah the early warning signs you understand you know when the relationship going out what am I being a dick am I trying to push her away because I don't wanna hang out with her anymore what's really going on here right you know you once you get through that Matt it's very interesting that you've you you're always hilarious but you've really come into your own over like these last three years thanks man so really cool to watch me and Natasha actually broke up this morning we're on if you guys tell yourself they say pills yeah very dad is saying or electric fence either or both those a guy that just passed away his name is shawn tompkins he's a really nice guy man is a kick boxing trainer for a lot of my MMA fighters real wild do real fun guy from Canada bas Rutten disciple 37 years old man just died time to sleep yeah never workout part attack supposedly that's the latest different much clogged artery or something who knows you know it could be some congenital night Allen just didn't know he wasn't aware of it really crazy but uh he was a great guy so rested peace Shaun are we rolling ladies and gentlemen I'm here with Neal Brennan I just got done doing the pop guy I know Neal for a long time night night here yeah longeth oh uh yeah 92 to 90 men at the Boston comedy club and uh great know what I only used to think about you but that you would be a good action movie hero I really did I don't like what I didn't see you for a while like between the boston and new and your own news rain was like could be like a bios me Bruce well but I feel like they account you would look you went to defaulting with bad relationship choices yeah you wanted this one but yeah I always felt like you could have been in action Your Honor some guys that I saw that I thought he could be something and you didn't become that I don't know what that means but I have pretty good instincts about like I think he could be like a thing and then you you betrayed me I'm very sorry um yeah I would've never thought it would become a sports broadcaster that's the weirdest one ya know why I had a resort common did you ever go in for did anyone ever come to me for an action movie if you ever do like a shitty wanted to have a meeting with people when they were doing they were looking for the next Steven Seagal and Steven Seagal became famous this is before I've done anything and I was living in New York and I went in for this meeting and the guy was just like super douchey like his attitude about martial arts are just another thing I want to kick his ass it was just really Dicky and it was like like so tell me why should we like he literally was like well as Hollywood moon so tell me why should we tell women with you I go wow that really how we do this yeah this is what really what I said like that's really how you talk you kick back and you go so tell me how should we do move with you why should we do more with you tell me and he goes kicks back cross his legs like look because they think you're looking a date like that's gonna happen match they think it's gonna be like a story he came in I said oh I chose fucking yes yeah half exactly no and we knew he was their guy it was he was a douchebag I kept saying that what I don't like about movies someone does something absolutely ridiculous when a guy like runs and jumps and kicks two guys at the same time we had we talked about this was nuts the last time we were here that's why you make a very short action movies yeah we make very short realistic action movie I'd be MIAC salutely head butt slam to the balls thrown the ground stomp his head that's the movie right but you the best little time there's no exchanging blows yeah nobody quick nobody waits like Batman for that for one fight to end yeah they jump all you and they kill you and there's none my podcast the champs we talk about how like an we've got yeah thank you how we have three my three guys that I did with the two guys to do with how we would take Blake Griffin does any of you together yeah and my move was going to be I bite his love handle which is really paint like that's my brother one time you think that stopped him uh Mel he said he would just punch me yeah you and that I wouldn't stop you cannot hurt someone so much with a bite to love handle he's gonna kill you okay I'm in real trouble yeah I would say don't do that if you bit me I would I would kill you for sure cuz I know you'll be capable doing something really nutty like biting me I'd have to kill you why wouldn't you just bite balls - why would you go what loving my design hell did man but yeah you could really fuck someone's balls up through the pants and I think about yeah but by the time you get down there yeah I'm not going to let you buy my balls it's gonna take you a while to secure a ball biting position yeah you gotta find it hey is that shaft and I what is that Chad you bite a shaft yeah I've learned a thing or two along the way and I'm gonna implement them on you while you're trying to bite my cock and balls my cock and ball I would say no so that is a thing that people do though sit around thinking like how they look how would I do this guy was going to come after me brian has a very unique move to avoid rape in prison where he pretends he's gotta blow the guy they just pulls his dick off yeah just take the balls dig your fingernails in and run that's gonna work right it'll work once yeah I mean even work one if you got a guy with a big meaty cock you really thinking you pull that cock off with one yank counts one of those guys who I actually believe if you believe something enough he could make it so you don't even like he could believe he's like a you could pull a cop that like he if any if I had to bet that any one person could pull a cock off of a do a heart of an erect cock at that no it would be countless you can do it I just believe because we don't believe it if you gotta believe you don't worry Kalin would it's so delusional just as a person that I agree with balloon I know Bryan Callen enough to know that even if you believe that he could pull the COG off he could not pull the cock off so I know that you would believe that he could do it and I would sit there if I hear you and I would stand there I go he's not gonna be able to pull the cargo and he won't be able to pull the car off he'll grab it he'll believe to yank on it it's hard as fuck man it's hard to pull a dick off Blake Griffin do it how big is Blake Griffin he's huge in his hands are like twice he like 2:42 fatty some like that yeah he might be able to it's a little Chinese dick but it looks like such a big the cockiest sighs you know but I feel like the bigger it would be easier because you get torque like a cell but it's so much tendons ligaments and it's thick around it's connected more parts more cells are connected I mean I'm sure a soft dick is probably easier to rip off in a hard dick right yeah because you can rip it more there's more ripping motion where you could dig your nails and just rip the hole around your feet it's not elbow skin it's soft skins how this conversation it's great I wonder if I'm talking on the podcast and then great it's like making funny guy you probably could do it a real strong guy mariusz pudzianowski you probably put your cock off you know he is the strong man guy he's a well right yeah it takes like fucking three hires and jewels like I think stone ball yeah okay yeah that guy could probably pull your cock off that guy um but Brian I don't know if you can pull someone's cock off Kevin yeah let's find out prices on my podcast I may be one of the funniest podcasters were done I was by favor what I've done was pretty daunting I've never laughed that hard and I gotta be honest with you MVP award goes to Brian right you made me laugh so fucking laugh today there's I told Brian what do the lines uh needs like I said a poverty friend and it was even funnier because it was in contrast to the foaming dude so pony and a instead of a same time

Rogan so I come out all this yelling screaming one one that's the white people's maple the color might be always that's the Yana look at what boss's brother zero wizards Oh ladies and gentlemen I'm ready for this that's it today john Heffron the fucking house bomb on twitter that's two EPs two Ephron and then eight N&F like Tim Ferriss look at him he's a school boy he's gonna attack that Han he's ready to go I always feel weird when I wear a backpack in the airport always feel like a dork there's something about a backpack like if you sling it over one shoulder you kind of be like kind of casual a cool nobody likes comic books but you actually have a Honda like hey the same for the hostel yeah I still get the candle that is that's a tough flippin backpack - it looks sort of schoolboy ish Tim first came on the podcast today and we talked about so much cool shit man that was another one where people are gonna have to back up and write names down and books down what's he saying we just covered so much shit and though the thing that to trip me out the most was you talking about shoving that stuff up your nose and increasing your short-term memory and earned I suppress some Chinese when you were doing a Chinese character that's crazy man that's nuts I've never heard of a through the human machine that's wonderful then it really is man you you really have explored a lot of the more interesting aspects of that - man you've got an amazing amount of information when it comes to that stuff so pick up that book folks a 4-hour body and a 4-hour workweek are Tim's books and you can check out his website for our blog yeah for our blog Amazon obviously a couple thousand reviews so you can read the most amusing one stars those are my favorites did my stars yeah but whatever one star view is do not buy this book because he'll take the money to set a new Guinness record in strangling kittens you know I thought that was a secret you've done some crazy records like do you have a tango record the runner Elisha tango spins knighted things set 31 to 34 37 spins on Regis and Kelly actually the spins of one minute yet oh that is the record they do it in one minute with a partner who travels around you in a diameters but 1012 feet so weights more time with people thing how long did you learn how to do that well this is six months in Argentina more than eight hours a day of tango until my feet were black on the bottom how old are you 34 you've been everywhere - that's amazing how much how many different countries are you going - 35 I had to count them out because to get a visa for India they make you list every country you've been to in the last ten years even though the only thing they want to know is are you a terrorist for Pakistan so they could just ask you have you been to package never know they're like let's doubt every country lived in the last 10 years so I counted about 35 that's insane how do you have the time to do that that's amazing these days I used to bounce around on do short trips I found that tiring now I just like to relocate for a few months at a time if I'm going to do it at all so we'll see but I like I do like relocating it's like the first time I went abroad at all really was a year in Japan as an exchange dude and I was introduced judo that was right I lived with a Japanese family and when I relocate like that for me at least it shows me how much my behavior is just arbitrary like driving on one side of the street yeah let's say soaping down in a shower as opposed to before a bath I mean it's all just culturally reinforced and so I find it fun to look through my life again through a fresh lens when I get back to the US I think that's that's really fun yeah it's always amazed me how different cultures are when I've only been to maybe 6 or 7 different countries but like the difference between the way people behave in Brazil suppose the way they behave in Germany supposed to it you know it sounds amazing that it's amazing how people vary and how adaptable we are to both our environment culture and you just get used to certain things you know yeah well I remember staying with this German family and we were watching The Simpsons and because it's dubbed into German she's like oh the Simpsons are from the US like I thought it was German oh that's fun because they'd only seen it in German on German television do they how do they translate the jokes do you speak German I speak pretty mediocre German do I get the judge jokes don't translate I mean you know what I mean they just don't because they're so subtle and they're also like these weird cultural references to determine taxation do they have any stand up in Germany I've never seen stand up in Germany I've seen stand up in Japan which is cool there are additional Japanese standard where they've two guys like kneeling down or sitting on pads and their traditional kimonos and it's just two guys bantering back and forth that's stand up coming man yeah yeah it's very cool so it's all on the knees and come oh yeah yeah so though like do like the sort of judo Jiu Jitsu style kneeling on the feet and then they'll just sit there like a fan and whack each other on the head and do this banter back and forth also they always do it with another person yeah wow this looks sort of a bawd village yes sort of all apps they do a lot of slapstick katana slapstick ties it's weird how cultures like some culture that were you know it's a weird how like America is so stand-up comedy heavy you know so many stand-up comics come with a lot of them come from England a lot of them comfortably never hear about stand-up comics from Germany you know been one that used to come to the comedy store it was like famous in Germany he was like on a television show but he wanted to come to America to make it but everything he did was like crazy physical was all like flying through the air fall on his head it was always weird nutty shit pulling stuff out of bags smashing them together boys and sound effects it's like their sense of humors alien art yeah you and german sense of humor is very different from us for sure and it's dosis in english as human English sense of humor almost relies on a higher level of politeness than they currently enjoy fact their whole this the pacing of the humor everything reply relies on being the suppose they're polite is there any non-us place like kind of a scalp Wales UK ever like Britain is there anywhere outside of the US that produces consistently good comics Australia has some good ones Australian Australia has some Australia has some rugged cats you know they have some wild dudes so Australia is like it's make sense David people like that fucks give another thing right yeah that's like it makes sense yeah the daily like Jim Jeffries is a great comment he's from Australia there's another do that I forget his name but real funny guys from Australia there's a few they have a scene down there too we perform the Sydney they got a real comedy club down yes and he's a great city Australia's another place I would live apocalypse head that's a good move that's out there it's pretty far away not much of a target yeah except crocodiles fucking snakes and shit poisonous spiders and the fact that 80% of countries uninhabitable oh that's true yeah I think you can only live around the edges inside your goggle by people you'll get killed by their animal you might get killed by people on you might get killed by Aboriginal look at some Forex ladies gentle for our blog calm the Joe Rogan experience and then also miss grace if you would up if you think you would F marry kill red band Sam triply tees hoodie yeah pity marry pity kill like are you serious okay I know I know Sam would love to just grudge humper he's a big fan okay good to know okay we're moving on sorry about that um okay so apologize for that it's kind of live what's happen to you question okay so um so
