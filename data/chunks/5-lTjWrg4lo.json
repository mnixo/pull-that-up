[Music] the job experience I need a theme song it's time yeah 600 episodes I think it's yeah you haven't had that for the first one - yeah it's great I love it I used to like the tell Nick Diaz that if he doesn't win then you gotta get a theme song but I would never take his his voice off the theme song we'll do a neat new theme song and then I'll incorporate his voice that was one of the coolest moments of my life Diaz wins he's get his hands up in the air it's like train by day Joe Rogan podcast was like that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me next to the birth of my children it's right up down Wow so we're all here because we're friends and this is an intervention Duncan you're gonna you're gonna re tell them about the demons tell them what happens yeah I don't know if you know this when Jews note that when people masturbate they're actually fuckin a demon that's on top of you yeah but you can't even see when your comic comes into our belly you have demon babies the only way to get the Jews out of my body is to jerk off Jews oh yeah bleed a minute the only way to get the Jews out of your body runs out of my body oh you have to mean like sometimes I get possessed by demons they swell up in my chest and they cause my penis to expand and to change shape you know I'm talking about it's very strange I've seen that becomes like the Stay Puft Marshmallow guy yeah so you get demons - yeah it sucks a movie the only thing that gets the demon out is if I jerk off a semitic man and then when i do that i see the demon come out of my penis in the form of this white salty substance to normal famous no it stays like crazy crazy aggressive yeah that's always screaming howling at night so we're here so this is not having the news show on Comedy Central Ari Shaffir officially a baller just had his new Comedy Central our special yeah paid regular that was the coolest shit man The Comedy Store was tweeting photos of the red band tweeted some to of the patio the filled party everybody out there watching your special on TV while you were performing in the O war that was the craziest picture Jeff Scott Yoshi picture yeah on stage live at the store and on stage and my special was from that same page and you know what's even cooler people come to see you now I think your new material now some of the best shit you've ever done it's right up really the best bits you've ever done the new shit that you're doing now is stuff you did in Vegas it's fucking great man it's really funny shit what of it keep swinging you know I get about 40 right now it's uh but it's 40 that I don't I don't know it that well yeah now it's still ever-evolving like you say Jarvis his friend Jarvis my friend - Jarvis he's to say that bits were like um like cooling metal or cooling honey so it was like real fluid and then as it gets cool it takes like more and more shape until it becomes like the same thing every time that's cool yeah I remember that I never I don't remember you told me you're a talent coordinator you told me that that's an interesting way to look at it I've always felt that they grow though I always felt that they're a living thing when they become sturdy like they start off as like little saplings and they're like oh sometimes they look impressive and sometimes they come sometimes they come out they're fucking trees there's certain bits that I've done that we're already a tree before they ever got to this stage like the vegan bit that was just on my last special I wrote that bit all after one conversation did you name that bit Jamie kill sting - Jay to kill things well now Jamie kill sting and believe even though he talks a lot about being a vegan he's not preachy about it and he also admits that he ate a lot of meat he's a bad example that Jamie tells 10 gets a bad rap and part of its because the conversation that he and I had on the show but Jamie kills teen I think you're a good dude I really do I think he's a gen 8 he's a genuinely like what he's trying to do he genuinely thinks he's doing like really good things and he's just it was about the the Daniel Tosh rape thing you know Dan Tosh made that joke where he asked the audience what they wanted to talk about some guy yells out rape and Daniel Tosh starts saying like yeah what a great subject like what's so funny about rape is it the humiliation is that the violence some woman says actually nothing is funny about rape and he goes wouldn't be funny in five guys just rape here right now what man it became this big Sammy well first of all that's the kind of shit that happens at a goddamn comedy club ya know we all know that and the guys just trying to be funny while he's on his toes on a stage in the spur of the moment yeah that's like a non-issue yeah Jamie and I disagreed with it heavily cuz he felt like it's lazy and you felt like you contributed to rape culture which is a term that like gets bandied about it's a it's a weird term you know some people think it's a horseshit term you know there is no rape culture it's a real thing that's why if you see the Indian comics the from India and stuff they're super rape jokey you know that's all that that's pretty much like all our comics just talk about rape and gang rape and then really dude they're Indians here India they're brown is fuck there's a giant movie industry there yeah their movie industry is bigger than our movies super corny right there's not always long sex scenes if you consider juggling fruit and singing in between a gun fighting the scene morning it's like all their movies still have lose like all numbers are like they will stop in the middle of a real action movie when I went to India we would like we would take valium and go to this movie theater in New Delhi and just watch their movies because they're so trippy but yeah in the middle of like an action movie it'll stop into a musical number that like a real serious action movie why this is their culture didn't like it they like it like that style of sorta supposed to either well mean we used to like it and if you go back and try to watch those old MoMA well all those like Gene Kelly movies they would start dancing this true yeah everybody would stand there and people would dance around them they had music videos that broke out in the middle of a movie so they have all these try to put it yeah they have all these plots they have real language their real dialogue they have a real storyline don't we well it's that someone's desired the one person's desire in the middle of a gigantic performance where people are interacting with each other it's one person's desire to totally steal the spotlight and the best way to do that is by singing everybody has to stand around and listen while John like we're all like support we're in rack and John's in the center he's singing happy yeah and he's got this great point and we're all like wow yeah he's singing about life and everyone's letting me move around singing about life nobody stops ago what are you fucking doing man like why you saying like nobody interacts with them there's no interact things this is one guy which is with a theatre to some folks is all about that moment onstage holding the skull look reminds me man I got a million dollar idea what's a found-footage musical like you know those found-footage movies but they find one word like people are absolutely real music no music is playing they just start singing that would be great really bad song choppy video it's totally happening right now another do with it fucking-a an improvised musical reality show bring them into a situation big brother it's song and the audience doesn't know so they have to they're they're people gonna interact with them they have to sing out to this like restaurant or bar have you ever seen the video there's a video with this bringing you back to activists that gay that sometimes missed the point there was a video of this lady she steps into a chicken restaurant and she starts talking about this is not food this is violence you know and there's a little girl and you know we should start saying and she just wants to live she just wants to be happy and she just wants to live and this little girl was gonna die just like all of her sisters and all of her brothers and her 30 second a chicken ah and she rescued this this chicken and so she's like videos of the same gal with her chicken yeah at home you know it's like so she goes into a restaurant disrupts all these people and like tells this whole story and then explains that it's you know our chicken and then a whole crew of assholes come in behind her with signs this is not food it's violence it's it's so weird and they're like we're just running a restaurant dude it seems like a parody it seems like someone is just badass some tim and eric' type dude really just put together some badass parody that's so subtle you like not sure right like is this bitch really this crazy that she's referring to this chicken as her girl yeah so it seems sometimes that like activists aren't aware of the fact that if their stunt isn't pulled off in the right way it seems like it could be more detrimental comes off super low force you know like people will the response is going to be to eat more chicken yeah yeah just because you're like I don't want to be associated with this kind of behavior and if that means eating chicken then I guess I'll eat more chicken so it's like it's it's dangerous to be an activist if you are not really subtle or if you're aren't skillful in what you're doing like being an activist is awesome just make sure that you're graceful when you do it well not only that you have to have a real objective sense of what actions you're putting out there and how those actions are gonna be perceived if you fake it yes he threw it it seems lame well there's some people that have this idea that their idea what-whatever what they're protesting against is more important than anything that's going to disrupt anything that's going to involve that like Greenpeace do you see what Greenpeace did with the Nazca lines oh yeah they fuck it's so fucking crazy these dumb assholes went to the Nazca lines and they set up a Nazca line so these they don't even know how old they are okay there are thousands of years old these line meanwhile you just revealed that you're an immortal they've dated a little more than a thousand years whatever it is it's not there are all sorts of geometric patterns of animals all sorts of different things some of them are animals some of them are spiders we're all these weird patterns you can only see from the sky oh yeah I'm sorry so they're patterns that are in there their patterns are made on these like flat planes and some of them are just a bunch of rocks that are pieced together in these lines and people have left them undisturbed because they're so cool forever so you can't just go there and walk around on them you can't fuck these assholes went there and they use some of the stones it's like paper weights they pick some of the rocks on the ground if I go there put a sign up this fucking side what a Greenpeace sign see they pull it you got a photo of it Jamie pull it up what dicks yes so douchey a lot of what Greenpeace does is really good which is they stop people from killing whales just there's photos Jamie go to photos Greenpeace Nazca lines uh commemorate a seal outside of a door right grandpa's so look what these assholes did see that see how cool that that design is that pattern that pattern has been there for that just naturally all right and they were they were using stones from that to put their sign about what the with the foot thing so they weren't disturbing people I don't know what the fuck they think they're doing they're still disturbing it by doing that like sometimes standing on that look your fucking footprints are also on that paper I can see the bottom of your tread you know what that means that means you stand you stood on that shit you stood on that shit somewhere and I'm supposed to believe that you're doing this all ethical yeah they shouldn't have done that it backfired and that sucks cuz all the people who are we doing good work look like assholes that sucks yeah okay so this is this is the actual why those are the lines like that yeah yeah what makes them we don't know we don't know who made them they really don't know that that's it Wow that can't that's not that's not just like movement like no agentic movement right oh no no no no no these are mad I mean someone definitely definitely without a doubt me is that in sand or is that in stone um this is so funny some people think the geometric ones could be indicate a flow of water that's connected to rituals to summon water hmm the spiders birds plants could be fertility symbols other possible explanations include irrigation schemes or giant astronomical calendars why is it everyone trying to figure it out that looks like a bird yeah well they're definitely trying to figure out there's a dog there's a monkey riding the monkey no yeah pull up the monkey Jamie they're so good there's a date right there's a spider Bigfoot that looks like what's his name if you scroll fine you'll find a monkey down there just a monkey and one of them it's really cool it's got like there's a there's birds which like bird feet and shit there's a gang of how did Bill Cosby and ecstacy get mixed in with that it's weird to see the images would you remember when they used to do that with websites they would code certain words into websites it's like a person upon foghorn funny funny people think it's an alien that thing that person with the eyeballs so click on that well yeah but it maybe that's how my daughter draws people yeah well maybe a giant two-year-old might be really shitty artists for thousands of years the shitty artists of around Getty like I had a conversation with this dude who was trying to tell me about you know these images that were on cave walls were were you know aliens depictions of alien it was Graham Hancock who I loved that's like come on man I might not be an alien that could be a lot of shit these people if they want to believe when in not only that but it was thousands of years ago just what they saw back then I think it was aliens pull up the monkey Jamie and you see this monkey just I want to see I think affecting the monkey cuz it's really good well it's got a curly tails go down a little bit go down a little bit got more and more and more and more and more stop up a little it's gone where he was a dog to the left you see that one to the far left Jamie about three down oh it's okay just where's that monkey where's the fucking monkey moron no well if you go to the Wikipedia you could see the month look here's the mask ACK oh here it is re see that seconds puking it's on the Wikipedia if you go to the Wikipedia look at the MA way oh it's you it's enormous like what how big is a person to toe I don't know that's a good question that's a very good question but they're really big I mean you like you see when those people were walking around I mean these are like alright there were like that it looks like it was drawn like with a finger on a tablet or something it doesn't look like a shit ton of people spent a long time I'm looked at they'll kind of wore out they've had some damage with mudslides too apparently yeah they but they they really there's all sorts of explanations so nobody goes that they just look at it and then the Greenpeace people weren't there I think aliens came visited these people gave them like showed them some incredible shit they left the people want them to come back so they draw these shapes on the ground hoping that they'll return it's classic cargo cult behavior that's where it all is right in the same place in Peru yeah yeah this is one area it's really fascinating also because there's what looked like landing strips there yeah it's long parallel lines they wanted to come back that's what a Luis that's got to be that's what it is yeah it could be they just you know they just figured out how to draw shit in the ground that you can see from the sky maybe they just thought it was an interesting way to do something did they couldn't see you well they could they just couldn't see it really well you know you could only really truly see what it is when you're up above it but I mean it's not impossible that they could measure it and do it all on the ground I'm just proposing you know being the devil's advocate like it's not impossible that they did those you could see the ground I mean you're looking down at your feet it's not like you're it's invasive to get me to help you do a 12 mile wide monkey little bit not that big how big is it dude not that big they're you know 200 feet wide I think the really big ones but they're not like 12 miles long or anything crazy the lines himself are superficial they're only 10 to 30 centimetres deep and could be washed away really yeah that's when nobody goes there cuz will wear it down it's only ever received a very small amount of rain but there's issues also that the great changes that we're seeing to the climate that it might start raining there hmm Neff fucked yes look at crops well at least well you know everybody's like really crops ever but brittle everyone yeah probably better than those stupid lawns right yeah but everybody's really liking lines shut up eat this they have it in their head that you know this that this site is like it's super important but we have all the images once we have the images if the water comes and washes everything away at least at least we've documented we know these people made these things we don't know why or when where they think it's the Nazca culture which is like I think it said here 400 to 650 ad so they live there and maybe carve those things they think now so that's over a thousand years ago that's you know more than as much as 1500 years ago could be longer crazy shit man they don't really have any explanation for why but there's a lot of I mean you could could be aliens right I mean if we can go to Mars man we can send a robot to Mars it's so arrogant to think that were the only ones that could do that I've never seen any evidence whatsoever that's even remotely compelling but aliens have visited here none of it none of it that's outside of other like there's not one thing that stands out we say that had to be aliens it couldn't have just been really smart people now one thing I would have them left anything well they might have it might even when we're looking at the pyramids when we might be looking at is someone's knowledge and information from another culture well don't the pyramids somehow point serious sort of sort of well depends he see there's a thing called the precession the equinoxes so the Earth spins yeah right you know it's like it's there's like a wobble to the earth and so when you see this the Stars it's not always the same and it wobbles like you know every X amount of thousands of years so depending upon where you think these were constructed you would have a different star line you'd have a different thing you would see there's a guy named John Anthony West who's I'm just amazing when it comes to this shit his whole video series it's called magical Egypt it's so good if you've never it's like you're not even interested at all Egypt you like that's fucking boring bunch of people living in the sand like assholes if you watch watch one of these videos I was just trying to be funny I would say that but um his videos just are super in-depth about the construction methods and how big it is like all those the magical things about the way they built them they think that it was a culture that lived a long fucking time before we think not just like 2500 BC but like he's above the the the notion that it's like 10,000 plus BC and if you go to 10,000 BC apparently where the lion is a sphinx where it's pointing would be directly over the constellation Leo oh I like the Sirius Theory better the dog star wha it's like Robert Anton Wilson crazy idea that the that we are possibly currently existing in the sirius star cluster in what we're having this experience of reality pumped into our consciousness as a form of training for something with matrix pods like well yeah matrix Pollux and that there's like so there's like clues left in the simulator pointing back home and just just as a little cookie like you weave in video games you know or maybe people a long time ago we're more aware of the fact that this is a interdimensional Academy a kind of Hogwarts for young godling z-- who are trying to like who have the potential to become like universe creators but before they're released to like create their own dimensions they have to go through this infinite loop again and again and again until you learn that the most important thing is to love the people around you more than you love yourself and then boom no more because then you could be a good well yeah then you can then we can trust you to fuck around with like our black hole machine or whatever I'm not gonna put you in charge of black holes while you're a selfish shithead that only seems to me like if that was really like a plot if someone had designed like people with this sort of like puzzle in front of them the plot is eventually they're gonna get intelligent enough they're gonna figure out the plot yeah that seems to me to be like a really shitty way of doing things yeah there's guy that's like very you tell them how to do it's very godlike yeah it's actually just tell me that's not really teach kids when that sense like actually that confusion that people feel and like the existential angst of being a person where you don't know what the fuck you are where are you going yeah what happens when I die like almost universally that needs to be plugged up whether it's plugged up with this alien story has or it's plugged up with you know a Mormon story what I'm just gonna plug it up yes if you're taking yeah feeling of Terror that like some people that's men that what are we doing here what are we doing here though yeah right understand they there's a there's a great existentialist philosopher slash author Camus you ever heard of come in force I haven't heard of Camus no yesterday or was it the day before I can't remember that's the first line yeah Wow yeah it's really good but he liked that thing that you're talking about that aching fuckin thing his premise see am us his premise and a lot of of his ilk their premise is that that that is being human like that awful feeling of like having a hole that you are constantly trying to Sisyphus the stranger yes there's a novel yeah try the myth of Sisyphus if you want to get into the philosophy angle but it's pretty it's pretty cool stuff but it will give you that chilling kind of Sisyphus sy s is there another wine there sis sis what pH us beautiful I don't really need to totally know that you know to be on the Kindle was cursed it's a Greek myth was cursed by the gods to eternally push a boulder up to the very top of a hill and then to let it roll back down the hill I'm gonna get to the top of roll it back that story and so this is that like the kernel for eternal so the so like the exit some existentialist look at the human predicament and they point out the fact that you're gonna die no one will remember you in a few hundred years all most human achievements that have happened in the past are completely lost gone forgotten even though they're in history it's still ultimately a meaningless thing in the sense that you have the CICC inevitable personal extinction that's going to happen and so the predicament in life is one of while being Sisyphus here we are anything we do push it up the fucking L it's gonna like roll back down we got to start over push it on the roll back down this is a kind of human archetype for how do we in the midst of what appears to be meaninglessness in the infinite scale find meaning in and like human endeavors when the whole thing's gonna get wiped out by the star the Sun yes some of those philosophers have brought them to God what's that some of those existentialist have brought them to God because they were like this must be the answer the axis there are the-- weirdly there are like theological or theistic existentialist like Soren Kierkegaard there's some of them are and believe in God weird but then there's like Sartre yeah then they're the ones who are just like now it's just all nausea and confusion my friends it's just a any I don't buy that what cuz I don't buy them knowing I don't buy there anyone that says no it's nothing no there's nothing like how do you know there's nothing you have no idea of where there's no examples there's no brain for something you're right don't even bring it up right you don't bring it up but you don't say it's nothing but you don't yeah you don't say it's not something either but are you land more in that camp don't you it's not even part of the conversation get out of here with that shit what yeah what a fish any reason to think that otherwise what are you talking about I think there is I think there's reason to think that fish or bears or whatever the fuck you want to thank if it gets you in the zone this is that it's like because there's like a that's like that's like taking two dribbles before you take a foul shot like it's just like there you go which roll makes you feel better that's fine that thing you just described the two dribbles before the foul shot know that though that's called chaos magic that's the roots of a magical system that's is that it's based on the idea that these symbols themselves they any inherent meaning outside of the mind state that they place you in and so if they help you transform your will into reality so if that rich will helps you score if whatever the fucking thing is that you do prior to sitting down to write or prior to whatever it is that your job happens to be if that actually puts your mind in a state where you are more likely to receive inspiration or you're going to be more graceful or athletic then that's all that fucking lies about who cares yeah yeah that's all that matters who the symbols themselves do you I mean are you really gonna like worry over the actual existence of a elephant-headed God that right it can shrink until family you know for your race well then it's like alright fine I don't think the issue is a belief system as much as the issue is getting caught up in an ideology that you can't question yeah that's because when you do that if you you want to go in the Thor camp or whatever camp you want to go to I believe is the you know the grandeur of the fucking Zeus yeah no matter wooden Odin prays Odin prays Odin yes anytime you can't question anything your fucks Ville you know if you have something you believe in that's probably empowering what's not empowering is when you subscribe to an ideology because if you believe that there's some all eternal loving God that's looking over you and judging you every day and that you have to do your best to make him proud as your divine father he created you and you know deep in your DNA what the good things you're supposed to do is if that if you really go live your life like that you'll probably live a pretty fucking cool life yep you'll be really nice to people you'd be super righteous you would want to make your daddy God all proud of you and shit the problem is when you subscribe to an ideology and that doesn't let you question anything the problem is not believing in a god the problem is now what do you have to do because you believe that God well now you have to stop gay marriage you have to stop guys from masturbating you have to stop people from doing this and stop it everyone yeah you gotta you have to listen to me cuz my way is the right way in the Lord's Lord Islam is the truth all of that stuff it's all the same shit it's all the same shit the ideologies the problem it's not believing in God what does this motherfucker God want you to go do this trap dynamite to your chest and walk into a cafe but God gets associate just like you talk about the chicken lady Goggins associated with that so you want to be like them and fuck the things they believe in exactly well yeah it's like a what happens is there's violent people in the world and they like to be violent they enjoy it it gets them off but they can't rationalize the fact that they enjoy being violent because it's seems so monstrous and animalistic you need a reason see their religion is a fantastic way to justify every dark activity that humans engage yes you can fucking like did you see the thing that popped up on the Internet Isis's guide to having child sex slaves did you see that no like they have a guide book which is like they have questions like there's important questions if you have a slave that's underage that's a girl and you're wanting or I guess a guide I guess they don't like gay people so if you have an underage sex slave that's a girl and you are in Isis you're gonna have some questions but the number one being about when do I get to fuck her yeah and this is a guide book where they're like well can you fuck her well if she's able to have sex in this guide book it says if she's able to have sex yeah but if she's not then you can enjoy her in other ways like just don't penetrate her but that's a real thing man they put they're putting that and they're quoting how do we know this is real and we don't know it's we CIA plan we don't know that it could be and I did think that like this could be this could be propagandist one but they do they are taking slaves like it is a thing it that they are taking slaves and some of those slaves are women and if you have a female slave that you've taken that you've captured from your Energon raped and you are gonna have some questions about the like as a religious person while effectively absolutely yeah what do you how do you ethically fuck this girl like when like when the dishwasher was invented Jews had to go to the rabbis and said are we allowed to put milk and meat dishes in here which is the ruling here they use that basically sex law you what is the answer to that a lot of Jews have separate dishwashers that's hilarious no conflicts oh goodness if you want to be kosher yeah the main thing is the main thing is this that what the I mean how it's awful is like the sex slavery is and as ridiculous as that is the structure is always the same which is a very manipulative charismatic power-hungry narcissistic guy has convinced some dumb people that he has got the line into God and as long as they're coming to him to ask him what to do it's great that's the main structure the structure needs to be that a certain amount of people believe that there is one person who has contact with an invisible guy and that that that person will tell them what's right and what's wrong it's very comforting yes we don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about it just go to the guy and ask him like you can feel your morale it's so dark but really when you see what's what's happening there is this incredibly awful version of S&M it's sadomasochism you're going to your daddy to find out how to fuck it's like this dark state of mass that's what it is it's S&M you're going to your daddy to find out if you can put milk with whatever and you're in your washing machine you're going to Daddy to find out if you can use birth control it's always said a lot of times it's sex related like the Pope just said something like didn't you just come out and say like you don't have to he was talking about how to have sex you know they'll tell you you can't use birth control you know that they tell you things involving sex like a man who is connected to an invisible being will tell you how to fuck on this planet I mean it is stupid it is as dumb as it gets but when you consider the fact that it is not only is it real but it is like these people doing this or behind businesses that are making billions of dollars every year and that money is going in the direction of paying for lobbyists to control government and politics that's when it becomes generous their governments I'm sinister if you look at it picture perspective do you think it's possible for people to have gotten where we've gotten as quickly as we've gotten without religion without some organizing ethical behavior oh god what was the big jump early on now what's holding us back but back then it's really helping us like don't kill but we would be raping and pillaging still yeah if there's a Judean way of living they say which is just like the basic tenets like don't murder don't steal don't don't don't rape well it's almost like an idea virus that is introduced into a system in order to force growth in a certain direction because I never got in society without I doubt it I doubt it Keeks dudes want to fall in the Greeks people want to rape yeah but they had a gang of different gods but I think they were kind of like Greek gods I think even back then they were I think even bad kids I don't know for sure you know what I'm not even that part of me that likes to chime in as though I know anything about Greek I have to come in I have no idea yeah I'm not really sure about that man but I do think that it's a the the predicament regardless of that being whether that was a kind of caste that needed to be placed on humanity as a whole to allow this growth through this thing to do yeah now we're in a place where I've grown the cast time to take off the cast I think I smell like a like like somebody sneezed into a rotting vagina well it's it's it's being replaced with a new one it's being replaced with a the-- of them atheism is very much a religion though but we take those tenets of like yeah I don't mean it in a negative way I mean it's like in and religions the wrong word it's an organized group the people that are a part of it they they subscribe to the the ideology of this organized group and are almost like for a large percentage at least I shouldn't say almost the majority but a large percentage are liberal a large percentage of atheists are liberal people like they tend to lean left with their ideas I would say if you had a gauge the difference between the Republican side and their dead Kratts I like which one has more atheists it would clearly be Democrat right is that right am i guessing I'm just guessing right I don't know let's see if we're right I'm sure I would say that yeah that seems very logical to think that you mean it does seem logical but let's see if it's true also the more into their super into God that Republicans they might have some atheist but the ones that are super into god those are more Republicans right but I don't really know can you be a single president is that even know what country no you can't a president you can't be like no if you ever figured that out know what would happen in like if Obon is a president allowed to have another job like you know bombers start like working on comedy could he do stand-up if he wanted to at night if he wasn't working yeah better could that would be amazing I don't know Joe it's 6:30 p.m. I worked an extra hour I'm clocked out yeah a lot of the people in Congress are closeted that are a thief that's hilarious wow what a bunch of fucking fakers it's saying there's an article about this on Think Progress why all of the atheists in Congress are closeted that's a layer they won't say it had to pretend they can't it's not popular atheism is not popular there's there's a certain thing that people want to do they want to say something really stupid and have everybody else go you're like we're not gonna think any more than we already have yeah when people say well I'll tell you what I meet somebody and they're an atheist I just walk away they're a damn fool silly in their brain PJ Harvey kind of moral compass do you operate on them that's the idea I can't trust you if you don't believe the symbol that was created a long time ago by people trying to control other people this is like way to go it's silly so forget it well there's a book I read and goddamnit I wish I could run the name of but the very first chapter in the book was talking about how fascinating it is that in the Old Testament when God is asking for offerings yeah kill he only wants stuff that humans like like he only wants the best thing like God never tells priests to ask people for like a jar of wasps right it's only it's only like he knows goats yeah like now it's the same system worked then the priests would come out and be like God wants they do money that's what they did the fucking bright people Jimmie's whatever his name is yeah yeah but it's the differences money now it's this ambiguous thing but back then what was kind of interesting it's like you would actually ask for like stuff Wow only stuff got men who iPad God wants a new iPads and your technology yeah God wants I don't your computers yeah it's very it's fascinating that way but I still I mean I do like I don't know I don't know I think God's an overused word but I do think there is definitely like I don't know what God wants it really tells officially I vote I've always just given some of this shit what's our favorite shit yeah just killed a nice man that's really fascinating stuff I've been reading this book that you know it's a controversial book and some people say that it's like I don't know I like the book it's well written it's called zealot by Reza Aslan it's the historical Christ and his premise is that Jesus regardless of his premise what's really fascinating is he's just talking about what it was like back then which is that the Romans had were occupying that that that land and that the priests were actually people who were used to it used to be like a religious thing but they would buy their positions from the Romans so everybody wanted the Romans gone and so right so like you know in the story in the Bible Jesus is crucified between two thieves and so reza aslan says that if you look at the actual word for thief it actually translates into bandit and bandit is the word that the Romans used to describe people are trying to overthrow them so geez his premises was a somebody who was Pro violence and wanted to overthrow the Romans and there were a lot of other people like him too and so when people were saying they were like the Son of God or the Messiah the term Messiah actually meant like the the king of the Jews somebody who was going to like lead the liberate the Jews from the Romans it's a really great book and the very first chapter taught how to be a cool fucking movie it would be really cool but when they talk about that the the lets them do to play well they were know I mean a lot of like what he says is like if you read in the in the in the Bible now they haven't scrubbed all of the violent stuff he said one thing he said is like something about I will turn you away I will turn you know if turned father against son I will turn like if you aren't able to leave your family then you'll never be able to follow me it's like all these things which are crazy Amanda Liberty we're gonna get the fucking Romans out of here man and that was the idea these assholes are occupying our country they've taken over our religion we're gonna fucking overthrow them and they really couldn't understand why God let the Romans in there in the first place so like that was a real monkey wrench in their ideas dozen people really chosen people but it's like no you're not really the fuckin chosen people because they're guys who are guarding your temples now wearing Roman outfit got freedom from the slit from slavery that were sort of half slaves again exactly and they couldn't I didn't work man it was like the to the paradigm did not fit in with their idea that were the chosen people suddenly there's these fucking Romans occupying everything and so a lot of the these the messiahs and there are many messiahs before Jesus by the way John the Baptist executed why was he executed he was executed because they looked at him as a threat to the Roman power structure that was it all these people getting crucified and by the way man crucifixion was in back then like they were throwing people on crosses every day so it's like it was like a constant attempt to like take down rebellion that's it silence their rebellion yeah yeah silence the rebellion it's really interesting great book it's really crazy but those sort of volatile moments in history crazed insane violent moments of control and then the repercussions of that control those are like the engines that fuel change and oftentimes fuel innovation and I know we look at him as being yeah we look at Indians like horrible moments when that's happening because they are everyone involved but like for the future like the I think all these chaotic moments were this people struggling to get into a position for power in the fact that nobody could really hold it and it keeps and people have their complaints and the people that are rising up they have the will of the people because the will of the people is we don't want any his fucking terror anymore yeah all right let's go get them and then they get in and they become the person they were fighting against like this process repeats itself over and over yeah and it seems like objectively if you look at it it's like this process of cleansing or filtering almost like water coming down from a glacier and going through all those rocks until it becomes pure it's like it's gotta go through all these trials and tribulations there's got to be all these fucking chaotic moments of horror so we understand what horror is so we never repeat har you got to have a Holocaust to understand where the 60s came from you got to have these bad moments that sort of make you like long for and accomplish the great heights this is why I just had Alex Graham my podcast and I'm not gonna try to repeat what he said about the Jews is the chosen people because they're creating psychedelics but he did one of his premises because Hoffman was a Jew but well the idea is that we needed scientific materialism atheism we needed people to turn their backs on the ancient version of God so that we could understand the universe at a deep enough level to be able to create us the to synthesize LSD and all the various lectures that are smart to figure that shit out yeah it's really cool but it's kind of what you're saying which is like we needed like these phases in human evolution are really important because like if you if you're constant if you're caught up in a ridiculous version of the deity and then maybe you're not going to be so inclined to study molecular biology or maybe you're not gonna be able to study chemistry in the same way and without studying that stuff then we wouldn't have some of the psychoactive compounds that I think a lot of people consider as being one of the potential ways that our species can evolve and so these these these psychedelics can actually be ways that connect with the thing that the ancient religions were talking about and then that thing that ended up being like turning turned into like a painted clown you know that people somebody had a vision you know Moses buy that what was the burning bush bush what was that what was it made of though it was called a t-shirt or something education which has what in it DMT dimethyltryptamine so I need the premise here is God alone is fucking head well the idea of what is your dream with the story really big well if you translating something from ancient Hebrew right and then you're putting into Latin and then eventually to English when you're doing that like you're gonna the the way they explain things it's gonna come off very different like you read like Russian stories translated to English there's it's so bizarre oh yeah throw it through like Google Translate it's so but so hard to understand how as their language works so much differently so by saying that like God took the form of a burning bush they easily could be saying he was smoking DMT that's right yeah you dry the fucking book that Bush out and figure out a way to get the fucking DMT out of it and smoke it like if you and especially if that's how they did it like what if they just lit those bushes on fire and then just like yes some out of it just breathe in wholesale smoke they did it like totally caveman style just take those bushes hack them down dry them out make a fucking tent like one of those sweat lodges at yourself with DMT and he saw a guy was a dude dude dude everybody down there hold us I got oh my god I got some stuff to tell you because God was telling you not to covet your neighbor's wife not because your neighbor's wife is like it's gonna simulation or what is my life my lives alone like the idea was that the guy owns that wife yeah yeah that's crazy like it's like this insane archaic way of thinking that's connected to that time yeah so we don't you know even if Moses did say those things we have no idea what the actual words that came out if Moses did have this psychedelic ancient rivers not used anymore yeah it's like and not only that like who the fuck wrote it down was it Moses Moses didn't write it down if I told you some shit that happened to me when I was a child and then you were it was your bit job to write a book after I died oh you would butcher it I would butcher your life you would butcher my lap we would butcher each other's lives if Moses wasn't right Moses yeah you know if you're not getting his fucking notebook yeah who knows what was actually said to be right written the same way throughout history like they write every letter the same exact way that's the written Torah right in the world or something the phrase II looking by the way the language is cool it's beautiful and it's so strange and psychedelic they have musical notes on each one of the letters you can read really yes you know what to go up and say it while you're the truck yeah when you're serving you're reading it the tour out loud wow you're parsha can you read Hebrew yeah of course fucking crazy man I'd like to learn it you lived in Israel why yeah that was doing religious studies was it fun yeah it was just like a given for a while but now that looks step back and look at it was like that's pretty fucking cool yeah it was cool I lived in Israel for two years Wow how old were you 18 18 to 20 Wow so it was all I got drunk there for the first time pre-post yeah pretty pussy Wow even do anything back then wow that's a faster solution buses and stuff what's it like there everything's made of stone Jerusalem's like the whole city's made of stone so the old cities all stone but everywhere else like stone outside you know the buildings it just looked really pretty did you go to that wall climbed up in that movie ridiculous like hey why you know security cameras why monitor the the wall separating us from the mass of zombies yeah yeah and then all of a sudden it's not flying over instantly yeah he escaped too easily a lot in that movie like oh my god plane crash and then only the true you survived yeah yeah it's like Godzilla yeah same sort of situation but so you were there from eighteen to twenty eighteen to twenty god I really got drunk threw out the first time at what years was that well first I went my high school does a half year for a senior year and in the second semester second four to six months we go to Israel and we get tour groups that was if it's really two and a half years so what year and calendar year was just 92 I think January of 92 so this is like Clinton presidency yeah I voted absentee ballot for Clinton that was the only time I ever go to the president did you wear religious garb while you were there commend yarmulke and the seat see the tassels man went one thing we love doing cuz there's no black people there only if he opens and they were like in like a different part of the town of the country we would just yell nigger at each other on the street scariest word ever yeah yeah you'd have to do like a full 360 sweep of your surroundings with a helicopter parachute down and he held it to feel super-confident someone's it's like the only word that you can yell out and anyone in that group is allowed to punch you women can't just run up to you punch you you know but if you come out nigger they have a free pass yes punch you want people to know this is the only racial slur that that is a free pass to violence yeah like Chinese if you yell out chain know like the most wise you know look at you laughing motherfucker you piece of shit but there are certain dudes not all of them but there's certain dudes that if they catch you yelling out that word they wolf the photo it's just Prophet Muhammad of words but it's crazy if you're in a place I mean there's guaranteed there's people that just heard you say that they're gonna be offended they're like you know fuck that guy you know who fucks he think he is yelling that shit out dropping in the podcast 22 years ago no it doesn't even matter just the fact that you just said it and all right just the fact that you say making fun of what that how irresponsible is to say that yeah you remember like I have ever the bit about the three magic words and that was one of them they're like you can't even say it like you're not even allowed to say the word referenced if your wait yeah it is a really interesting thing because symbols are harmless but it's somehow they justified violence like whenever this ridiculous thing or at an image of the Prophet were around whenever it's there it's like that thing itself is meaningless harmless but it allows a result it allows violent people an excuse to be violent and there is nothing I think more satisfying than some people to oh to be violent and righteous at the same time right oh yeah like American sniper that guys like pegging like um kills not one wrong even though every time he's like I don't know what this guy's hand fuck it I'm taking the shot he's never wrong movie yeah it was it was really like the acting was horrible have you seen it no there was no plot is just some scenes the wife was only annoyed by owns the entire time you're just like you've never built a relationship there's no fucking movie you ever written this fucking movie hmm and I don't give a fuck at the very end they go they go deep okay so he comes home he's all fucked in the head he meets some he made some some he's working out his wife he meet some veterans he helps them fucking sniper and that's how he gets his life together he helps him snipe and shit and then he picks one guy up and he's like yeah we're gonna go today and then uh just at home on the range and the guy looks at his wife weird and then it cuts away it goes he was killed by a veteran yeah who's that guy but they didn't show what happened they didn't show you our 20-minute movie show every tour fuckin forward toward combine them but they don't forget that they failed to mention they just died and they showed footage of this funeral procession also the guy is like Jesse Ventura sued that guy and one and no the guy who was there was no it wasn't just that apparently a whole long laundry list of questionable stores that was that guy no wonder but hard for Josue there probably to take all the plot like is well there was a bunch of other things that he did he said he did like one of them was there was a carjacking where two people were shot and killed it read like a fucking Mencia talking about himself apparently that's how it saw no evidence at the carjacking took close to God yeah and there was another one where he killed a bunch of people in Katrina he was a sniper and Katrina yeah shooting looters and talked about which is like okay look it's one thing if you're shooting terrorists who have rocket launchers but you're shooting people that are poor people that are stealing shit because they're involved in chaos yeah because the fucking water has come and surrounded the city and there's no resources and peace so you're shooting looters like what should be are you should be really fucking careful about who we celebrate that's right if you're shooting looters yeah you're murder yeah we're not talking about war we're not talking like even Michael Moore was talking about his pollutant no that's not what you get for looting you don't get this is not made for people who want and not for a judge to say but it's not right from a fucking roof it's gonna be delivered because you go to the trial and you have a jury of your peers yeah that's what the government is supposed to be established for like to be on a rooftop you're just murdering this movie was like a full life right I mean this crazy learning people well Jesse Ventura was a fucking Navy SEAL he was in what scar gets called the UDT before it was the Navy SEALs I believe that's the name of the organization there was a pre-dating named the same Jesse Ventura was one of them so apparently this guy told the story about knocking out Jesse Ventura and Jesse Ventura bad-mouthing the troops and bad-mouthing the war which he said he would never do never did never argued with this guy he never got hit and he gave the guy an opportunity to attract it otherwise he was good cuz we wrote about in his book he called them scruffy face or something like that but then on radio shows he admitted that it was Jesse Ventura so do the math but I think he did it on Opie and Anthony actually I think that's where it came out so they realized that it's not true so the guy got killed okay Chris Kyle gets killed and now Jesse Ventura goes through with the lawsuit with the guy's wife mmm which mmm dad see no she's got all the profits from that yes fuck her I'll fuckin lie about him I give that money to charity and then it comes out later she's a lawyer too should give 20 percent of it that's ready I think as long as her look if her why should what life isn't I mean it's she's suing the guy who lied it just so happens the guy who lied died like down the stops on the book well that's the issue you're dead right you do I'm getting the issues a book ran out like who owns the book who but but but then the issue is does he represent them when he goes on radio stations and says something that's not even in the book does he name the guy in a story in the book but does it make them responsible I say it doesn't I say the whole thing gets sued not Random House because he said scruffy face who the file but then when he says now I've told you scruffy faces now what you've printed is libel or whatever is the thing man if he brought about all that other shit about shooting looters and all that other shit like if that turns out to be not true which people are saying it's not true you really gotta take the whole book took the book off before we pack this is what this is what's important Oprah had that book about that guy's shattered little pieces or whatever a thousand little pieces yeah yes and he was like knows all why she was like what you just said he went to heaven and he came out and said the whole thing was a lie you know that yeah yeah they pulled that book - hey pull yeah well no there's this like cheesy book where a kid goes into a coma flies around heaven for a while comes back right to this bestseller people are like I knew was real not news like this I never read it but it's a funny it's just everything but the kid got real it actually got religion that's what it was and felt so guilty about lying that he came out and said the whole thing was a lie I thought I could get attention wow great it's really it's let me pulled it there's a great there's a great blog that I read called if you just google truth justice and the Curious Case of Chris Kyle it's really really well-written which explains like all of the various stories and here's why they couldn't be true and here you know not casting a judgement not using the inflammatory language just trying to explain like what may be or may not have been true it's said in the beginning this movie that was just released this is all a true story see some of it I'm sure was she has to think the guy that doesn't shoot some kid and they go like if you're wrong about this you're fine let me work extra spotter that's your spotters telling you you're gonna go to jail forever if you're if you take this wrong shot the other thing you have to remember too is Clint Eastwood yeah Clint Eastwood who used to be the baddest motherfucker haha now - he's an old dude yeah and you addressed Obama yeah how did he direct a movie when I saw the thing no seriously when I saw the thing all I thought was oh this is just clearly wartime Rogen tweeted that he considered compared it to the sniper movie in Tarantino's movie I think Rogan right back a little bit but in Tarantino's movie and glorious bastards they're watching this in Germany they're watching a movie about a sniper and it's like he's being celebrated right it's probably it's propaganda American sniper is propaganda there's no question about it so we know that then I was thinking like almost like the show Clint Eastwood really direct this because when you see him at the Republican National Convention he seemed kind of like nutty out of it so I was thinking how the fuck is this guy directing like this kind of hardcore actually doing a form-based there because he's this manly rugged right-wing Republican hero and they knew that that would like get more people to watch this movie which is essentially a lubricated water slide that leads to your nearest Kru ting office if you get hypnotized by the thing enough that's what it is oh you want to fight you want flavor justice and I feel you want to be Noble you know know what you don't don't want to work in the oil fields you want to be Noble yeah go straight to seal it means 30 yeah I think about a lot of people that are in this country that are you got born a shit town with no fucking opportunity yeah and you're surrounded by a bunch of dummies and then you go see this movie you're like holy shit but I think when you make a movie about someone's life story and this is what I was pissed off at Foxcatcher for the same reason that movie Foxcatcher about John du Pont who was that crazy old man yeah his shot Dave Schultz who's an Olympic champion wrestler and it was based on his brother Mark Schultz in this one they fucked with everything in that movie they he's so angry he's been - Mark Schultz been tweeting like crazy because he's still alive he was lying - he's Olympic gold medalist I mean it killed him in the movie well no no no no John du Pont killed the an Olympic gold medalist in the movie but his brother Mark Schultz who the book the movie in the book is based on it's still alive and they changed all these aspects of his life for this movie and he's like I'm still alive but this is me like this isn't like a Chris Kyle thing where they made the movie after he's dead and who knows what you know he let put in and not but this is like Mark Schultz was saying this didn't happen like they they messed with shit that didn't even make sense like they had the UFC in their movie yeah but it was in 1988 there was no fucking UFC until 1993 didn't even exist so they're watching an actual fight between Big Daddy Goodrich who was the eventual opponent of Mark Schultz and a lot of people like your rügen you're all fucking UFC trivia nobody gives you shit to build the story no it's not dummy it's about history because why would you make up any aspects of history when you're doing a true story you don't need to change the timeline for the UFC that's totally arbitrary like someone deciding to do that is their own creative flair just kissing just cupping their balls and jizzing over history or if you did that with that how the fuck am I gonna believe any of the aspects of this story cuz you lied about something I know you lied about this weird shit with it's like there's like this weird relationship between the two when they're looking at each other weird and he's wearing shorts and now he's got frosted tips and people were saying that it seemed like it was gay and Schultz got really upset that they were insinuating there was some sort of a gay relationship they like fucked with the timeline of his achievements too because he had already won the World Championships I mean he was already the best wrestler in the world in his weight class and they were making it look like he needed his brother and that he was he was sucking in DuPont was career was falling apart he was the best wrestler in his weight class in the world mark fuckin Schultz would was an animal right and if you watch him wrestle when he was in his peak form he was a fucking animal and like they changed like the aspects of his achievements in this movie like he was already a world champion like the way they made it and the way they it's like this guy was fucked and nothing was going right for him and then he needed this John du Pont situation and that's why he moved in in a beautiful mind when the wife stuck with him even there was going crazy yeah the real life she just left of course as soon as you ran the bath wore on the kid she was like I'm out from divorcing it's over ya know like we're gonna make it together baby yeah this is like his American cyber's like we're gonna tell the whole story like what whole story there was also a shitty father and husband are thinking about the Ari Shaffir story when it comes out they're sure they're gonna show him like with a bag of mushrooms but he's like weeping as he eats um like I can't stop your car you gotta stop eating those mushrooms and all he's doing is watching child porn fuck you I don't even know why why should it be legal I didn't fuck any kids why isn't the video of themselves legal and put some words in your mouth that someone could totally see put it like on a newspaper quote or something I can't have a come-up did you ever see Lenny with Dustin Hoffman you know I miss - look I'm huge fucking Lenny Bruce fan so yeah I am fascinated by I'm not a huge fan of his war this is a tricky way to say it cuz like I think if you I'm not endorsing what right now I'm saying like if you go you've won it like if Lenny Bruce is performing at the Laugh Factory new at the Comedy Store I would tell people to go see you I would go because it would be freaky just to see him yeah but but you're dealing with a completely different era though the world was just weighed there right but anyway this is great Dustin Hoffman movie where Dustin Hoffman fucking nailed it he sounds just like Lenny Bruce I mean is that one of the few times where guys on stage and it seems like he's a real comic huh it's really good but he says a bunch of shit and you go did he say that how do I know he said that I know you know I know you don't know exactly what came out of his mouth at any given moment so a lot of this is just bullshit you know it's like if you there's a real person you gotta try your best to make everything as on the money as possible and whatever you fill in has got to be directly related to everything you absolutely know happen but you got to fill in stuff like when he tells his wife he loves her for the first time it's like that's you're like I'm guessing this how it went it's fine unless the wife's alive and she can tell you yeah yeah but I think what you're talking about is a controversial subject I think some people say that you've got creative license one of the things I mean it's a based on true story it said this is a true story look he's rah rah all the way he's a flag-waving old man sure is he really is all those old men stick together well look I think this is i mean delivered look I think Howard Stern just saying he enjoyed it as a movie it's supposed to be a very good movie it was like well made as a movie was no story the acting was horrible there were some cool SH like fuckin sniping shots this nice always cool and that was it but it wasn't much I don't think he would label she's not like a war the one Victor one the bad guy wants to get the whole times like to man I think I've said on the podcast is cool lantern here's what it boils down to you want to use military equipment right in a movie right you're not gonna get your own fuckin tanks and where are you gonna get the military equipment from you're gonna get the military equipment from the military and the military and you can look this over on me they get to have script approval so the military they look through your script and they make sure that the stuff that is in your script is gonna get people down to their local recruiting office and that's why they let you use their machinery don't usually set to Kubrick that there's never been a anti-war movie that hasn't made an enlistment go up anti-war movies yeah KTV like you literally cannot make an anti-war movie because every single depiction of war makes people go oh that's cool like platoon all of it all of it you can see the trend right afterwards enlistment shoots up after those big movies so Ryan the guy gets blown up the clothes not but everyone abuse right you forget the funds we got blown up because people like being violent and this is why Sebastian youngers book war is such an incredible book because it is it portrays war with no like attempt to be like this is right or this is wrong it just says if you take it I can't remember the exact wording but it's like if you take a 22 year old and put them behind one of those giant fucking submarines yeah it feels good people love violence so if you can figure out a way to get people to be violent without the guilt that goes along with like you're killing other members of your species then what do you do you create an imaginary story right and the imaginary story in Iraq was the weapons of mass destruction also Saddam Hussein they said this movie like oh you if I don't do my job they come to San Diego and knock on your door that's apparently another aspect of the book that has been the question is that the the barrels of weapons of mass destruction that they found like he said that they found like chemical weapons right oh really yes oh he said we actually saw them you laid eyes on them but they're like wouldn't want you to tell anybody what what do you mean Google search do a Google search on birth defects in some of the parts of Iraq that we attack because we used shells that had some kind of radioactive isotope in it so now the babies are being born birth defects because the other thing people say is Saddam Hussein gassed his own people right he gassed his own people well what are we doing to them when we're dropping all those bombs targeted strikes man they know exactly where they're hitting no they don't people babies are being born there with like severe birth defects because of what we did there so I think in a movie like that you need to at least illustrate the fact that the reason that man was sitting on the tops of buildings in that area killing people was he was was because he was sent there based on bad information to say the least and and the people he's killing like in the very beginning it's like anybody over the age of 18 this is like you can see anybody over the age of 18 built in this area this is an evacuation zone so there's no yeah except people that are out to kill it it's all open game it's like oh wait a minute so you're saying that because the normal of our shots that way don't worry about like hoods yeah question but morally no anyone was there over 18 that's what they're they're these monsters did not leave the city that we bombed that they lived in when we told them to so if they're still here kill their asses and then he still like shows restraint and then when he finally has to it's a kid but he's has a fuckin grenade launcher and he waits until the kids running at the fucking and about to throw it and then he shoots them but it's totally know I'm shooting a kid and then the mom what the fuck but why would the kid be angry I mean really why would you be angry they only destroyed your city that you lived in yeah this is another thing they're shooting Marines it shouldn't it's like why the Marines right there where they can get shot remember though thousands of miles away back to America what we were saying earlier about ideologies problem and being a nationalistic person subscribing and being a patriot subscribing to one nation only regardless of what the actual act itself is and looking at it like you know that's okay because it's one of those like that is an ideology area gap that is as much of an ideology as a religion this an unquestioning thing like you know one of the things that Michael Moore was saying was that he put it on his tweet his Twitter that a sniper is a coward and everybody got really pissed off you know they're like the I think the logic behind it's kind of silly like you have to look him in the eye when you shoot him like shooting someone in the back is a coward's move like well in that sense 90% of war is cowardly yeah because you're saying some kind of war is okay but some kind of you have rules yeah yeah yeah look at somebody's out on the back or like what about from a hundred yards right but that means no more Rockets it means and we're drunk yeah a lot of the wiring or do is you're shooting people like you don't necessarily look them in the eye when you shoot them are you having a duel like what are you doing you're standing back-to-back and walking ten paces like assholes like what kind of there's reason to be there can't you look at some of the negative effects that we want to pull those back like what if 30% of children in Yemen have PTSD now because of drones that's a negative it's really important that information gets out there when you are putting a movie out that's gonna get people the same way like when Beverly Hills Chihuahua came out everybody bought a Chihuahua and the pounds filled up with chihuahuas because they also been American sniper is gonna do the exact same thing for people who are a little confused and what to do in their lives and they're gonna think well I guess the best thing I can do right now is kill people that my government tells me you're evil even though if I study the facts I find that it's a far more complex issue than that and maybe my decision should not be to become a hired killer for people who are telling me that I should kill people who more than likely are innocent or just trying to defend their home from an invading occupying force it's really important to realize that now I'm not saying all war is bad because some people will be like you naive son of a bitch you don't even realize let me repeat the speech at the beginning of American sniper this is what the day there's a speech here's the speech the dad gives at the dinner table after the American sniper what's his name Chris what was his name Chris Chris Kyle has just defended his brother from a beating by a bully and they're sitting around the table his brothers got bruised up a little bit Chris Kyle's sitting there and his dad gives this speech there's three types of people hold on before you get the speech he goes I was just defending my brother and he looks at the little brother with a black eye and he goes is that true like what do you mean obviously he has a black eye he just got beat up that's right that's right what a shitty movie is that true it goes yep all it is three types of people and morals 3 types there's sheeps these are the people who believe that there aren't evil people in the world and by the way I'm paraphrasing out there are the sheep's these are the people who believe that there aren't evil people in the world and that everything's safe and then there's the wolf's and these are the people and try to use evil to overpower others something like that and then there's the sheepdogs and these are the people who defend the sheep Oh what are you gonna be it goes your any if if you're anything if you're the sheep or the wolf and he takes his belt off and put it down your fucking ass watch it man it is from the very beginning it's pure it really is like the way we talk about how soldiers are on their dying breath would tell him I'm just glad I got to see Mencia that was a story yeah mine was this story he told Pete I remember it going around there he tell people like yeah I met his like his fuckin buddy in arms when he was dying he's like you know I got married re I imagine if that really did happen though that's actually sad that's sadder than him lying zooming it didn't happen but people are definitely dumb enough to do that you understand about the Punisher tour of 2006 that's fucking hilarious last words you know it'd be like but what about what about him stealing jokes his last words but he did it better [Laughter] sorry I will give you $100,000 of on your deathbed you say yeah at least I got to see Mencia a hundred thousand good really give him a hundred thousand and how would he use it he's dead Oh well you won't need this and I am one of your best friends by the way my storytellers show this is not happy for mirs this Thursday oh yeah with me Bobby Lee and keegan-michael key and Duncan time we've done these extra stories that we're doing for the web only they'll be on YouTube and Duncan's is premiering tomorrow that's right Duncan tells a cool story about going to an LSD trip Grateful Dead coffee a reason they do you want to put that on television the realized to book another white male was nearly impossible to any white male did you need diversity Charlie yeah there was like who else can we get that's a little not bad to look for non-white males yeah so it's a Jerry Seinfeld type situation yeah they like look we're just gonna get two attacked if you don't get something to attack is just like bottom line it was just like fucking well I mean they're pissed about that what is it the Oscars they don't have to get half but they just got you gotta be representative that's so crazy they're pissed about the Oscars it's all like all white people well unless black people are being excluded unless Asian people are being excluded Joey Diaz yeah those are both fucking ethnos but my problem is like you can't have affirmative action comedy yeah you're right you know you can't you're gonna ruin the whole thing you can't do that you can't like you whoever's funny you guys sideshow yeah yeah but you get but you can do it like this like it's show me the pool of people that are qualified you should have a hundred people like right make two of those there's only six blacks that are qualified of those hundreds but pick two of them I don't mind being on the internet I love the internet that's where I live is on the internet they can be way longer to just like we did last year and really like don't worry about any no I love the one that you put it that we did that's that was on the internet was great it was fun it noses actually before the show was even on TV this is it's totally awesome to have something in the Internet I was just confused as to oh yeah the reasoning for we also because it came later to Eric the guy who runs it with me he was like hey let's do it also a web series the Webster's and that way he goes to it's like if we show some short ones we want to bump somebody up we can if they're a good short story to Rothbart and with Miz you know what that was a big fucking awesome about the web - it doesn't get cancelled cancelled it's on anytime you want it's actually a way better medium for distribution okay YouTube channels way better especially now you have YouTube on Apple TV so you can go right to you - right yeah I mean you can get youtube on a lot of those little like Netflix today hey watch them on your phone you can watch anywhere you want if it's on Comedy Central you're gonna be guaranteed a very large audience you know a million-plus audience of people sitting there watching a lot of you aren't even your fans when you get good online you're gonna get all of your fans so they watch it more intently they see your name right there it's way easy for them like fan wise yeah TV okay it's a no web no no no no also all the stories go on the web let's make a cool-looking clip tell a story about trying to buy acid in a parking lot on TV exactly like wyman one that's great about it's some sex and a dog is involved and they're like you're not doing bestiality on here yeah we'll put it on the web though I was like fine golden I don't care if I get to choose so I'd rather be the wet you could say whatever the fuck you want yeah I would right yeah for sure cuz they because he called me and he's like can we go through what your story is the idea being if we can like maybe we can make it so it could possibly be on TV and I said oh no I just rather not go on TV because I don't want to deal I don't want to worry about that I don't want to think about that cuz the story I'm telling is a story about being in high school trying to buy drugs and and like just want the worst slash best acid trip I ever had in my life you don't even want to have to worry about something you make it sound a little less Pro that I don't get it because I am Pro you know like no am i special I go do more drugs you should do drugs what drugs uh-huh mushrooms and any sort of psychedelic hmmm I'm like you'll never knows nothing ever bad happen to you actually a bush gets an office that could be an issue yeah well yeah I mean there's a statute I mean you could it could it be an issue is that real no that's quite all both stop it you're gonna get ideas in their heads for sure she's talking about schedule one drugs now Oh Comedy Central's heads though you say yeah I'm not worried about the politician no no don't be pussies you guys are rebels I think with mushrooms especially III I think mushrooms like okay remember when marijuana was deeply illegal way back in the day you'd fantasize with your friends about the idea that marijuana becoming legalized and you can see that it could be on the horizon maybe but it was still kind of like it's never gonna be legal it's a ridiculous dream yeah I think mushrooms is the new marijuana I think mushrooms is gonna psilocybin is going to become a prescription medication that's given to people to stop smoking yeah yeah yeah exactly that's gonna happen once you start realizing if there are medical benefits that they looking like they're proving that it's like they'll try to separate them again I thank God for döblin right oh yeah he's a champion hero that guy is a that guy deserves to be it deserves a Nobel Prize for the world he's doing for a second because he's like through some stringent hardcore studies proving that many of these psychoactive compounds have medicinal is a Rick Doblin from the multidisciplinary Association for psychedelic studies maps you know it's just they do these like real study they will hardcore studies where it's undeniable oh look what do you know psilocybin helps long-term smokers quit and when you compare it to chantix yeah it's like the the psilocybin is a million times better yeah that helps my depression a lot yeah it does it heals you changes the way your brain is functioning you're the path that you're on I think the path you're on like someone try to explain this to me once it's a I've always tried to remember the exact way it's explained but that we want to think of our moments as being moments individual unto themselves but they're not they're a chain of unique moments throughout your entire life your interpretations of those unique moments I'm paraphrasing this shit out how this guy said it no and then all of your associations with life itself that are connected to your interpretations of these moments and then here you are today and you want to think that this is life but it's only life because of all these pathways that you've carved in the way you view the world as soon as you change those death ways yeah you open up a whole new world because now your associations are different so now your brains reaction to life you change your route to work and almost a mess or you're changing and it's such a great feeling whenever anything that happens just slightly because a lot of people are in a cave in situation when it comes to their lives they're literally buried under a series of antiquated stale symbols that they're looking at the universe through and they feel trapped it's like their shoes are too tight yeah and if like a psychedelic or meditating - and I really mean that I'm not just saying that because that people because I'm I really think meditation has a very similar effect but any of these things they reset those simple structures in your brain and if you just like if you're in a cave in and you get an extra inch compared to like being home pressed against the wall that's a big fucking deal man oh right so it's slightly percentage difference change is like oh thank god I'm 13% less frightened for my entire life have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk about changing paths in life he's a very really interesting analogy he talks about like you're going to cars going exactly saying or a boat right or two boats going exactly the same direction but one boat just takes a two degree turn just two degrees yeah as they go further down the one boat that took the two degree turn is going to go wider and wider away from the original path and then each decision that you make that's a good decision takes you closer like even though it's just like you're just steering your ship just dirt as you go out it's gonna be a much different path a much different end then if you just stayed on the original path that's incredibly way different and psychedelics makes you go right turn Claud yeah whoa the currents try to bring you back though yes well kind of bring it back to where you were going see it's like gotta take him again well I've always said get off that car yeah that doing psychedelics it's like pressing like the reset button for your brain like control remember that that your your desktop reboots and there's only one folder on the desktop and that's that desktop says the folder says my old bullshit and you have two choices if you just like create a completely different desktop look at reality as a completely different or open up my old bullshit and fall back into these familiar patterns I had a very comforting right you know and you those moments after the psychedelic experience are so important to grab and hang on to because it gives you this opportunity to make this new way of thinking like a part of your habit yeah once you get in that habit whether it's fucking you know the 30 days or 60 days or 90 days like people say that once you like to have a pattern ingrained and how you behave and think and do it just takes a consistent approach to that pattern and then it becomes like a part of you like that's what quit smoking like you fast through 90 days and you'll be alright right jus say when you have if you go to send the same feed three times you just keep sitting there that's your that's your new all-time seed yeah it's like when you take a psychedelic it's like if your life is a polluted city like one of those polluted like what's that Detroit Detroit right yeah then it's like the psychedelic all of a sudden takes you in a helicopter outside the pollution and so now you're seeing oh god the air up here so fresh it's so nice but the thing is helicopters gonna land it's gonna put you back out into your city and that's where the job starts which is like shit man how can I clean this fucking thing up and then that's that's like the that's when you start doing things like exercising meditating or that's where you like create just a very simple intention in everything you do which is as much as possible I'm going to try to alleviate the suffering of people around me as much as I can yeah you know now that might not be a lot it might just be call it does that too we got back from from this last UFC just a little bit of mushrooms was enough that I saw a homeless guy and he's like I was like I opened my wallet and I only had 20s I was like not fuck it there you go yeah that's what it does those little moments man it shows you that you get those moments present themselves to you all day fucking long but if you are stuck in selfishness yeah it's real simple little things but it's fun it's a very wonderful that kind of simple intention can really deep pollute your your subjective city that you've been sucking in shitty gas there was one time I saw it that I was that I was uh the only time I was like I ever died to somebody but it was Willy Hunter was on him and he was shitting I'm fine he's shitting on some like comic who would become like a vine star you know she was a shitty comet but she became like a and he was like I hate vine well I mean there's for fun there's six-second like fun videos now I hate him like what about a six-second YouTube video you'd watch that I don't whatever he was just big shitty we're like try to talk about it he couldn't stop then we started with the mushrooms he was like I'm a bad person and never was like now now you're fine and you kept doing it and it eventually was like Willy listen you're right that was you being a bad person yeah look I'm so sorry but was like it's okay cuz here's a deal from now on you don't have to be that anymore yeah you can just let that go and let people talk and he's like yeah yeah that's what it shows you like you can change but that thing you're talking about where you realize shit I'm a bad person that is there's that contra in the name and Buddhism there's an actual name for that and it's considered to be a very sweet moment where you need that moment it's fertilizer where you need that moment where you look at your life and you feel this very specific kind of sadness because you look at all the times you could have been kinder all the times you could have like called that person back all the times you could have made decisions that were pushing your boat in the direction of a better world and you didn't do it and you should feel sad about that but you shouldn't spend your whole life feeling sad about it you should just spend some time there and look at it and think okay well that's gone the past has been devoured by time there's only this moment now and so from this point forward as much as I can my decisions are going to be based on reducing the suffering of my species and that means take up your trash you litter before that's when you have to let her keep going no no yeah the the path of of trying to figure out like was the best way in life is obscured by law I'm not amazing like there's laws that they've created that make the best tools to find out who you really are illegal like that's like there's not a therapy in the fucking world that will get a crazy sociopathic egomaniacal person to really look at themselves like a bag of mushrooms well there's nothing nothing no it does all those moments in film like wow I realize now that's all bullshit that's writing a mushroom trip people that you know that are untrustworthy that you can't you can't like you can't trust their stories you can't trust their they're like those are the people that we all agree could have like the best experience on psychedelics because we give them like the best view themselves yeah but those are the same type of people that are gonna argue against it like if you ever talk to people that don't want mushrooms to be legal or don't want say like ah but fuck that you think that should be leave you lose your fucking mind what about people who've lost your fucking mind it's like what mastermind what are you talking about those yeah there's been some people that have blown their brains out with LSD for sure there's definitely some people that had some psychotic episodes and it can be argued that a lot of those psychotic episodes are people who are control freaks or you go maniacs that are struggling with the reality that's presented with them present it to them it's a planet shouldn't try it that's for sure it's of people with history of schizophrenia family polar that's it yeah about bipolar people they probably shouldn't try it either yeah probably a whole slew of people who have abnormal human chemistry you know what I was bipolar people shouldn't try caffeine really shouldn't take caffeine pills yeah you shouldn't do anything that's gonna push you in a manic state it's like we can't consider you know it's like the victim thing about people the victims of psychedelics you know and I know you think climbing up what is it that amount yeah I think it's ridiculous but there's a valley there called the I just read about this on reddit I think it's called there's an area I think it's called the valley of rainbows and they call it that because of the brightly colored jackets on corpses that are all laying there dead and I think psychedelics have the same kind of Valley I think that there is an undeniable valley that must be filled with people who have been pushed into psychotic episodes or whom who under the influence of a psychedelic made bad decisions car accidents all the things that come from irresponsibly using ana toxic you've got to admit that's real but just because that is real doesn't therefore exclude all the people who are saying again and again and again and again my relationships are better so the marriage is here with alcohol yeah alright sometimes don't drunk drunk yeah but like it's pretty fun to get fucked up your friends once in a while you got to look at the whole paper look at the whole thing don't deny the fact that they're dangerous chemicals and that people have more than likely completely lost their shit because of them don't deny that but then also don't deny the benefits in the same way with American sniper much better movie if that character was actually dealing with the fact that he's blowing people away in a war that has been shown to be based on bad information don't you think that when you get to be as old as Clint Eastwood is no don't you think that you or your faculties have been compromised in the same way yeah he was he's not as sharp no on Million Dollar Baby was really good yeah but this is not that what's also it's the subject matter that he's prone to go into these like very right-wing and also you probably get over you can't separate your deep feelings you didn't mean feeling about women boxers exact you know but he has deep feelings about this so it's got to be a hundred percent rah-rah-rah it's like all right man now you're not even if you were younger you still wouldn't be able to see this it's like when someone when someone talks like in their own words and you get to hear them talk in their own words you get a sense of like oh I see why you created this piece of art I see why this is your perspective and when you saw that rip that Republican National Convention thing whatever the fuck it was when he was talking to Obama that's that's Clint Eastwood that was know he's so he's so fucking crazy that he thought that up like on the spot that was ad libbed I didn't even have anything planned out those fuckers guy is his speech in front of this gigantic group of people he's so confident in his ideas then he's gonna ad-lib a conversation with Obama complete with punchlines oh yeah I comes from a non video world - or he's like so what's a group of a thousand people well he's also just so completely confident yeah in his position and life and who he is and he's a movie star he's been a movie star for fucking a hundred thousand years everybody's been kissing his ass long before the internet came along he's also a guy that agreed to do a fucking reality show do you know that now his wife was in a reality show his wife was it some crazy reality show man his wife I don't know if they're still together I think they might have got divorced but he wanted to be a star so she married Clint Eastwood she was young and hot and then she did a reality show didn't know it yeah it didn't last I'm not sure if he's still with her it's worth it I looked up an interview with eastwood about directing the movie because i didn't understand how the guy really connected by this yeah oh I mean I was just like oh wow this is such blatant propaganda they're not even trying to make it subtle this is just like warts wartime movie out of it yeah yeah that I was curious like okay I wonder how involved Eastwood was in directing this just based on what I saw at the Republican National Convention didn't know it was improvised so now that kind of explains that I thought maybe Oh suffering from senile dementia or something it was called mrs. Eastwood & Company it was on 2012 it was a reality show so what the interview say though well the interview was you know it was just him saying like he had actually been reading the book when they called and he said let me finish the book I've got 40 pages left and so I read it the next day and decided you know just a basic basic the interview but I just it was a movie that was her pretty goddamn heart that's his wife it was his wife divorce and of course he would marry a superhot person she taught his fuck should how's the wowsa son a movie star yes what each part yeah you can't really boy we gonna say oh yeah I also have a story that's out on the youtubes now my first story they put it out now smuggling in Australia oh shit oh cool don't talk about that online what are you doing the beginning of it I should say this is all a lie you just got done talking about how truthful you should be do anymore cuz the results of this story but even then you you could be like admitting to an Interpol related in crime I don't buy any of that you're gonna fucking they have every bag of garbage I've never been gone at a time and they have them like locked up by date labeled so that if you talk about something they go back and they go we found it we found the bag we got the wrappers it's fucking kids on the pot and that you brought those they'll find your DNA from the wrapper from your sweat they'll isolate it and they'll bring you up into some sort of tribunal the next time you try to go to Sydney here's that little I care about that just YouTube search this is not happening already smuggles weeding into Australia and you can see it right now you are gangster sir you know man that makes me think of this movie that's coming I'm really excited about Timothy Leary's kid is releasing this movie about his dad and and and Richard Alpert but it's got all this like Bradley Cooper plays Timothy Leary I heard what's that bro this is a documentary oh I missed it who's gonna give acid to this kid and he wasn't gonna but then the kid picked up a Bible so he gave the kid acid the kid is about to pick up the bottle I can't do it he gets eyedropper and squirts in the kids mouth you see the kids eyeballs dilate falls back into a kaleidoscope and sergeant Pepper's do something probably worse something more ridiculous man well it's more you'll see through this yeah that's not who's watching this though yeah those sniper movies not really for smart people but it's cool to watch clips or sympathy Larry at the Senate hearings pologize cool watching him like having to talk to Senate about LSD it's badass so he just you apologize to your date yeah why we're talking about so I thought that would be better than I was sorry just a poor pic I mean you get to pick the next one that's hilarious or pick that's hilarious there's a lot of stories about this any again a shitload of tweets of people asking me like to substantiate but there's a lot of stories it's all over online what the Henry a liar yeah the concerns I can't say I don't know who the fuck is right and who's wrong I didn't do any research except a jury decide JSTOR is right yeah and then nothing else has been they owe him they owe jesse ventura 1.8 million dollars apparently one point eight nine million i say one point seven one point seven four with the fight so it's also crazy yeah that that's how let's get there it's never like one point eight one three seven four million like it's that exact amount is the pain how do they come up with it a new narrative down to the close eight hundred thousand that's a hundred thousand two weird thing man to make a movie about a guy you know was might have been a liar and put those lies in a movie and that gets all america all frothy I mean well that means that you know what that means that means another fucking attacks comer does that what it means so we had he gets all orchestrated I'm gonna get people ready to join up I don't think alright yeah I mean it's better than a draft I guess if you got a pick between a draft and like if that means like ridiculous propaganda movies coming out every year you know what I think I think you should know war we should fight no wars with anyone under 50 I think everybody who goes to war should be over 50 well peace let's see let's see how quick we fuckin settle this thing I bet it would be pretty goddamn quick Oh a bunch of old people too just don't want any trouble I mean that was like how can we is there a way to solve this without shooting them it's like those pedometers coming at me it's like okay but shooting them to death is the only way to stop a guy every not you because you think about the consequences of the decisions think about the consequences of a decision to fly in a plane to a place we've never been and shoot someone you never known based on the directions by some people who you don't know we're making you March they're making you go shoot jump jump they're making you do all this shit preparing you for you have to listen to them unquestionably no but imagine that with 50 year olds ya never gonna rub in we're gonna go wait a minute why was shootin these guys winning win we're breaking down what door who the fuck are you who the fuck were you and where'd you go to school what's your degree in and you're gonna tell me about international politics do you even know these fuckin Sunnis what's the difference Shino Sunni and Shiah sir tell me what the difference is do you know do you know why these people were war with each other do you know why they hate each other do you know why they hate us do you know this is holy land do you know how long this has been holy land do you know in there and you you if you had a group of 50 year old beat over there and out slug it oh you're loud so I have to listen is that what's going on are you gonna get my face and spit is that gonna make me intimidated and so I'll listen so I'll just go and kill some people that you say are bad if we did that if we just had only 50 year olds and above go to war just the whole fucking thing would change yeah the whole thing it's just it's easy to send fucking kids they don't know any better they'd say your cerebral cortex your frontal lobe they're saying like for young males especially because of fucking implies earlier the rowdier they're not making rational decisions like when you're a 16 year old kid your balls are filled with testosterone there's a completely new experience by the time you've got to be 40 years old you've had a lifetime of wanting to come a lifetime of like knowing what that is and knowing how to mitigate it no 17 18 you don't know what the fuck is happening to your body you add in to that masturbation guilt like people who are actually avoiding masturbation most of us don't but there are some who do so they try it as little white gloves on well I do the rats when they get caught Master man they put Megan wear a white glove Oh white gloves and someone who's not mad one of those GoPros under you over your bunk and if they don't see you beating off under the sheet I can fucking ask you questions doctor you want to come in here and talk to us real quick got anything on your mind like maybe but ya know ya go see your booties or something on your mind you're trying to keep boys assholes from I'm just thinking about killing right now what's Duncan this is not the type of soldier will look good for in this here army we want well-balanced individuals that make rational choices based on the evidence at hand not based on lust not based on a ball full of calm just waiting to fuckin jizz all over some new part of the world to spread your fuckin seed my gun is my cock bullets or my jizz and the brains oh my god in the movies best friend die to go Jim's dead bro really this bad like you can call me an American if I just think I'm still making of this is bad that's how manipulative it is like you want to walk out but simultaneously you feel like you're being like you have to go to 18 on this this is kind of done this an hour I like 26 to 18 it's kind of embarrassing if this turns out that this guy really did make up all this shit cuz there's another article I'm looking at right now about the the criticism of the post Katrina New Orleans story like how it's all total horseshit how they can prove it's horseshit cuz he wasn't even there at that time huh yeah it's like there's a lot of horseshit you mean there's there's there's Facebook and the movies all he's just trying to downplay all of his legend even though he's now it's like he's the one who was saying it yeah my you for this would be wrong good luck good luck the shot no I'm not even supposed to I'm not gonna be out here but I'm gonna fry you for it why aren't you looking you're the spotter look you help to tell if it's an IUD or not you just crouching behind a wall I just fuckin up his shot I'm gonna deal extra pressure on this there's a Facebook page not endorsed innocence let me know that's dedicated entirely to the subject and it's Chris Kyle was a murderous liar the murder it's a community on Facebook and it's all a bunch of different posts saying that you know saying how much it was bullshit this is crazy man yeah I guess people don't want to it's really hard for people to digest the simple fact that that war makes a lot of money for a small amount of people it's a profitable endeavor and if you want to make money in that industry then you've got to convince heroes because that is the hero against it's a really sweet impulse the idea that I will give my life for you to protect you to protect people I don't know that's the one of the highest human aspirations it's like an incredible thing but so you take those people who have this incredible aspiration to give their life to protect people and you lie to them yeah brainwash them and send them to a place to kill people based on this very Winkleman leave the NFL and fucking give his life and by the way well know Pat Tillman did it on his own yeah yeah we need you to do this but Pat Tillman was a huge critic once he got over there you know he was killed by friendly fire and there's many people have speculated they murdered him they murdered him because he wouldn't shut the fuck up about how disorganized everything was about what a dog and pony show and everything was fucked up the people that he had listened to were all assholes he was like this is crazy like this is not what I signed out for this is not what I wanted like UB there's total chaos which led to this fuckin crossfire situation he's fuckin yeah I'm stop shooting and then they shot him they shot his whole troupe up though I mean look when you start shooting things that's the other thing they become target and then say we've become targets they don't comment on drone mistakes they don't comment on the other times when it's it blows up a fucking wedding convention which is most of the time that's like there's more mistake the innocence and then our policy is not to comment on that like wait why is that an allowable policy yeah the percentage is terrifying if you look at the percentage of people that are actually killed by drones that are their intended targets it's terrible should be terrorists but they're not surgical strikes yeah how close is it you know just it's not a scalpel on the end of a fishing pole yeah you know yeah this is the idea that surgical is retarded if we had drones going overhead and then I found out who was responsible for it Yemen and I'm a little kid I'm like the this this fucking Yemen drone that's over here killed my kids like goddamn right I'm gonna wanna attack Yemen stop fuckin said of that shit over here if you kill my father yeah well not only that but why wouldn't they want to if you look at the like we were talking there earlier about what you were saying about this these invading armies in Iraq and all the people that have PTSD and the birth defects you know you got to go way back to the original Gulf War they were using fucking depleted uranium and everybody forgets about this yeah everybody completely sweeps this under the rug it was proven they used depleted uranium shells that blew right through fucking tanks this incredibly dense nuclear waste that poisons everything around it for 100,000 years 25 years ago we're expecting those 15 year olds who are the 40 year olds now to go oh well I don't care anymore no big deal yeah but not just forget about that time you killed my entire family when you're right here someone representing your governments right they're totally cool but it's something that we're not supposed to talk about just like the ideologies that we discussed earlier just like religion it falls into a religion got at optional ISM falls into a religion don't all start talking about it but in the end you can talk about it well it's also because like look there keep talking about it right the weed it's like that's why it's only cuz I once I got another deal right everybody talks about comes normalized you gotta just talk about it all time exactly if you're friends with whatever and it doesn't mean that you don't this is where people get confused it doesn't mean that there aren't heroes and doesn't mean you don't need a defense you don't need to be able to protect yourself from some fucking North Korean asshole ya gotta sides to start taking over the world like what if they had massive resources we're lucky they're in a resource starved environment you have this communist dictator with nuclear weapons in a resource starved environment where they have to shut the lights off at night because they can't afford to keep them on all right and if that guy had oil or gold or something crazy and like Saudi Arabia type money if like one of those guys became some sort of a fucking world spreading villain you need heroes you need real soldiers that are willing to fight against bad people that's what happened in World War two right in World War two when you have the Nazis and all that I mean I'm sure there's also the phenolic City they use the justified war argue as yes proof to get us into sort of less way less justified war solutely and not we're saying for about the best thing to happen in the US Army we're saying look now we can do anything we just say we're doing the right thing exactly what exactly the same thing we were saying about religion is that it's not that these people are bad people and it's not that God is bad no one's saying that like but what we're saying is like look what's being done in the name of this and look how there's no thinking right whenever there's no thinking and horrific acts are being done there's no thing if you're ever in a situation where a fucking little kid has a rocket launcher everybody should stop what they're doing get the fuck out of there and try to figure out a how how did this happen B how do you fix it and the way you don't fix this is by shooting kids that doesn't fix shit that's just like the mother my baby is doing now Oakland PD is starting up like youth basketball leagues and they're coaching and stuff too so that the youth grow up not going fuck the police but like no the police are cool they help us out and stuff that's like we can't solve it right now but 20 years from now it'll be better than it is now well it's also when they drop it in New York when they did the police slowdown where they just wouldn't arrest anybody anything after those two kids got oh those two cops got shot by that one guy yeah um that one guy who by the way also shot his fucking ex-girlfriend like the guy was a piece of shit like two people who think he's a hero like Jesus Christ he shot his girlfriend first and then he went shot those cops he was a psychotic murderous person but because of that act the cops backed up the cups finally started stop fucking with people they need to stay where they're at right there yeah exactly where they are right by finding a camera I'm not saying that they should be scared all the time of being murdered but I'm saying the attitude that they develop okay we're not gonna arrest anybody for anything that's not important cigarettes aside so tell them to get lost or don't you shake him down yeah how about you hire a fucking lawyer to go sue that guy and then you find out he does have any monies I'm gonna pay anyway there's your problem yeah you got a problem with tax collecting you know probably that guy robbed somebody then you bring jaywalking if he comes in he breaks in your house and steals your TV then you have the cops but anything any use of that other than protecting people fucking choking a guy cuz he's not paying cigarette tax no what the fuck are the cops yeah it's not like New York plunged into chaos because they started enforcing write him a ticket yeah you know much nicer the world would be if cops only acted in that slow down manner but they don't act like that with a big black brothers it would be don't act here you've been there it was the last few months you've moved there like half the yeah what is your experience like in the difference in racism out here as opposed to race well everyone's all joined in here we're way step more separated but I don't think we see shit like why people 20 should see the cut like they're constantly getting like you know what resisting arrest is resisting arrest is after the first time someone's like hey let me see your ID and they grab you and they push you the second time the same shit happens a cop pushes you the four times they gather your car and they grab your wrist come on man if you pull back you've resisted arrest wow I'm late for a movie what let's just talk about this first you've resisted arrest right it's up to their discretion whether or not they choose to arrest you or don't arrest some people get off on the exact same charge and they skate whereas other people get arrested like you're a white guy with a suit and you do a certain thing to stop it frisk yeah based on stop and frisk people Latinos and blacks who look like they might have some shit right you didn't see it on Wall Street you didn't see them course to getting stop and frisk on Wall Street people Wall Street weren't as outraged about it stop and frisk for shit that shouldn't be illegal in the first so that's like illegal search it's like saying we're gonna just search you but we have no reason to search it well it could have been weapons right they're looking for doughnuts dope man they want to get you for that arrest you for dope something that grows out of the earth it helps cancer I'll be honest cops lovers if yeah if I'm a cop and I don't like you and I see something even if I don't think it's wrong if I'm a 23 year old I'm like well I'm gonna put you in jail now meanwhile you think it's wrong Wall Street guy with a leather-bound briefcase it has your in your engravement of your initials and your family crest on it they pull you over they stop and frisk you pop open that you see a he'll heroin uh-huh heroin pills but on that bottle has your name on it the King got his price up this yeah I know the doctor as well you know I know that people would abused their privileges based on stuff I don't believe in we have a comedians basketball league and we're all playing and it's it's directly they call technicals on curses and stuff and so if you hear somebody yeah well they don't know it's the comedian's League there's we just made our own comedians League but if we hear somebody cursing some other community I hear fucking Jeff die curse oh he cursed be cursed and believes curse to be not allowed right but isn't that just for fun like yeah but we want the fucking benefit we're gonna use our power so we don't believe in 23 somebody goes fuck you Catholic well I'll look at anything I can to put you in jail right now that would be like if we were playing pool and I got suckered shot Oh get me ball in here exactly cuz I curse that you actually asked for it no no dude you gotta be born in like they'll be sitting like I declined that rule dude she came you guys do that playing basketball you need to stop you need to get on mushrooms and think about that yeah calling technicals like that or not having your Jersey Mike we're comics nobody remembers to watch that Jersey and it's only comics playing against comics they made our own league so you know but Mike it leaves to get on that that's a Larry yes we have one team we call them the corporate sellouts and that's all the agents and managers it's funny you know what you should do you should recruit really fucking good players and just get him to do an open mic that's the diamond shit that's what he does and he gets him to one of them Mike like no holiness to play the game of comics they're all having fun okay will used to have a comics of a softball league back in Boston really oh my god it would get so competitive it was so crazy it was like it like competitive people screaming at people over fucking fouls or or where ball was in the ball was out you know it's like oh my god yeah I remember like people in each others face throwing their gloves down screaming each other a comics bat baseball game yeah but that's Boston baby babies without their bottles I was back at Boston that they fixed our club that laughs Austin yeah the sound system is awesome okay you don't have to worry about it any more than all of them cuz everybody had that rumor that was out that the sound system sucked is the loudest fuck it did feedback once when I got like on top of the actual speaker I was talking about but that happens almost everywhere you know unless it's perfect that's one thing the Improv does you there's never a fuckup if you work in an improv like if the this sound system is always perfect the seating is always perfect it's never sightline issues they don't ever fuck around like you know some clubs that you work out they're kind of funky like if you see idioms we can't even see fly balls yeah but Claude is worse because there's often pillars in the room and if you're behind that pillar and you will go to the right side like the the people that are behind that pillar literally can't even see you yeah like they're there but unless they have to watch monitors in a club The Improv has that nailed yeah they always say like no you got to set this up like that like all of them are like no up set it up like that yeah this way it's
