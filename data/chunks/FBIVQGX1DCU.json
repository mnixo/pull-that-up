haha hello freak bitches and I got interesting things so they're really asking it's a last night I believe you you got a pile of notes what is it about breathing what is it about breathing or is breathing just one component of this is it breathing and also focusing on what you're trying to accomplish yeah focus absolutely works let me explain a little bit about breathing breathing is chemistry oxygen is chemistry in the body so if you are able to access energize the cells more than we do normally because we talked about the lymphatic system and the tissue and actually the body is able to store up more oxygen than 100% we presumed a possible it scientifically we are able to store up more oxygen so if a breathing technique whatever breathing technique is able to store up more oxygen in the cell that means going into the tissue going into the lymphatic system then suddenly the the chemistry becomes alkaline the acid gets out of the body at will and then the mind the mind is positive a little electrical charges neurotransmitters and they are subtly able to connect in the body and you enabling you to have control direct all the systems in the body that's the way nature manner to be so the mind a minds condition to be effective in the body is making the body by breath but at the right breathing profound breathing in an alkaline state then these electrical signals are able to travel throughout and we the way nature meant it to be is that we are able to direct any part of the body so the immune system and the Crean system the lymphatic system vascular's all the systems we told a little bit last time but I get more direct evidence now and right now we are working with the universities on the brain on say emotional reactivity and they see incredible things that we actually are able to get into those places where emotion exists and we think yeah emotion where is it where is it but it is translated also as something chemical so they can measure motion in the chemical form yes what are they what are they measuring and they they go in to say the hypothalamus mm-hmm hypothalamus hippocampus amygdala those are the places where this chemistry is going on and we had no way to get into that now if you are able to oxidize those part and to pressurize with breathing techniques into those parts then suddenly you feel you begin to cry alright because the chemistry is changing you are dealing with the chemistry which was stored up because she couldn't work it up before and now you are able to tap in there change the chemistry and that that's the function you're not able to deal with it now so later when you have peace and you are somewhere not stressful then work on it and breathing does it it break it into it positively influences the chemistry in the in the depth of the brain you know what happens you create 25% more blood flow and a blood flow is with oxygen through through your breathing yes well it makes sense because your blood is being it's carrying oxygen right so the more oxygen you provide your blood and you are definitely providing it more with these big long deep breaths and these techniques at you that you pursue yes manipulating up the spine the central nervous system up till the tunnel of the light the brainstem is at top so if you pressurize after act inhaling exhaling like we did last time you did about three minutes almost and without air in the lungs very good first round it's very promising for the next rounds because you get more and more oxygen it's only to show that you you are able to store up oxygen far more that you ever used before so in case when you need it to regulate the chemistry inside the body then it needs oxygen then you we are all able with these breathing exercises to get it anywhere where the chemistry is messed up and a chemistry messed up will send off a signal but we are not emotionally not listening because we get our worries and we need to do the deadline and this and data so we are not in and then this chemistry stays over there and and will deregulate the system and then we become sick and we don't know what's happening we go to the doctor and or the psychiatrist because we could become a depressed and all but we are very able to get into any place in the body and in this case the the brain or where and we do all these studies now with the university they say cognitive therapy just talking to each other in the psychology and psychotherapy that's not enough that was a conference with 200 experts and they did this breathing and then they so wow they're talking it's not enough but if you do this breathing then you really get into the brain not suddenly you get a sense of control because you're creating this extra circulation of blood yes to get up with oxygen making it alkaline then suddenly the blockage is created because of wrong chemistry because of trauma or anxiety or grief then suddenly it that chemistry is being dealt with and you get balanced hmm simple and we keep it simple and and and try to get this web of our thoughts thinking of so many difficulties and complication what is emotion what is fear what is PTSD what is trauma what is depression we don't know where it is in the brain just get all the brain full of oxygen get a get alkalinity up and you are able to steer by going through the spine up in your head and do it all is that why I believe is that why some studies have shown that a rigorous exercise particularly cardio like running elliptical machines things along like those lines are just as good for depression as medication absolutely absolutely it it's dealing with the oxygen and attention they enforcing when you think those giant deep breaths you take when you're jogging or yes yes and when you do they're staying so you actually create a the body to be effective with the oxygen then suddenly different mechanisms are at work more oxygen is coming in and the chemistry is balancing out a depression is caused by a wrong chemistry creating inflammation ice you know I'm a regular exerciser but sometimes you
