Gregory how you holding up I am holding it up although not as much as I would like to be holding it out like that's the I think that's a lot people are talking about all the different constraints of this pandemic masturbation has gone by the wayside for a lot of you if you live in a two-bedroom apartment and you got two kids hmm you know you gonna have to jerk off while you're shitting bring your phone in there with you have you got a land it just right you got to let it squirt and then come down between your legs into the water to point down you got to hurt yourself you know you got to go overhand look you're doing deep in the third gear yeah that's the thing is like and I've never been a shower guy and especially now that I'm fifth I'll be 54 on Wednesday I remember jerking off in the bath once and it just floated fucking like drug floated all right it's it's fucking floating and cooking right I remember once I was at my my brother-in-law's apartment in New York it was in New York City and we played midnight hockey in Central Park he played in this league and he go out it was fucking February when I was like 20 20 degrees out and we played hockey for an hour and a half in Central Park you know they have rinks out there Wolman rink and we come back and I and I was out of shape but this but this guy's like a hockey fanatics I want to do it so I come back and I was like I got to take a bath so I go into the bath and and they're fucking slob just three brothers living together in an apartment so I go in the bathroom and I fill it up I get in and I'm laying there and I'm fucking chilling out I'm like oh this feels so good and then I see this egg drop soup and I realize like they all jerk off in the shower I just like jumped up fucking showered for like 45 minutes it's so weird that we're more terrified of jizz than virtually any other body part like if I had a choice between a guy jizzing on my pants or peeing on my pants I'd say peeing all day oh yeah right absent that hilarious isn't that weird it's like we've decided that one fluid coming out of the dick is associated with pleasure male pleasure dirty men trying to come he owns you pee just an idiot white peeing on me man yeah my friends have peed on me it's happened you know we were gonna know if you're out in the woods we were out in the woods and we were at a we were at a fort we had this 4/20 nage we were like 13 and we were already drinking and smoking a lot of pot we were like 13 and we were in this fort and we all got shit-faced and then my friend just pulled his dick out and he started peeing on all of us go home that night like my jeans were drenched in piss wasn't even mine of course my mother thought it was me that really is a difference room men and women girls don't go out and pee on each other now no they rarely go in the woods by themselves anyway right right just a group of girls in the woods that's some horror movie you're not supposed to do that yeah girls guys in the woods that's normal shit right a group of girls in the woods it's like what are you girls to do you have a gun yeah you can't just be in the woods yeah isn't it where the woods make everything scarier everything let's make our all the grim fairy tale stuff right well it's all wolves would eat people yes all right that's what it was a little red riding-hood like we don't have to deal with that anymore so we kind of forgot what can happen yes wolves don't play by any rules they'll eat your kids yeah for sure hell yeah and people used to have to deal with that until they wiped him out is I'm not an anti wolf guy don't get me out but that's what those fears are all about right going through the woods at night and monsters are hiding and they're trying to get you yeah everything scarier in the woods we've escaped the woods we got some nice hard surfaces and some streetlights I feel pretty good about it I feel like we're fucking holding our ground here but every now and then a coyote will run across a bank bullets right every now and then a coyote is on Olive Street just looking around trying to see what kind of actually fucking creeps like the roadrunner the fucking coyote man watch out he's got some Acme shit except in that in the roadrunner the coyote never wins yeah in real life they always win of course they win every time they beat me they killed all my chickens dude all of them they got them all this was here and yeah Wow yeah they've killed you at fencing yes they got in they broke into the chicken coop they killed nine chickens the last remaining nine chickens he had killed the plucked him off one at a time damn yeah with help from my dog at one point time my Mastiff became friends with the coyote and he's way bigger than them so they used him to break into the chicken coop so he broke into the chicken coop and the Coyotes got in the chicken coop with the dog like they literally tricked the dog into breaking into the chicken coop oh and if the Mastiff got shit from other masters like dude you're friends with coyotes well you know he just got tricked he thought there were dogs yeah there were his friends right and my other dogs kind of an asshole and they don't get along like good they're both gone now unfortunately they're 13 yeah they both passed in the 13 is exceptionally old for a mastiff - he was really hurt at the end but he was the best dog but he just wanted to be friends with the coyote coyotes like hey man let's kill these fucking hilarious so we are pressure from the Coyotes when when this the thing that happens with chickens where be convinced that they have laid a viable egg like they've been bred with it's kind of sad really and they'll sit on an egg and they pluck all their feathers out and there's nothing nothing ever happens right this is no egg ever comes and turns into a chick because they're not being impregnated by roosters right which by the way I didn't know until I was 40 okay and I was like oh yeah of course duh I didn't know that tell us forty anyway you have to take them out of the regular population and put them in a smaller coop where they have to sit up on their feet and you do it for a few days and they get over it if you don't they'll continue to pull their feathers out for like a whole cycle and they'll do it for like twenty eight thirty days it's it's not good for them they're pecking at their skin so you have to separate them so we separated them we put him in a smaller coop a little small one where it has to sit up for a couple days and the dog just smashed that just I mean he's a hundred and forty pounds of solid muscle and bone the sweetest dog of all time Mastiffs they're so sweet like he didn't want to hurt a fly but this coyote was his buddy and he was like yeah what a great idea so he smashes this little chicken coop and in the coyote we're playing like fucking clue or something me and my family are sitting around playing some board game and we look up I go oh fucking coyotes got a chicken so the Coyotes running through the backyard with a chicken in its mouth and I see it we had a fence in the backyard where the coyote jumped over that was about five feet five five feet five inches maybe something like that yeah it was nothing no sure their back legs are like Springs with a chicken in its mouth dude I know it leaped up into the air touch the top of the five foot thing like it was nothing and then bounced right over and and landed on the ground so gracefully yeah look I had to admire it yeah I know it just killed my chicken but I'm like whoa yeah but dude you've when you have kids and you see those fucking things you just go wait what is stopping that from eating a baby right nothing right think stopping that from eating a baby you leave a baby in the yard a coyote will steal it and jump over the fence with it understand that right fortunately human beings don't leave their fucking babies by themselves yeah but if you did dude we were in South Africa one time and we're taking a hike down to the the Cape of Good Hope which is like the point it's like the western point of Africa and they have baboons there it's like a baboon fucking forest and so we're like she was a park ranger they're like should we be scared and he's like you guys are fine but if you put your my son at the time was about three or four say if you put him down they're gonna take him just like that we were like could you immensely carry your baby get snatched by a baboon which is like a dog monkey yeah right there the weirdest ones yeah cuz they kind of have like a dog face almost a giant canines right do you know they're so smart that they trained dogs baboons do baboons trained on oh shit they steal puppies they bring the puppies into their little camp and they feed them and that way the puppy barks whenever anything's coming near so they can go to sleep oh no shit dude and they eat babies yeah damn what what the fuck man it's crazy video - you see these baboons dragging these puppies by their tail just drag them and then they try to get away sit the fuck now it's putting the puppies know what to do the puppies - they give him some food they're like little demons trained dogs there's strong shit they're super strong there's a really really interesting guy out of Stanford professor Robert Sapolsky and we were really fortunate enough to get him to talk on the podcast about a bunch of different things one of them being parasites that control behavior of certain animals and cats and stuff to call toxoplasmosis but another thing is that he studied baboons if I like a long time like years he study the same pack you could go back to Africa study these same baboons over and over again and while he was studying them there was a case where a really crazy thing had happened where poisoned food had gotten into the dump and these baboons had eaten the poisoned food because the Alpha is always ate first they got the poisoned food and they died off and something like that I hope I'm not fucking this up but some there was some sort of a shift because of eating poisoned food where the the really aggressive males were gone and then the males just started like grooming each other and hanging out was like the hairstylists one I mean it's really crazy who are like more chill ok maybe not till babies let's just go raid the dumpsters those baboons survived and then the crazy thing is many generations later that same behavior the shift in behavior was still observed there wasn't so much like super aggressive angry tooth and claw males that are dominating everyone else it was more like cooperation and yeah it's crazy shit I know I'm butchering it so apologies to professor Sapolsky he's amazing his stuff about this guy so maybe they're sent to this meat to movement we castrated all aggressive men well I have a bit where I talk about hyenas and like matriarchal animal societies Ryan is the the females are particularly vicious I don't want to do the bit but one of the reasons why they're vicious is because the men are bitches all right they're all in their way and there's lions everywhere they can't be strong yeah so the females got more powerful and then they took over the society that happens in all sorts of ecosystems we have this idea that the males have to dominate because we dominate now right in nature like where we are not a single-celled organism right we're not a primate that has hair all over its body anymore we're some new thing well we became this new thing because we adapt it right something happened there's natural selection there was random mutations and then BOOM human being in 2020 but that doesn't mean this is the same thing as a human being in three thousand twenty or four thousand twenty or ten thousand twenty we might be turning into a toe different thing and it seems like we are to me I mean if you just look at the difference between like like this this dope-ass chimpanzee schoo that uh this dude made for me man shane's machine on Instagram he made that uh army helmet head too but the point is like this thing is fucking way stronger than us yeah this thing is like it might look kind of like us but it would tear us to pieces I mean it's even if it's like close to the same weight as us it's so impossibly strong I can't even imagine it so we're not that anymore somebody happened something happen write something out we we stop being this ridiculously strong murderous omnivore right and we became a human being which seems to be way more calm except in big burst of rage you know mass shoot well it's like in that book Sapien when when we went from being was it Neanderthal to to homo sapien that they existed at the same time yeah and that actually the Neanderthal is way stronger way faster bigger no brain to dope did have a bigger brain don't wait so I thought true I thought the safest room I thought Homo sapiens out thug how thought out thunk I think they think they did because I think they think that the larger brain if I remember correctly was correct connected to the mass of the bodies the bodies are very massive right they were like my height it was like a really tall male like five eight neanderthal brains bigger not necessarily better but they were like 210 pounds yeah they were just built different than us and not tall no they were short wide thick ass fucking crazy thick bones like their bone structure was very dense they they had like real like the difference between human like mahoma sapien bones and Neanderthal bones you look at them like damn these motherfuckers were sturdy yeah right see it doesn't ever do it that the Homo sapiens were able to get into trees and get into places where they could escape see in those images right there they look pretty similar than the shape of the head yeah and they have the hips are lower yeah but the bones don't look too much what's shorter but the balls don't look too much bigger right other things I'd seen something where it was talking about the the mass of the bones that there were larger different proportions than Homo sapiens this is crazy there's been a bunch of different kinds of people man once you really wrap your head around that and what are those ones in Russia they're still trying to figure out the Denisovan yeah and then that there's a few of them the homo flora insists that little hobbit man then lived and Flores there's a human yeah that's a weird little human being right there's been a bunch of us no it's true if you think about you know got God willing this species goes forward as far as you say ten thousand I mean can you imagine in the year ten thousand it was like when you look at all those movies like et or any of those it's always a it's a bigger head a smaller body and big fingers cuz it's just a fucking keyboard yep I mean think about when et was made there wasn't even really computers being used on a regular basis at that point right but they sort of figured out that's what it's gonna be do you remember that Matthew Broderick movie wargames now do you want to play a game he was like thermonuclear war like yeah he played thermonuclear war with a computer yeah that's what I remember that's what people thought like oh my god computers are gonna take over yeah kind of right they just didn't see it coming like this what do you mean care enough you don't think they're yeah they're definitely right I'm I just it's not like computers are starting nuclear wars and tricking society right but once once they do once they realize how fucked up our priorities are you know once once computer one thing you have to say about though that's coronavirus thing this is a good example of people who are at least like the compliance of the the the country the total compliance it's not perfect but it's pretty fucking incredible right pretty fucking incredible you got the whole country to shut down for a month for a virus and just kind of hang out and just that no one goes anywhere you go to supermarket minimal movement you know couple state though couple states are holding out couple States I think Mississippi is like fuck it we gonna keep on living away we do I think it was Alabama I think Alabama there is that see if his Alabama was the quote they said we're not California yeah you realize what we represent to the deep south we are the fucking annoying like yeah the little snowflakes for sure dude meanwhile we're not at all is the fucking there's a lot of tough people California's got a lot of right-wingers also yeah man a lot alabama governor refuses to issue shelter-in-place order we are not California look at her god bless 80 years old her heart it's all covet 19 K IV said during a news conference on Thursday she would not issue a shelter-in-place order that 21 of the states have enacted to prevent further spread of Kovan 19 y'all we are not Louisiana we are not New York State we are not California oh okay you got to publish that whole statement you got to publish that whole stem you can't just say we are not California see that's a little sneaky yeah it's right sneaky all right but I get it because you can't have the whole thing in a title of a story right now everything's clickbait but that's a good clickbait we are not California yeah but we're not Louisiana not so clickbait is it now that's like what are you saying you know it's so funny that the South has these standing it goes back to the Civil War I mean the statewide identity is so powerful you think about how Texans think of themselves they are Texans before they are they before they are Americans oh yeah and it's like that in most southern states and it's like you know that's what the fucking war was fought about but it's Texas more than any of the other ones now yeah Texas it's a totally different country I'm a hundred percent on board with that it's a different country yeah it's Texas I got their own economy they're a republic - they were for the longest time they could have bailed mm-hmm you know like and they're the ones who had a fight off Comanches dude yeah oh my god when I read this book wit was what is the the Guin now Empire the summer moon this Native American book I read actually listen to it on audio I don't wanna lie but it's amazing and it's all about the Comanches and the the Comanche Indians and the Texas Rangers which were created to try to combat the Comanches this guy moved to Texas and started reading up on the history of American Indian and settler combat and all the other different crazy stuff that went on during those days and he's like why in the fuck these Comanches just ran this place for hundreds of years no she's never like the first one to figure out horseback yeah that was Texas so the Texas Rangers were the first successful guys against the Comanche and they basically fought like the Comanche they fought on horseback they didn't dress like regular soldiers they grew their hair out long they're just savages yeah and they were our savages and they went out and fought the savages at the savage game right and that's like what established Texas that's there that's a deeply rooted independent place like oh yeah fuck you we carved this fucking place out yeah don't do there's a book I just just finished this book about that exact time it was about the Rangers when they first went down into Mexico because it's a book by Cormac McCarthy called blood meridian oh yeah I've heard about that dude it's about these these Texas Rangers they go into Mexico and they get paid per scalp so it's just like it's just detailing and its base is based on a true story it's about this group that goes down in there and they lose it it's like it's like heart of darkness they go down there or you know Apocalypse Now yeah they go down there and they they start going after tribes that are attacking Americans and then eventually they realize they're just making money for scalps they go after fucking peaceful societies kids fucking and it they were just they would go in and they would pick up babies and smash them against rocks and I mean everything is detailed about how it really was but and Cormac MacCarthy like to that guy can fucking write goddamn that wasn't that long ago now this was the 1860s yeah that's really close yeah if you think about the difference between life now and then but again you know look at what's going on with the cartels in Mexico mm-hmm I mean there's giant swaths of Mexico just totally controlled by the cartels if you're a person who lives in that town like yeah shit out a lot no one's gonna almost gonna come rescue you no one's gonna help you now there's no government there's no police right there yeah now you want to talk about fucking heroic people how about guys that will stay in the local police and try to fight against these cartels journalists in Mexico that'll write about the cartels you got it yeah that's a death sentence how did you think about these immigrants that are coming to this country it's like you know there was a time where we really did honor the idea that if you were a refugee from a war-torn country whose life was in danger that would it was that was a reason to get into this country and it's very it's very hard for them to figure out at the border who's who and who's telling what story but you know you go to a lot of places and you know El Salvador Nicaragua I mean they are literally fleeing for their lives when they leave their towns yeah that's bright next door yeah we got this weird idea that that's far enough away I know I know it's real weird yeah cuz it's in a lot of ways it's like any disaster that can happen you know you almost should have saw it coming yeah like almost every crazy disaster look you almost should have saw it coming like why why are they still building houses that get torn apart by hurricanes mm-hmm isn't it possible to build a house it doesn't get torn apart by heart you have it economically it's not only wise it's like - it's too hard when you see houses getting torn apart by hurricanes like you get it it's a resource issue but part of you is like men as human beings like we know how to make houses that survived hurricanes all right don't we yeah it makes some hurricane proof houses right yeah why don't they like retrofit houses for hurricanes I get it be super expensive but when you see like the amount of money that they have now with this stimulus package I hate to say it but it does bring forth a lot of the ideas that people like Bernie Sanders talk about where it's like you've got all this money to help people when the shit hits the fan right but why didn't you have all this money to help people like get out of a bad situation or why didn't you have all this money to help stimulate inner cities that are economically depressed why does it have to wait until the entire country is shut down for a month that you realize like we got to get these people some fucking money look where's this money coming from man all right what are you doing with it it's almost like on a micro level you can look at your own family for a lot of people like I know with me it's like I'm on the road more than I probably want to be sometimes because I'm always like I got a kid in college I got to save money and now that I'm not working at all for possibly a long fucking time any comedians we're gonna be one of the last people back in the workforce because it's gonna it's gonna demand that people trust getting back into groups again I refuse to let you call it the work force us being kitchens carrying big funny bone people were doing things they don't want to do for money you are the ones in the workforce and thank you no but just in terms of money I think about like I'm fine you know I we're tightening up keeping it simple and I'm realizing in a way as far as my family goes never been happier with my family never felt closer we're having amazing memories we're having we do yoga as a family every other night we have dinners we take turns cooking it we did fucking jigsaw puzzle it's amazing and I wouldn't be doing that right now if there wasn't a goddamn pandemic going on that's that's true right it's like a little bit of a reset in terms of the time that you have and like what it's what's worth what to you right what is it what do you want do you want a bigger house do you want more property do you want more than - or do you want more happiness yeah because for a lot of people I keep chasing more and more money but it's not necessarily making you happier because you're just doing it for the money it's not like money that came along while you're doing what you loved yeah and so for a lot of us when you're chasing things like why are you doing it hmm and sometimes you stop or you forced to stop like we're forced to stop and then you go why am I just living on momentum that I never assess whether or not it's smart to be flying all the time and always tired from it coming in on Sunday just fucking exhausted all the time instead of just waking up like now I'm just waking up I know it's my way or no jet lag yeah you wake up and go Mike look I'm awake it is so weird after 30 years of doing stand-up to not fucking go out at all I mean I've never gone I don't think I've ever gone more than two or three weeks without doing stand-up and really I rarely rarely do less than four nights a week yeah and to not do it at all now for two weeks straight three weeks straight what's this you've ever done where you didn't do it before I would say probably three to four weeks I remember the first time I took a big break I had knee surgery my ACL reconstructed my left knee the first one ever got and I was two weeks out like no standard for two weeks then I finally did it on crutches I'm like I am doing fucking stand-up yeah I'm just I'm getting up there yeah with quit with crutches on it did stand up I was like I'm not stopping like this is ridiculous yeah two weeks was too much I was freaking out because I wasn't that good back then either so two weeks it's like you know that's like that was probably like 91 or something like that that's like touch-and-go back then man so how are you dealing with this shift in the paradigm because for us it's not just it's like we are receiving accolades we are getting positive energy thrown at us in the form of laughter how are you dealing with like your psyche and in in the loss of that oh that's interesting that's an interesting question doesn't seem to be effect to me at all I guess maybe because I've been able to do the podcast still yeah but also because I'm one of those people that are very highly value recognizing the reality of the moment and accepting it I think it's very important very important to not dwell and freak out about things that you have zero control mmm this is clearly something we have zero control over the whole world shut down and I think in those opportunities sometimes it gives you a moment to reflect and go okay like how do I feel about everything how am I you know what what am i doing like if this if this really is this temporary existence am i doing it in the most pleasurable way the most enjoyable way the most fulfilling and loving way like how am I doing this the right way am I just doing this the way I've been doing it because I'm on this momentum kick of you know you're constantly doing more and constantly bigger places and constantly traveling and okay that's all fun no doubt about it that stuff's fun but what's the right balance right there's like there's a health and enjoyment balance that you have to recognize and family and community balance to like we're all forced to like hang out with each other you know even if we're doing it like social distance style we're kind of forced to be around each other all the time mm-hmm it's good yeah it's good what we were supposed to be that's how people are supposed to live you're supposed to live around each other all the time support each other each other when somebody's down like what can I do I mean it's like one of the first impulses a lot of people are feeling is alright first and foremost take care of my own yeah and then the second feeling which is almost as strong as like who how can I help out a community yeah our feeling of community it's enhanced you know one of the places that I always think of as the loneliest places is apartment buildings yeah ours feel like apartments are really lonely which is a weird feeling right to have when you're looking at something that has thousands of people living in one structure or hundreds of people or whatever the number might but I remember living in apartment buildings I never knew any of those people I'm like hey what's up yeah this company little door you shut your cage you both yeah and you hope nobody breaks in and takes your things you know yeah apartments are weird like you don't you don't get too tight with people that you know live next door especially if it's rentals yeah if it's AK if it's a condo where you own people start to go like all right you're gonna be here for a while we'll say hi well Norton I think owns this place and he was saying you know know anybody oh really maybe it's changed since the this conversation that I had with him because like because I live the fucking thousand people I don't know any yeah and he's got a fucking pool and it's never invited me like how many times I like kiddingly I go like hey we should all come over on Sunday you're like we'll be at the cellar hey we should all come over Sunday hang out of your pool and he's always like yeah his voice goes up my you can come to his dungeon first of all who knows Waltons and who knows what kind of things fake feet crazy norm dick insert at the bottom of it he's so hilarious I saw him the other day in spider-man oh no shit yeah I hate him and he stinks something like that it was like it was a quick a quick blurb where they're asking him how he feels about spider-man it was fucking hilarious dude his book is called happy endings what's so fucking funny he wrote two books Jim Norton is a legit author yeah and I was saying how do i conversation with him about it there he is play it he got booked his agent negotiated it they set the car he got a trailer they put on makeup they went through wardrobe tests and then just he stinks that I don't like him okay that's a wrap thanks for coming in I bet that was maybe two takes maybe they asked him to do it twice he probably nailed it on the first one and they'll be getting residuals for the rest of his life he stinks I don't like him wasn't a bad movie man i watch that we were watching a lot of movies dude okay here's here's something underrated massively underrated Adam Sandler movies sure Adam Sandler movies are ridiculously underrated yeah ridiculously underrated you watching me your daughter's dude they're hilarious yeah he Adam Sandler has like I don't know how many movies that are really really funny but surprisingly funny like like chuck and Larry the one where he marries Kevin James for for benefits I didn't see that one dude it is hilarious yeah some rough moments in it where you watching you go well you could never do this and try it's one of those moves like if somebody ever goes back on it and look so like hey what the fuck but ultimately in the end it was like a really positive movie but dude there are hilarious moments in that movie where I'm like wow this is really fucking funny yeah kingpin how kingpins fucking great no no's different movie no no but I'm not no I'm just saying kingpin there's another movie yeah that I wish I could go back and watch again but it's a little too rough for my kids yeah rated R right but that's another one like people can you can forget how fucking funny that movie yeah I forgot how funny those Adam Sandler movies are though yeah I really did alright there's a lot of a man waterboy is fucking hilarious yeah it starts off you're like oh is this gonna be good cuz you know it's 20 years ago or whatever the fuck it was well it's like I don't know do people watch Laurel and Hardy back then and go like oh this is fuckin did it all get dismissed as being too silly it's like no those guys now you know they accomplished something they provide style it's a style of movie it's a absurdist ridiculous style of the Zohan yeah it's a style of movie right and he's so good at it man really funny shit yeah but it's weird like people have this idea about what is acceptable funny and not acceptable funny and he always got pushed into this category of like you know if if critics would pan it like if you look at a lot of them like the Rotten Tomatoes like 14% 15% and then the audience is like 97 yeah right dude they're just missing what it is yeah you can't want the Ramones to be Pink Floyd mm-hmm you know Pink Floyd has their own style and the Ramones had a way more like rock n roll high school it was a simpler it's a different thing right it's a different thing Yeah right I'm sailing movies are their own thing yeah the fucking hilarious man was like five of them over the last week it kind of goes into the genre of like Loren Michaels has never given a shit about critics you know and they weren't they take sketches and characters from the show that are funny and starting with the first one must have been the Blues Brothers or Animal House and they just started spinning out fucking movies from what they knew were were the kernels of something that was very funny they started there and so a lot of them are you know even like it's pat like you go back and watch the movies they're fucking hilarious as long as you go in with the right mindset Tommy Boy I watched - oh yeah you know I never saw Tommy Boy before yeah I'm like why didn't I ever see this it's hilarious yeah I mean it's Wharton's in that right yeah Swartz it sports ins in all these movies yeah he's into everything he's in chuck and Larry he's like one of the best parts of Chuck him Larry yeah he's amazing Nick Swardson is fucking hilarious he's really really really funny yeah dude when he was like when he first came to New York I can't imagine he was more than 19 or 20 years old and he was like hanging around with you know all the comics and he was just like already as funny as everybody else he already had the confidence and just like the knowledge about he's a really fucking brilliant guy well he's just got a style of comedy - that's his yeah you know like his kind of punchlines it's it just mat it's him you know he knows how to do it and he understands how to put diary in a punchline every one of these Adam Sandler movies again so is Rob Schneider at Rob Schneider's and every one of them there's so many horror movies where they culturally-appropriate you're like oh my god yeah rob schneider places like really really stereotypical japanese guy he has japanese eyes on like they did they put makeup to change his eyes to you look more like a japanese guy he's got a crazy bowl haircut today it's hilarious yeah but it's like why can't you do that today like it's it's just a character it's supposed to be over the top and ridiculous yeah doesn't mean everyone in the race is horrible it's just huh this is an individual this guy chose to play yeah but you I don't think you could do it anymore now it takes too much eat now you know I just think about the other days like I watched what was the show with that black woman in it Madea no it's a TV it's a TV series with a black woman who's a British actress she sang at the Oscars this year anyway what are you she she's a kind of spare time do you have do you want to know always good there's an opera singer so it was what kind of singing you know like R&B but the point is she's a British she's a British African you say is there's african-american and there's British British Africa British that I don't know but she was portraying a an American woman and you think but is that cultural appropriation because she's not an American black woman interesting ooh that's a really interesting point so can a British woman who's of African descent playing in African American yeah yeah that's a different thing but I think there's a loophole there's a cross pollination loophole how to do that they both suffered yeah you're allowed to do that you what you can't do is blackface that you're just pretending you're a black person from another continent I mean you were sold off to slavery you know in some European continent as well Cynthia irvene oh yes you made Harriet Tubman see yeah Cynthia areevo and what was the TV she's amazing ed that was so fucking the outsider dude she's she's so good in the answer edible because she plays an autistic person and where are someone on the spectrum yeah but she doesn't overplay it no she nails very hard to play that not only that she never breaks it's like super consistent an entire time you you and you you've almost like I don't want to give away too much of that show cuz that shows really good it's called the outsider it's an HBO series a supernatural scary spooky series but she plays this savant character I don't give too much of it away because he really should see it it's it's pretty fucking incredible but the the way she does it it's like you buy eat like you're thinking oh the way she thinks she's probably thinking it this way like you start thinking through her right right she went yeah you see the character navigate like certain perils and bad situations you're kind of seeing it like oh what is her response gonna be to this cuz you know that you know she's playing this character you're buying in right she's got you fully sucked in yeah someone does that sometimes like you're you almost like you're thinking like they are on the screen that's why like when they kick someone's ass you get excited cuz you almost feel like you're kicking that yeah there's a phrase for that in writing I think it's called did the eyes in or something like that and it's yeah that does happen right you know there's movies where that like thriller movies where that happens where you don't know how someone's gonna escape if if they can escape if you know if someone's waiting for them some shits about to go down you're like in that person's head yeah in a lot of ways right Silence of the Lambs yes oh sure for sure that's a perfect example yeah when she when it's dark out when she can't see and she's got the pistol and she's trying to figure out where the fuck this guy is yeah holy shit yeah holy shit did that whoa the way they shot that the way they shot that were they you know you're convinced that she's she's going one place and then the FBI's going to another place and you're convinced the FBI has got the killer and they've got their guns drawn they storm the house and in a cut and a quick cut they go from them busting into the house killers not in there to right back to her and you suddenly realize oh no she's about to walk in on the killer that's one of the greatest fucking moments in movie history in movie history yeah dude HBO's got a lot of good shit there's a there's a series called my brilliant friend it's an Italian it's a series of Italian books this woman Elena Ferrante wrote they were really good there's like four or five of them and I read them all and and then they made this series it's one of the few times where it's been as good as the books are and it's it's in Italian it's subtitled but it's which all sounds really fucking boring but it's great Wow and the woman who wrote the books it's set in Naples and which I guess is like a shitty part of Italy it's like you know kind of the ghetto of Italy but they speak dialect they call a dialect instead of Italian so the writer wanted it to be authentic so she only let them hire actresses from Naples Italy just fucking there's no acting community there yeah I think it's a dialect of Italian yeah because my grandmother spoke it oh is that right yeah yeah I said she was she was poor and they they would speak it around the house too and they would explained to me that this is not sometimes it's not regular Italian like some parts of my family knew it and some parts of my family did not know knowing right but it wasn't straightforward Italian yeah there was some weird shit in there right so she wanted it spoken in dialect so so they hired they found actors from this fucking town and they are I'm telling you the two lead actresses are they're gonna win Emmys it's fucking they're brilliant you know yeah they're just folks from the town yeah were they acting in their town were they doing I'm not sure I'm sure they did some acting because they they have chops but like imagine they didn't yeah all actors just stepped up to the plate from a bakery yeah and knocked it out of the fucking park well that's how it was with a lot of like I think Scorsese would he knew Italians from Little Italy from where he grew up and he put some of these guys in his movies and they were just like pussy pussy big pussy what's his name that Joey Diaz now what's the guys the guys they who played big pussy goddammit he wants the comedy club in Vegas does he really am I thinking of the right guy you making up Italians you're so racist this guy yes yeah Salvatore it's our nothing wrong guys not big pussy for the guy Vincent Pastore who's together that was his character so Vincent Pastore is the actor but the guy the guy that ran is amazing by the way that guys fucking incredible before The Sopranos he was running the comedy club right way way way back in the day and then you know who got him on first drew Carey oh no shit yeah drew Carey hooked him up yeah so he'd never acted comes in and he's fucking brilliant kill right yeah kills it I mean literally has one of the biggest roles in the soprano yeah and nails it yeah and I'm telling you I knew steve Schirripa from back when he ran the Riviera in Vegas I love him to death he's got an amazing tomato sauce by the way I know she organic Tomatoes yeah what is the pull up the his Italian tomato sauce it's he's got mary mara mara now he's got our about to sauce that spicy spicy sauce like if you get lobster Fra Diavolo yeah that's it right there uncle Steve's and I look at that arrabiata I've never know how to say that I only read it I never said I never actually said beyond how do you say it arrabiata and but whatever it's guys it's tomato basil it's it's all organic - it's really good stuff your grandmother still alive no no my grandmother dude my grandmother had a stroke and they gave my grandfather they said she's got about 72 hours to live she laughs live 12 years 12 years after an aneurysm and he thought he she had three weeks there they did not think she was gonna make it she made it for 12 years so the last 12 years of my grandmother's life when I would go to visit her she was immobile in a bed she couldn't remember me no shit it was a horrible dude do you think when when your grandfather was told she had three weeks left do you think he threw a moo no I live with them when I first moved to to the to New Jersey from Boston oh that's right I first had when I remember when I left Boston for New York I had zero money and see I just stayed with my grandparents in Newark and my grandmother was in that state at the time where she was bedridden and they have help or was it just your grandfather tell you it would have helped dude of nurses would come over and help as well it was rough man Wow it was a sobering reminder the the temporary nature of life because I remember my grandmother when I was little she was always this powerful lady this powerful force yeah you know I was yelling at my grandfather and don't rush me don't rush me Joe oh yeah father's name was Joe - uh-huh don't rush me Joe I've talked about her before how crazy she was in an amazing way but my grandmother had a monkey she a monkey no shit yeah chee-chee-chee choose to open up gum peel open gum sticker and smile to it but she she bit some folks they had to get rid but Gigi lived in the garage and the Attic rather so when I would come over she would have to put they'd have to put chichi away just she didn't like kids ask you to get to play with the mats being a kid and knowing this a month must have been torture for you know I scared that little thing that little thing bits somebody I can't remember if it bit my sister or my cousin I can't remember cuz we were real little at the time yeah you know probably four or something like that yeah I don't cheechee bit some man and then they had to put chichi away poor chichi I don't know what they did with them she get in the Attic the kids are coming off she might've gave chichi away my grandmother was the real deal though she made like homemade pasta that she has ain't like the whole thing with dodo flower sauce there was not a goddamn thing that was was not made by haha yeah well you grew up in Italy well she was born in Italy but mostly grew up in Italian neighborhoods in New Jersey right and that's where they that's where the we live when I came to visit them so people don't realize like you go to an Italian restaurant in LA it's like there's some really good ones but it's just you can go to a fucking you got a route 7 in New Jersey and just find a little Angelina's fucking restaurant and it'll be the best Italian food you've ever had yeah you can get some ridiculous Italian American food that's what's interesting it's like it's a different style of cooking even than Italian Italian food mmm you know and when you go to Italy things are it's just the a lot of the things we associate with Italian food like the marinara sauce and the meatballs and that kind of stuff that was more made popular over here like that style of Italian food like lasagnas and shit like that that we consider like Italian food a lot of that was like made popular over here when you go over there things are more elegant you know have any like linguini with clams and it's a perfect presentation yeah you're going to these nice restaurants and even the pizza seems different over there you know but Italian Americans it was a different breed because it was the the psychos that wanted to get on boats the same with Irish Americans they're the people that were willing to get on a boat yeah and drift across the ocean man yeah you know we don't want to go on a fucking Cruise Line right now yeah right you don't want to go on a cruise yeah no there's a boat my grandfather was one of 13 kids 12 of them came over one at a time the family lived in a fucking three room hot and every time they somehow could get enough money together they'd take one of the kids when they were like 14 put him on a boat in steerage sent him to America they had like fucking third cousins in Montana they had nothing they were coming in to Ellis Island with nothing no like a dress no fucking iPhone giving you directions on how to get out to Brooklyn and they just kept showing up one by one and they all made it every one of them made it over here it's incredible it's insane when you think about how bad life must sucked now in in Italy and in Ireland at the time and in England as well that people are willing to just hop on a boat and take a risk yep no video no photograph you know that there's no photographs until like the late 1800s so a lot of these people they're just guessing we'll be able to came over here the 1700s the 1800s just guessing yeah just guessing what's over there well you got a drawing for me so I can risk my life and my baby can show me a drawing this is a mango forest yeah all the mangoes you want all right across the fucking ocean while we're drunk let's kill a few people along the way not only what disease isn't gonna be there when you get there bro there were all diseases yeah you know that was one of the things that dr. Peter Hotez was on the podcast yesterday was explaining quarantine and he was saying that essentially like when a boat would come into a harbor the word quarantine came from 40 days they had to leave these people on the boat for 40 days to make sure the rent and to make sure they weren't infected with the plague so that's how they handled it back then yeah yeah this is uh this is nothing new people but back then they didn't even know when the plagues were coming or what it was or how to avoid it or what are those symptoms yeah there's no vaccines there was no vaccines imagine no vaccines for fuckin smallpox mmm imagine that like it's just gonna storm through and disfigure everybody sorry yeah you know what they used to do is they would go around with a corpse of somebody that died from smallpox and they would in they would inject you with it with a little some cells from the corpse they would go door to door with a wagon with a corpse in the back of it and they would give you injections no yeah how many people did that give smallpox do I don't know but I guess if you give a small amount at what they realize that it worked as a vaccine a vaccine if you gave a very small amount yeah really yeah did it was that effective I imagine some people died from it if it wasn't done right and we have to figure that out yes that's fascinating see if we can find Jamie's the fastest one-handed Googler on planet earth we're not gonna say he's jerking off in the tub so this would be I typed in injections with corpses nothing quite came up right away like on wagons you said or something like that good yeah I remember watching HBO did this special about John Adams and in Boston and there was a scene from it where they were going through town with a wagon with a corpse in it shooting people when did when was the when does the first vaccine what mom was that I don't know if you had a guess like what was the polio vaccine what year was that that's not the first one but that's the most like who knows a guy who made a vaccine more than anyone knows Jonas Salk smallpox was the first one yeah really first vaccine and what year was it 1796 holy shit they had a vaccine in 1796 so that must be exactly what it was yeah what did they know in 1796 dude you imagine getting your leg broken back then fuck yeah the odds that you had a doctor that knew what they were doing there was no good medical schools in 1796 and like you read about guys getting their medical degrees in like a year you know it's always like John Hancock yeah he had a medical degree at a law degree by the time he was 21 years old my lawyer sucks bleeding try to stop the blood from all he can out get a rag to whenever I think about old-school doctors I think about the scene in the Wolfman with Benicio del Toro where they're running exams on them and one of those medical theaters yeah you know they used to have medical theaters where people would sit in the stands and look down and watch people perform operations oh yeah so students could just sit there people could just sit there and watch it was like a theater all right coughing how fucking weird is that yeah I mean the the Wolfman movies that's when Benicio del Toro becomes the Wolfman in front of all these people they've got them all strapped in but the the people that are in that audience they're just Gawker's yeah just sitting there watching some guys saw some dudes leg off ah they got a biting down on leather and shit hey what would you pay to do that though shit Matt audience Jesus Christ I don't want to see that you'd be so freaked out but I mean people go to see horror movies they want to get freaked out that's not real it's like part of what's fun about horror movies is it's not real violence yeah you know I had a conversation with about that with Hugo Martin he's a the creative director for Doom there's which is doom eternal is a new video game and in the video game the doom tour first of all looks insane it looks so good but the gore is so over the top like you're ripping people's heads off and blood spraying they're all like zombie people yeah feel like cutting them in half of the chainsaw like crazy shit blowing him up and he was like cuz it's so so over the top that's it's cartoonish yeah it's less disturbing than like if it was more realistic right right okay I'm just like arguing it a little bit but I've been thinking about it a lot like whether or not that makes any sense like it's one of those that's why I talk in my head yeah it's like Tarantino movies like you know in that scene where they they have that sword fight in that Chinese restaurant which one's Kill Bill and Kill Bill went and oh my Thurman is just fuckin slaying and this there's like four inches of blood on the floor when she's done cuz it's a comic book so it doesn't after a while you're kind of laughing dude his movies are so hyper violent yeah I forgot when we were talking recently about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood the scene in the end when you know people are just getting smashed yeah whoa you forgot yeah got like some of the scenes of that guys put in movies right but is that less disturbing somehow than something that's like more realistic violence I don't know like is that more disturbing here's a perfect example then Silence of the Lambs the sounds of lamb that scene with Jodie Foster in the end was so realistic yeah like you really felt trapped with like fuck like something real but did you feel like that when you're watching once upon a time in Hollywood no you're watching spectacle right like you enjoyed it it was great it was a great movie but it was like spectacle more than I have genuine anxiety because I'm worried what's gonna happen to her right yeah there's a movie called wait until dark that was made back in like the 60s and it was uh no violence nobody gets even slapped in the face and it's the scariest movie you've ever watched in your life it's about this blind woman and she's going through customs and somebody somebody like sticks heroin in her luggage so she brings it home and now they got to go and get the heroin from her and so they she's blind she lives alone and so they sneak into her apartment and it's all about her trying to defend herself and so she she turns off all her she smashes all their light bulbs so she's on even footing with them so they're trying to find her in the dark and it's like it's fucking amazing if you're the correct wait until dark yeah I found I couldn't find like verbage of it but I actually found the scene from the John Adams yeah where they showing I I guess this would be a interpretation of what inoculation was like oh it's not a corpse he's still alive so they scrape some pus off of him and then they injected into people Jesus Christ Jamie a little horror arm oh my god YouTube I'm not showing this just look up smallpox inoculation John Adams HBO it's goddamn crazy yeah you know that's interesting that I used to do it because was it a pole the polio vaccine was one of the vaccines were you got a big scar from it I actually have a scar oh the shoulder it's like looks like sort of a slice ya know yeah yeah I had it from the time I was a baby yeah that's what it looked like yeah like a little slice staff yeah that was from a vaccine that I got when I guess I was a baby I think it was a polio vaccine or was it smallpox that a smallpox well I typed in polio but whatever it was sooner also hopefully we're gonna have a mark from a fucking Barcelona virus vaccine they say a year to a year and a half yeah stop yeah whatever is stopping people from funding medical research I hope they open up the floodgates now Yeah right I hope they realize like hey you need more of these guys and they need a lot more money and they need to be way ahead of this shit well yeah because this is one pandemic there are a most multiple different scenarios of how this happens again sure well there was another guy that died recently on a bus that they identified as having a completely different corona virus in China but he got a virus that specifically hasn't jumped from human to human it's only jumped from rats to humans and the way it jumps from rats to humans is by ingesting animal feces or animal urine yeah you know animal fluids right so this guy somehow or another got some live bat fluid in his body in and was dying on this bus and they pulled a guy off and he test positive for a totally different corona virus it's killing him what do you think would happen I command some guy gets Corona and he's got it fucking bad systems are shutting down this is it he's gonna die and he wants to have sex again but he doesn't want to get anybody sick so he fucks his dogs oh my god and then like all the symptoms go away and he realizes like he's found the cure and now he has this moral obligation like does he call the CDC and say hey I'm kind of embarrassed to tell you guys this but I think I cracked it and what if it's only his dog but if everybody has to come to his house and fuck his dog we tried fucking a bunch of different dogs this there's no way to recreate this thing we fuck Marty Marty but I fuck Marty no we're all gonna have to fuck Marty there's a train of people everyday outside trying to try to breed Marty citroen puppies they try to do calculations on how many pumps it takes to cure you yeah you can't let people pump too many times more Marty needs a break does it help uh people loves you put peanut butter on my deck see what happens no no no everybody's like the pounds are empty everybody fucking dogs oh my god biology is so weird man I wouldn't that wouldn't even be that shocking that's the way a disease gets cured you have two fucking animal yeah how's that any weirder than some of this shit that's real how's it any weirder than some of these parasites that ever seen those videos of frogs that have the parasites in their eyeballs and they're swimming around their eyeballs no no show creepy man really yeah they're getting eaten from the inside out these parasites that are in their eyeballs this poor frog sitting there Britta ridet and these these worms are squirreling all around like visibly under its eyeballs yeah fuck dude my brother-in-law he's a cinematographer he shoots nature stuff so he goes like deep into the Amazon he shot he shot the first live I want to say Rhino or hippopotamus birth ever found that poor frog holy shit dude nature doesn't give a fuck nature's just going to war 24/7 finding new ways to fuck up animals testing their systems dam breaking through and establishing dominance inside this poor fucking creatures eyeball Wow bro please so my brother-in-law was in he was in the Amazon he was shooting I think it was a first live hippo or a rhino birth and he comes back and he's visit us out in California he's got this he's got this bump on his arm and it's got a red line running up his arm which means there's some kind of a bad infection right so they shoot him up full of antibiotics they say you'll be fine so he's driving up the up the PCH going up to Malibu with his family and he's poking at it and he's trying to pop it like a zit and all sudden the thing just fucking explodes and this being this creature fucking flies out of him and lands on the floor of the car and is like looking around it's like little creature and the kids are fucking dog and he's like he's like it fucking jumped out of me and like they're freaking out and they they brought it to the tropical disease spread they brought it to he went to the hospital say what the fuck is this they sent it to the tropical disease specialist and they found out it was a bat fly larvae yeah come on play that look at that that supers it there's a there's a crazy Netflix documentary on rats that is a rat that's infected with a botfly and it's like you know 20% of its neck yeah the thing is this enormous huge fuckin oh god they're extracting it whoa look at that yeah and it's got a little head how weird man that little fucker was living inside that guy's body yeah and so they come out so look at that man well that they think can't look around though it flies out doesn't it just come out of a river like that maybe it's cuz he was squeezing it did it flew away but it shot it shot out when does it become a botfly like it's a larva it so it looks like it buries itself into the ground and then becomes that without the kemaman how's it any different than a monster alright look at that it's just little it's a monster it's a whole insect world is those scariest horror movie that's ever existed the scariest monster movie ever is the whole insect world we are so lucky that like spiders black widows and tarantulas we're so lucky that they're little yes so lucky so the radiation starts dude we would have no chain yeah you imagine if praying mantises or the size of horses just running around snatching people or other Priuses yeah tipping over the fucking car and pulling the people out of the back seats we'd all be armed you'd have all kinds of firearms you would have to have a really high caliber rifle to penetrate the exterior shell of a man as if it was a scale and you probably would even hurt it that much oh they're extracting it look at this yo and look at how they have to do it kind of slowly they have to slowly ease it out oh my God look at the size of that thing that's in this person's calf that's the thing about like being in the jungle is forget about the fucking Tigers and the Panthers how about the botflies I'm not just live that dirty hippie that's that's getting this treatment they have those wrist wrist bracelets he's playing a second-line me no look at the bracelets you almost deserve a botfly if you wear those bracelets there's more than one by five Jesus Christ look at the size of this fucking thing look at the size this is the second one in this hole what the fuck man that's so insane that's so insane Wow that's gross we used to go out when I was a teenager we used to go to this golf course and we would we would look for golf balls in the woods and then we would sell them back to the Pro Shop for like 50 cents a ball and and then we realized like the ponds everybody was hitting their fucking balls into the lakes and the ponds and so we would go we go in bathing suits and you would step and it would go like up to your knees in silt just mud and he would feel around with your feet for the balls and you'd reach down and pull him up and you could get dozens of balls just walking around and then we get out and we'd have fucking leeches all over our calves and we would just take alcohol put it on and yank him off and you're teenagers you don't give a shit just fuckin no problem well if we get a leech no not been lucky I've never been bit by a dangerous snake I've had some spider bites but never by like a black widow or anything like that yeah I've seen a lot of snakes though Matt while snakes are freaky Brendan Schaub just found one on the hike he sent me a picture in a video of this fucking thing oh yeah huge rattlesnake on a hike Wow like what what is that man yeah look at that thing that's just hanging around that can kill you yeah how about the big ones now in the Florida Everglades those pythons pythons well this is how dumb we are in California those things are valuable okay they're an invasive species that's destroying you want to talk about the destruction of an ecosystem the way pythons have decimated life in the Everglades it's kind of like a little bit of an open secret like all the biologists are aware of it they've done these studies on deer and all these different mammals and all these different things and the populations are ridiculously reduced like almost down to nothing you don't find raccoons anymore you don't find a lot of the animals that used to find in the Everglades anymore and they also eat alligators so what do we do in California you can't buy Python because Python is an exotic species we don't encourage people to use that as a skin that is a deer and raccoon and squirrel eating demon from another continent yeah and it lives in Florida and if you made it valuable you fucking knuckleheads people would go in there and kill those fucking things and bring the natural ecosystem back in the back why aren't they killing them because they're assholes first of all because you can't even sell them in California too because it's hard it should be valuable they should be valuable it should be something that we look if you leave them there you're saying fuck all these other animals let's let this demon snake that's suppose to exist on another continent and there's no natural enemies here let's let that thing just wander through the fucking swamps and kill everything in its path let's just do that but like or sell it but I'm not a hunter but I would think if you're a hunter wouldn't it feel noble to actually go and help the Everglades it's dangerous though that's dangerous like that's not just regular hunting you're hunting monsters you know you're an alligator country yeah one of my favorite alligator stories is a guy was running from the cops he's had a stolen car parked cars see the stolen car or high-speed chase whatever it was parks the car in a bridge jumps in the water immediately gets eaten by an alligator the water right on a fucking alligator alligator jump in and swim to save this fucking 16 footer just dude there's a Twitter account called Florida man and it's a base isn't it fucking great that's the Florida man story right there it is a Florida man story do they you know they're they're real when I was a kid hunters put the squeeze on 80 snakes and floor with his Python bowl all they got a Python bowl like done in January says two hundred seven hundred and fifty people from 20 states turned up Wow they only got 80 of them in 10 days but 10 days the only caught 80 of them so one in 10 guys yeah but look at the size of these things that they're killing matters look at the fucking size of them they're all they're enormous and those things are in I don't even know if they're killing them it looks like they still have a live but these things are they're eating everything they can find and they have no natural enemies and they're just spreading through that ecosystem the idea that that should be illegal to make a purse out of but you can can you make a purse out of a cow like why is that right how come what's going on there like why do you think that that is more valuable than a cow like and it's beautiful it is beautiful but what this is a this is an invasive species like you're supposed to be killing them yeah here you are you have to put like a human put that thing there it's not supposed to be there and humans have to extract it because it's destroying everything that has crazy consequences that they never know 10 20 years down the line what's gonna be like after these pythons just completely ruined the entire part of the country what are they gonna do this those things are those are people eaters yeah you can eat people oh yeah definitely kids think it's so big man when you see that picture of the one that had the alligator that it was eaten that it yet through its body yeah imagine what kind of a thing eats an alligator and eats it all in one piece right now imagine that someone says you shouldn't kill those to make purses out of them no yeah you can actually you should they're monsters you should kill them yeah those are monsters well you shouldn't kill all of them but they don't belong here like killing rattlesnakes is a terrible idea because rattlesnakes have a really important place in the ecosystem she'd only kill a rattlesnake if it's on your property it's threatening you and if you know you feel like you need to defend yourself but going out into the woods where the Rauh snakes live look at this thing Oh oh my God look at it eating this is we're watching a Python eating an alligator it's fucking bananas it just dislocates its jaw and this thing's still alive so there's poor little alligators trying to figure out what the fuck is happening and this and its breathing and this Python is slowly swallowing it whole now imagine what it would do to your little Timmy yeah imagine if that think trapped your son if your son son was out there fishing and almost his friends ran away because they were terrified cuz a 20 foot long snake is eating their friend well we better not make a bag out of it we better not because pythons are beautiful and we're not speciesists look at it seat in the back feet it's all the way down to the back feet stuffing it into its mouth that's the top three worst way to die bro you're still alive for a long-ass time you get digested yeah you just get smothered and digested fuck all that oh yes the teeth man look at those bottom teeth fuck you look at those things imagine that biting you and pulling you leg fur into its fucking mouth goddamnit we better not turn them into wallets because that's just wrong you should 100% turn them into wallets 100% not only that you're gonna have to kill them and mego if you don't turn them into wallets what are you do with the skin because yeah you gotta kill them and at least the wallets are worth something at least the clothing is worth something yeah at least let people make things out of their skin don't let their whole body go to waste just for your ideology that's a thing but it's a thing that's not supposed to be there and that's why it's destroying everything I wonder if there meets any good how giant pythons wall swallowed an Indonesian woman yeah they are small though fuck swallowed her a picture but bro swallowed her what happened to the woman she was 54 years old she went missing last Thursday while checking on her vegetable garden on muna Island in Sulawesi is a Hainan Province a huge search was mounted by local police her sandals and machete were found a day later a giant Python with a bloated belly was lying about 30 meters away who residents were suspicious that the snake swallowed the victim so they killed it they carried out of the garden gruesome footage has been circulating on social media and Indonesia showing the woman's body being recovered intact in front of a large crowd fuck that and people like will this shouldn't be made in diss shoes yeah you should make them in the shoes that's what you're supposed to do when they eat people you fucking idiots is it just California that made it illegal I don't know there's certain companies that are reacting to this push against what they call exotics like crocodile and alligator and Python things like that and so certain companies are no longer making things with exotics to sort of bend to political pressure or pressure by you know air quotes activists yeah but really it's monster skin okay you got monster skin let's make monsters King clothes cut the shit all right I'm not saying she kill them all you definitely shouldn't kill them all but the idea you shouldn't kill most of the fucking snakes that are invasive species in Florida and sell them and make purses out of them why did how bad would it Python Jacobi yeah a nice big collar yeah I bet you can get one probably up to go to some Bolly or some shit you go somewhere sneaky yeah you'd be the king walk on stage Python everything everything Python from the 70s Gators that's what uh like dudes that wanted like really fancy shoes they wanted Gators they wanted alligator skin shoes if you wanted a real nice pair of shoes lets people know you're steppin out on the tag look at these Gators son yeah that was a big thing fuckin guineas we always talk about their Gators because they're dangerous they meanwhile I'm walk around with a cow yeah the fucking easiest animal to kill so easy to stand there made him to kill turned him into something do you know they go feral too when they go fairly become a completely different thing oh yeah yeah they they go Pharoah all throughout Australia and there's other places they go feral too but they they calm scrub bulls and think about how aggressive bulls are right like that's why it's fun to ride them people like to grab ahold of them cuz he's fuckin going crazy trying to smash you the Bulls are very very aggressive well they ain't shit compared to these wild poles the wild bulls are those Bulls on meth because they're out in the wild yeah never been controlled and never been in a cage and if they see people they'll run at you 30 miles an hour and Gore you and Terry knows yeah oh yeah there's some of the most dangerous animals in the bush in Australia is these things called scrub bulls my friend Adam Greentree who killed that up that's an Asian water buffalo he killed that in Australia those are also invasive all throughout Australia these fucking they brought in these Asian water buffalo and they just destroy an entire swathes of land and they go up to the north country and they have to they have to shoot them they have to kill them there's no natural predators there once they get past the crocodiles like nothing can fuck with them but they have these but they're nothing compared to the Bulls they're like domestic cows that are wild feral bull he said they're the most aggressive motherfuckers in in the bush like way more aggressive than these Asiatic water buffalo mm-hmm and you know you think of them you think oh it's like it's gonna look like a bull mile but even look weird they have like different antler or different horns the horns come out like bigger and wider they have interesting colorations and not all black they're like a bunch of different cool weird colors Wow yeah they look like almost like dogs and a lot of what you like patches like a patch of brown a patch of white weird-looking that should be the next show is like like Anthony Bourdain but you go to places with invasive animals kill them cook them eat them wear them that's your next show man no I'm not gonna do that but it's good yeah it's a good idea but I don't have the time for that plus I'm not shooting anything dangerous I'm not going in these dangerous places and hunting dangerous things yeah fuck all that right these scrub bull see if you can get an image there they're freaky looking man they look like bulls kinda but Bulls that like our wild like sort of Tarzan look like a human yeah right but he didn't right he's all jacked and you had a loincloth on bare chested and fucked up here he lookin a wild human yeah this one looks fake almost but I can't no no I want to see dead ones yeah the dead ones you get a better look at them scrub Bowl yeah I like that right there right yeah like that look look at that dang what is that that's a bull that's and then the one below it Jaime is even weirder like look at that with the white with the black the white patches on the black skin they're weird and look at the the shape of the antler so the horns rather see how wide spritzy that's a whoa that's uh I think that might even be Adam but like that's a scrub bowl like that picture that that got with that guy's holding up so that's what they look like so that thing will just charge you charge you that's a perfect image of one look at that thing that kind of looks like a bowl kind of not right yeah and they're super muscular and really really fucking aggressive and they used to at one point in time be domestic you know who knows how many years ago and they eventually got out and formed their own little pack got together I guess heard I guess he would call them herd together did a lot of fucking and made a bunch of other wild cows and look at that one in the lower left-hand corner Jamie the dead one on the ground look at that thing yeah how weird is that like that kinda looks like a cow but not really right a chi looks like a bull let's go like a moose shaped face yeah exactly but kind of looks like a domestic bull but not really you would say what is that some African animal or something like that animals are weird when they get free then you see their true nature there's a lot of animals that we keep in pens and we keep them captive and we don't really understand what the fuck they are we only understand what the domestic version of that animal is when those animals are forced to find their own food they become a different thing yeah a chickens are a good example that I didn't I had no idea how savage chickens were until I got my own I was like look at these fucking monsters when you when you would see chickens with a mouse its it was stunning I could seen it a couple of times one time I caught a mouse and I threw it in there they fuck this mouse up and one one of them got it and ran with it and they all chased her around so she's got it in her mouth and she's running and they're all chasing her trying to pull it out of her mouth I didn't even know they were carnivores dude they're ferocious no she chickens are so ferocious well I have never seen anything I mean I guess a dog would gobble something up pretty quick but I've never seen anything attack as lustfully at meat as a chicken like cats aren't that lustful if you give a cat something they kind of didn't like yeah and they eat it right you know a dog they want to eat it quick chickens are like twice as fast as dogs here's a perfect example this is a mouse and this mouse is being chased by this cat and the the chicken is watching this cat fuck around with this mouse and the chicken decides to step in and fuck this mouse up look at this so the cats like oh I'm just gonna play with my food and chickens like bitch let me show you what the fuck is up look it just starts tearing it apart and the chicken is not interested in anything other than eating that mouse yeah the chickens not there for a game chicken is there to kill and eat it's a dinosaur man it's a different kind of life-form than a cat you know cats cats are like chill with each other they purr they're more complicated you know yeah they'd like you to come up to the rub against you look even like the tiger King guy like you pet some of them cats yeah fucking fight you ain't never petting a chicken bitch that chicken doesn't give a fuck about you round one chickens in a rat it's a squirrel that's a ground squirrel is that too big rat is that a rat it is right so they fucking hate that where they're on a vegetarian diet that might be a ground squirrel man it says ninja rat oh that's a rat Wow so these chickens are trying to decide whether the juice is worth the squeeze see they're moving in close but they're looking for other stuff and white hmm I think I could fuck that dude up look he's like trying to play coy like he doesn't really eat that rat all right move a little closer it's getting a little grass a little closer man I think I can eat that thing hmm look don't find nothing in this fucking grass what that dude is right there I'm just gonna ease up just you know hey just come over here looking for worms just like you just two hunters out there so let's see some of that in slow motion oh the rat launched itself oh look at that first strike the rat said okay I'm gonna start this party the rat just jumped at the chicken well if a rat jumped at me I'd feel the same way and I'm way bigger than a chicken right if a rat jump to you let's get out of here you know do you think toxo would let the rat fuck with chickens - the same way it does with cats cuz it's a cat maybe arrived right gonna bring their piss I mean look at him launching himself in the air though unless he's defending himself and family maybe yeah wait for me well I think they feel that way about any bird well that is pretty badass yeah that used to get up there fast if you're a bird you know and in a rat sees you like you're a mortal enemy yeah for sure like the big ones for sure I see a lot of hawks man you see a lot of Hawks in the valley you know and I never have the patience to sit and watch one and hope he gets something but uh my director director on Newsradio Tom sharona's was sitting in his backyard and like I think he was in Studio City and I was back porch he watched it Dov gets snatched by a hawk oh yeah yeah so the Dove was just sitting there on this fence and this hawk came along Wow yeah right in front of him yeah we had a we had a hawk smashed into our sliding glass door going I don't know what he went after but he came in fast and slammed into it took off yeah we killed a couple of them accidentally that way a couple of them right we have changed our back fence from it was like metal bars to glass and it wiped out like three hawks oh no shit at least when they fucking nose dive right into it no it was a bummer yeah yeah birds will fly into your window all the times that happen to your house yeah and you hear that thunk like oh shit and go out and see some bird I saw this little kind of Sparrow looking bird and he was staying he was standing like against the side window of a car and he kept launching himself at this sideview mirror again and again he just kept attacking his own image Wow not picking up on it there was a little bit of a hawk war that went on in my backyard oh really yeah yeah well I think what happened is when we put up the fence the glass fence one Hawk slammed into it that Hawk might have been running shit that might have been like one of the top Hawks of the community because then there was a bunch of young Hawks that were hanging around they were getting really cocky and they were like flying on top of the chicken coop you'd have to chase him off like what the fuck are you guys doing yeah like acting different they were like bold it was swooping low they're acting like young punks right and then I started finding them dead headless really yeah yeah yeah where one other animal perhaps an owl was jacking these little country young Hawks and and biting their head off damn leaving their body yeah we found at least two of them I remember I remember correctly I think was like we we got at least two Hawks rehabbed one of them we brought to a wildlife shelter and they actually were able to release it back at the wild again after it mended up but it was another one that got Kayode flying into the fence and one of them that we kept for a weekend and fed it this was a big thing in the house because they were feeding them mice okay so we had this Hawk and we'd go to the pet store there's a pet store that sells exotic pets and they have these things called pinkies they're basically baby mice and this is what they said you have to feed the hawk before we can get it to this wildlife thing that wasn't open till Monday so they're feeding them these little tiny baby mice because they want this poor Hawk to be better so this demon is eating babies in my house okay [Music] okay and then they get to the end it gets to the end it's Sunday the the demon stopped eating babies it left one baby alive so we took this one baby mouse and then the girls are like well we want to keep it as a pet I go what I go you just this thing's slaughtered ten of them yeah this thing just ate I don't know how many of it but it just ate its brothers and sisters you like this one I'll spare ya I'll spare you I'll spare you and I'll bring in it see is that an owl eating a Hawks head yeah see I guess that's Al's move when owls kill a hawk look at this they just eat their fucking head dude taking this Scout yeah and they leave their headless body Wow that's how bad ass owls are look at that just standing over the dude imagine if you did that to a guy and you were holding him down with your feet and with your hands you just pulled his head off with your teeth and just chewed through the side of his neck you're holding on to his head and that's sitting on some guy's roof that's just uh in your neighborhood look there's a fence cuz it's kind of even oh yeah no big deal that's awesome just one demon killing another demon and that's the one we associate with wisdom ah give a hoot don't pollute he's the one who's telling you how many licks it takes to go meanwhile oh yeah he's out there eating the hawk heads yeah look at that man we had a crow he got these fucking huge crows and in the driveway there was I came home and there was a possum a baby possum on the driveway he was near dead and there was this giant fucking black crow and he was pecking at the at the possum so like I don't know what human instinct made me jump in there and break it up and so like I'm chasing the the the crow away and then I tell my son and go get a shoebox inside so I can scoop up the the possum and the crow is not having it he's like that's my fucking possum dude and so he keeps coming at me and I'm like staving off a crow who's like coming at me and then swooping away dive-bombing you he's dive-bomb to have a weapon now my fists and my few swing at him now I don't know if you would hurt a bird it was coming at you I feel like there's a weight behind them you would just knock them into the air yeah I don't think I think they're so light I think it'd be hard to hurt them you know I mean yeah like if a bird was swooping at you and you hit it I don't know if it would hurt it that much yeah I think we just bounced off right cuz they're waiting right I mean I'm just guessing I think if you kicked a turkey in the head you could fuck it up you know only if it's Thanksgiving now if you only around the holidays gave like a Muay Thai fighter kick and you kicked a Turkey's neck yeah you fucked that turkey up you know yeah Birds have an advantage man they're like a fat they're like a lightweight sir just fucking they're done yes yeah the dinosaurs man we were reading about this eagle that used to live in New Zealand before the people wiped it out it was called a haast eagle and they think that people might have walked it wiped it out because it was probably eating them uh-huh this thing weighed 25 pounds Wow I think the biggest it got was like H a a st eagle and they they believe it was brought to extinction one of the theories is by human beings because they think that it was probably a dangerous animal fucking huge eagle yeah huge Wow your cousin gets eaten by an eagle how big do those things get I think they had something like a 7-foot wingspan yeah this is up to three meter wingspan three meters is that the biggest said bit that bait is that the biggest animal that has flight that's a good question imagine the pterodactyl days what in the fuck was that like yeah giant flying lizard chats fellow carnivores yep fuck that you imagine there it is whoa the largest ever what that sounds like quetzel quota which is the that's that that Aztec god qu etz alc o8 t lu s Quetzalcoatlus Quetzalcoatl was that that flying God of the Aztecs he just go back up to that I was reading that top part there yeah a pterodactyl Petrus or from the Late Cretaceous of North America largest known flying animal to have ever lived so that is like probably they probably named it after crustal quatl which was the see if you find that word Quetzalcoatl because I think that's what that was it was an Aztec god that was like a bird wingspan of 36 feet Jesus Jesus Christ what the fuck thats a plane now see this is a god the feathered serpent a name for the feathered serpent deity of the hms Dameon Mesoamerican culture I wonder if there was ever a time were human beings and that Petrus or thing coincided when was that Petrus or when did that thing go extinct that Quetzalcoatl us you imagine if there was a Newman you know Neanderthals or whatever Australia Pittacus and you're looking up you see a 35-foot bird fuck you man fuck you fuck you were discovered in Texas that's the same course right area of course Texans before the Comanches they had giant flying dinosaurs just whatever would Late Cretaceous I don't know what's that when does that at 10 million years what does that think it says 100 266 oh so that's way before even the Yucatan impact that killed the dinosaurs that was 65 million years if the climate was warmer than now even then what's the biggest thing that lived that flew while people were alive I think was that haast eagle you said that was three meters right that's nine feet by the way fuck that to imagine a nine foot I don't take your kid easily I don't take endur'd small kid may be a pretty big kid yeah they carry deer away oh shit how do they pull goats off the side of cliffs and not even big ones dad have you ever see that Golden Eagles do that Golden Eagles are the biggest North American Eagles and I've actually think bald eagles have done this as well and they swooped down and they grabbed these sheep that are trying to climb their way up to the top of these mountains they pull them off and they they drop them on the rocks yeah and watch them smash Wow and sometimes they ride them down to the ground wow dude there's one video this one eagle he grabs ahold of this sheep and pulls him off of the sheep or goat I forget which one was pulls it off the side of this wall and as it's going down the Eagles hanging on so the eagle hits the ground with and bounces it and oh my god it's fucking madness it's madness that's beautiful they meet Eagles fine yeah eagle fell bounced had this goat hit it in the head bounced fine the end flies away yeah crazy flexible bones that they have shit yeah dude we're so lucky we have one thing to worry about right now other than normal shit that everybody has to worry about all the time in life one new thing and everything just hits to a halt when one new thing like and the whole world changes what new thing right albatross has a bigger wingspan than the haast eagle really it's about the same maybe it says it's 11 feet Jesus I hope the trust the ones that are alive right now Wow that's what are they mostly fish right and this even says a condor with a 24 foot wingspan that's 28 million years ago Oh Nica albatross they go out to sea for fucking weeks what do they do just dive in and eat fish I haven't eat yeah look at that whoa yeah that would be just more annoying than anything I don't think they're gonna kill you but an Eagles got a face like a bolt-cutter there's a couple as I was digging through a couple articles even speculated if those giant quetzel Kotal things some others like Petra fare too big to even fly maybe mmm they could have been like giant ostrich type bird right yeah they only have the bones right egg wings yeah just something that just got too big for its wings didn't need to fill maybe get fly like a chicken like chickens can fly like you know they fly like 10 feet or something like that they just kind of run fly at the same time they get a little get a little air no I think about like my friend had a a parrot when I was a kid parrot or a power kid I don't know Birds but it scared the shit out of me like I would reach into the cage just to like you know you try to stick your finger in its belly so it steps on your finger but it bites you instead and I remember being a full-sized human being scared of this take that and expand by a thousand yeah and it's flying above you yeah birds can scare the shit out of you yeah they can pull a fucking salmon out of a flowing river with their feet and fly away with it yeah imagine even grabbing a salmon imagine just dunking your hand into a river and pulling a salmon out no I'm now imagine doing them while you're flying in you snatch it pull it out of the river and then fly away with it alright and that's our American that's our national bird national animal it's pretty cool national animal I guess it's a ruthless cunt of a flying dinosaur yeah would it be better if we had something compassionate to be that close oh they're real close shoe bills are super dangerous oh yeah well that is an ancient predatory carnivorous dinosaur that's that happens to still be alive why is that guy getting close to it with his kid oh don't do that please don't do that yeah I could imagine if that thing was pissed off at you well we can touch it bro that's the kind of people to get eaten I think we're fine oh I think we're fine I'm gonna bend over and pull up my pants there are some animals that are dangers a really aggressive bird casts away I think it's called and this lady's filming on the beach in Australia she's like oh look look at the cool bird and the bird starts going after her they'll come fuck with you what is it a ballon Epps's rex Shoebill stork facts that's what it's called Bala Nexus Rex it's a Rex it's a fucking dinosaur look at that face Wow look at the mountain that one right there look at that one look at that image what in the fuck is that that's that's flightless right yeah but it gets to five feet tall and it snatches fish and lizards and all kinds other things swallow them whole there's a fantastic documentary that bebe BBC put out years ago about the Congo and the shoe bill lives in the Congo and in the in the Congo the shoe bill eats this there's a fish that comes out of the land and then crawls across the land till it can find another pond and then slides into that pond yeah and the shoe bill is eating that thing and you're like what am I seeing I'm seeing a battle between two prehistoric animals well that's a maze of fish that can swim and then climb out of the water and walk on the ground and then jump in a new a new pond right that's the that's the missing link for evolution the first animal that first fish to get out of the water yeah yeah it is I mean all these animals adapt when they're in the Congo that's that what are you looking at there Jamie that's weird oh that's what it was on the bottom they're all I mean they're all adapting to their environment they found in the Congo there's uh I think it's called a duiker it's a specific type of antelope but because they'd been in this used to what they think is at least parts of the Congo that if I don't hope I'm not fucking this up but I believe what it was was it used to be grasslands and then the climate changed it became rain for us and a lot of animals there were like Plains animals were stuck in the Congo in the rainforest and they had to adapt so like you'll see these herds of ungulates running through the Congo like these different kinds of antelopes running through the swampy waters yeah like what are those things doing here and then there's other antelopes like these dijkers that actually can swim so they can swim in their water as much as a hundred meters no shit a hundred metres underwater yeah yeah yeah they can hold their breath in the eat fish that's wild what yeah they're adapting yeah so they're figuring out how to get see if you can find that thing I think it's I don't remember how to spell it it's pink it's gonna be us in five years these little fuck look at that what does that bird doing no no no no that's not it it dijkers an antelope dude it's not a bird it's not it's not in the ocean it's it's that's a tuna it's in the Congo Jimmy you're high really stuck on that shoe bill fucking around you like is it this my bro that's a sandwich that's the 96 Olympics in Antelope I think it's called to die I'm not I'm not spell I don't know how to spell it I don't think it's dik er but there's a it's a small antelope like creature that it lives in Africa try under lesbian G yeah they they have these little short legs and they swim by the way today's a big day Joe 20th appearance on the Joe Rogan experience you were telling me that that's crazy that's crazy yeah that's nuts today's April Fool's be very careful a lot of motherfuckers out there playing that stupid game I was gonna tell you a crazy fuckin story I was driving up here thinking I gotta come up with some funny the gemsbok oh that's another animal that can swim in the ocean yeah they swim yeah that's called the gemsbok is that what that one's called I think spelling did you know you got DUI keer okay it's gonna take a long time to find video of its women but this this documentary was just showing how sometimes things just change and these animals get fucked yeah and they're just not supposed to be there right I think part of the part of it was they were locating things like elephants in the in parts of the Congo - that were also in the rainforest and like what the fuck of these things doing here alright it's really interesting man you know we're we're just real fortunate that we are in a place that is fairly calm with very few monsters yeah but this is you know there's spots in the world where unfortunately your civilization really never had a chance to get a foothold because it was always dealing with defense there was not enough time to relax to really build up a good stout civilization because everything is just about acquiring food and making sure you don't get a rocket right well that's why it's kind of cool that we have mountain lions but not a lot there's like we can literally count the number of mountain lions we have in Los Angeles but they're fucking there they're there dude they're real too yeah it keeps you it kind of keeps you honest a little bit I think we got a I think it's good no matter what city are in there should be a fucking bear just one bear just a little something to let you know there's a food chain respect it yeah you know we just we think we just get food from the store no that's that's what's confusing about all this food does not come from the store food is food comes from living things either vegetables and fruits or animals that's food the store is this weird thing that we invented yeah you got to figure out how to get food you can't rely on the store right and one thing that's happened is there's a giant uptick of people looking into hunting licenses and people like watching videos on hunting and happening aronia yes and a homesteading a lot of people that are looking to buy plots of land and like raise rabbits for food raise chickens and raise pigs and there's a lot of videos that are popping up on youtube now about homesteading where people like hey how do we a fucking avoid this you buy a patch of land you get a few families to chip in you all build houses on that land or you buy houses that are close enough to each other that you could share land and you fucking grow food yeah you grow food and make sure that you don't need anybody right if you get all your food from your yard that can be done this sound this sounds so like out there but it's like that's literally how ninety five percent of the world lives yeah and not not only that but how 99.9 percent of the world lived until the last couple of hundred years yeah you know this is how you're supposed to you supposed to have food in your body yeah most of something here my grandfather always had a garden always had a course yes yeah he would go back there and he would check his Tomatoes he knew where everything was no my peppers are coming in he would always have this little thing of this spot over here for this kind of plant and this kind of food he would grow spices and all kinds of shit yeah like those old-school immigrant people that came over here back when food was hard to get they knew how to like make sure you have something right make sure you have a you know you can stay alive with your garden you know well especially the chickens that you can't get eggs we haven't shoppin last night there's no eggs it's hard yeah these kunti coyotes killed all my fucking chickens or I'd get some eggs for you that sucks I got a but the thing is about rebuilding we we've talked about this when you build the shelter the chicken shelter and and put new chickens in there now you're a target like they know where meat is and they know a bonza bonanza of meat they'd nine chickens in one day in one in one sitting they killed nine chickens was just a fucking like just disgusting pile of feathers yeah where all the chickens were slaughtered yeah and the whole white pulled the mesh was pulled out and they just jumped in there and just one at a time killed all the chicken Wow I don't want that shit around my house you know that's the thing it's like if you if you're gonna have coyotes targeting your house like looking looking at your house as a source of food if you're doing that by keeping chickens you're gonna have more coyote interactions yeah and either you're cool with that or you kind of creeped out by yeah I'm kind of creeped out by it especially when I'm high I tied a dead chicken to a one of the Coyotes killed the chicken before I chased it out I tied a chicken to a pot like a pot that you plant plants in you know pottery uh-huh and I tied it down and I tied it in and I said it 30 yards from my balcony and I got a rangefinder and I arranged all these different spots on the yard and I set up there for hours with a bow trying to kill a coyote really yeah he's right there go get your chicken you were pissed I was I was having war with them yeah seven war I was gonna kill him and I was gonna throw him over the fence let these cunts know hey I killed your friend I'll kill you too you should have chewed its head off or thinking about owning some of it and then shitting into a bag and throwing the bag over the hill I ate a piece your friend you fucks yeah yeah I'm not a fan I like having them around it's cool to hear him at night but I don't want them thinking of my my animals and my dog or my cat or anything like that as a food source because it sounds like you cared about these chickens if they did they become like pets they're like pets but not like Marshalls like he met Marshall he's out there right now yeah he's like family he that little sweetie he's my he's one of my kids yeah like he's my buddy he's like a full-grown three-year-old cuddle bunny you know he's the sweetest dog in the world like that's very different than the chicken my relationship with the chicken is not that deep like that dog is I love that dog he's my buddy like every time I see him I'm like dude yeah and he's like he comes over with a toy in his mouth and he's just he's just a bundle of love he loves everybody to everybody he meets he just loves ever yeah that's chickens I'm not like that man they're not that valuable chickens are independent little cunts I was walking my dogs this morning and some fuckin asshole goes can I pet your dog I'm like let me check let me check the news no no you can't rub your fucking germy hands on my dog it's gonna come home to your house right yeah no you're not supposed to do that right now right now not supposed to let something dude just touch you some guy wanted to shake my head at the grocery store the week of the whole thing yeah when I shook his hand I didn't want to be rude right but I felt weird about it I was like oh we still check-in hands like when when do we stop doing this this is that was the the week that everybody went crazy and started buying shit it is crazy too because there's no shortage of food no no change doesn't change yeah yeah yeah especially the toilet paper thing became totally random he's like one asshole filled up his shopping cart with toilet paper and then somebody saw him do that and somebody else saw him do that and they all just decided it was a panic on toilet paper it doesn't make any sense it's almost like it was perpetrated by a toilet paper industry ah do you know how much money you would save if you had a bad day or like there's a little tushy ones that we had that was a sponsor I think that was like what did red band say across like $79 yeah that's that uh that's for the goldwater the one that yeah and the few few extra bucks you get it heated up but just take it like a seal like a Navy SEAL yeah if I'm gonna do that I'm I cuz I looked online you can't get the cheap ones anywhere the cold water ones are sold out but they did have like some high-end ones and I was thinking like you shit every day yeah every you know I'm gonna get it in my house I'll have it for the rest of my life why not go big and just get one that's like some of them have remote controls where you can live here you can change the direction of it have you ever taken a shit here you told me to use it once but I didn't do it don't be scared it's wonderful really it's wonderful yeah yours has probably got a fucking tanning bed in it it does you can direct make it a stronger wave a lighter wave yeah direct it into the hole itself you could aim right in the hole you know it makes you have to shit more like when it goes up the hole your body's like oh yeah I got some extra for you so you get loosens everything throu a little hemorrhoidal lotion on there for me if I need it doesn't you'll do that yourself but the point is you're saving a lot of money in toilet paper like bleach my asshole cleans it I don't think I bleach it it'd be a nice little option though I don't extra button know that you need to worry about that in these trying times look if you get Botox now you're an asshole yeah you know this doctor could be in an emergency room helping kovat 19 patients you're like I'm seeing there's some movement there's some movement right here like watch watch okay I can look I'm shocked yeah me well he's got three people hacking up in the waiting room oh come on well this article in the Atlantic was really disturbing where they were saying that if the people that are going in to find out if they have kovat they can't even give them this was in New York they couldn't even give them a test because they didn't meet a certain criteria and if they didn't have it before they definitely have it now there's other people in this waiting room yeah and they're all waiting and they're all sick and coughing like fucking christ so what's the point at which you're supposed to go in because just get it yeah I mean what do you mean know what I mean what's the point where you should go to the doctor versus sit it out and try to because they say 90% of the people to come in have pneumonia or or the flu they don't have kovat well that's the thing is that the flu still here right so it's happening at the same time as the flu but it's a new thing obviously we know what to do with the flu you could put give people Tamiflu you know you can get a flu shot you much like we had dr. Hotez explain how even if you get a flu shot from the wrong kind of flu to make a vaccine it's still has enough of the the things in it that fight off parts of the flu cos of flu is a virus has a bunch of different components and so it can mitigate some of the components even if it's not the perfect vaccine for that virus so it still protects you somewhat protects you better than not having anything so that's the flu like there's a bunch of shit with this thing they're like we don't we don't know yeah you know we don't we really don't know we don't know what's going on I mean people talk about all these different treatments that may or may not be effective but this is too new for the most part you really just need a ventilator I mean that's the only thing you would need medical care for right cuz I can't do much for you otherwise well there's been some talk about Z packs you know but there's no there's no definitive evidence and those when they run studies like that it takes a long-ass time to get you know if they're doing double-blind placebo-controlled studies trying to find out what what does what and what's effective for what and any kind of clinical trial I think takes months right oh no a year it's a year is it yeah cuz they think they've already identified some vaccines but they said for it to be you know if you don't test it you could put it out and kill as many people with the vaccine yeah yeah yeah and at the same time Tiger king becomes the number one show in the world the same time a documentary on wild tigers they're in captivity at this crazy dudes place who's married to two other crazy dudes who's in a battle with this lady who might have fed her ex-husband to Tigers right don't tell me I haven't seen a spoiler yeah what do you think Jamie about the whole about did that lady feed her husband to the tiger if I if you had a million dollars today reopen the case dick yesterday yeah they're looking back into it they're looking into maybe I don't know bro if you have a husband that's a millionaire and you raise Tigers and then that guy disappears and no one knows where he is if that happens I think people should be suspicious they'd be like okay where is he you don't know where he is at all huh he just went away huh how many Tigers you have you have a hundred Tigers can we see your target words with you Tigers tranq your Tigers and examine their shit and survive through lab like this human shit here this is human and you you ate a human this tiger ate a human oh my god this lady fed her fucking husband two tigers well she needs a meat grinder she must have a meat grinder so she needs she throws the husband in the meat grinder throws the piles out there where the Tigers eat and they just tear him apart like Scarface 97 dude I think that was a real thing with drug dealers was getting a tiger for that reason oh well that's always been the thing with people with pigs that was in that movie snatch oh that's right that's right baby pigs yeah guy with the crazy glasses yeah who's that dude that dude from the movie snatched that guy's amazing we've talked about him before God I got a rewatch that music that was member he had I get it a cup of tea and these big-ass thick glasses and yeah totally different kind of gangster his name is Alan Ford Alan Ford you fucking legend sir yeah that guy's amazing there's a new guy Richie movie out right now right what is it caused to be in the movie theaters with the low bid hits dude he's one of my all-time favorite people I've ever talked to guy rich he's an interesting guy oh you had him in yeah I don't know shit yeah he changed my mind about suits he's so passionate about suits about wearing suits owning a suit the way you own it how's this a new movie by Matthew McConaughey oh shit I'll take it Matthew McConaughey and Hugh Grant grant playing a bad guy why not I love it I have never seen a guy ritchie movie that I didn't love never won they're all amazing Lock Stock Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels that was great what was the one about the the British gangsters that moved to Spain and they're retired and then the guy makes him come back in oh shit what was that what was that that was fucking her see his thing here oh I think that was it was that rock'n'roll oh that was 2008 no I never saw a man from uncle these are all his movies really Wow anyway the gentleman so it was supposed to be released right around or was it really think it did come out actually about like it wasn't out for very long and the hit and then the thing hey you know that's one cool thing like Apple TV is letting you buy new movies let you buy the movies that are supposed to be out in the movie theater you could rent though oh really on Apple TV yeah no shit not all of them but enough so you're like oh shit this is this is a movie movie that's awesome but there's so many movies that's the thing that you're realizing - like if there's ever been a time in human history where you could really entertain yourself without having to go anywhere yes now I know before you'd have to go to the DVD store and get the fucking kovat infected blockbuster boxes where they'd awful all B's you spray it spray it good and then maybe some of the spray would get into the tape and it would really get the VHS home and fuck the domestic box office brought in 5000 $179 for the week of March 22 26 holy shit five thousand dollars down 100% from the 2004 204,000 Oh two hundred and four million one hundred ninety three thousand four hundred and six the same week a year ago Wow is down a hundred percent [Laughter] [Music] damn that's a big loss but the restaurant industry I think probably took the biggest loss right or the bars bars and restaurants probably took in comedy clubs - comedy clubs theaters sure all those well movie theaters and regular tutors - right all theaters anything Performing Diaz freaked me out I was talking on the phone yesterday and he's like he's like Dawg you think you're gonna be playing the funny bone in st. Louis Chris fucking Chris Rock's gonna be playing that fucking Club this year like all the theater acts are gonna come down to clubs because nobody's gonna be coming out it's very possible we don't know how long this is gonna last man or how long people's apprehension about getting into a group is gonna last even if it clears up next month it's still gonna be a long time before people are comfortable well this also showed people that people that are paying attention to numbers it showed people the devastation the flu does every year yeah until this happened I had no idea that many people were dying every year from the flu yeah that's that's an eye-opener that alone makes you want to wash your hands more yeah and just kind of be careful when people are coughing and dude malaria still I think the number one killer in the world they think malaria has killed we do we figure out this is this has come about four different times and every time I forget whether or not this statistic is bullshit but I think they think half of all the people have died ever that was the the theory were killed by malaria no shit so if you took all the people that have ever died like when you know ten billion people that have ever died five billion died from malaria wow that's the number the shitty way to die till row my friend Justin rent has gotten it three times he runs the fight for the Forgotten charity going to the Congo and building wells for the pig no really yeah oh wow he's been there he's a fighter I fought for the UFC and I don't remember exactly how he initially made his trip over to the Congo but he fell in love with these pygmy people and started helping them trying to figure out how to get them wall wells built in freshwater because a lot of their problems were these diseases that were getting from pathogens in the water because they're just stagnant water and no way to fix it and so he developed this charity fight for the Forgotten and started going back and forth over there but in the meantime he's gotten malaria three different times one time he got sick and the malaria came back so it was like it wasn't even I'm pretty sure he doesn't even think he was reinfected he thinks it rekindled inside of his body when he got sick his immune system was was down and there was like a hint of malaria still in his body and it read that's what fucked me up to paying attention to this we have viruses all the time in our body that are just kind of duking it out yeah there's a war being waged and that the common cold is also a type of corona virus oh is that right yeah yeah make sure that's true it's closer to 4 to 5 percent they think of the total people over 4 or 5 percent between somewhere between 4 and 5 oh well that's way different than 50 let's keep lying and it's not like it's gone down I mean it unless they get rid of mosquitoes there will always be and I think that is a possibility that's something they've talked about doing is engineering some new kind of mosquito that like doesn't breed or some mosquito that kills other mosquitoes or or something along those lines they've they've had a couple of different things that they've tried to figure out how to do but the problem is you don't once you do that you know you let that cat out of the bag and kill all the mosquitoes then you find out the mosquitoes with a glue that holds the whole thing together and the lizards were eating the mosquitoes and the cats reit and the lizards and who knows what kind of shit could go down you got rid of mosquitoes yeah but they do carry a lot of disgusting things the dirty blood yeah the dirty saliva they'd sting you and give you a malaria disease dude people were worried remember when aids first came out people were worried that mosquitoes we're gonna pass it around oh yeah definitely people like what they carry malaria why the fuck can't they carry that oh that's think about all these pandemics like you know coronavirus is actually kind of a pussy and it's it's easy to kill there's other viruses which are much tougher but as a very thin membrane it's a it's a fatty membrane that goes over it and you know foam from soap yeah by the way make sure when you wash your hands get a lot of foam going that's actually the thing that kills the corona really yeah foam yeah foam it up and get your thumbs for God's sake don't forget your goddamn thumbs it's a new strain of corona virus not previously seen in humans for other strains interests are very common usually only cause mild symptoms like the common cold yeah yeah what we're just talking about we're talking about washing hands malaria then it's dead it's a pussy that's what was because there was this other thing that I talked about with the Austral home that scared me way more than that that's uh I mean it's scary for sure don't get me wrong but there's this chronic wasting disease that they found in deer and it's it's 100% fatal and it's a prion disease the same same kind of disease as mad cow disease was and the same as mad cow disease made the jump to humans then it became very dangerous and people to some people to this day like they can't give blood because they were alive eating cheeseburgers during the mad cow days maybe they've released that I don't know but for a long time they couldn't get blood because the idea would be that used to all these prions in your system you could they took these surgical instruments that they used on patients who died of mad cow disease and they ran these surgical instruments through these sanitization machines the the sanitary process sanitizing process three times three times like a thousand degree temperature couldn't kill it three times still had living prions on the surgical equipment yeah yeah and all we got to do is soap it up sing happy birthday twice yeah this done nothing in comparison to something that could happen to us if chronic wasting disease ever made the leap from deer to humans yeah it's very spooky and I had my friend Doug Dern and Brian what's his name again don't guess Richards I think I think you're right who's biologists who's explaining who's explaining a wildlife expert explained all of it to us like what what it is how it's happened how its spread it's spreading from deer and do the end is horrific we watched a video of one of them where they're they're wasting away and they're spitting so this this this this fluid that's coming out of their body is contaminated and then deer will come along and eat the leaves that have that prion on it and take it in and ill get it it'll get chronic wasting disease and then it'll rot away and spitting out this stuff and then other deer not dude it's horrific and it's 100% fatal so think about what we've got that your immune system you know for the vast majority of the people is gonna fight off it's tragic the people that don't not diminishing that at all that's not what I'm saying but there's a giant difference between something that idris elba gets and shows no weaknesses it shows no symptoms rather or Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson get it and they get over it it's rough but they get over and they survive versus prions to kill hundred percent of all the deer that they in fact they're all dead and they waste away they waste away to nothing it's it's ugly Wow look this guy was was sounding the warning bell he was like these have made the jump to mice and they prions have made the jump from animals to people this is totally possible this can happen yeah and it's like right now it's like this like silent thing that they're just keeping an eye on and it's spreading across the country and people don't know like there's places where people have stopped eating deer meat and there's checkpoints we have to bring the deer in like Wisconsin where my friend Doug lives where they bring the deer and they have to test them before you can eat this chronic wasting just test it for a CWD yeah and the thing is it hasn't me to jump to people but who's gonna take that risk Yeah right you're gonna eat it eat this deer sausage that came from a deer that has CWD but it's never made the jump to people so have the sausage mmm what I'm not eating that the thing definitely had it it was definitely positive because a lot of times they're positive for like a year so they're running around like looking like a regular deer and you shoot it and you cook it knead it and you're eating the prions yes they just don't affect your brain yet about 7,000 to 15,000 animals infected with CWD are eaten each year and that number could rise by 20% annually according to the Alliance for Public wildlife which Oscar Holmes cited in his testimony scientists can't say for sure that CWD will cross over and infect humans but as time goes on and more infected meat is consumed the likelihood increases osterholm said it's like a throw at the genetic roulette table he said fuck that yeah what if that gets into the cows what if that gets into your cheeseburger this is maybe what the whole vegan movements about maybe they're trying to protect us from the ultimate attack what if that's the only people that survive can you imagine how annoying the earth will become everybody will be thin and I know well for self righteous all the guys would have to have man buns you have to yeah meat eaters would like get a Velcro man bun and put it on just to get through security yeah you couldn't eat meat anymore everybody was dying of chronic wasting disease yeah imagine man again this is uh these are possible there's been a bunch of different horrific there's been 15 random acts they say in the last 300 years no more than that three thousand years I'm sure there have been more than that I'm sure there's been a bunch recently we were reading him off recently like ones that were considered pandemic h1n1 was considered oh hi there was 15 of something maybe it's not a pandemic then h1n1 was the number again Jamie it was like more than 50,000 dead in this country in this country yeah no yeah yeah well that's this country total in the world but a sure that's America or the rest of the world the very next thing below it says estimated one hundred fifty one to five hundred seventy-five thousand people died during the first year okay so five hundred seventy five thousand in the world but only eighteen thousand in America what was the one that got the big number if I'm wrong about eight one h1n1 there was one that had a really large number we like what tooth that remember I read to you at those quotes the other day did we ever figure out those are real there was one okay yeah total us is cases oh that's what it is there's the one from death rates range from three to thirty three percent swine flu the twelve thousand four hundred sixty nine deaths the United States according to CDC from April 2009 April 2010 wait about the 2017 to 2018 h2 n3 that one it says killed it says he'll sixty one thousand Americans is that the one H two and three from 2017 but again in 1968 is it says 1732 eighteen no H two and three oh sorry did I say it wrong no I'm looking at one that's just dyslexic back the other way estimated affected eight hundred and ninety four thousand people got the flu overall death rate was seven point five percent with a peak in January 2018 of 10.8% fatality rate whoa yeah I don't know if that's true though ten percent face - I fix that a doctor sent me who's a wise man yeah we've done zero research right so that's what I'm trying to find out well ten percent I think is a death rate for corona isn't it about oh no it's that was what-who person was in Italy I think that's the influenza A influenza h3n2 and how many people that kill each other how come there wasn't social distancing and all this stuff for for I think the idea is that the flu is something we're prepared for we have flu shots we have Tamiflu we're prepared for someone getting a bad case of the flu we're to prepare for the flu this is something that nobody that you saw coming it directly affects your Esper taury system they said dr. Hotez yesterday was trying to explain it was basically five times more deadly than the flu and five times more contagious okay so it's a perfect combination and a great number of people are asymptomatic so they they get it and nothing happens spreads them all and they spread it and then the people that infects its it infects a lot of people from them and it is really bad for the people with it's really bad for it's weird yeah and this is one of the things that he was kind of highlighting that it's a very strange one okay influenza is caused up to fifty seven thousand three hundred deaths and sickened up to forty 1.3 million people according to do estimates in the last year I was live this was supposed to a year ago so this was so that was the 2007 I think 2000 2017-2018 year that's the 57,000 57,000 Americans died in one year or the flu mm-hmm no shit I know that's what's crazy that's what this is this is what's but you got to think Greg about the numbers of us this is what we have to think this scale and again this is not diminishing because people want to get up set up these kind of things I'm not diminishing at all the impact of the corona virus and what it's happening right now and and it's it's different for sure it's definitely worse but what I'm saying is most of us weren't truly aware of the numbers of people that are affected by the flu until this until you're looking at those numbers and you go wait wait how many and then you think we're dealing with three hundred and thirty million people three hundred thirty million or whatever it is and how many of them are getting sick and and how many people do you know they get really sick how many people do you know that are sick already and then they get really sick and then they die how many people do you know that have cancer and they're going through chemo and then they get sick and they die it happens there's so many fucking people that when the flu comes along anyone that catches it that's in a compromised state is in trouble kids are in trouble well let say kids I think are more in danger the flu than they are of Corona and Corona seems to affect the elderly right yeah it's a different disease although I got a friend who works in an in an ER in New York who says that originally it was older people and now they're seeing a lot of people in their 20s coming in and not is getting up a dying from it Jesus yeah they think there's a bunch of different factors and they don't know what they are they think there might be genetic there might be different blood types it might be people that vape I might have an issue people that smoke seem to certainly have an issue and they think maybe that's part of the reason why Italy has such a high right and men have a higher rate than women because they smoke more and they're gross and they don't wash their hands what if it only grew on balls we'd be dead I'm just constantly having us to get our balls cut off just like they do to dogs look the best way to make a dog calm as you cut their balls off right that's what they're gonna do to people that's how we're gonna become those aliens yeah and I'm talking about before yeah that's the obvious next step for people it's obvious you go from original ancient primate to human being to alien yeah that's the next step no gender chop it all off that's what all this gender neutral gender this gender that gender norms all the other battling going on about gender that never existed before it's a slow slide and the neutering all the males yeah cuz that's the only way it's gonna work out because and we'll be happier to J we won't have to feel the pressure of breeding one more all gonna listen to Liz oh we're gonna understand why each others are mad then we're gonna get it we go oh now I know why you're mad yeah I never thought that way before right hey boy surprised you were more mad that was one of the funniest things about I was watching this documentary about this lady who converted into a man and she was talking about like the difference being like once she got testosterone and they started shooting her up with testosterone her clit started growing she was like oh okay I get it no I thought that you the way you guys felt was like the same way we felt yeah she's like I've never been this horny in my life yeah yeah you get it now yeah this different thing it's different than the male horny is a it's a pursuing horny it's an aggressive look I gotta take care of this Jesus yeah like a young kid like an 18 year old kid agony agony all-consuming you couldn't think about anything you couldn't be in a room with that nun without having a dirty thumb mm-hmm and once you got your first sexual experience once a girl a cute young girl your age slides your penis into her mouth Oh My Jesus this is better than anything I've ever done by far mm-hmm I'm gonna focus solely on this for the next two decades when your first girlfriend is rubbing your balls while your ejaculating into her mouth like what could be better than this you're telling me there's a thing better yeah cuz I say horseshit yes my whole life I thought tens were tens and now everything other than this is like a three yeah so all the tens like Oh Star Wars amazing stores can suck a fucking pail these days fuck you Star Wars sucks compared to blowjobs right and for women a nice cuddle feels

anyway I mean I've never real I've never I've been married since fake tits have been around so I don't really know what it's like to interact with fake tits but it seems to me that like if if that if the vagina and the tits are the really the key points for making love then who cares with the rest of bodies fake hmm interesting thought yeah like a fake arm yeah let's make it all fake but if what it was she's like jerking you off with the fake arm use the real one just with the fake ones more sensitive the real one I hit twitches sometimes like the bionic man ones real and ones yeah you don't want to get jerked off by the fake ones yeah like I want you to do it like do you really hand is this weird yeah on what you using a tool on me you know at least I'm calm you commit to letting someone use something on you yeah you know commit to someone want to put a vibrator in your taint okay hey hey hey it's not real let's just hang out yeah you know use a tarragon on my taint right let's just talk yeah you don't have to do that but I remember there was who was this girl in college and she's the chain smoke and drink tab all day it was everything everything about it was just kind of manufactured and hmm you know just just perfect and I remember one time like I was over a house and I we we've kind of broken up and she'd had a party and she's like hey why don't you stick around it's like nah man I'm gonna head out she's like no stay stay I was like man she's like I have toys I'm like all right let's crack another beer and she took you over the top that's because I never played with toys and and she opened up her her bottom drawer her dresser and it was like a fucking hardware store all different sizes and shapes and uh do you remember post 9/11 when Stanhope would travel with a suitcase filled with dildos now yes that was his thing that was his thing Stanhope would travel with a whole suitcase filled with dildos that's great like a shoe salesman let me show you my wares I mean there are a hundred percent legal that have yeah so he would just get checked and every TSA anybody what in the fuck and they'd open up his bags just dicks rubber dicks but what kind of girl you go bet you go back to his hotel room and he opens up his suitcase and you're you just start using those same kind of girl that loves tan oh yeah that's right perfect perfect yeah yep you know it's uh you just wipe sit down with this tie just good old honest advertising now listen I see that you like me and you've come back to my room can I assume I can put in hardware that's been in other women inside of you right now yes sure let's do it let's smoke cigarettes - yeah take some mushroom smoke a cigarette fuck you phone calls - filthy dildos inside of me every time I get a phone call from Stanhope it's it's like oh yeah I hope he's drunk what do you got what are you doing right now we got into yoga for a while no not yoga biking and hiking oh yeah I did so yeah he no he did yoga - yeah he met this lady down in Tucson he was writing a book and she's she was a cyclist right um anyway she got him like to stop drinking for a while start eating healthy start exercising start riding a bike and she was like getting him to do it on a regular basis huh yeah I was like what how is this possible I don't know if he maintained I was assumed it was just a cleansing period for weed hot back yeah I think that on the booze that makes being a drunk could get boring if he never took a break you got to step away once in a while clean it up and then feel the joy of going back down into the darkness you know you know I talked to Ari Shaffir yes all right excellent ari he's quarantined himself in Maryland for two weeks he's just he's run out of edibles and he's not smoking it because he thinks it makes you vulnerable to Corona so he's living like a he's doing yoga living a clean life good for him yeah so he's gonna do that for two weeks and he's gonna move in with his folks right yeah yeah I think he just decided to play it that way smart move coming from New York because that's where Michael yo got it that's where there's the most cases in the country right now meanwhile they say more cases in the United States and more deaths the United States than China and I don't buy that I was reading this scientist was saying that is literally almost impossible you're dealing with a country that has three times the amount of people and it broke out there so there's three times the amount of people who broke out there it's been going on far longer that it's been going on here and they're saying there's less deaths in China than there are here and less people infected yeah yeah China conceal'd extent of virus outbreak US intelligence says that's from Bloomberg yeah that should say duh yeah yeah of course they did now when they shoot you for reporting the truth yeah dude there's 21 million people missing from their cell phone database they're really 21 million that doesn't mean doesn't mean that 21 million people are dead from the virus but let's just say it's only 10% of those people yeah let's say it's that that's 2 million people dud alright let's say it's 10% of that come on man 200,000 people did how many people how many people really died is it really only 30,000 or whatever they said how many did they say died it's not that many well they've also loosened up their restrictions now so if it if it didn't get if it didn't get that bad it will get that bad because it'll have a boomerang now that they open it up again well they tried to open up movie theatres and they immediately closed them back down again well here people as soon as they relax things the divorce rate went up shot through the roof in China 3,000 does get the fuck out of here yeah right 81 thousand cases we have way more cases only 3,000 deaths we have more deaths come on yeah they listen you're dealing with a military dictatorship they get to decide what information gets revealed and anything that would show them to have made a mistake or to be liable or to be negligent or incompetent is going to be suppressed well what's North Korea saying it's a good question I haven't heard a peep out of North Korea South Korea apparently got on it very quickly they were saying that Germany has the best results they have a very very low mortality rate and they don't know if it's because the stringency of their system the health of the people whether it's a combination of things they have apparently are very good health care system but it makes sounds like the thing about the way Germans make cars you know yeah there's so well engineered it's so well thought out North Korea claims no coronavirus cases fucking credit card number and kim jeong-hoon just shot an 11 again last week in golf yeah oh to see how crazy golf scores yeah does he really he claims that he got a hole-in-one on every call there's something crazy we're gonna like a 27 out of 18 hole really really yeah what does that zelich Tiger Woods world class no no Tiger Woods will shoot a great round of 63 so this guy says like just 17 I forget what it is but it's like it entails several holes in one and round oh my god Dennis Robbo's with them that must be fun though to be able to just tell people everyday like all right print this I fucked nine women last night they were all tens they said he got a 34 a 38 underpart 34 by the way Lil Duval who's the best follow on instagram right now he's all days been posting about the the corona virus and funny memes and shed but he had one with the the king of Thailand the king of Thailand is sequestered in his palace with his 18 girlfriends is that sequestered yes it is it's just him and them and just a long bone session how many does he have like you feeling any better no I need a little more time the king of Thailand had a girl that was like his number one girl here this came - oh excuse me twenty girlfriends wow he's in a luxury hotel with twenty girlfriends so he's got em all in rooms they can't go anywhere and stay put that with all his medals are for yes for fucking he won the fucking Olympics every year he stands on the podium holding his dick that is so crazy there's just different styles of life but uh I think little Duval wrote aspirations yeah it's the same guy oh no shit not only did he took away her military position because she was disrespectful to the Queen Wow yeah he made her bow down friend everybody you watch the video click it says watch the video you should watch the video as he made her his official concubine and ceremony attended by his wife so that was when he made his official concubine that was one video but there's another video where he took away the title which hasn't been bestowed upon someone in a long time apparently he took it away because she she slipped of the tongue look at this official concubine look at bowing down oh she gives the concubine crown just imagine living like that imagine the whole world he gives her something to eat what is she doing she putting in her hair like a lethal flower to put behind her ear yeah there's like rules stuff you have to do meanwhile the wives like mm-hmm this bitch fuck this bitch doing okay they all have to be on their knees in front of him I guess lots of different ways to go all right huh yeah Wow maybe he's got the best time of this coronavirus thailand's playboy King was taken over a luxury German hotel to isolate from the coronavirus along with a harem of 20 women salute 67 keep on rockin in the free world sir it seems like a lot I guess it's you know maybe you know something we don't know yeah he whatever his diet is I need it well maybe it's just like he knows it's gonna take a long time yeah maybe they get to world leaders and they go look we got a couple of years was not clear if his fourth wife former flight attendant was even with him the baller move would be to like wait four days and then send for more women right just to blow people's minds yeah with golden underwear on you just put pose at the balcony every down then stand out of the balcony overlooking the city with a glass of champagne with golden underwear just look around and you go right back in send in some more bitches just left well Germany's the best place to be like you were saying super low mortality rate less than 1/10 of 1% in Germany I was reading that like in Scandinavia different countries are there they're all being pretty conservative about it except for Sweden which has like completely lack stalls social distancing and they've got the same rates of infection as I really don't know there was a change that's jumped yeah the Sweden model there was a curve that they showed week to week where everyone else is kind of like this is the the thing you keep hearing flatten the curve right well Sweden is a good example of how it's not flat and it's going up so they had like you know Sweden was yellow and this country was another color and and Sweden was going up well the ones were not huh yeah it's it's a risky move you know and I think I don't know if their fatalities are any higher though we're gonna see state-by-state what happens in this country because you know California has been really locked down pretty early in pretty well and there are a lot of cases in San Francisco but not that bad here not bad here in LA no no it's not bad if you really stop and consider what it could be um a lot in New York though New York's rough yeah it's but think about the way people the style of life over there everybody's bumping into everybody on station yep yep apartment buildings taking the elevators hundreds of other people on stairs and city bikes oh yeah man you're you're always in contact with people you're eating out way more than you're eat at home I mean it's one of the cool things about New York City you know that's that's what's gonna be weird coming back if people can relax or if they're just now are we gonna be like this when the flu comes around again like what if another pandemic flu that does the kind of damage that that other one they were talking about the 2017-2018 flu we gotta be gun-shy now oh i think i watch TV or movies and i literally have a subconscious reaction to people being close to each other that's how internalized it's become and that's gonna stick around for a while yeah like you see a picture of dudes like hugging each other and laughing at a bar like what are you doing yeah yep fuck yeah we're gonna be rewired after this do you think you'll get through it and and go back to normal do what you think or do you think there's no normal I think it depends on what you just said I think if there's another one that comes on the heels of this then it's gonna really reinforce it but if if this thing clears up as you know if the weather comes in and it's warm which isn't even proven because a lot of warm weather places still have the coronavirus but if it if it's if that helps stem it for a while and and it goes away within a few months I think we'll be okay well dude you're welcome to come in here anytime you want while we while we're down if you want to do regular podcast let's do them all the time oh that's great hang out yeah cuz one of the things that I'm enjoying for real enjoying over these last few weeks was been I did a podcast with Burt and I did a podcast with Tom that I did a podcast with Joey and I'm like these are my favorite like we're all getting to hang out a regular basis right you know it's not like these big stretches where you're going on tour on the east and I'm going over here and Joey's over there like we're all together yes fucking with 30 minutes drive from each other all the time yeah it's different I know this is great and it's like it's like I was saying with my family family and close friends it's like yeah what's better than that in life the things that's weird those you can't hug and you're not even shaking hands and we're seeing each other but we're staying all these feet apart from its own yeah yeah it's it feels a little weird in that regard but yeah that's just what it is now right what it is now until it stops being that I know when podcasting has to take the place of stand-up for a while just energy-wise creativity-wise people that are doing stand-up on the internet with no audience or out of your fucking mind people are doing that the Laugh Factory they were streaming stand-up comedy can he hear the audience's laugh is like a zoom where it's back and forth no there's no audience he's doing stan has to in standup they're basically playing guitar with no instrument yeah right they're masturbating it's comedy masturbation well they just start trying it out you know they go people at home are listening but it's not the same now people want the content but you got to figure out I just started this new podcast called Sunday papers where I just me and you know my buddy Mike Gibbons yeah sure yes so me and Mike do a thing where we read the Sunday paper and we just go through each section entertainment sports business let's go and we just do jokes about each section and we have little sound effects for the paper and oh that's great yeah so it's on my site it's on fits dog radio site but and it's like it's just another reason to hang out with a good friend yes a week yeah Tim Dylan said it best he's like stand-ups that you can't just do stand-up - no audience you suck you got to be creative yeah I'm up with sketches right you know but Dylan's always doing that tim has always got like is Megan McCain he's really fucking funny he's so prolific yeah he is and he let the stuff he does out on the street just fucking around with people is hilarious no he's awesome he's awesome but he goes so far like his characters I told him like I want you to get healthy man I'm like we need you yeah like we really do need him right he's fucking hilarious he's a wild man and this is the TEL like for me like guys like him head fucking push it hard like they're important yeah you got to keep these guys around that's right you got to nourish them because like there's a lot of lazy comics out there they're not putting in one tenth of the work that Tim Dylan's out there putting in yeah he's constantly uploading new videos constantly doing that constantly tweeting funny shit constantly yeah on stantly yeah he's just still working man and he's just naturally funny yes he's got that he's free gotta be from Long Island right he's definitely from New York he's got that Long Island sense of humor he does yeah the best format well-read a smart guy okay yeah we're in we're in a strange strange moment in history yeah it's strange but it's an opportunity as really is something you got to look at like you said something to me when I asked you last week how you're doing you said you just you're just trying to accept and I think that's the key if you can accept it then you can be proactive about it you can be creative about it you can just take whatever life force you have and and you know look at what what what are the possibilities here don't have any expectations that get shattered by reality accept what it is what it is is a new thing you know stay alive be nice to each other and and do your best and try to get through this and hopefully at the other end when science and medicine has gotten a handle on this hopefully we can go back to normal life they'll be wonderful but right now we can't so it is what it is if you just want to run around screaming and hollering and freaking out about it and it's not good what what makes me more concerned than anything is what is life gonna be like once the economy rolls back again how many people gonna be out of work how many business is gonna be shuttered how many you know how fucked up is it gonna be that gives me the most fear of the unknown because I know that a certain amount of people are gonna get sick and a certain large percentage are gonna get better and unfortunately some people are gonna die and all that's awful but I kind of see that that that makes sense in my mind I kind of see a disease I see people that all make sense what doesn't make sense is an economy that stops and then restarts again I've never seen that yeah so for that I'm like what is that like and there's no model to base it on because our economy today is so much different than it was you know even ten years ago the International economy it is it's a it's a digital economy there's so much of it that we don't we don't know how it's gonna how it's gonna play out yeah and I know that a lot more people are gonna stop going to work I think that businesses are saying oh we don't need offices for a hundred percent of our people and parking spots no we'll just have 50% of the people work from home like we just did for the last three months that worked that would be very cost-effective for people that don't want to have gigantic offices and and then also how free how much freedom it is if you can work from home yep I mean for a lot of people if that's possible that would definitely be preferable hell yeah and productivity I can tell you from writing on TV shows over the years there's been some that I've written from home you know where I'm like a consultant that's just handing them it's I do so much more work when I have to actually hand it in through an email than when I'm sitting in a writers room with 12 other people throwing out a line once an hour I'll I'm eating fucking sushi I mean I work my ass off when I'm home because I got a I got to justify it yes that's a good point that's a good point you're accountable yeah I mean I think a good thing to do right now to think about that in terms of creation of material one thing I've been guilty of over the last month haven't written jack shit I'm gonna have a couple ideas I wrote down but I really have been writing when I haven't been doing stand-up and I decided what I wanted to do is I wanted to know what my take on this is and I felt like the best way I could figure out what my take on it is is just have a natural take on it mm-hmm like actually go through this and and find out what it is first how long it's gonna last and what what do you what are your thoughts on this and at the beginning I didn't know what my thoughts on it were because my thoughts on it were stay safe make sure family stays safe friends stay safe you know do whatever you're supposed to do and and let's find out how long it's gonna take what are the experts say talk to some experts what's the prognosis look like it keeps getting pushed back now it's June now they're saying June things are gonna restart June like fuck what is that like what does that like for people that are checked to check three months yeah April May June right when when does it when does it go back three months from now and it's already been a month whoa you know what went what day June what is June 14 you've got more cases then what do we do when do we do we ever say fuck it let's just go back to work what is that like hmm what kind of drunken Wild West parties oh you're gonna be when people go back to work and start going back to bars and yeah they forgot how to be out at a bar at a nightclub mm-hmm how many people gonna be pregnant when this this all goes back there's gonna be a giant up nine months from now like oh yeah I didn't think of that they're fucking and they're scared and they're shooting those those fear-based loads yep which are heavy dude we're running out of condoms I was just reading the paper that's they're like who they produce all the condoms in Malaysia I think it's in Malaysia and fucking their shuttered the factory shuttered we need to make shit here but we need to make shit in a way that doesn't destroy the environment and one of the ways they're able to make shit in other countries is then all the same regulations environmental regulations as they do here that's always been the big problem with shipping stuff overseas they also don't have the same regulations like when the Foxconn scandal came out and they found out there was Nets around the building to keep people from jumping through the building where they make iPhones yeah you're like uh what yeah we gotta make them here and we got to figure out a way where we make them when we have a the person who makes them makes good living you know the back the old days when they used to have like great cars that were made in Detroit they were all made in Detroit and Detroit was a huge city yeah Detroit was one of the richest cities in the country yeah it was huge now it's a disaster because everything got shipped overseas or everything got shipped to you know different places well they got to figure out you know the union's because the unions are a great theory and they have worked well in a lot of ways but they also have huge problems and they've there's got to be a way to get unions back in place that can guarantee people health coverage and retirement without making the cost of doing business so high that it hurts the industry I don't know jack-shit about finances so I don't know whether or not there's even comment on that but it would be nice if everybody worked it out yeah it would be nice if everybody figured out how to make shit in America where we don't have to worry about things going down and let's let's learn from this let's learn from this and start making medicine over here why is all the medicine made in China what right how much what it's crazy yeah we make a lot of shit but we need to balance out we need to balance out for some sort of apocalyptic event we got to be prepared well this is like you know we're streamlining right now we're realizing what's necessary and what's luxury and we're getting we're keeping it simple and then we're gonna come out of it having a better gauge of what each of us needs or individually at the second term we go to war with Iran China backs Iran whoa things get crazy no one has any money fifty percent are out of work militaries in the streets yeah kovat 21 comes out kills 40% of the population still no ventilators all right that's possible too yeah yeah there's a lot of Possible's out there that was the things that we wish we were shipping stuff overseas they just just read something today that like we were sending metal medical equipment to other countries we were do you read anything about that it was when the ship broke down in China we shipped a bunch of our stuff there to help them without then replenishing what we shipped over okay oh we got stupid but I think I also read something about Thailand that we would that we were in the Pratt we were actually shipping stuff to Thailand right now and then it was some kind of mix-up and the government's apologizing about it now well China's apparently gonna stop according to my friend forest Galante who's a wildlife biologist China's gonna stop the sale of a lot of wildlife now which is what you got in those wet markets yeah you know sale of wildlife all packed on top of each other apparently they're they're enacting some new regulations to stop that because they're recognizing like hey this is where diseases come from it's a better way to do this but I mean in really impoverished provinces and you think about the sheer size of China and the sheer numbers of the population like and the fact they've been doing it this way for so long what are you gonna do different how you gonna stop them well it's factory farming it's so what's happening is like these small farmers are being pushed further and further into the wilderness and so they're you know they're basically harvesting animals that aren't normally eaten and there's a lot of batshit and the animals are eating batshit it sounds like a gas station version of what's really one of your doctor guests who knows what the fuck they're talking about I think you're right about batshit though official asked the Thais for help only to be informed by the puzzled voices on the other side of the line that a u.s. shipment of the same supplies the second of two so far was already on its way to Bangkok so that we had a problem with our policy in the way shit was already sent over and someone else was asking for stuff and they didn't know that it was already being sent there so they'd put a stop on that and yeah oh so it's being sent to Bangkok and we turned it around today while their King is in Germany clucking 20 beautiful women meanwhile I was watching there's this guy do you know Efrain raises now probably one of the if not the greatest pool player of all time one of the greatest pool players of all time and he lives in the Philippines and he plays these money matches over there all the time he's really old now he doesn't play like he used to when he was at his best but they put these matches online from like March 20th 2020 packed pool hall people stuffed into in the Philippines stuffed on top of each other no social distancing whatsoever smoking cigarettes hanging out playing pool

some push-ups I've been now I've been doing stuff I've been family yoga been doing every other day we found a good video online we do and then bike rides took a long-ass bike route my son last night but they closed the beach they closed the parks yeah the tennis courts everything right now Cameron Haynes his son Truitt is trying to break the record for the most chin-ups in 24 hours he's doing five I think he's doing five every minute and he's been really yeah he's been doing it since three o'clock in the morning the idea is it goes all the way through to 24 hours of chin-ups and I think the number to beat he's looking to beat like 4000 something chin-ups no shit mmm-hmm damn yeah that's going on right now go to his Instagram you know at cams Instagram page because camp flew in to help him I think they're doing it in Utah and his Instagram is just true it that's Cam's son and posted anything for the last five hours who's that 2060 2016 yeah so he might need to take a little nappy-poo what's he built like is he lean or is hideous he's a stud he's very strong there is okay yeah he's probably he's in the phytic acid in the 200-pound range it's tall yeah he's a big kid big strong kid I mean he's taller than camp can know how tall he is no I think about it oh he's still anyway overhand yeah that's pull-ups chin-ups through this one yeah I guess he's probably like 511 510 511 whatever he is the kids stud and he's young man he's I think he's in his early 20s so he's doing this he's doing five of them but he's got a savage father I mean his father's out there running 240 mile races that take three days you know his father is one of the the best bow hunters on planet earth yeah yeah his father's Cameron Haynes is the guy who originally taught me how to shoot a bow and taught me how to hunt so that's his son so his sons a fucking savage - so he's doing five of these every minute so what you say is that mm what mm mm 60 sure 60 yeah Rogan and Haynes for president 2020 yeah that's great but anyway this kid is an animal and he's documenting the whole thing so good luck to you true it mountain ops that's where that the mountain ops gym that makes sense they're a company that makes high-end supplements that are used by a lot of outdoor people uh-huh make a lot of stuff specifically tailored towards athletes that hunt and at like this that's the thing about this bow hunting thing that's very different than what people associate with hunting like you have to go to the animals and there's no easy way to do it you're going to the end you're hiking right it's it's a it's a sport you have to be in shape it's it's a rare you're gonna carry heavy shit you gotta carry heavy shit but that's the easy part the hard part is well not always because sometimes you're deep deep in you got to carry heavy shit for miles and miles but it's also hard just to get to where the elk are they're they're super athletes and they just effortlessly bound up the side of a hill in seconds and it would take you an hour to go to the same place yeah so you have to follow these fuckers and you have to be fit to do it and you're at you know 8,000 feet above sea level so there's not much air there anyway yeah so he started running marathons Cameron did and getting in really great shape just for elk hunting and then along the way said all right I'm gonna I'm gonna do some ultra marathons so he did some hundred miles and then this did this Bigfoot 200 was it Bigfoot 240 no it's ammo up to 40 so he did a 200 mile er and then he did a 240-mile er that's 10 marathons dude it's so preposterous it takes days days and days and days and they just run for days not straight through yes without sleeping he'll race and an hour max in an hour sometimes people sleep 10 minutes yeah Courtney dill Walter we had her in here she won not only did she win it she won it by more than ten hours so she was 10 hours faster than the second-place person yet she's a savage she said she slept for a minute and then when the minute was over she was angry she thought they'd let her sleep for longer she was so rested uh-huh and she got up and fucking kept running dude she ran 200 I think it's like officially they call it a two Ford it was like 238 238 miles think about how many times you run through pain like cuz I run if I run to the beach and back it's two miles and my angler miny something hurts yeah but when you run that far you're dealing with blisters twisted ankles chafing oh you gotta fall apart damn yeah I've said it before but I'll say it one more time if anyone hasn't seen go and watch the video that was documenting Eddie Izzard strip around all of UK he was running a marathon every day you do it for like 20 days or something 26 days I think he did it something crazy like that yeah but here's what's really crazy didn't run before this that's the craziness so decided to pick up running and run a marathon every day for like almost a month and just by sheer will oh you mean he didn't train leading up to that no he's overweight no shit overweight didn't wasn't in shape at all feet were destroyed yeah I mean destroy like one day they forced him like medically forced him to take a day off like you have to rest your feet his feet were destroyed destroy the skin was just hanging off of them just raw meat and they're showing like they're trying to clean the dressings and the bandages and is just falling apart like his skins destroy you got a hassle serious internal pain emotional pain to put yourself through that or you have to have a mind it's like a bank vault you don't let those things fuck with you you just keep going you have a goal here's your goal left foot right foot go keep going put two went to get to the end and then get something to eat go to sleep and you can do it again tomorrow and after a while I sort of got in shape he just got in shape by running a goddamn marathon every day and so towards the end of it he's like not really in much pain anymore he's like be able to do him a little bit faster you could see his body's getting more accustomed to to running and was he doing it in high-heeled shoes no no no he was only that helps imagines yeah yeah he was doing regular clothes what's that oh he did I was nails pin well didn't he just did another one he just did a 28 and 28 days I think he was telling us he was doing one and he wanted to run through these really bad parts of Africa and they're like no like you'll get killed they'll rob you and kill you he's like wheelie is like yeah we're gonna get you take you in a van get you out of this area and then you can run the rest yeah like there's areas they like you are not running like what if you guys follow me like no that come get you make humanity great again oh I love his hat it's blue hat make humanity great again you got to go blue right because he's got the red and the you can't even wear a red hat today and someone had a supreme hat on it was Saab he had a red hat that said supreme and white letters people I could probably take that hat off did you see Curb Your Enthusiasm this season no I didn't there's one where he wears a hat just to just to have people leave him alone and he fucking loves it he's watched her in LA and retreats him like a pariah those are my picks if you're if you're bunkered down looking for shit to watch on TV curbs new season is great Ozark it's fucking great just started just cut through Episode one of the new season that's one of my favorite shows out mmm outside or excuse me on HBO great what else is good my brilliant friend HBO what is that that's when I was telling you about it the Italian one based on the books oh that's really good names a new better call Saul I haven't seen it yet but it's all loaded up on the DVR that just finished this plenty shit to watch plenty of good shit everybody what's interesting about this time so we're gonna gonna actually have time to watch it I know I always pictured like god I wish I could just like you know break my leg so I could lay in bed and catch up on this series and it's like that's happening yep it's happening for everybody yeah man I mean I like to be optimistic I want to I want to think that we're gonna come through this better then we're gonna come through this a little bit more compassionate and understanding what it's like to be a person but this is we have a vulnerable existence that's what I want right my fear is that there's gonna be so much economic disparity so many people out of work so much crime that is gonna be a bloody bunch of people that don't feel like they're being looked out for and then there'll be a further divide yeah that haves and have-nots in this country which is what you know one of the reasons why I like people like Bernie Sanders whether or not you're he's right or wrong about whether or not he can enact any of those economic possibilities that he's talking about wondering I mean that stuff actually works at least the guy running the show has always been about helping the working people making sure people have health care making sure your education is cover just those thoughts alone like for the strength of our community and taking into consideration what we're going through right now with it when you realize what's actually important what's actually important is that everybody's gonna be okay you know whoever's okay make sure they're okay get to get them resources yeah help help where you can when we think of ourselves in our neighborhood you think your neighborhood your neighbors need some help you want to help right you want to especially at a time like this we should that should how that should be our approach to the whole country yeah right I just have to expand how we feel in a neighborhood in a crisis expand that to the whole country like maybe we can have a little bit of a shift here and the way we look at each other this is real possible that maybe everybody can do their part and then you know the people that are not doing their part the people that are fuckin shitty when when they get served on internet videos people are enjoying the shit out of it you know they're enjoying it there was a some guy was spit on like he spit on some you see that yeah and some guys smashed him yeah everyone send that to everybody right yeah fuck you man well that's the thing it's like this partisanship it's so hard to see you know what it's probably started with Reagan and it's gone since then where the left and the right or just at each other and there's no one reality anymore and the things that brings people together is a war a crisis where suddenly you see that we are all in the same country we're all in the same side that you the humane side and hopefully that that's that's what comes out of this that's well said and I hope you're right Greg Fitzsimmons ladies and gentlemen episode 20 episode 20 on the Joe Rogan experience dude we talked a lot of shit yeah it's been great thanks for having me often let's play some pool let's play some pool dude all right friends we'll be back much love to you all bye you [Music]
