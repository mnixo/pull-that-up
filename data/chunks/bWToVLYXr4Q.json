hey everybody this episode of Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by ting we have a winner for the ting podcast contest and the winner is Holley Mack 23 and Holley Mack 23 she gets an iPhone 5 right though it is yeah assuming that Holley Mac is a girl I don't even know if it's a girl whoever Halle Mac let's let's find out let's do a little Google search on Holley Mac 23 shy probably she's gonna get swarmed by assholes now I think of that but they wanted you to announce it online well Holly Mac 23 got 19 followers soon there will be more she hot listen she's a nice person that's what's important yeah she's very pretty but she's got a man in her picture bud so back off anyway Holly Mac 23 you win The Ting contest what is ting ting is a no-bullshit mobile service company that uses a Sprint backbone what ting does is they rent time on Sprint but then give you cell phone service at a in a very reasonable way with no contracts no early termination fees no add-on coverages and you only pay for what you use if you use very little you pay very little and if you use more you don't have to pay some exorbitant rates that you you know some fines that you get when you go over your data coverage or over your text minutes or in that nonsense you get with other cell phone providers and I think that what they're doing is probably most likely going to be the future for cell phone companies I think the more companies like ting come around and the more they provide you with excellent service without all the nonsense and bullshit and contracts and all the crap that everybody hates about cell phone coverage all that stuff is out the window with Tang and they have the latest and greatest Android devices they have the HTC One which is a fantastic phone and the Samsung Galaxy

pal bud bratzman who's my neighbor we've been friends for many many a year but more than two decades right we've been friends for a long time Steen seventeen years something like that long last time bud every year leaves family and friends behind and travels to Mexico to do this fucking crazy race and every year I talked to his wife shaking my head I talked to other people shaking my head calm that bud bratzman is a crazy son of a bitch like what the fuck is he doing down in Mexico doing jumps and flying over hills well he is brought with him Rob MacCachren who is apparently demand when it comes to this Baja racing stuff and I mean I'm fascinated by it and so I'm real excited to get you guys on the podcast and talk about it and I know you've got something upcoming that you're promoting that so people can get a chance to check it out yeah we I started racing I'm at the TV business right so I think you think I'm crazy but this race is much like Mount Everest to me you just got to go do it it starts always start just a stupid bucket list thing you got to go do right so I did it one year Rob's been doing it for 25 years or 30 years I did it one year 2005 and I'm like I gotta go climb Mount Everest I gotta go do this thing so I did it through a sponsor might be of courage and I'm like oh my god and this is actually leans back to you this is mixed martial arts of racing there's no rules there's no classes there are there classes but there's no rules you can do anything you want there's consequences down there I mean if you don't train you don't pay attention you don't sleep you've got part of that before you have consequences you get hurt and get killed you could wreck your car you can sit on the middle of desert for 20 hours you know I just went to go compete kind of like an Ironman like I want to go compete I want to finish it right so I just say you did a marathon yeah I did a marathon I'm a big little trophy it's fine and now I'm hooked right so then it's kind of the Lord this majestic place Rob will talk about Allah this majestic place I was like I finished I'm happy 36 hours in the car I finished it was great everyone was happy I was tired of shit then the next year I came back but I want to do it again well maybe I'll take a second or third or get on the podium and then so I started chasing it and started chasing it took me eight years every day you know I work out all the time just to go race i watch race videos I guess much see time as I can because I only do the one race a year I do about two races a year just one to practice and then I go down and raced a thousand and I finally won in 2012 but then there's guys like Rob 200 wins he's wait he's won 200 times in off-road racing he's won five out of all the stats over a five Baja 1000 thousand five by one five hundreds he's the legend of our sport he races in trophy trucks which is not my class so for folks who don't know what what Baja racing is explained that what Rob why don't you explain it since you've done it yes decades absolutely Baja 1000 is Baja Peninsula basically start in Ensenada race all the way down to La Paz approximate thousand miles all dirt road all dirt roads some asphalt roads sometimes we can't get through dirt so we have to get up on the highway and actually race down the highway with the traffic as Budd was alluding to there is no rules the highways wide open the racecourse is wide open there's cattle there's horses there's uh are they speed limits on the highway now there are there didn't used to be yeah there didn't used to be now you know we had sanctioning bodies the sport is growing a little bit and your Mexican government doesn't want Rob doing I can't do 130 miles now in the highway he can they don't want him to do 130 on so they've they've got us down to 60 but they it's sections it's really it's kind of like get between rounds in a fight you know you get jump on the highway you get time to relax a little bit get to take a drink of water your crews in 60 miles an hour and up I had about five miles you dumped off in the dirt again and you're just all an ass in the dirt and how fast you go on the dirt the top speed that close to 140 yeah yeah we go across dry lakes 130 540 miles an hour through the whoops you know two and three foot whoops like waves anyway you know from 6d all the way up to 120 across them it's an incredible thing the the wheel travel of these trucks is you know over 20 inches in the front over 30 inches in the rear the tires that we have are 39 inches tall they cost a lot of money luckily both bud and I are supported by BF Goodrich it's an incredible incredible sport and like Bud was saying when he got involved with it he fell in love with it and I did the same thing back in the early 80s and I'm addicted to it the bob 1000 it only comes once a year he tried to win it if you don't get it done you got to wait another 365 days to get down there do it again and it's it's an awesome feeling and you can't wait to get down there and do it so these trucks they have like some sort of special suspension on them where each wheel is kind of independent and they have a lot of wheel travel so they can hit these big crazy bumps and it still kind of keeps the thing fairly levels that that's the idea behind it absolutely got a great analogy there either the front suspensions a arm independent the rear is actually straight axle but with you know shocks that are four and a half inches in diameter coil springs that are 5 inches in diameter the trucks they work really really well over the bumps they're amazing when you watch them in video you see the wheels just flopping around like they're just just super loose and it's incredible thing that that's absolutely amazing yeah they have um I know dodge makes a truck that's just like a purpose-built off-road truck that that they sell for like civilians Ford for well you know Ford makes the Raptor right dodge makes an even more hardcore version of it for the RAM you guys are shaking none other that's be afforded people know we just know the truck industry and both Rob and I were in the early stage of develop at the Raptor I racer Raptor no wait Rob was an early development of the other Raptor testing and we just had that conversation about tests in Borrego we we know the truck market pretty well Dodge has nothing they've tried to duplicate it is what they've done there's there something called a ram ram yeah exactly there's Jamie pull up the video Dodd Raptor vs. Ram runner head-to-head this is what I'm referring to I saw a video online that was have you driven one yet no I've driven the Raptor a lot and there incredible vehicle and I know they're pretty cool you could buy them like yeah absolutely I mean it's it's amazing to be able to go to the the Ford dealer and and get a truck that is capable of doing what the Ford Raptor is I'm blowing away I've been in the offered industry for a long time and it's absolutely incredible with the what the rapper can do yeah our neighbor has one of these things uses it to go get groceries see that's the the difference between them is that the Raptor apparently I watched the video the Raptor is more comfortable driving around you could actually use it as a regular car where's the RAM runner is much more like you know one of these things something that you really wouldn't drive on the street yeah the RAM road I don't know what it is I mean it's probably aftermarket or purpose-built by a third party or a second stage manufacturer it's not I mean so it's not like as mainstream as a raptor they run they run and I've talked to them I've been at the planet they run like eight F one 50s and then they throw rapped in their eighth one f-150 put a raptor I mean it's a it's a real production vehicle hi hi number production vehicle that was what my point was gonna be is like this has become this this type of racing has become so popular that it's sort of bleeding over into the commercial market the the regular domesticated human beings are buying these trucks that they could just drive out into the desert and go fucking go crazy and hit bumps with yeah you used to see we called you know the flat billers you know mimicking the off-road truck buying a range or putting fiberglass fenders on it raising it up lowering it and I think you know Ford Motor Company saw that it's like hey we should build something that you can just buy right off the lot and and they did that I think 2008 but and I both went to got invited go to out do some testing with the Raptor and and blown away by it and then they came on the show room and you're capable buying those things for you know under $50,000 it's an incredible vehicle yeah they're fast as shit too right yeah six to the 6-2 is really fast and motor and motor is incredible I beat the crap out of it in our race did a hundred and 305 across the diablo lake bed it's an amazing motor that's a stock motor that's not even pumped up my trophy trucks got 900 horsepower that's why we can do for 140 suspect 900-horsepower yeah they're there now they're there they probably way full of gas 105 gallons of gas gets about two miles a gallon 900 horsepower 39 five gallons of gas yeah yeah it you don't like driving a bomb in order to get anywhere in order to get anywhere you got to have that much gas because at two miles a gallon you don't get very far it really like it's two miles for the gallon pretty much that's about the average with him driving that is hilarious that's hilarious you have a two mile to the gallon car Wow 900 horsepower it is a bomb it's a bomb it's 900 horsepower a hundred and how many gallons so many 105 gallons Wow that's crazy so how long can that get you like when you it's not always two miles right like when you're on the highway going 60 yeah it'll go up to eight yeah it'll go up to price 600 crazy we try to we try to go anywhere from you know 100 and 100 75 miles to 225 on a tank of gas with 900 horsepower the tires can't go a whole lot farther when you're out there in the desert spinning them and just started tearing the rubber off them and so do you have spares in the back or do you have pit stops to you both both we carry two spare tires on the back but we have two yeah just two but every every you know 175 225 miles we have a full-on fuel pit we pull in there and stop they'll put you know 100 gallons of gas or get it fill back up and change the rear tires on the truck and then if we happen to have a flat in between spots you know they'll they'll react another tire so we pretty much have that plan to race it up and down the Baja Peninsula that's about 1100 mile race will stop every 200 miles if we do these shorter loop races anywhere from 250 to 500 miles or the other races go halfway to tires and fuel and and hit it so but when we did for folks who don't know bud produced he's produced Jesus Christ 100 shows me how many shows you produced produced Overhaulin and rides and rides when we did that Barracuda the the the silver Barracuda that we mean that was what like 2000 four or five or since 2005 yeah so that was like right around the year that you were you were beginning to race yep right around the time and I love I love jujitsu and I love all the stuff that we used to Train to you and this is kind of my new my next new passion I always had to figure out what something new and crazy yeah I'm gonna go to Antarctica I'm gonna climb Mount Everest I'm gonna go do something stupid this is my something stupid it was really just a I had so many TV shows on the air at the time my sponsor was like hey we want to treat you once you go down doing this stupid celebrity race and then I just haven't returned well bud was also for folks who don't know was one of the owners of the king of the cage back in the day and but and I'm mad at you Jitsu we trained it jean-jacques Machado's are both students of John Jaques and you were always involved in a bunch of fucking nutty shit you're always off doing something Looney Tunes but this one man this one stuck like glue this Baja thing boy you would get this look in your eye like a fucking junkie when you would start talking about like a like a crazed crackhead just looking to get that next fix sure with a 900 horsepower car flying around going 140 miles hour over bumps it is nothing like you've ever seen no you you have to like I talked to people like a new a good friend of mine um Andrew Hendricks he raced Seca for years right so he's got him he's got his Mustang he's got an Audi he's racing Seca and the American LeMans Series and they're fast and he's loving it he took one ride in a trophy truck sold his stuff and he's got five trophy trucks now and he's gonna start racing so flat ground got boring flat ground always gets point going around the fucking circle it's stupid it's going around a circle you're going I left left I love that bad for your brain like bouncing up and down I talked to a guy who's an expert in I know it's a lot of shit brain I'm saying my whole life I'm looking at my hole all my choices oh my god it's amazing I I talk for a living what I'm not sure there's anything I don't do it is not bad for my brain but the bouncing around apparently he was telling me that even just jet skiing like or water skiing like getting pulled behind a boat and bouncing up and down he's like that's really bad for your brain like you there's nowhere in nature were you like today's d-day Dunedin each hit water and have your head snap up and down like that he's like in nature it's like what running maybe the occasional jump you jump over things you're avoiding animals that are trying to eat you but you know the human body is an amazing thing right so my very first race I I don't think I could feel my neck or my head for about three days afterwards my neck was so sore and I at the time and I've actually been lot smarter and technologies move they gave me the heaviest oldest crappiest helmet it must have weighed six pounds here put this on and then I was in the car for 36 hours with this helmet on and I thought my head was gonna come off you get a Mike Tyson neck from that yeah so your body workout I do I do when I for training for thing I put a 25 pound plate on my head yeah I'm not kidding I believe you you got it your your body started to evolve and could absorb that and you actually the thing that helps you the most is you is you're almost like a like a drunk driving you just relax do you see both and just fucking relax you always put like Rob and I will go take guys for a ride we do an occasion there over this on the holy shit bar and they're tense and they're so tense and their seatbelts are sucked in stop breathing - yeah and and they suck they're there we actually took a SEAL team guy was on my team in Oh nine but he put his a seatbelt so tight you like start hurting their Clavel your clavicles start crushing down your sternum your sternum starts separating from your chest and I'm not kidding he's like I think my heart hurts I'm like I swear to God am i joking absolutely not my heart hurts I think I hurt my heart I'm like no you just what happens you really you push so much on the clavicle down sucking down and your chest is I'm reading your ribs you're separating the sin of your sternum out so like the area that they cut open when they give you open-heart surgery it starts separating it's College right here I'm like you're not having a heart attack you just come on pussy get on it you know you know I took Josh Barnett did two years ago yeah I know a lot of MMA guys do it doesn't Apple Eric Apple he goes down there a lot no he's been down there a lot he does short court racing for yeah he did short course he does a lot of racing he told me he was involved in some horrible horrible wreck it was bad yeah he did he did a nose did you see I think I'm not like Elsinore he was in that West Coast chill troll yeah it went over and over and over and he uh yeah he uh he got blood in his eye and got all funky he's thank you all sorts are leading yeah head bleeding yeah and he was an ease a novice he's a great friend of mine he's the Navi hasn't raced as much but yeah that was he's another fucking nut right he started out his career do ya motorcycle racing they got into MMA and now another crazy adrenaline junkie yep the the idea behind this is all based on competition and there's one of the things we were talking about like there's very little money in this yeah for its really you know it's a beautiful sport because you don't really have to have a lot of money to get in certain classes and then there's the like the upper echelon clash like Rob's class and there's not and I'll stop talking about that there's not a lot of money into it but I don't think there's much money is in yacht racing I mean there you doll the really big sports are things that are on a bucket list you know there's not a lot of money in climbing I met at Mount Everest it's actually cost you 25 grand if you want to go do it you it's just one of those things you have to go do right it's passion driven I mean we get addicted to it it's like a drug and we end up spending everything that we have to do it the the smaller cars the small classes the the run anywhere from 20 to 50 grand trophy trucks like I Drive their $500,000 go $500,000 truck yep oh my god should pull up a picture one of those what would you look for it trophy trucks no just to rob a can do you have one in your sight yeah yeah yeah Rob MacCachren calm you'll pull it up and you know for me to it's there was there's a mystique around Baja for some reason it's all basically you go the the essence of cool is I guess your Trond is you're trying to figure yourself out in your 20s and your 30s looking you look back at Steve McQueen guys like Steve McQueen and James Garner and all these other cool Paul Newman they all race the race I mean they did this race before and they went down there and they raced they raced I mean McQueen almost won it a couple times really Paul Newman raced it when he was 80 it was 80 I mean these these cool got maybe what killed them yeah poor bastard these cool guys want to go down there and race so there's a cool mystique to it I mean the list of celebrities and people want to go down there and race is just interesting yeah I guess it's a very strange thing that this has become so is that the truck yeah that's okay that's actually image yeah your trophy truck yep that's actually a short course truck there that's I do short course racing - that's a pro - why is there a naked girl next to you did she race with you well I would make racing better absolutely that's a rock star the image always have the ladies in the posters Oh Rockstar Energy Drink not like one of those dudes like I'm a Rox know I'm out there driving around I'm a rockstar now he's the most humble driver left a lot of guys out there I just wanted to let people know who just listening a lot of people watch this more people listen yeah and watch it so the idea behind it came when like what year did this this this race get created from probably in the in the early 60s when hear my version yeah I read once no in 62 I'll tell you exactly the how what happened is 62 in the Honda Motor Company decided they were gonna they're gonna put out two enduro bikes right 1962 Steve McQueen's stunt guy his name's Dave Ekins bud Ekins was his stunt double in a lot of the races and I'll make this short they said how are we gonna test these bike in market to Americans these guys are just racers and idiots and they wanted to go okay we're gonna go we're and swear to god this is what happened they win in 1962 they went to Tijuana they went to Western you know they time stamp a card and they went down a little pause and they time stamped a card no navigation no nothing and it made the Baja Peninsula that was the very first run in the 60s that happened and then all of a sudden so they did a time it's kind of like you know you know the Gumball Rally mm-hmm this is like the Gumball Rally but on dirt with a huge car so they did their rally and then they post at a times like we did that in 35 minutes so then somebody else came back or 35 hours sorry make somebody else came back says okay well we can beat that so they did in 32 hours and if you look at the heritage of people going down there saying I can beat that and then truck started going down there and then cars started going down there and then in 67 there was there was a race 60 67 there's a race to Nora right was the fresh Nora and then an icon my world right Mickey Thompson who's an icon of Motorsports for everything that he's done at land speed and off-road and everything he the guy that drove the rocket car yeah he did it he drove he built land speed records for life yeah he did every he's Mickey Mickey Thompson and the emotive swirls is just a just a genius is I used to kind of a pioneer in a lot of ways he was always like ahead of the game he was always building and pioneering something before its time and Pearlman got together said let's do a race so they they started off in Tijuana and there was a couple hundred guys there there I mean Gardner was in there Steve McQueen wasn't there were guys I'm not kidding who had shoulder pads like football shoulder pads on on a motorcycle drop the flag and they all go Wow Wow so that's what started it all off yeah it's a wild frontier and it's I'm telling you there's there's no rules someone's in your way you honk nicely nicely and if they don't move you move them like you pumped them and I let you run into me with cars yes so humans or cars you're running into humans are you running into cars cars car depends on the day for me it's cars try not to run into humans but you told me that there's a lot of shenanigans that go on with like the locals like the locals know that this event is going to take place a lot of what we talked about we talked about before we went on live on the air but besides the fact that they try to touch the cars like if you see the videos like I don't know how much how much of this stuff can we show we can't play the music is that what it is no you could play all the other ones the other the other videos I sent you there's here's a video right here yes look how wide that fucking thing is it's about 92 inches wide which is about 15 inches wider than a normal truck and there we are going across the try lake about 130 and that's your trophy truck yeah that's a trophy truck that's ba California oh that looks fun it is fun look how close those people get yeah down there in Baja I mean this is the biggest sport that they have and they wait year-round for us to come down there and they they have you know such huge passion for it like I do they at times they want to touch the truck the way you'll go by and you'll see him trying to reach out and grab the truck some of the other things they the shenanigans they do is uh build jumps booby traps we call them and they crash a lot of cars but what they're doing is they want to see the excitement they want to see the truck or the buggy hit the jump and fly through the air and get pictures one thing it's always funny about Mexico is you see that they have the the phone cameras and I think you can piece together your whole race by them with their phone cameras if they all posted it you could pretty much put the whole thousand so I'll put it reflected so if first all the Mexican people are amazing they're amazing to us and it sounds like I'm making excuses for them but they are innocent enough where they just decide like they truly and I had to learn this the hard way I had celebrity in my car and I was driving but that's just a random celebrity no I had actually chip boos I had Chip Foose with me in my car okay and we're driving and I'm doing about 90 just a right random dirt road and I see a bunch of people over here right okay I got a make sure to watch them make sure they're not darting out in front of me and they're let's see some random people will be here with a fire and there's a lot of them and it's it's dusk and they both have fires on side of this road and I'm like this is true was this fucking people doing on side of the road boom and I hit a telephone pole they buried in middle the road right and I went up like this and I'm coming down like at 90 miles an hour I'm like oh fuck this is gonna be terrible luckily the car absorbed it we nerfed in bounced off and kept gone I didn't see the telephone pole because I'm an idiot I'm a newbie and I'm looking at bunch of Mexicans over there a bunch of guys that's really nice of these people coming up to see you so they thought it was cute to set up this booby trap just to watch people try to jump it and go flying through the air well I think you know I think the rednecks would do the same thing if you if you let if you didn't have those fences they Daytona 500 and they could actually you know fix the outcome like we're gonna we're gonna see if Dale junior could jump this car right oh for sure they would do it but that's what it is in Mexico there's no there's no that's there they're able to go wherever they want well and the capabilities of these trucks are pretty extraordinary they're very different than anything that a NASCAR car could do they're not necessary I have a belief because some people throw bottles a show like that but I they're unnecessarily out to kill us or hurt us because actually after they reconcile help us I've had them wreck wreck before in a booby trap and they'll roll the car over to help you fix a car with a welder they'll get help you change a tire and they'll push you're on your way they not only throw bottles but they throw rocks sometimes they thrown snakes in the cab of the truck and grow snakes in the cab of the truck yeah - you know it didn't happen to me but my partner in with Mastercraft racing he was coming in Ensenada coming to finish at night and they Robbie no yeah Robbie Pierce from Mastercraft he got a snake thrown in the cab of the truck holy thankfully he stopped me because I don't really what kind of snake I don't I don't know I know poisonous or non poisonous who cares if you're driving 80 miles an hour to snake its own you looked out it could be it Mazel via a Cobra that's a really hard call you put in your teeth you just pull over and get the fuck out of the car so was technology developed specifically for this race to figure out how to drive fast and hit those bumps cuz this all I mean I'm fairly ignorant I mean I kind of understand suspensions I kind of see but but it's pretty obvious when I look at your trophy truck there's some extraordinary equipment on that yeah absolutely it's developed over the years you know like when it when bud was telling the story earlier about but it started in the 60s they were taking stock trucks down there put a little bit bigger tires on them taking the windshields Adam stuff like that see putting some extra seat belts in them and now it's just developed into you know big tall tires that way tire and wheel probably weighs 150 pounds of piece shocks $15,000 per set of shocks for the truck 9 horsepower like I said some of us have automatic tranny some of the manual trannies lights like a baseball stadium of kc lights as a sponsor and runs seven of them on the roof and and seven them on the front bumper and you can see a mile down the road and light up the whole desert and Wow over the years it's you know we keep developing making new things better and it's the whole ego thing you want to be the first one to La Paz and you're constantly thinking about what can you do what can you make what can you build to make it go faster well go ahead no please no I mean then there's an entire industry that was spawned off of this this is a halo right so trophy trucks and Baja racing is a halo for any brand it doesn't really matter what it is we we entertain brands like we said Ford bfgoodrich Casey think if they can go down there conquer Baja GoPro you name the company and they want to go to Baja and they always come to me because I'm I'm the media guy and they're like how do we do this like I don't know I'll hook up with the trophy truck and we'll go beat the shit out of your product and see if it works it's there's an entire industry if you go to SEMA which is that big you know aftermarket parts thing there's an entire industry which is dedicated off-road and the halo of offroad is Baja 1000 racing it's the halo it doesn't really you know how we um when you say it's the halo what do you mean by that yeah it's it's really the pinnacle view if you if you go to racing like NASCAR f1 you know the stuff is developed and then trickles down so there is a pass-through from everything that Rob is complete cuz he complains a lot everything that Rob complained cuz it's not fast enough it's not good enough that's how you get a 900 horsepower rock that goes two miles in the gala he'll talk to his shot comes I hit a shock I hit this bump one time at 85 miles it I felt it and I don't want to feel it I Drive I hit all due respect he drives a fucking pillow I'm a thing drives it's just it drives so when you're going all over those crazy bumps and shit you're fairly level nothing he feels nothing you you you you feel a little bit but it's it's incredible it's it's analogy we have is it's like riding on a marshmallow when you jump in you land it's like just falling like you're landing on a marshmallow and that's the development over all the years and and thankfully I'm in the trophy truck class which is the elite class I've worked my way up from the bottom driven through them all and definitely don't want to go back and thanks the bottom ones like what are they how many classes are there well there's there's there's more than 10 classes there's there's probably six or eight truck classes and there's six or eight buggy classes and there's also motorcycles in eighteen eighty V's all these there ends up being over 20 classes at the Bob 1000 and and they all compete against their own class they all start at their own time together against a clock they don't we're not racing we were racing all together the track at the same time but we're separated by start time so you're really racing the clock you do have traffic you do you have to get by the guys and to get the win I'm so used to bud jumping yeah so when you're when you're driving these things it's very different than the cheaper trucks yeah cheaper because none of them achieved but the different class yeah well the different classes you got entry-level classes exactly yet have your entry-level classes and they're a lot more stock they don't have as much will travel they got eight or ten inches that will travel in the truck smaller tires they're just restricted a lot more and those cars are a lot more difficult they beat you up a lot more they take a lot longer to get down the down the peninsula yeah that's what I was gonna get at so like when you first started out you took much more of a beating yeah absolutely so now like that's that's why you're into these really cushy rides like you've been there done not been there done that I want to work my way up and and get to the top of the sport I've been doing it for thirty years and I've been in the elite class since the mid 90s so this is a good vehicle for the apocalypse except for the fact that he uses so much fuel if you have gun you can get fuel yeah we got a make your own fuel at a certain point I mean you're not running diesel right now see that's the problem you know Neil Young makes his own diesel I think Daryl Hannah makes her own diesel out of vegetable oil and crimp like that yeah well Neil Young apparently has his gigantic farm he has like a thousand plus acre ranch in Northern California and he makes his own biodiesel and runs all his vehicles off of his own gasoline so he's completely totally off the grid they like a conversion on the old Mercedes yeah you can do a conversion on any kind of old car well I'm not even new cars apparently I'm gonna do conversions to biodiesel yeah yeah we have to we have to actually I was gonna run one year I was I was working does that show that picture Jaime would you put up Neil Young 59 Lincoln runs on biodiesel and give me plugged in Wow that's pretty dope I was working on a dealer I was gonna do a truck an all-electric truck down there yeah that's possible I mean the little lithium batteries cuz I was involved with a truck company and then they you know my answer is very stock like how what can we do to market this thing I mean it I don't care what it is it right it could be a minibike my answer is race it we should probably go race it right could you do uh I mean is it feasible that you could have enough battery power to do that sure yeah and the torque could be amazing that's why I want to do a torque on those electric motors are amazing the problems I don't think you would go our pits my pits my pits are about 120 miles apart and that'd be hard to get there yeah my buddy Aubrey has one of those Tesla's right and the pickup is incredible like I was really shocked at how fast those things go like the zero to 60 is like four seconds right it's bananas and it's weird because there's no gears it's just we you is going it's not like I'm very digital it's just it's very much like a spaceship you just you hit the grass completely silent I mean you hear the tires rolling on the rubber or the rubber rolling on the concrete and that's it you don't you don't hear anything it's very strange that be a little bit scary in Baja because the spectators you're there used to hear in the race vehicle come and electrically probably wouldn't hear it coming right if we could play that annoyed we can play that polka music how many you would have to have so many batteries though what I'm thinking is like a Tesla if you go from the beginning fully charged to the end you're getting like 300 miles I think yeah but that's all I would need to do we planned it out to be 120 miles to charge so we do build a carriage underneath which are about seven eight hundred pounds of batteries and then you get to the next pit you have a fully charged set of drop that carriage put that carriage in bolt it back up I'd be in my own class and I could provide them whatever company was at the time it was a company called Phoenix I could provide them with a Baja 1000 win as a marketing camp has some free cert or any of these other country any other companies have ever thought about doing some point Ford is amazing at it because they do use Baja a lot last year I raced a Brant the brand new f-150 the 2015 f-150 which is a twin turbocharged v6 in in the stock class that stock suspension stock everything stock on the car twin turbocharged v6 and we did the raptor together i did the raptor weight he was on the testing and I raced the f-150 last last year and when you race an f-150 how much of it is different than what you would bar off a showroom floor nothing roll cage we had we had a fuel cell roll cage spare tire that one I had I had a radio we had cupholders I remember look at some of the videos as a cup holder in there you can look it up online f-150 reached the Baja 1000 there's me and you're gonna laugh at me that's it right there that seems pretty different no that's different fencers that's know you'll see why it's the 2012 bond and they pissed me off because I told them they did this to make me mad they have they made me wear a white driving suit folks you don't know bud wears but you're you're the weirdest fucking dude I've ever met when it comes to clothes you go over Bud's house he's got all black pants all black shirts is whole fucking wardrobe his entire closet is black shirts black pants black t-shirts black underwear I'm assuming yeah black socks black socks black sneakers yep he just doesn't want to think about colors no so when they hit you with some white did you wear it or did you just get a marker and sharp I was up I was pretty up I didn't have to get in the car at the beginning and I'm in the rain was a the weather was pretty cold so I had a black slicker I put on the top so it rained on you and you rolled around the dirt and you white driver's seat I've been trying to get bud high for so long to get him to smoke pot and I'm like the first thing you do is throw away those fucking black clothes you're gonna go got all these pretty colors I could choose just let me get a start wearing pastels you'll start enjoying different colors start realizing how ridiculous we turn to Andy Dick and you can wear pastels it's not Andy I'm saying you have appreciation for other colors no no I think if I smoke pot which I'm not going to be more into the dark lord world and I'll have it maybe skulls on my t-shirts wow you get darker yeah okay now when you drive an f-150 do you use like regular tires like you take tires that are right off of a showroom floor yeah these do we had the new BF Goodrich ko2 is that we raced on this on this truck normally invention regular f150 suspension stock dude we went hunting at Tejon ranch up in northern like it's near Bakersfield or TV right you did that no no no this was a recent one went wild pig hunting to hone ranches this huge ranch it's 1 million seven hundred thousand acres biggest ranch in California huge place and this guy Cody who was one of the guides there one of hunting guides drove us all around an f-150 and I mean talking horrific terrain and this fucking thing is driving over rocks and and I was so impressed I was like this is like one of the best commercials for an f-150 you could ever get just go under like if you're thinking about buying one of these things what's an f-150 capable of go fucking drive around to hone ranch for a couple of days and one of these things and and think if you would want to do this on anything else this is this is what I oh that's their Raptor that Rob Rob and I were involved the development of so that's a that's a custom Raptor that's not like yeah that we race that in class eight and we we built it out but it that one still had the stock motor yeah stock motor stock - we did have just we do have custom suspension on it actually that's what caused me to race the f-150 last year is they go okay well we built the raptor a little bit and you know people start chatting now online like oh that wasn't really stock so they made us race a stock car oh so just not even a raptor just a regular f-150 regular f-150 regular now did you bottom out at all with that that's probably an understatement yeah yeah you don't bottom out with your truck we do but we're going you know three times as fast as the stock trike so it bottoms out you don't feel it quite as bad it doesn't do this much damage so the bottom of your f-150 was completely stock as well no no plates or anything we had it no we did we had a um we definitely had a skid plate underneath of the front under them to protect the motor underneath yeah because we bought them down a lot that's what you see in the front of the Raptor that front piece that skips down out that's a skid plate so you just installed something along those lines yep that's it yep Wow and then after we raced it and then the car was in such good shape but I can even believe because this year was what last year's race is Baja yeah it's a tooth out you'll see it and we put it up on line the Ford f-150 new f-150 races conquers ball they this was a tough at the 2012 2013 sorry was the single toughest Baja thousand I've ever seen I want yeah I don't know Roger Norman who owns score decided it was his first Baja 1000 course this is my opinion I'll let Rob talk it was his first Baja 1000 he wanted to make a statement he's a former racer he wanted to make it the worst fucking course you ever ever could drive and it was tough it was hard and slow and fast gnarly and then how did they change it he just marks the course she go to this is the f-150 yes that's a stock f-150 with just the lights on it yep Wow that's you driving that thing yep I had the blue helmet sitting in mine it's a great f-150 fuckin commercial I mean Ford's really smart doing this I'm fucking never thought about racing in my life and now I'm thinking god I gotta do this go with Rob right if next time here's the way to go hello go straight to the top trophy truck and come here in Vegas he lives in Vegas next time you're in Vegas he'll take you out the Primm go for a ride you'll shit yourself I'm there in May I'm there in May for the UFC incontinent you'll become tell you what we'll make a deal I'll get you UFC tickets you take me for a fucking beat ride in the desert we're in I would love that amber would love to go - yeah all right beautiful it's good event - it's a TJ Dillashaw versus Hannon Burrell should be fun now you guys have been involved in this for a long time how much is the popularity increased over the last few years because it seems like there's a lot of exposure like I'm hearing about it all the time maybe I'm hearing about it just because I'm friends with bud but I mean I'm seeing it online I'm seeing like a lot of these crazy like Ram runner type trucks are being built yeah popular it's it's you know I've known for 32 years and it's it's increased buds definitely helping out a lot with score this year you know with television production getting us out there on TV putting very good shows together I think here at the end April in April 20th yeah we did it we just did a deal with CBS you know I just I told this great story that I won I won my race in 2012 in my class and then Roger norm and who's the new owner came up to me and swear to god he's like well now you're a champion you can produce TV for me was what he said to me it's like great and I I get too happy because you know you know me as I do I do TV I do all my stuff so now I get to kind of merge and I always seem to this merge of my two hobbies together when I was doing jujitsu we had king of the cage right right right I gotta have a reason and a really a television vehicle to do something because then I get to be kind of be cool and sport well you're kind of a workaholic and it's it helps you when you're doing jujitsu well you know hey I need to know what the fuck's going on when I'm watching fights right so it's so it's a way to sort of make a hobby a part of your job but you do my immersion style like Rob will tell you like I've raced for 10 years and now I'm producing a TV there's not much I haven't done their experience down there not like Rob has but he I know the racers feel comfortable just like you know when you're commentating a fight the fighters feel comfortable that you you're commentating God you know what the fuck they're doing the setups I know what they're doing in the car I've been on the course right and right and not not not in the super trucks but I've been down there going I know that course I know what he's doing this is what happens that's a booby trap some we're editing the show I could to bring my experience into it yeah that's got to help a lot for for the riders for the drivers yeah absolutely he has much more more passion than I do just just riding around with him today and listen him talk about all the stuff and how jacked up he gets when he watches the videos and stuff he's like a kid in a candy store and yeah buds fucking chill rides is what got me - I've never thought about buying a classic car but I watched his show rides I'm like goddamn I want to kill one of those that looks fucking cool I think the shows coming back rides is coming back it should come back do you have a price right back there you could put two more cars there's space I got a little Raj you can put two come on I'm thinking of expanding thinking getting a bigger place I could put a archery range in there's where there's an archery range here whether you know it or not there's targets in the back and there's a straight shot 28 yards from the front door it's the back you got a tag the werewolf you know I've accomplished well my new thing is hunting and I've been doing that the last couple years I'm fucking bananas about that the way you're bananas about racing so I'm trying to incorporate that into my life we do that - yeah kill animals on the racecourse every once in a while yeah but I don't think that's hunting oh that's just livestock getting on the racecourse yeah back to uh the course getting tougher how did they make the course tougher Roger looks at the maps tries to figure out the roughest worse spots on the whole bar Peninsula and then tries to mark the course so it goes through all that he wanted to make a statement he wanted to make Baja tougher than ever and he did it last 2013 it was a loop race from Ensenada to Ensenada it wasn't a peninsula run but he went to all the worst parts of Baja and had us run through it so they changed the actual place you go to so there's no benefit oh every year every year every year the course gets different yeah absolutely every year it's different maybe runs the opposite direction just different different areas because that becomes a big issue with like say like the nurburgring which is the benchmark that they use to test performance cars the the issue becomes when guys have raced the Nurburgring so many times they know exactly when to slow down exactly when to speed up and that has a big effect on those Nurburgring times because you know everyone's chasing that 7-minute time around the Nurburgring and now sub 7-minute in that Porsche 918 they've managed to go sub 7 minutes which is fucking insane but a lot of that is those guys knowing that course absolutely they don't have that know our stuff changes every time it's different even loop races every time you come around there's already been a hundred other cars that have been there since you hadn't completely different silt beds rocks are moved so that's part of the thing that's so interesting about our sport is never the same well it's interesting is it's also the mayhem starts with the organizer so I want to put in perspective for it so you know what a Tough Mudder is right I've heard the expression so a Tough Mudder of those you know those races they put through obstacle courses and through mud holes and you're gonna take over here to climb up a wall and go through fire and crawl through barbed wire fences this is like a Tough Mudder our organizer which is Roger and some of the guys who marked the course they want they they it start the mayhem starts with them because they'll put us through shit and they know we're gonna get stuck or they'll go if he's not paying attention he's gonna hit that rock he's gonna go flippin off the edge and that'll be great these guys are sadistic pricks so they're saying yes I'm gonna set up a rock there to make sure we're gonna set up the course by rock so if you don't pay attention you're gonna go flying off the edge of a cliff yes and I've been I'm not kidding sometimes we'll be it's really weird you'll be reading the terrain to reading the terrain you'll come up over this rise and there's a left-hand turn and if you don't pay attention you're off oh Jesus Christ that starts with this sadistic pricks that are down there marking the course am I wrong no absolutely right well you told me once that you were driving and you came upon a wreck and a guy had his bone sticking through his leg guy broke his leg right and you it flipped off the side of a cliff and you had to get down there and locals were starting to creep in and it got real sketchy no no that wasn't that wasn't you're mixing two story yeah the Josh Barnett story and then our we had my team in o-72 BF kedusha most haven't had one of the worst wrecks in the planet everybody thought the two drivers were dead and I had to go in and get them and this is part of again this is an adventure race it's not car racing this is an adventure race and what happened in ours this is they are our BC car went off the cliff at San Xavier and two guys like us you say he went off the cliff at son Xavier it's fucking crazy cuz it's far 300 feet huh and there are sections on the course where they're inverted where it's like this and you just hit luckily the car dropped 300 feet rolled seven times 300 feet destroyed the car and I didn't know because I went we were just talking about it I went I was down in Loretto we went down a little pause and I got a call to go back to Loretto cuz our cars in trouble and we can't find the car and I didn't know where he's at and then the guys in the car call my wife two o'clock in the morning that's my kid they call my wife on the satphone even though I know and they sound all fucked up there like us bud there inators like what the fuck so she calls me on my sad phone goes like somebody just called here from the house I'm like alright where would they say they were there I think no they just hung up so now our car is off the course we know it's not moving because we can track it we don't know where they're at we could kind of tell where that where they were the last time so I did this again this is an adventurous and Rob's got 7 million of these stories I'll tell you one stupid story and then I'll shut up because I've been talking too much you keep saying I'm gonna shut up you better stop don't shut up I'm supposed to shut up you're supposed to be here doing a podcast but not on me i self-deprecating you fuck I'm just sad I see my friend tell you goddamn story alright so we zhis we're racing and I remember it was Kenny Bartram I there's two guys in the car there was tracy Jordan who's a rock crawler king of the hammers guy and Kenny Bartram Kenny Barnes was just you know famous guy who cowboy Kenny does he does nuclear cowboy stuff and he's an FMX guys a motor sorry motocross guy so I told my guys to get in the car san javier is very de just settle yourself down get you son Xavier and then you can haul ass you know down to La Paz no problem 13 miles from the pit 13 miles for the pit is straight down and he knows I'm not lying it's up a twisty road yeah and there's cliffs on one side you're on the side of the mountain for 13 miles when there's clip on the side or real tight twisty stuff don't make a mistake and let me tell you why because 200 years ago some priests this is actually true 200 years ago some priests on a donkey they used to what they used to do with emissions they used to be two days missions used to be two days apart they'd set a mission here and then him and a donkey and somebody else would go up a road and when after the second day they'd land and they'd build another mission right there and then two days later they do it so up this hill this donkey trail going up this hill this guy and I talked to him I had Thanksgiving dinner with him he hung a wheel off it off the corner it said oh shit hold on six times he counted the revolutions going over and over and all of a sudden there was nothing and then they hit and the co-driver was knocked out he had a compression bruise from his helmet compression B was like his helmet got hit and then put a bruise on his skull from the from the roll cage so I had so my story is I get to Loretto and nobody's there we were sold before behind there was no pit there's no support and there's one guy picking up cans I'm in my race suit I studied jiu-jitsu I'm a badass right okay so like I go up to this guy and I look at him and he's an older guys in his 60s I really didn't feel like talking I just said give me your keys he looked at me excuse me I said give me your keys I have an injured driver I need your truck so he reaches this puck I was gonna beat his ass I didn't care I was gonna take his drug gonna take his truck I have an injured driver on the course so why wouldn't you just ask him to help you with adrenaline see and I was tired Anik you stay up for three days and go ask some guy for I'm not staying up for three days you stay up for 36 hours in they go excuse me sir can I'm not English so you give me your keys I said give me your keys you lucky didn't get shot yeah that's true so he reaches in his pocket and he hands oh and he goes can I go with you I'm like sure get in so I grab his I grab his truck and it was a stock Toyota truck and we go down this riverbed I did that the riverbed which is terrible but it took me two hours to go 13 miles and the stock Toyota truck a little tiny itty bit like a mini truck and we got to Sam Xavier went up search inform stopping every time that there was a crest every time that I thought momentum could take a driver off we job search couldn't find him so two hours we finally found them it was still night well it was in my still night I found him and my co-driver got had a concussion he's vomiting he's peeing he peeing pissing himself he smelled like shit got picked up my two drivers went down there and they the scavengers who rode he started taking wheels off the car GPS anything you can get off the car we're already doing that while the guys were inside the car guys were already there he got off the top of it out of the gully and they were already down there picking so I went back down there to get my Sat phone and get my other stuff and I'm like fuck away I'm shooting the Mexicans away that are already picking this car apart Wow and so I get Tracy back in the car and this is these are stories these happen every that's why it's an adventure race I'm not like I went to the drag strip and it did nine seconds right I got Tracy back in the car two and a half hours back and we stopped because he had the vomit every every like every 15 minutes I hold on and he's long he's got a concussion bad concussion so we get him back he's okay we get him in Loretto as I'm getting my um we were in Loretto we got him down a little pause and by that time it was seven eight o'clock in the morning taken to the emergency room probably not advisable but took an emergency room I told that like yeah I told the doctor in Spanish that he heard his dick and he's got to check his dick take your pants off shaking his pants Tracy Georgia swear to god he's looking at me like why I told him you hurt your day so how many people have died doing this race there's every every year so there's there's probably probably one motorcycle or biggest thing is there's accidents on the highway it's not actually the race cars that happened but uh because the race starts in Ensenada it goes all the way to LA pause we race all the way through the day through the night into the next day and usually a lot of the accidents happened there on the highway with the spectator traffic or the chase traffic race race cars not too often not too often motorcycle guys get hurt a lot I mean Josh Barnett hit a motorcycle guy in in 13/12/2012 even a motorcycle guy but what happened was that well I did you know it's funny monster energy called me and they said they wanted to do I know any um any athletes any athletes or superstars that want to come down a race because they were out yes I called Josh I know he's a he's the ultimate gearhead and to gearheads if you say hey you want to come race he two weeks notice never raced off row in his life I had him in a car comes down there to like the next week I put in my we do some training down down a sterile Beach show him how to work at the car and Nate thing he's in a race poor fucker he's like a nineteen he was nineteen hour he went I took him nineteen hours you'd like the first stent like three it's like three hundred miles he's going through a silt bed there's a motorcycle guy Clips him and breaks his leg now Josh did one of the most amazing things I'm not saying that Rob wouldn't do this so Josh Burnett who he is no youngest ever UFC heavyweight champion super great guy super Greg I had him on the podcast he's probably one of the best podcast guests excuse me one of the best podcast guests I've ever had he's super intelligent guy yeah he's so smart heavyweight fighter amazing amazing grappler amazing fighter and he loves cars he has a Shelby he's got he's got all kinds of cars he's a fucking nut so he goes down there into a silk a silk bed and he wanted he wants to get around it but you don't only have control in the silk bed you can hit it sometimes you need a rut and it throws you right a little bit he hit this guy and broke his leg compound fractured his leg so he gets through the silk bed and not a lot of guys that do this by the way I'm just telling you it's just like for the first time being down there so he and he feels like shit he'll tell you the story but he pulls off to the side of the course goes in the silk bed which is dangerous by the way pulls the guy mortise important that guy's motorcycle out so no other cars hit it and then picks the guy up walks him out and puts him on the hood of his car calls in waits for a helicopter to come helicopter comes Josh carries this guy with a compound fractured leg into the helicopter drops him a helicopter then puts his helmet back on it continues his race and then he rolled it roll this truck after all that yeah there's Josh oh yeah that's the rest of the picture right there that's it that's his buggy Monster Energy truck Wow so so you were talking about the dude who raced on flat surfaces and then just gave it up and started doing only this kind of dirt crazy shit there's not a lot of these courses though right it's like you could go there's a lot of race courses around the country where the average person can do and do you know a track day and put on a helmet and drive fast around a course how many courses are there like this where a guy can just throw out and it's unlimited Baja there's there's roads everywhere go down there and and practice a run or play you'd have to go to Mexico to do it ah there's there's some stuff in the in the States well there's a lot of races by the way yeah I mean he does short course you can you can you can grip in a pro 2 Pro for pretty easy and you go short court racing and then long there's um there's two organizations there's obviously score and there's a couple other organizations that do them you know the mint the mint 400 which rob races in best in the desert rob races and I've done some stuff in the in Arizona Nevada you there's a lot of race so there are a few courses are there courses or is it just organizations we build courses they're all every off-road race is unique ok so now like what if save someone's listening to this and no like you know what I need some goddamn adventure in my life best thing to do is look up score score schedules score goat score score on out of strip club in knots wherever it is I don't know anything about those places score international yeah score and national looked up on the internet look of schedule find out where the races are go check one out there's a lot of other racing organizations that race all over you know the western United States there's almost off-road race just about every weekend somewhere somewhere in the western US you can and for some folks they just go quote-unquote off-roading so they just get a truck and find a spot where they are a lot of Drive and just go nutty yeah that's nuts those are Jeep adventure guys the guys go like moab and they go real slow and crawling look i made it up the rock dude I could walk quicker than that you stupid fuck yeah what's in your truck that you need to get up to the top of the rock with it you know that doesn't make any sense to me no yeah I don't get the rock crawling this is slow speed is it's pretty incredible I did a rock crawling as actually Rock race so with the Rockies well there's different things rock crawling is one thing racing slow and then racing slow but it's it's pretty wild that when they do the it's I think it's the events called keying the Hammers and you climb up some rocks that you can't even climb with your hands but you get in this modified unlimited vehicle like very expensive on top it's same but even bigger tires and we have and they just go right up it like you're like you're actually crawling a little you can't crawl you can't climb it now you can't climb it with your your your you can't it's very hard for you to climb it as a human being but this car will pull up to it or this truck kind of like a Jeep but it's highly modified it's it's difference between like a stock Ford f-150 and a trophy truck it's like the stock Jeep and an unlimited I think they call them ultra fours yeah and they're they're incredible what they'll do they'll go up incredible rock climbing events straight faces you'll see some of the internet stuff it is fascinating it's crazy but it is slow it's racing slow well I guarantee you somebody could climb with those free climber dude yeah like those Alex Arnold guys that go up the you know they go up things that aren't even flat they're like leaning towards he said you couldn't climb it I could climb it test me bud I'll fucking climb right now bitch the the the the industry like must be like it must be a huge thing like building all these different things and be people must be getting involved in this recreationally and building these like trucks and taking the regular trucks and adding all this stuff to it and it's just like how riding I mean you have you have a geyser right yeah there's there's the guys of brothers build trophy trucks Jim Coe builds trophy trucks there's probably there's probably five or six builders that do trophy trucks and then you have all your your guys that work out of their own shop smaller building their own stuff so that's you know but alluded earlier there's really no rules trophy trucks the rules are it can't fly you could have a minute suspension it has to have a body like a truck body which is fiberglass and it can't fly it has to stay on the ground so it's it's a unique thing you can pretty much brainstorm with whatever you can to try to go out there and beat your competition well that's what's innovative about the sport with you when you give guys unlimited horsepower limit of this do anything you want actually there is one I'll tell you that I saw then you'll remember this story really well there's actually only one rule that I know of actually but you you get to you get especially in competition you get to breed the best of the human mind because he's trying to beat this other guy I'm gonna kick his ass so here's the one rule Oh 807 I think is oh seven right there's guy named Brian Collins mmm swear to god this happened they took a fueling system off an Apache helicopter right stuck it off the back of their truck and they had a fuelling truck that would walk up to it while they're moving and jam it in the back of it and refuel it why they're moving and finally score it was that oh seven oh eight when was it I think was Mark Miller and Ryan are CRO holy and they did it on the highway they they they developed a system on a regular chase truck that was following the race truck down the highway and the fuel was in the bed of the chase truck and they had a pressurized system if they pulled up why they're going 60 miles an hour down the highway they pulled up behind the race truck and it had like a like a nozzle out the front of it and they stabbed it into the nozzle that was on the trace truck and they filled it Jesus Christ yeah so they could save four minutes they could save two or three minutes in the pen not even supposed to smoke when you're at a gas station I think that's rules like no boy no more fuelling way going am I supposed to use your cell phone while you're at a gas station because very rarely a spark an electronic spark can ignite fumes and you can burst into flames like that's happened before yeah any fucking crazy are you at 60 miles an hour filling their car up on the highway I remember watch I was with the herps team that year I forgot what it was at a Hertz yeah herps like herpes no terrible herbes like in Vegas the herps gas stations the herps hotel I don't know what that is no they're pretty big yeah the herps hotels right on paradise that's a terrible place to go and stay sorry for the people who own it just the nothing don't be sorry for the name yeah we're gonna stay at the herbes good luck I got they got the herps yeah I got to the herps shit you gonna be okay did you take your medication use some antibacterial soap all right you know I was with them well say I won't say their name again I was with them and we saw that and we're like we're all kind of like that's pretty cool and that do they win that year yeah they did won that year because yeah well there's more to it than just that but how many minutes you think that's saved throughout the thousand mile race probably 10 minutes instead of stopping in the pit and that matters absolutely now no one's sleeping you guys are just driving yeah everybody in the race truck they're driving the whole way some people solo they drive the whole thousand mile race without getting out of the truck drive the whole way I've done that in the past do you have a diaper on god they have these catheters oh all right this kid there's a tube in your dick the only hobby is way out of control oh can you that's not a tube in your section is a catheter right my favorite things I like I like I really Kevin you big no it's not what it is but it's the best thing that's ever happened for offroad for me it is amazing it goes over the top like a like oh like a condom right and then a rubber hose connected to the end of that that goes all the way down the inside your leg and you tape the end of the hose to the side of your shoe so you can pin your shoe so no next to you shoot it's the best I know it's in the truck somebody just peeing some people have done that though they don't get the tube out of their shoe before generation and they're actually find out their pee and that's another great story Ivan Stewart who's a let's hang your foot out the window and I use peanut oil if we don't have carpet it's all metal aluminum down there there's a hole in the floor I just yeah that is there's there's leaks there's little panels and stuff and so you just pee on the floor and just hope it goes away somewhere yeah it does it does well the best thing is you pulled in the pits you start peeing you tell your mechanic like I think I got a leak and he's down there sniffing it yeah that's a great that story right there's happened multiple times and the the one I was gonna tell you about Ivan Stewart's an icon of the sport was that the start line and warming his truck up he's just about ready to go off the start line and all sudden underneath his truck there's there's liquid in one of his mechanics jumps underneath her like holy shit what does that goes touches his finger and it comes up smells it and realizes what it is that Ivan's actually taking a piss didn't mean to ruin your snow but it for your listeners by the way get a catheter go online get a race catheter the best things like I'm like Anna bar I did a race or a UFC fight or UFC fight I did I did this have to miss anything yeah but then you get a pee on the ground yeah you pee in the bar near dry it's fine I was I would of this blue water I was at this blue water race in Arizona one time I think it was with Greg Fouts and we got our ass kicked we're just putting around we got stuck a couple time in a stock full so we actually got to the bar and we felt like a dick by the way and I had my race suit on we came in so late but the bar is going everybody's there and they're having a celebration I just kept my catheter on instead of and so I'm just sitting at the bar I'm like getting next to somebody to start peeing okay and you're done you don't think and you just pee on the ground the bar yeah you solve a bitch I can't believe you think that's funny how dare you what about the person that owns that bar you just peeing in their establishment somebody has to buy the beer bring it there somebody has to pay to be put the refrigerator in and turn it on don't feel so 8 bucks 8 bucks don't buy it that's what it looks like black hat yeah that's one of the brands right there Wow dad that is ridiculous when you're in a sport when you have to have a hose taped over your dick maybe there's a problem with that sport you don't rob you don't drink coffee no never never when I was a kid my mom dad drink coffee I couldn't stand the smell probably got to early 20s or so realized I've never had it and said you know what I'm gonna do without for for my life so I'm a soda guy so you drink soda yeah that's that is my fix in the morning so is that what you get your caffeine from I mean like when you're doing a 33 hour run like you must do some form of stimulant stay awake no ah it the the adrenaline that gets going in you when you're winning the race mm-hmm you know you get you get into the night you typically are ball 1,000 starts at 10 o'clock and you'll finish at 2:00 3:00 in the morning for me if we're doing well about midnight when you start to get tired usually realize you're and shit you got a chance to win this race and the adrenaline kicks in and takes you right to the finish it's when you're having a bad day lots of troubles and you're pulling a 36 hour event that and you're not capable winning the race the Drennen goes away and then you need to throw some sodas down to keep it going or or some energy drinks yeah I would think that that would get really sketchy when you're dealing with like these crazy times where you really have to be paying attention and you've been up for 25 hours that must be that or the real danger lies now yeah absolutely that's you know most likely buds earlier story with candy Bartram and and tracy Jordan when they went off the cliff I mean they just got in the car but I believe they were in the car earlier that same day right so they the Bob peninsula the race course a thousand miles the highways eight hundred miles most likely they got up in the morning in Ensenada did couple stints in the race car got out but they were traveling down the racecourse down the highway and when they got back in it it was early hours of the morning and and dusty maybe foggy and you can remember that every turn could end your race maybe maybe in your life if you're if you're going too fast but every turn so for me because obviously you can tell I have an issue with paying attention i I think I can't think of anything else and that's why I always equate it to Cagefighting if you get in the cage you start thinking about your bills and your cheque and you know they got this happened in my way all the bullshit you're gonna get your ass kicked right same thing down here the only thing you have to really worry about is you're looking at brush you're looking at dust you're looking at power lines looking at all that you're reading the terrain and that's all that consumes your mind because you don't you're fucked yeah that's a thing that people need right like I find that I gravitate towards things that require my full complete attention in the moment whether it's going to the rifle range and shooting a rifle you know I got I took my friend Duncan and Chris yesterday we went to the rifle range and it's one of the things that Duncan was saying like when you're shooting you don't think about anything else like the moment you're pulling that trigger your mind is free of all the other nonsense you got going on your life your mind is just concentrating on keeping the reticle keeping that crosshair on that target calming your nerves and then squeezing that trigger and not moving anything else what is it about us that we need things like that is it the over complex society that we live in I think so I think you know there's with my business your business and all elevating we're doing there's text messages and there's fucking Facebook and Twitter and you got to all this bullshit and there's so much stuff in there and the thing that I think it's different much different than rifles there's consequences of what we do because if we don't if you miss the shot oh ho hum I missed the shot I'm not running down rifle you don't shoot me but yeah but and what we do if you and I've done it before I've like you kind of get into a wall like driving in a snowstorm you see the snowstorm coming out you kind of get Drive you kind of drive yourself to a little bit of sleep mmm turn comes up you're gonna go off a cliff you're gonna wreck your someone's gonna hit you from behind you you know it the the worst it's death the very easiest as you broke your car and you got to get us out there and fix it and you just let your team down there are teams he's got 60 70 people there on his team and then they all worked really hard to get him down there and that pressures on him not to fuck up but isn't a weird we as human beings have this strange desire to chase danger like that there like that that managing danger becomes sort of like a drug fix we're getting well you're a lot deeper human being than I am but this is this goes back to you know primal human we used to go on hunts all right guys we used to go on hunts we used to like you stay here I'm gonna go on a hunt I'm gonna chase bear I'm gonna kill the Buffalo I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to war I'm gonna do these things and yeah I don't know what it is you get to a certain part of your life and you got to start chasing that you have to have it like I don't need to race I'd have to race well I think there's certain human reward systems that are set up in our minds and essentially in our DNA and that we don't fulfill them at all with the average the average everyday cubicle life traffic cubicle come home television the news bombards you with fucking nonsense from all around the world and then you go to sleep and start all over again and you're missing a lot of shit and then something comes along like this race where like you know you fucking jump it around this crazy fucking truck you're going 140 miles an hour and your body's like finally something's happening yeah yeah for me absolutely I am when I'm not racing last year I raced 35 weekends I raced it took the green flag fucking but most of the year yeah I raced I think I took the green flag over 80 times and I mean every time basically I started a race I started a race they threw a green flag so I raced over 80 times okay last year in 35 weekends some of these times I take for green flags actually one weekend last year I took seven green flags over the weekend racing in three different trucks discussed her there's multiple classes and the short course races there's multiple classes so I'm addicted it so much I go get in any vehicle I can go race so I raced seven times but when there's when there's when I have a weekend off I don't know what to do with myself so I think I need that adrenaline rush I need to race I need to get a checkered flag I need to win that's it's really what my life is a passionate because the heart of yeah here's me system absolutely and but you've been you've been chasing stuff like that all as long as I've known you you're always like trying to do some crazy like charged-up thing you build your character I think he's a guy you build to help you build your character and I'm I'm addicted to drugs my drug is at Dorf ins and an adrenaline and I have to have that hmm I think it was um I forgot who said it we might have been Reese Malin or someone like that but they said in in normal life the other guy in the cubicle sit in New York City he may have like one close call on in his whole entire life or maybe one a year down in Mexico you have nine or ten in a race yeah I mean you are close to death a few times I mean holy shit oh fuck I'm glad that didn't happen and you do that for over and over and it's it's it's scary for you know definitely I've you know I've said I did a movie in the Raptor I don't know it if you saw it no I never saw that what you do you did that like you you produced a film about the Ford Raptor like right when it was coming out it was the launch of the launch of that was a launch in what year was that oh eight and my wife and there was two movies back to back I did and there was one time we got stuck all I guess and I got stuck you remember the scene and I I took a touch at oast wrap pull data to the front of the thing walked across and hooked it to my friend's truck and a some idiot in the trophy truck mm-hmm wasn't me ran over my strap like right where I was whoa I mean it cuz you know what you're in this blinding silk bed I don't think he didn't try to kill me he's blinding silk bed he knows if he slows down he just sees a hole there's a truck there's a guy I'm gonna go right between fuck that was very close really close so I said that was a scene in our movie my wife is like uh yeah you're not doing that anymore that's quite often she sorry Wow well my wife um one last story this is my wife I in 2012 when I won my race I called my wife I mean it's I'm excited I won one race Rob's run 220 races more than anybody in the planet I won one race I call my wife at five o'clock I said honey we want I could chase it for nine years she said good you can quit and she hung up on me I got I got no play like I can't I want to call my mom I want to call my wife I wanted like hey guess what I did this he's like yeah that's nice you can quit now yeah it's it's hard for some people to relate to that need to be charged up and do nutty things like that right yeah I think so I mean for me it's all about winning champions winning races and I can't get enough of it well so many people try to they try to live their life safe you know they try to do just the opposite they're like looking for the softest cushion to sit on they're looking for the easiest job they're looking for the longest amount of time off they're looking for the this - did the cushiest existence yeah no that's not living that's you got to get out there and experience life you got to live it yeah I agree but I mean there's that there's like these two schools of thought when it comes to people there's people that try to seek out adventure and thrills and have all these wild experiences in their life and there's people that have zero desire to do that see Joe and I have it we have a disease we have like a dinner-party disease that we share like I I I can't talk to those people and I I seek out like I do deep sea dives on shipwrecks and I'll try to go to this not because I think I'm a bad actually because I'm pushing myself I always want to push myself I have to something do something to train for so when I go to talk to people like regular people or people that are boring as shit I sound like an idiot and I had nothing to say to them cuz you you you try to do what we just did here Rob's got a million of them you try to tell him an adventure story in Baja like I hit a jump at 120 and I jumped this or I accidentally hit this guy in a bike and they like they think you're crazy yeah there's certain people that it's just it's too it's too time-consuming trying to explain your motivations behind certain things like I try to think of like what's the least thrilling thing that I do that I could sort of like tell people that I do like what do you woody what'd he do for a living I do have radio show on the Internet like I say that like a leave out the UFC I'll leave out stand-up comedy like I don't want it's just this ain't the bridge between us it's too far there's no there's no room there some folks just they don't want any thrills they want no thrills they want no nothing dangerous they want just everything to be spelled out for them they want you know two weeks paid vacation and they want to make sure that they could retire when they're 65 and they're already ready to die like they've got it all set up you bet you bet yeah yeah so Rob what's it what's the best story for Baja cuz I told my crazy story but you have the but you have better story well you know actually I think I'm Ben honestly fortunate enough when I started going to Baja went with Walker Evans and and people that have tons of experience down there and they kind of help minimize those stories for me you know one of the early days racing class one single buggy single seater only one person in there down there after San Xavier well you're talking about earlier had a flat tire and got out to change that tire and had a you know the motors running in the buggy and and you can't hear anybody around you there's typically snow I thought I was in the middle of nowhere and all of a sudden somebody came up tapped me on the back of the shoulder scared this crap out of me things like that I don't you know crashing I've done multiple crashes all over the place wad and stuff up breaking my collarbone the crazy stories I guess you know I don't have the wild ones the reason why is I think that I you know I go down there prepared I'm there to win you know I try really minimize all that stuff and haven't had a hottest crazy stuff happen did you get involved in other Motorsports first well yeah regular racing first yeah I started racing motorcycles when I was eight nine ten years old Jesus Christ yeah keep racing motorcycles in eight years yeah got got involved in doing that and you know my dad was involved in doing off-road racing in the early 70s when I was on motorcycles and then when I got turned 16 years old we got into racing buggies doing the mint 400 stuff like that and you know I quit my senior year a basketball is the dumbest thing I ever did I should have played it through but I fell in love with off-road racing and then you know just made it made it my hobby there for a few years and then got lucky enough to get picked up by people like Ford Motor Company BF Goodrich tires and I ended up making a career out of it so I'm doing doing this for a living for over 20 years and and like Budd said we've won you know over 200 races on BF Goodrich tires I'm actually about 280 total wins and off-road since 82 over 20 championships and if you had a stop and you had to go and live an office job like if someone came along and BF Goodrich said look we're taking you out of the fucking Heat it's just it's too crazy we're gonna give you a nice cushy job stop cigar your salary nice house yeah at this point I can't even imagine that you know I think about that you know everyone's water what am I gonna do when this is over and and I don't know I don't even know what I'm gonna do but you know hopefully go to work with somebody like BF Goodrich or you know my family owns a buggy shop in Vegas doing stuff like that but um you know I don't plan on quitting anytime soon it's what I know you know it's it's almost uh-oh I know I mean I have it's my hobby it's my job it's my life who's the oldest guy thing to do you were saying it that Newman did it when he was 80 yeah he do eat at a race when he was 80 what a fucking animal he was and I have a man Stewart did it I mean he did until in his sixties yeah was that Walker Evans Larry Ragan some of the best of sport you know had their most success in their their 50s which I haven't got there yet I'm going to calm down yeah it's it's you calm down you did there's a thing in our race in racing called red mist red mist will get you hurt like Jesse James goes down there all the time and he generally wads it up in the first hundred miles by Jesse James cuz he just goes crazy no because people misunderstand the race I mean he knows more about the races I bet they misunderstand the race I think they think in the first hundred miles I got a beat everybody yeah the analogy that I have is they when they put their helmet on they throw their brains out the window and and I did that when I was young crash a lot of stuff ruined ruined cars but over time you learn that's not how you win the race you basically go as slow as you possibly can to win you you have to keep an eye on your competition you go through the pitch get split times find out how you're doing but as long as you're you know you're close to winning the race you're doing a good job when you get down to the end that's typical on you and a couple other guys that are racing for the win all those other 20 thirty guys in your class they're broke or they're having problems how many people are racing like when when they say ready set go how many people fucking 150 on all the classes 150 to 350 depends on which way is like the thousands like 300 or 350 people so yeah so 350 vehicles all together bah how did it how does it set I mean how many lanes are you're dealing with here when they start the race when when they start the race they send one one truck or one buggy at a time usually every 30 seconds apart racing the clock we're out placing on the track at the same time you do have to come up and bump those guys move them out of your way if they're slower than in front of you but um you know we're racing the clock and as you get down the course that the bike start usually the bikes the quads the UTV's they start about three hours in front of the first four-wheel vehicle but we end up catching those guys and that's where it becomes really sketchy and sometimes where these you know bud story earlier when when when Josh at the bike guy because the bikes can't do certain things well some of them can do yes some of them can but a lot of the specially Mexico a lot of the bike guys are sportsmen and when you're doing a long race to like the Baja 1000 it becomes more the bike guys you know they get used up quicker and the the trucks you're sitting in the seat yeah you know you don't have air conditioner but you got you know you can have snacks you can have food you can have water as you're racing down the course the bike guy it's just him in a small light you know I talked earlier about how the lights on my trucks are like a stadium they have one light we have 14 to 20 lights on our trucks that makes a lot different yeah in fact that must be scary driving a motorcycle fast yeah they they think of baseball stadiums behind them some time here at trophy trucks behind him some of the guys the smart ones oh they freak out they look behind of like oh shit and they get off the road and the trophy coats were blown by them cuz they don't want to get run over I mean there's a lot a lot of accidents with the bike guys and their score is doing a lot of things to to mitigate that at this point they're starting them later we just started the night before and stuff like that okay for me there's an interesting thing for me I was gonna tell you like I'm known you know me for a long long time I'm known finally like kind of a crazy jackass that doesn't do this when I'm going down the races you talked about the catheters there's an interesting that happens to me and my psyche I'm wearing a fire suit I have my catheters on I have a fireproof underwear I put my helmet on I got my knife in my pocket so I can cut my seatbelts off anything else happens I start doing all the stuff I'm like holy shit I'm doing something pretty serious and I calm down I have problems with my sponsors who hang out with me and they're like you're you're gonna fucking wreck you're a crazy like whacky idiot who's gonna wreck the car so they don't then they're not managing this craziness well well yeah some people just don't some people just can't like look at all the different variables look at all the craziness and just settle in okay this is what we're doing now yeah some people in it's hard the red mist comes in like it you your son and I've get I get caught up sometimes too because I had a guy pull behind me one time french guy Toby he's gonna kick my ass if I don't move I said we'll stop the car I'll stop the car get out I don't care we'll stop right in the middle of course you're gonna kick my ass fucking French French they gave us these fries and now they got a delta my way or I'll kick your ass that's what he's saying yeah yeah on the radio Mike fuck you out of the way I'll kick your ass yeah and I know what he's doing he's freaking out and he's in this race and you just got to pace yourself you gotta be calm it's hard not to get caught up in the beginning when guys are banging like they're hitting you I don't understand you know some people hit ya hard they mean ramen ramen you try to get you out of the way yeah just they don't even care Dental Hulk you just drive also being rear-ended the 405 at 60 miles an hour you're like holy shit the off-road tracks are one lane it's not like five lanes on the 405 it's one lane so to past that guy you come up there you hope he moves out of the way typically doesn't really want to so you got to come up there and bump them and sometimes people get out of control and they hit you really hard they try to move you off the track especially if it's a jackass like these guys who have actually had a bad day so this is about the problem I have right so they've had a bet I'm having a good day right so I'm in front of my class he's had a bad day in a trophy truck he's got 900 horsepower 105 gallons of fuel he's fucking pissed off he's tired he's not happy anymore and he's trying to make up time and then and there's me and my buggy burner going to want to deal with these slow guys we want to get to the wee get done we want to get to the finish line in in the dust that he's kicking up makes the trophy truck guy pissed off and it's like you don't deserve to be here get out of my way and by the time you get to him you give him a little love a little oh that's the bump that's the bump oh yeah and how many guys get fucked up because of that I mean it seems like that would be one of the reasons why a lot of guys wreck a lot of the cars they're built to take that it's in the DNA of offroad that's that's kind of how we pass you come up there you bump into each other that you like that's your you know your I caught you now you move out of the way let me go by that's what you guys use there chromoly tubing huge chromoly Jamie said so they're designed to take a good impact you know you you would pull the other side exactly like a 19-15 you know if you were in the accident if you're on the 405 if someone hit you that hard you pull over and call the cops yeah and grab your neck and go whoa that was an impact oh yeah part of the game it's part of the game wow that's crazy that it seems so bizarre that just seems so crazy that part of it is just ramming into you why are you going you know X amount of miles an hour right yeah it's not normal it's normal in that world right that world it's normal we're fucking human beings are so crazy in that way we just find normalcy in the fact that well this is what happens when you do this and then all rules all decor all normal rules of behavior go out the window when you're racing in a Baja and you're pissing through your fucking shoe and well I think there's there's a there's a very weird I could do some something in the psyche I can tell you from me one once you've figured this out and you've done the organization and you've gone to your catheter to your knife you got your chase team you got your feel once you've organized the successful race campaign like he has then regular life in business is not that hard right you actually you get out of a race it's like then then actually you sometimes get a little short with stupid people you're like really you just had to go to the store and pick up a six-pack and come back was that that's fucking hard and because what we do there's so many consequences he can tell a guy and this is actually how it goes to is like I need you to go to the P make station which is the gas station go be there at 1:00 o'clock with some extra tires that I may need when I get out and that's what you tell the guy and it's 800 miles away and you don't see that guy until 800 motel you know for 12 hours from there and that guy is sitting there it is logistics crazy and you surround yourself with the people who know have a common goal your logistics are all point out if you need anything down there you know where it's at and you come back to the states and you can't you end like you know some your employees or someone like that can't handle like two simple instructions you're like that guy would die down to Mexico well it's just that the stakes are higher the pressure is higher and everyone's tuned in everyone's tuned in everyone has a goal you want to surround yourself with the people who've been down there to Mexico it's two-lane highways very dangerous there's not streetlights very rarely there's a yellow line dividing the center lane and you got you got to have the right people it's a very dangerous things too legit it is it's a logistics nightmare to plan out a race I always say to people if I if I would spend as much effort that I do off-road racing and putting the team together and the logistics in a regular business I'd have a lot of money instead I raced a trophy truck and I don't have much money oh yeah no this makes ups look like I don't know this is like real logistics yeah but would it be any more exciting I mean you're you a lot of money would it wouldn't be worth it you know like there's a lot of people that have a lot of money that we know they're just miserable as fuck they're all on antidepressants and they're they're always constantly in and out of relationships and their life is a fucking holy wreck of failure and catastrophe but they're financially successful because they're not challenging themselves I think it has to do with challenging yourself yeah I think you're right I think there's something about being uncomfortable that yeah provides you with a certain sense of well-being I don't I don't know what it is but yeah I was hunting in Montana last year and we were talking about employees doing things and this the show meteor has these guys that work for it I mean I don't know what they get paid but I'm sure they don't get paid much and these guys are working 24 hours a day for the six seven days that we're there they're sleeping on the ground it's fucking zero degrees outside they're huddled up and sleeping back they get up before everybody else because they have to start the coffee they have to fire up the the campfire and and you know have a job where someone doesn't want to fucking clean the restroom someone doesn't want to take out the garbage a normal job where you're you show up at 9:00 and you leave at 5:00 and try getting people to work throughout the day for what this guy gets paid to be 24 hours a day in Montana sleeping on the ground freezing their dick off but that's what he's doing like that's what he's doing and in that world in you know he becomes a part of that production like this is what I'm doing now and this guy that you're calling and saying hey you know go 800 miles get some fucking tires meet us there like that's what that guys doing and he's there and he's there yeah and you said I mean when production AG last year I have a group and we did the f-150 thing they called my production guys like you've been around production for a while my guys work for 54 hours straight and they call himself the 54 our crew right cuz they they had that they film this whole special for ESPN and then they were filming my whole special for Ford and they were up for 54 hours not a complaint they didn't like hit me for overtime they're like that was amazing and you just gotta surround you and I don't care about the overtime you guys surround yourself with people like I didn't know my race is gonna be that effing long I mean we just happened to be you know we took 42 hours to do it these guys do it 19 or something like that but you you surround yourself with those people and I was gonna say something about our support staff is you know our chase crews are amazing because we have volunteers like my brother comes out every year it's something my brother and I can do now their chase crews are amazing cuz most of them are volunteers they're gonna come down there they'll drive in dangerous roads they won't sleep at night they'll be up for 36 hours and they eat beef jerky and it's cold as shit and they are always there it's miserable they hate it while it's happening yep but in the end you're you get home you get rested up and you all the great stories come out and you love it you want to go back and do it again yep it's that just that different level of life it's like when you're out there doing the race you're out there doing some wild crazy shit like that it's like everything's elevated you're more tuned in you're more aware of your surroundings you're not inundated by cell phones and text messages and emails they don't even work actually I have why have one phone and maybe a sad phone I don't even return and like I'm gone yeah once you go to Mexico all going to Mexico yep you don't there see when I get home and that's part of it too right part of it too is like the disconnect unplug unplugging and then you know recharging your brain and being out there and that desolate surroundings going 140 miles an hour over bumps what gives you there's another side of the two that gives you appreciation now you know I have I have a kid now but I know my brother says it too you see you're down there you also see the people how they live there are kids amazing kids and they live in chicken coops right the blue chicken coop down by a hose they live in chicken coops and my kidding I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop that's what it is and there's kids and I actually called this is my little story but I there's there's a there's a the kids that never grow up always come out of ojos so there's a little road after you turn down to blue date into blue gate on the right hand side there's a blue chicken coop and it looks like every year for ten years the same kids come out they never get older they don't have shoes they're smiling we hand them stickers I stop them give them I give them candy I talked to him the heat signs autograph you take pictures you go back the next year they look the same age yeah and they and they live job telling you chicken coop I can draw it for you right it's it's a fucking chicken coop it looks like it's it's a chicken coop but it's not funny but you appreciate you come back and sometimes you look at your kids and other people the kids like you have no idea yeah and then sometimes those kids and chickens will go to the dump and that's where they they find metal and they find scrap and they take the lumen of cans and they get their money and they're happy to they're happy they don't they're not negative then I'm pissed off they're they have no shoes and and you know the Baja racers do a lot for the community down there I mean sometimes they'll build orphanages I mean a lot of the Baja guys get touched by what happens down there and the people down there and they go give back because it you can't help but you know you can't help but go to these it's a third world country and a lot a lot of ways not Cabo and stuff like that but the places where we go and you get affected by it you get to see the other world and you do appreciate what we have our kids will never appreciate it because you know the 500 shoes these kids have no shoes seriously no shoes and they live in chicken coops with a sheet on the front door yeah I've been I've driven in New Mexico I'll pass Tijuana into some really sketchy areas and you get to see these people that are living in these houses that are essentially like cardboard boxes with no windows and you know you see these small villages of places like that and it really puts it into perspective and even more weird that that's connected to the United States just one of the richest countries on earth that's just you just drive so the same landmass yes keep going and you go from Southern California the fucking Kardashians live and you see a Rolls Royce in your neighborhood and then a couple hours drive and then all sudden you're in a third-world country where no one has shoes there's a vantage point you go through go through the gate of Tijuana you take a right and you go up this hill and there's a marsh so you're in Tijuana and you're right you have the cardboard boxes and you look off to your right and there's a twenty million dollar beach house sitting there and you can see it imagine waking up every day you're up on this hill in Tijuana no running water everything's happened you look up there's a twenty million dollar beach house it's mind-blowing he puts it on Mexican no it's States yeah yeah so you can see San Diego yeah you come up on this hill you can see say you look off to the right there's San Diego in 20 there's it's right there yeah that is fucking bananas la jolla like those houses in La Jolla we should do the Comedy Store and we you know look at La Jolla I mean they have palaces these palaces overlooking the ocean and the most incredible affluent community everyone's driving around these expensive European cars in you're 20 minutes away from Tijuana yep 20 minutes that's fucking crazy that's like from here driving a van nuys you know and but except you're driving to one of the worst spots one of the worst border towns on earth but the people are amazing the people no bus they do so much for so it's pretty fuckin badass to fucking throw down tacos shrimp everything lobster lobster tacos where's the lobster tacos that lobster tacos forgot Moses at mamas mamas mamas Spinoza's yeah mama knows that lobster tacos are amazing now I never get to stop yeah I'm using a car now do any Mexicans race absolutely there's a lot of like people that live in Mexico the join in on this yep have you ever won it oh yeah you know actually the very top of illa dosa one he's part of the Red Bull team on the 50th anniversary it wasn't it was the Mexican dependence yep him and his father Gus wanted and they're there they they're from there from Tijuana they're from that area and there's also Juan Carlos Lopez a lot of Mexican teams I mean Mexican teams get little resources they go race and by the way they race trophy trucks which they do there's a couple trophy truck teams but they'll race Volkswagens they'll race everything you could possibly get so you were talking about the French guy that wanted to kick your ass is that a guy from France that came over just to race in this yeah there's about there's usually guys from 150 countries people all over the world come Japanese guys come down they're all I mean everybody all over the world come to Baja 1000 it's that much of a spectacle you you have to be I don't live in a cave for 800 years not to hear the Baja 1000 Wow people them all over the world come yeah because I've seen like in Europe I know they do a lot of rally car races and they use Porsches like Porsche has a lot of rally cars but they may they drive on dirt roads yeah but do they have this kind of thing as well we have in other countries ya know rallies big yeah like this kind of rally like this kind of like crazy modified truck they did that car which is a little bit different races a stage race that car used to was really from Paris to the cars Perry the car was the name of it and now that's in South America through Brazil and Argentina and Chile have you raced that car yet no yeah there's no that cars famous race I mean it's a very famous race and we score Raj and I've been talking to Saudis to try to bring a race over there we've met with China Roger met with China to try to bring a race over there we're gonna try to expand what what score's gonna do and starting to bring it to other countries I would think it would be a no-brainer for like Saudi Arabia or any those places where all those rich oil people love to do crazy shit like drift cars yeah like you've seen those videos those drifting videos oh yeah from Arab countries Dubai's real big right now on the sand buggies for me to get them into offroad yeah well Rogers talking to you and we can get we can get them over there they have an f1 race you know the obviously idea is getting all you know get all the trophy truck teams yeah I'm over there put them on a ship get everybody there and go race and what's the Sam buggies like uh it's a lot lighter buggy than what we raced an off-road and they basically just go to the sand dunes that are specific built for sand dune team they have thousand horsepower they do wheelies up the hill down the hill and over and Dubai I guess that's a big thing going on right now a lot of recreational yeah not race is just recreation yeah there's have fun what is it about people that you know like the moment someone invented cars look these guys are drifting why is that exciting to go sideways by the way I have no idea the feeling of being out of control think is hiding the most people I have not a control like that's on an open freeway almost yeah I know it looks like it is that doesn't seem like a smart move well I've seen some fucking horrific crashes - oh yeah I've seen some of those Arab drifting crashes or cars are flipping and bodies are flying out but the moment like people invented cars like how long before the moment a car was invented before people decided to fucking race him when the second car was built probably right I'll promise you when the second car was built Henry Ford based a whole industry that our whole industry the first auto race was in Chicago but our whole industry is based on auto racing it's it's there's an it's even goes past the 60s it's back when Henry Ford he raced Henry Ford raced Duesenberg raced all these guys race to prove out Edelbrock whose aftermarket guy but he raced they all the thing in our industry is you know race on Sunday sell on Monday so I'm gonna go out for builds his cars like I'm gonna go out and win this race Indianapolis 500 is based on manufacturers racing who's got the fastest car yeah I had a conversation with someone about that once whether we're talking about planned obsolescence like planned like that there's certain technology that's available today that you're not going to see in cellphones or televisions because they wanted to be obsolete a year from now and he was trying to make the argument about automobiles that they do that they can make the best car right I'm like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about because what they're doing right they're racing cars and then they develop that technology based on those race cars and that trickles down into the consumer aftermarket cars or consumer cars the Corvette program is the number one to look at right so Corvette is the longest longest running sports car in America longest built isn't everyone out of production and their race program that the transfer of Technology I did the whole documentary series on on Corvette launching the c6 and the whole thing was transfer technology if they develop a you know you do the R&D which is the hard part right which is what Rob does for his trucks and they start looking and poking around you doing the Rd in your race and you make that c6 Corvette R which is called c6 Corvette R are now c7 Swit Corvette are they race those teens pratt & miller builds them and then there is it there is a chevrolet engineer and i know them on the race team looking at stuff you know checking camber checking brakes checking aerodynamics checking everything and that technology transfers to your car which is why corvette is still one of the most dominant cars out there fruit 70 grand you can get because they they invest in that technology a new one is incredible that stingray is pretty bad that is an incredible car it's beautiful looking I saw one the other day I thought it was a Ferrari that same here I told my son I check out that Ferrari goes that's a Corvette right looks like yeah it looks like a like a European like high-end top-end car and the interior is nice now to fondly they figured out a way to make a car that doesn't look like a piece of shit with a fucking Impala steering wheel I mean they used to have these dogshit interiors same thing the Viper did we I did document a reason rebuilding the Viper Ralph shields from from SRT motors he did the same thing they they did the race they learned stuff from racing they put it in there but the new new Viper is amazing looking what's what's a better car the new Viper or the new Corvette it depends at price points are much different for the money the Corvette has to be at the price point on the Viper is one hundred ten thousand hundred fifteen thousand the Corvette you could take the roof off - that's pretty dope that's pretty cool look at that thing I mean they fuckin nailed it man yeah but see all the all the hood vents all all the brake ducts all that stuff is all developed from racing it's all functional yeah it's not nonsense it's not just something to look at which you know cars have had in the past we were at a weird time right now in automobiles because there's so much power great time a great time but so much power in the cars you could buy on the showroom floor like when they have the the Shelby gt500 660 plus horsepower right at this you know walk from the showroom pay the guy your money get in the car and you have a 660 plus horsepower car with a live rear axle and you're stomping on the high block hey good it means a saint zero to 60 in three seconds in a fucking car that you could just drive off the showroom floor and then the 60s used to be you know 280 horsepower 332 the boss came I was like oh it's got 320 horsepower AB smooth and I've actually driven an old 302 and I actually test drove the new 302 in a test track and at Ford it's unbelievable partner Lee Jones said the same thing it's like if I we were racing a Laguna Seca Parnelli and I was like if I had that car it would be easy well the new 302 are you talking about the Laguna Seca one or the one that hasn't come out yet yeah we are we're partner and I were test driving the Laguna Seca that's a incredible car that car got overlooked a lot by people it did because first of all the stripes and everything were a little whack like the way they were painting it but everybody wants the bigger engine everybody wants the you know the 550 horsepower Shelby now the 668 horsepower Shelby but that 440 horsepower Laguna Seca was the perfect balance front end to rear end there it is right there yeah it was suspension that's the boss 302 right yeah that's the boss 302 yeah yep that's the boss 302 and you're talking about Laguna Seca with the red and had the red red rims and yeah I think that the front air the front spoiler the race spoiler was the pipes coming off of it they just figured out a way to make cars that have horsepower that would be a fuckin super exotic car just twenty years ago just twenty years ago if you wanted to buy a car that had 400 horsepower I mean you're spending a hundred grand you're spending a hundred and fifty grand you know you're buying you know the top-of-the-line Porsche 911 turbo or something like that or a crazy Lamborghini yeah yeah that's 300 grand now you're buying a fucking Mustang GT it means bizarre with bizarre time it's good it's very good but the amount of power and responsibility that comes with having one of these you just hand it off to some fucking 17 year old kid Mary you know Merry Christmas you little fuck here's your key well they've also improved they've also improved brakes brakes traction control actually I have also big issues with traction control stuff like that because you do hand that guys 700 or spa our car and then he really then you just you unreinforced the car fixity management it starts breaking for you you know you don't have throttle cables anymore you got drive-by-wire and you can hit wide open throttle but the drive-by-wire the brain tells you no no you don't want full throttle because you're just gonna spin the tires I was racing it to Road Atlanta in the Corvette c6 Corvette and they have this turn 11 that comes off and your car gets airborne and every time I get airborne I'd land the card shut off like okay idiot whatever you're doing you got to stop because that's not good we're not how supposed to have four it would shut off it would go to limp mode shut off I go I go around what if you had to fucking maneuver away from something well the ng would go into limb mode it wouldn't shit would it would go it would shut down I'd nail the throttle there's no throttle it would go to it'd go in the 4-cylinder mode limp mode until I got halfway through the straightaway not good and I couldn't shut the damn thing off that's retarded yeah that's terrible but now they're they're developing them with sport mode and other modes where you can do it and flip a switch to you on a lot of these so yeah you can well the other problem is I don't know if this is true but what people are really worried about is that someone is gonna be able to have kill switches when they get shut your car off like remotely like say if you run from the cops or something like that they're doing already they have that's OnStar yeah OnStar does that you know OnStar you can shut York off like that like Joe Rogan just stole my Cadillac I'm driving down the road can you please shut it off being feeling yep can you pull that shit out can you unplug all that stuff probably that's probably wired in it's definitely wired in that's something you can't retroactively Leigh you can't take like an old Corvette ding ring like a 1970 stingray and just take all those modern components and have the same sort of experience that you would have driving a c7 Corvette but no OnStar no nonsense yeah I'm sure you continue but you couldn't have the traction control right you couldn't could you figure out a way to put a computer or when you have all that there's enough there's enough you know tuners or tutor and builders are amazing they can have the traction control in it sure because that's what a lot of people want to do now right I mean that's another show that you're doing right the restroom odds restomod yeah resto mods are the thing where you take an old car and you put all new suspension new components that's very attractive to people Tim Allen's game he's got a 60 69 Camaro and it's got all-new c7 Corvette suspension wheels everything in it tumblin you can look it up it's his new it's green it's beautiful you pop the hood you'll like some stuff you in cars you and I were looking at it it's unbelievable and he drives it around yeah you could drive it everywhere yeah Drive no way it starts like a Corvette you can start it from the remote hmmm 69 Camaro just started up it's a cool car what about the interior does it look like a new Corvette or is it like an old-school interior it's an old-school interior Wow pull that up man let's see this build my Bodie Stroud built it okay I've heard that name before right yes and yep I've told you about it yeah this is a video of it here is this it yes EML on a Jay Leno oh hey Wow G little garage hey everybody oh wow I mean it really is a sleeper yeah yeah that's crazy that's a Corvette turn the volume up let me hear what he says to say about this guy Tim Allen Tim come on in buddy shitty wheels comedian actor best-selling author and carga car guy yeah movie star yes but most of all car guy this is a beautiful Camaro you know I've been looking at it when I first pulled in I went oh a 68 Camaro but then I look and there's all these subtle little changes just the kind of things that I like those aren't stock wheels they're way wide rims but they're the steel was wonderful Tom Sherwood used to race one of these on Woodward when I was a kid green this car stock 327 it's one of those things that's just a great bullet it ran it rain circles run any other car I loved that car loved racing with them no console it was the low-end one wasn't the SS so I redid that and always like smoked eunuch the Trans Am car that he made and every time he I saw one I think one of the elder Brock family has it now and I'd see it race in these classic car racing well there's something about that car right not the track trainer arm lower it's amazing he showed you inches off the rake of the hood took off the drip rails which I don't have on all right there are natural flares which they don't have they're not all buttoned up a lot of my time with the ball-peen hammers yeah you know may think and then I decided in those days in Woodward days they had Capo's right which is what is it you central office production order you can put it on your order and if you did the right sequence GM would put a truck motor engine cars when did that time was a 427 yeah and they put 427 s in very few Camaros another would you know 800 Granderson right but what that means is GM did not want their big engine from the Corvette in the Camaro Dusenberry there is a Bugatti room you could that room is all first about you could special order a car with the big engine and that's what these hadn't so I changed the name to that that's the name - 427 COPO that's what I called it and we did some great little nametags all this kind of stuff is details that I like rally wheels that aren't wheels at all there I mean it's not a wheel like the old days disc brakes have to fit underneath you gotta make them bigger they Seventeen's yes and yeah I mean that's what I like you know I like it when someone does a period car I hate it when they all of a sudden they have 22 inch tubs on it right it just doesn't look right you know this town you hit a pothole and I'm living at the side of the road I got to have a because I Drive these things right and well that's a beautiful looking wheel I mean that's a custom wheel you cannot buy that was made specifically for this vehicle number one I really wanted black wheels with hubcaps that's how Cocos came right they didn't come with rally wheels so I have a set of black wheels that I want bumpers I put back on it all the trim went back on its stock mirrors right I got a no console none of that stuff well that's what I love but it's really a beautiful beautiful car see if you can get a video of the ins side of it I want to see what they did to the inside of it forget images but that's that's a trend that a lot of people are doing now because they want to have that beautiful old school muscle car look but they also want to have a car that that's the interior no way that's a real interior that's Recaro seats that can't be the interior the car yeah that's the interior the cartons no way play press play let me hear what he has to say that can't be the actual interior like a stunt interior because that's an image instead of the video why isn't yeah I don't know why they didn't mm-hmm but that doesn t riyer card I've sat in their car that's what it looks like yeah so he had he put like an old stupid looking steering wheel and everything that's a stock steering wheel everything stock interior but it's not stock handling like the pinion and all that shit yeah it's all it's all see c7 Corvette Wow that's the trend right that's what everybody wants yep and your new show when is that is that airing already pilot on the History Channel hasn't aired yet it'll be a pilot
