the gyro gun experience here man here here when you were talking about Alaska you know and getting off the grid and all that you know I had a transformative experience the first time I went to Alaska I was in college in New York I was studying literature and one of my teachers is a visiting professor that I got to be friends with was the youngest person to ever be a professor at Oxford he's like a real big shot at Oxford I mean since 1261 or something this guy's the youngest person to ever be a professor Wow how old were they 21 when he was a flight yeah anyway he's very well known guy Indira Gandhi was his godmother he's written a bunch of books and all this and he was a friend of mine and he was I was in my I was skipped my junior year of college and so I had one more year undergraduate and I was going to go to Oxford for my PhD thanks to this guy and his connections I was gonna like study literature there do a PhD and by the time I was thirty be teaching somewhere hopefully have tenure and be all set for life and all so I skipped my junior year cuz I found a loophole in the Student Handbook where I could like scam through which I've done like every school I've ever been in every job I've ever had I find some scam right so I scanned my way out of junior year and I said I'm gonna go to Alaska because I want to see the frontier so I hitchhiked from New York to Alaska had all these freaky adventures as you can imagine right went to prison got shot at you know all this crazy should happen and I met people along the way who picked me up especially like in the Yukon Anila in Alaska who were so fucking kind yeah I'm so competent and they take me home I'd see you know they'd feed me introduce me of the wife the kids that you know they or women who'd stop and pick me up just trusting like yeah whatever you know the really self-sufficient people they built their own houses they had healthy relationships they knew how to fix their own cars they were really self-sufficient none of them knew anything about the fancy-schmancy literature and philosophy that I was studying right like I I had you know The Collected Poems of D H Lawrence in my backpack and they'd never heard any of the shit right but when I compared them to my professor friends back at school it was like wait a minute these people don't know any of this you know elite knowledge but they're really happy people and they're healthy people and they have good families and they're decent and they're kind and they're generous to me and then I imagine one of them you know stumbles into Princeton New Jersey or you're where I was going to school in upstate New York and my professor friends you know come upon them they'd they'd laugh at them they wouldn't help them they wouldn't be kind to them they would and my professor friends like had to call a fucking electrician to change a lightbulb right so it's like well wait a minute what what do I want to do in this life where am I going so that's when I just said all right fuck it no grad school and I wrote to the guy like just sorry not going to prinster Oxford not not gonna do any of this till I'm 30 I'm not gonna make a commitment to anything no job no woman no grad school no med school nothing I'm just gonna float around the world and have adventures wow that's a fucking cool story I love that idea that's that's really cool I found that I didn't go to the Yukon but I went to Anchorage recently with Ari right you guys went fishing we went fishing we you need a showing there Kenai Peninsula mmm south of Anchorage got a great time yeah we caught some salmon and we we did a show up there but I felt that way as well about the people that roses there's a self-sufficiency to a lot of folks that live up there that eat mean even in Anchorage which is a City you know it's a real City they have you know hotels and gas stations and the whole deal movie theater into the movies there it was 10 o'clock at night it was bright out yes very weird with bars with no windows yeah I can't people are in there drinking you don't want to see a fucking Sun come your eyes let you know what a loser you are yeah and people will make better decisions there was light on them we don't want that so do they still have like handgun permits where you have to leave your gun at the door we go into the bar some places the gun check yeah you have to check your guns and you know man because everybody's got guns get shit-faced then you pick up your gun on your way out yeah that's the best time to get it after you've gotten up bar exactly but you you find people there they were very kind and very cool and very competent as you were saying and they're just they're people that are also dealing with nature and a way different level yeah they're dealing with weather you know real weather yeah and we don't have to do that we especially in California which is the most ridiculous and retarded state in the country as far as the way people behave on the norm don't get me wrong I love it here and there's a lot of cool people here and you know all my best friends are here but the reality of California is that we don't have to deal with weather at all the worst thing we have to do is press a button oh my god it's hot you press a button it's not hot anymore I mean it's yeah really as long as the power stays on really not that fucking hard to deal but if you lived in Alaska you have to take precautions every year you have to keep a candle in the back your car you have to keep matches you have to keep blankets with you at all times because your car could break down you could be at the side of the road no one could be on the road and that candle it might keep you alive you are the light that candle in your car with all the doors shut and that's the only way you're gonna stay warm and stay alive like there's a there's a lot of that kind of thinking going on there and then when someone sees you pulled over the side of the road they're not like oh who's just creepy fuck you know in Sherman Oaks that's pulled over to the side of the road with its hazards on I'm not stopping for this guy right there like oh he was this person this guy you know kindred soul out here in the middle of the woods that got fucked and this could be me yeah come on in do you guys have cell phone service no we drive five more miles we get cell phone service hop in the car I'll take you to where we can call somebody yeah yeah there's not but you're right your professor friends to not pick them up would be right where they live that's the crazy thing about it's like you're right that the professor was probably wouldn't pick up someone who is broken down the side of the road but they're right to and not doing that if you live in a city because you never know what the fuck you're gonna get exactly yeah yeah you got it you gotta participate in the world you're born into whether you agree with it or not how's that smile said okay I don't even smell it yet no smell that's going that way damn what's wrong with you yeah cuz I'm with your no son you should smell the fuck out other that's nice sure don't lie to me man all right I already notice that I tell you I mean I don't must be the coke Oh did I say that out dare you that's a bad drug that's it I that's a drug I had access I mean I you're in this position all the time I'm sure but you know having access to like the best of the best of something I knew a guy in college who was the son of an oil minister from a country I won't name just to keep me out of trouble he had a private jet he used to fly to Colombia he had a diplomatic bag so he could bring anything into the country he'd bring the shit into the country and he was like in this frat and I knew someone who was in the frat and I was never a frat boy at all but they would invite me and like he's like yellow rocks of coke you know antics and it was the I mean I went to this dumbass college where everybody was rich so the drug scene there was off the charts and like I've done the best coke there is right I mean I know the guy who invented MDMA I you know it's like I've got I had these really good connections for drugs and coke sucks the best coke in the world shit I don't get it Wow I mean my in my sense is that it it affects a certain personality structure in a really pleasant way and I don't have that structure so for me hallucinogens are like boom that's pushing my button right coke it just made me fucking nervous and drink too much well you're a self-deprecating guy and you joke around about a lot and you also introspective and I think that one of the things that people don't like about people that are coked up is that they want to talk about themselves they want to tell you how fucking badass they are they want to brag they want to talk about like making money we're gonna buy this forest we're gonna fucking you know like you know I mean like Mike Young used to always talk about how people and on coke always want to start a business with you and it's really kind of true it's like they always have these three ism yeah they have these crazy grand plans and just I've never been interested in it I got lucky and I ducked it yeah when I was a kid I've told the story a hundred times but I had a friend my friend that I'm still friends with in high school his cousin used to sell it life went down the toilet and I watched him wither away lost like a shitload of weight became weird you know just always on coke and when he wasn't wasn't on coke he was just exhausted you know it's just like Jesus that looks like a like so know when someone got bit by a vampire yeah like oh my god like you got to get that bug they got you yeah it's like you're taking all the energy from part of your life and concentrating it in the few hours after you do the coke and like what are you gonna do with all that energy except irritate people but I knew a girl and she was a great girl she wasn't a mean person she wasn't nasty materialistic she's beautiful she's really nice and sweet and kind but fuck she loved coke mmm goddamn and she would feel bad about it she got fucking love it I love doing coke I'm like really like you know I was not curious enough to want to do it but listening to her you know she knew it was bad knew she shouldn't do it didn't want to do it anymore but should tell you goddamn what I'm doing I love doing coke in my experience the people who tend to get really hooked on coke are people who have issues where they feel bad about themselves they may feel they've got a lack of self esteem they feel like they they're not good enough they're not whatever there's shame and all that because the coke takes that away for a while that totally makes sense in this case because this woman her mother was like really overbearing and her mother was like super alpha successful her mother was a single mom and was like like no man's gonna fucking run me and show she was a lawyer and she was accessible business had a law firm and she was like super like intense with her daughter about achievement about pursuing things about you know don't eat the wrong foods and you know eat you know it was like really like overbearing and gave her a hard time about her weight like you're too fat you're never gonna be a model and like and so I guess the coke was like free you don't have to think about a giver like maybe she had a deficit created by our mom's constant you know yeah you ever you know gob or Ma Tei is no he's a whore Montez yeah I know it didn't know the name I've only seen it written yeah he's a cool guy if you ever want to have him on the show he's a friend of mine he's a very interesting guy he's a doctor who works with addicts he's been working with addicts in Vancouver and like the slum part of Vancouver for a long time a lot I like real down-and-out people and he also is very interested in alternative approaches to addiction you know he's written about ayahuasca as a way of dealing with addiction treating addicts and all that but anyway he his theory is that all addiction is due to trauma it's not it has nothing to do with the substance or the activity it's that's just how it manifests right but it's all about psychological trauma it's all trying to alleviate suffering of some point of some kind and it's interesting his research sort of meshes very well with this experiment that was done also in British Columbia I can't remember Williamson I think was the the scientist named you know those famous studies where they give rats like they've got a water bottle it's just water and then another one that's got Coke in it and the rats will just keep doing the coke and they'll forget to eat and then the the you know like die like these people you're talking about lost all this weight and just like completely focused this guy looked at that and he he was a professor scientist he looked at and he's like okay well that that's the sort of main study that everybody cites that shows that coke is addictive and it's coke that causes the problem and it's the substance and molecular problems but what if we took those rats same kind of rats but instead of just being in a cage where there's nothing to do put them in a really interesting environment where there are lots of other options there are lots of other rats they're tubes to go through and things to climb and things to hide under and lots of stimulation right and then let's try it they try it what happens the rats do the coke once or twice and then walk away from it never go back right so there's an argument to be made that a strong argument that it's not about substances it's like I was saying it's about the way this substance inner sex with whatever your particular suffering is right so these rats in a cage you're obviously suffering cuz they're not in a natural environment a fucking cage there's nothing like get high so they get high that's a very good point that I never considered there's a very very good point it's called rat Park if anyone wants to google it just google rat Park cuz that's what he called this you know like sort of enclosure that he made for the rat Majan being a rat being stuck in a fucking fluorescent lighting room and fucking metal cage and a little water bottle you gotta suck on big to look the fucking life they live is dogshit yeah you're in a prison setting you got you got a prison a guy in solitary confinement right and you're offering them to get high of course it's gonna get hot and you're being surrounded by giants everywhere you go there's just enormous creatures who could easily reach in and just snuff your life by squeezing it's just ridiculous and by nature you're terrified right here's your prey animal you're you know yeah you should be running from everything and all sudden you can't run you can't hide right you're and they just reach and grab you and they fucking give you coke yeah which makes even more pair goddamn PETA you might have a point yeah I remember you know when dusk when the mosquitoes come out and you can see a swarm setting up your tent you know and like I remember setting up my tent and like every second moving my shirt so they couldn't like get in through the shirt you know I had to keep moving the shirt while I'm setting up then you get in there and you can hear it's like hail banging against the side of the tent you can hear them banging on the tent oh my god yeah they're their little helicopter what the fuck did people do before they figured out tents well the Eskimos I believe that they smeared and fat on their skin that would certain kinds of fat would keep the mosquitoes off them and they've got all sorts of really clever adaptations you know you know we we sort of assumed that we would be helpless but that's because we didn't grow up there and our culture didn't you know right so and there's you know Wade Davis says no he's a he's an anthropologist he's written a bunch of books a really interesting guy he's like anthropologist in residence at the Smithsonian in Washington he wrote a book called the Wayfarers I think was his last about traditional like about how these guys could navigate across the Pacific just looking at the Stars and the color of the water and smelling and what you know whatever they'd anyway he one of the stories he tells us about this Eskimo guy old guy and family sort of took the keys to the car away from him you can't go anymore they were afraid he would go out and die the traditional way when Eskimo people got old they would just like wander off into the ice and die so it's not to be a burden to the family right and he was a traditional guy and they were worried that he would take the the snow machine out and just die out there somewhere or hurt himself hunting or whatever so they have this whole intervention and so that night he goes out gets out of the house takes a shit in his hand forms the shit into a knife blade spits on it and the spit is freezing along the edge and he hones that down so he gets a nice sharp edge with his spit takes his shit knife kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes their ribs and makes a sled out of it and with the sinews and whatever other pieces of the dog's you know he knew all this stuff from his childhood hooks up a couple other dogs to the sled and he takes up and into the snow on his you know sled with his shit knife what oh my god that might be the most insane story I've ever heard and they're so clever you know how they kill polar bears I know they take blood and put it on a blade and know that that was actually wolves the wolves would lick though the blade and they would cut themselves too down yeah similar kind of thing what they would do is they take a little they'd make a wooden box and they would take a seal rib and sharpen the two ends of the seal rib and they're pretty flexible so they'd bend it and stick it into the box right and then they'd pour melted fat into the box and let it solidify freeze and then they'd knock it out so you've got a fat cube with this flexed two-bladed thing inside it and they leave that mass no polar bear come along swallow it and opens in the polar bear Wow and they just follow the blood drops it would kill hemorrhaging kill them I just remember that I mean there's stories like that all over the world you know the Indian monkey trap the East Indian monkey no I don't know how interested your readers well that system is and this is a good metaphor too I was remember this one they would take a same thing take a box with a hole about you know a little smaller than a fist in the money in the box and then they put a mango in the box and then hammer it shot and tie it to a tree so the mango starts rotting the monkey smells that monkey comes along can stick his hand in and feel the mango but he can't get his hand out as long as he's holding on to the mango and they won't let go of the mango all they have to do is let go and they can leave but they got the mango in their hands and they won't let go and so the guy comes around to check the traps there's the monkey standing there with his hand in the box hit it on the head you got your monkey whoa something about greed there that's an awesome story that is a perfect metaphor - yeah that's amazing Wow that's funny hi gentlemen I think we're we're at three hours are we at three oh yes he seems fucking fly by they fly by they've been amongst the most popular podcasts that I do and I know you guys are saying the same thing well it's yeah the one we did together last time I guess mine was the third right has twice as many downloads as any other that have been up for ever and the second is you you and me Wow yeah the same thing with us I mean these these podcasts that we have are amongst the highest downloaded ones that we have you know yeah justic effect the one we did for sure is the most I ever downloads I reckon they're really fun you know there's fun they're bizarre it's a very bizarre combination I don't know if you guys saw I created a page that archives them okay cool you know I'm happy to transfer it where we decided to do it but for the moment it's on Chris Ryan PhD calm and you'll see try podcast you have and that's where the first three are archived yeah it's just unlink that leads back to your site in your site well we were talking before the podcast started about trying to figure out a name but we're not even close old Menace know those pretty badass because of your description of what it is right but with people it's is it funny without knowing the story no you have to tell the story though just tell people the story because I don't think you did while the podcast was going on it was before the pocket oh we were talking about techniques that that adolescent boys develop the good ones anyway for our not coming and and like some people like think of baseball stats or whatever just something like non-sexual to get your head away from what you're doing which in itself is kind of a weird thing to be you know you're like having the best experience of your life and you're trying not to notice okay nature wants you to come instantly and just shoot a load into a chick and make a kid and you want to have a good time it's a strategy yeah very zen well it goes back to sex it done it's you know a sperm competition yeah nature's designed you to shoot your load get out of the waist of the next guy and that's why by the way we're turned on by seeing gang bangs and dudes fucking a be you are yeah anyway so my technique was to think about old people trudging through the snow like World War two you know Crimean refugees trudging through that Russian winter it's freezing yeah like that a babushka yeah exactly that makes me not want to think about that guys sorry guys I can't come down would you live the last year life if that guy's asshole was permanently an inch from your face what is it guy yeah what would you do for the rest of your life well you can live you can do everything you want you know right here to the right you can move it around but it always has to stay like sort of like the like the moon is in your orbit that guy's asshole he's wrong asshole orbits here you know what after a week or two you wouldn't even notice to say that I would kill myself I would come in push that guy with me I would just left I didn't show in my life fart in your face everything's perfect no asshole ever lands in the wrong place that's what the Buddhists say howdy Krishna yeah okay yeah I can't go to prison for saying this or any talking about this but you know what non-americans if you admit that you have ever used illegal drugs they can they stamp your passport you're never allowed in the country I know if two friends that happen to so if you're in another country and you start talking about using drugs like on another podcast they can well I don't know I don't know about podcast but what happened with his friend she was coming back from Amsterdam she was a judge in the cannabis cup competition she lives in Vancouver and the plane she changed planes in Seattle and they took her and said so what were you doing in Amsterdam and she told them and they said so have you smoked marijuana she said yeah and they stamped her password she's never allowed in the US again because she smoked marijuana in Amsterdam Wow and another guy no is a psychiatrist a Canadian psychiatrist who had worked with LSD psychotherapy and they stopped him at the the drive-thru border you know at Vancouver and interviewed them they they wiki pedia them and like oh you did research with LSD have you ever used LSD he said yeah Stan that's crazy that's all is that only America as far as I know Canada's rough if you get a drunk driving in America good luck in in Canada oh really oh yeah yeah a lot of a lot of fighters have issues getting in Canada for fights a lot of comedians have issues a lot of comedians have had issues getting into the Montreal Comedy Festival which is one of the big events for stand-up comedian because of drunk driving yes because the drunk driving conviction or any domestic violence yeah anything like that yeah Eddie Bravo had an arrest for having a gun on him legally okay he was working for a check cashing place and he used to have to carry large sums of cash in his car to another location and so he would leave with the check cash company and he had a registered concealed carry permit for a gun and so he got pulled over for something and he had to tell the the cop officer I work for check caption company I have a legal registered handgun in my car right now it's loaded and then they go okay hold on a second we're gonna put you in handcuffs we're gonna run this so they run it they go okay checks out they let him go because it was not even supposed to be on his record because it was all legal doesn't matter every time he goes to Canada they sit him down tell us about this you have a gone on side you right now you take a gun you should to go for the border no no no no no no no no I was I was working for a company I was I get cut he's got an extra hour every time he goes into Canada that happened to me especially an immigration going into Canada would you get a what it was your issue well they asked me if I'd ever been convicted of a crime and I said no and you know I go sit down and then they call me over and they said the guys like you said you'd never been convicted of a crime correct I said yeah he said is there anything you'd like to say about Fairbanks Alaska in 1983 I was like yeah I got busted in Fairbanks you know for eating a Snickers bar in a fucking grocery store and not paying for it and but I did get three days it was Memorial Day weekend I did three four nights in the prison and then the guy said you know 20 hours of community service and this will disappear from your record and you know if you don't get arrested in a year so I always say no cuz that's yeah I wasn't convicted of anything and and they said it would be taken from my record and the guys like no the fact that you were not Alaskan so you're from out of state meant they couldn't strike it from your record so and it's on your FBI record which is what we get in Canada so he was nikkor thief yeah I'm a sneaker thief so he's a cool guy I did four days in a fete in a federal medium security prison with no underwear for a Snickers first Snickers what do you mean with no underwear were you wearing anything or just naked I was wearing because it makes it more harrowing come on man I was 19 years old now yeah we liked very Twinkie I was Twinkie I was very Twinkie yeah so you were worried it was I mean I would have been worried if I were wearing you know what anything isn't that under the amount of money that they can even bust you for so maybe not in the 80s Reagan wasn't president they were trying to fucking be tough on crime just say no yeah and also I had a I mean what happened was we got in from this 10-day hitch with these two guys I'd met on the ferry coming up the Inside Passage and we had this long hitch through the Yukon Territory all this crazy shit and and we get to Fairbanks so the first place we go is the laundromat because we stank right we didn't have that special soap defense though defense so and so we went to the laundromat we put everything possible in the washer so all three of us were wearing shorts with no underwear boots with no socks and a jacket with no shirt and then one of the guys was like he wanted to go to the grocery store cuz there was a payphone he was gonna call his girlfriend to let her know that he'd arrived on time and I was like forget I'll go over with you and the other guy's gonna stay with the bags or backpacks and all that shit you know watch the clothes so I went with him somebody was on the phone we started pushing a cart around we were like you know Soviet immigrants like oh so many kinds of you know fruitier because we'd been living in the woods eating nuts and chocolate and LSD for the last ten days and so he he opened a thing of kefir first time I'd ever heard of kefir which is like liquid yogurt yeah and drank that great for your body acidophilus and I for some reason ate a Snickers bar even though I'd been eating chocolate not much imagination there and then we he used the phone we ditched the card and we left and so there's some security guy had seen us and turned into a thing this cop showed up and I had a knife in my boot and some grass in my pocket both of which were legal at the time in Alaska but it was enough to make this cop not like me at all and he was like this you know eating a poliana cop kind of situation and he didn't like smartass college kids from outside coming into Alaska in the summer and you know sneakers mucking around yeah fucking around Kieffer so he took us he handcuffed us and took us to prison Fairbanks Correctional Center did you not have the money for the Snickers bar yeah we had plenty of money he just didn't want to pay for it but it was like well you tell it to the magistrate oh oh you mean for that now that was just like I don't know what the fuck you're just young and we're just dumb and you know and maybe there was a line or something I don't remember right we pretended we were shopping so we put like dog food and shit in the carts you know and we had our stuff and put the package like we were gonna pay for it when we checked out right right right so I don't know what we were just being dumb but yeah so we ended up being taken to this prison and I had a pipe - yeah cuz I remember when we were did the intake the guy that liked the prison dude who booked us and you know did the whole intake thing I was joking with him I was like yeah I'm not gonna get that pipe and grass back am i and he was like I don't think so man I was like well you know wouldn't bother me if it just disappeared and was never even registered because grass is hard to come by in Alaska right wasn't and so we sort of had a little understanding like I'm cool you're cool cuz he was like what the fuck you have Snickers bar why would this guy yeah what's wrong with that cop did you like hit him or something like no it you know he just had a hair up his ass right so this guy was cool he saved us cuz what he did is he said look I'm not gonna put you guys in with the general population you're gonna sleep in the gym that night you got some cots you sleep in the gym you never let the other one out of your sight the whole time you're here you go to the bathroom together you go to the showers together you watch each other's back and you'll get through it all right Wow and we did anyway it was wild and this was like eighty-three I guess and so that there's a lot of money in Alaska right from all the oil so the prison was plush it was like every meal was all-you-can-eat really salad bar whole wheat rolls white rolls Wednesday was prime rib day where the cops could pay a buck to eat with the prisoners yeah but the catch was the only 20 minutes each meal so I remember like one day we're sitting there at this table and we're like 19 maybe 20 maybe 20 something like that we're sitting at this table and the guy across the table looked like Charles Bronson you remember him - and the tats and all that and we're just like this dude was shoveling it in and he looks up at one point he says this is the best fucking prison I've ever been in like a laundry list of prisons that don't don't meet that criteria standard yeah he is was he founded dude with his wife and he beat him with a lead pipe and he didn't know if he was dead but as soon as it happened he got in his car he's from like New Mexico or Arizona he got in his car and drove to Alaska because he knew he'd get picked up and he wanted to get picked up in Alaska because he'd heard the prisons were much better that's hilarious so he might have beat a guy to death and said the way to deal with this is to go to a place that has awesome prisons in that place just happens to be on the exact opposite of the Mountaineers fucking far shit [Music]
