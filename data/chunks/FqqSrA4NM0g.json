[Music] what what he's done if Floyd Mayweather retires he's done the the thing that nobody ever does he went out on top undefeated with all the money after having fought all challengers I mean he might have fought Pacquiao late but you can't deny that he fought all challengers who gives a fuck what I mean the 50 things seems to be an issue they're not an issue for me I don't know yeah 250 you know whether or not he wants to break the record I mean how much of that is his ego that's gonna last for I mean he's still pretty young right yeah I mean he's free I think he's 36 if I had to guess but he's in really good shape I mean he takes care of himself really well he's like notoriously disciplined about workouts and he'll even go out at night go to a nightclub drink water and then work out at 2 o'clock in the morning cuz he has his own gym and his own thing and you know he works hard you don't get that good on just talent you know you get that good on talent and discipline and the hard fucking work there's just no way around it and smart you got to be smart to you got to be sneaky got to be clever do you see who he's training right now for a fight yeah train Soulja Boy Soulja Boy is really gonna fight Chris Brown is that real I mean it doesn't seem like it but I've been talked about for a few days now apparently it's gonna be on pay-per-view I'm fighting over a girl I'm gonna tell you right now Chris Brown's gonna fuck him up probably yeah there's that's an angry dude but see that dude on the left with the red that's a real angry dude that the other dude I just do not think he is as angry but who knows man I've never seen either in person I don't maybe one of them maybe Soulja Boy's been hiding some sick boxing skills and just pretending this whole time I doubt it see I feel like Chris Brown was probably punched a lot more people you know don't you think all you know wife-beating girl beating jokes aside he's definitely seems like a dude who's much more likely to punch people maybe maybe more likely to but I couldn't really seem out neither either of them getting in like a street fighter anything they've been pretty famous for most of their life and pretend to mmm interesting since they're in their teens oh boy here's another thing here's another reason why I say Chris Brown Chris Brown's a real fucking dancer you ever see that guy move oh yeah yo he could do some crazy shit listen this is gonna be a bloodbath I might be wrong fuckin by it you know and if Soulja Boy fucks him up I'll apologize I was trying to think about this hasn't there been other things I mean I know you were supposedly supposed to fight Wesley Snipes but like wasn't this about other things like this ever happened you still have a whole celebrity boxing show I remember that happened a couple of times yeah yeah Danny Bonaduce fought screech he fucked up a couple of people I remember when I was younger there was supposed to be a big event where Shaquille O'Neal is supposed to go one-on-one on pay-per-view with this other big player named Hakeem Olajuwon they're gonna box nut box they were gonna come play basketball one-on-one for a million dollars but it never ended up happening I don't know it went away but I was just kind of wondering in my head like I feel like this is hat I've heard things like that's coming up in half like or at least been announced but they just kind of fizzle out who knows man I mean people have done crazy shit this just seems like a really really nutty one and they're fighting over a girl I just haven't seen any evidence of Soulja Boy's athleticism me somebody put up a video of him working out there's a compilation of him working out it's but it's hard to tell if he's just being silly you know it's like he's uh he's like shadowboxing and he's riding an elliptical machine he seems like a really young guy how old is he he's in his 20s yeah well there's there's a bunch of this little complication here this so whoever they do that was narrating it was like oh man he goes you working out with your socks on this is not the same compilation but it was pretty funny he's like only real savages work out with this sock sock I don't know man it's just [Music]
