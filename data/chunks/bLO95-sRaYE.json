the girag and experience this is going to be a rough transition but seems how I have to go do my podcast pretty quick on the topic of podcasts you know I'm being sued yes and explain that to people because it's one of the dumbest fucking lawsuits I've ever heard in my life but there's people that make a living off of these types of lawsuits right there yeah called patent trolls the buy up patents and their lawyers and it's sort of I think it's this country at its worst I really do it's they buy patents and then they sue companies saying they're using stealing or unlawfully using their technology and sometimes when you're buying technology there's a real good argument to that like that technology is a part of this thing that you're selling and without that technology which is patented your technology what you're selling would not exist right and I get that part and I support innovation and people should be paid for for intellectual property and clear ideas but this is a weird one this is what is the exact term that that they have a patent on the exact they have a patent on a playlist yes son online anything in a cereal order right right like even blogs I evidently anything that comes out on a Monday and then the next one comes out on a Tuesday or this song is above that song and this song is number three and that song is number seven that's what they claim to have dominion over so if you have a blog and you enter into that blog like you know blog entry number one you know Adam goes to do podcasts to talk about this lawsuit they could sue you for that like they own a piece of that a serialized message that you're putting on a website yeah numbered message that that's correct that's insane well this is insane because if it's true then really everything on the Internet's got to go away everything could you imagine if they bought up everything on the internet with one sneaky move like one sneaky move one pad what the judge says look the guy's got a point he owns everything in serialized form well the banal number the problem is is I don't think the judge of the jury is going to think they have a point unfortunately in order to make our point that they don't have a point it's going to cost 1.5 million dollars holy shit yeah holy shit that's what patent litigation costs that's what the legal fees are going to be that's what that's what I've been quoted oh my god I've been quoted 1.25 to 1.5 Wow yeah that's stunning I never would have thought it would be that high so are they all screaming hate a lot so is that what it is it's all the lawyers that's what it is it's all the lawyers and that's how much work do they have to do here Joe for me it's like I first off that I've spent $50,000 trying to get a change of fucking venue these guys are in eastern Texas that's where they set up because eastern Texas is famous for 'only to their types of folk yeah to this type of thing patent troll lawsuits I don't live in eastern Texas and my business isn't in eastern Texas and they don't live in eastern Texas either that's just where they hung their shingle and they hung the shingle specifically because this is a place that's advantageous to do things like this well is it's what you would do if you were company that bought up other people's technology and then tried it to other businesses and make money off of them you're going to maximize that the possibility of you getting an outcome that's in your favor and you'll do it on the moon if you have to now these people come to you with some sort of a settlement like if they said hey you know you're using our technology we would like five bucks a month like anything on those lines yes three million dollars whoa and this is because they've they've won these before the same company they got eight million dollars from Apple right yeah it's it's unclear what I'm doing with them and what they're doing with me but it's a pretty simple equation which is I just said look all the guys in podcasting need to kind of band together and we need to fight them and then we need to beat them and then once we beat them then they're beat because they can't go after you or Marc Maron or whoever once we beat them but if we allow this to just go away it's not going to if we say well let's just put it aside and you know fucking ignore them then they win and well possibility that they could win there's no way look when you get sued you get sued you got to respond but you know let's just say we said look uh you guys obviously haven't done the math on our company but you know it's it's a business no one wants to spend the time and the 1 million plus dollars to fight this thing you know take 350 grand and please go away or 500 grand or a hundred grand whatever it is well how long before they go to iTunes and they go let's see who else is doing okay over here on iTunes and it's a hippie so Roman is doing all right now last time we did this with Corolla we got 500k out of him wonder what Joe's good for and all we got to do is do the same thing we did with Corolla he knows I mean we'll let will let Joe's attorneys coach him up but they're going to tell you this is the most expensive kind of litigation it's going to cost over a million dollars and we can go on the internet looked at them known as human beings are behind this you know the actual human beings ah are you aware of their names or faces you know what they look like no I don't and and I I never think that way like I I just think that I understand that we live in a world that is generally decent and that these people probably think of themselves is generally decent you know they probably have kids that love them and a wife that gives them a blowjob on occasion this is what they do for a living this is their business and I think when a guy were works at a used RV lot and he's got an RV on that lot that's worth $4,000 and some elderly couple comes in there and he gets him for 20 grand he doesn't go home and stare in the mirror and go wow I'm a really bad human being he goes I'm a fucking great salesman and I think that's what these guys do I don't even fault them and on a personal level like they make money from doing this I understand it it's no it's not even worth trying to make it a personal issue I don't feel it's a personal issue they saw my podcast I'm actually in a bizarre way flattered they saw my podcast and said that guy is really doing well for himself like let's go you get I wanted three million bucks that's that's insane that's all that was your first offering so that's stunning what we're doing is we're getting everyone together and we're going to show them that the podcast community is a lot stronger than they thought that they fucked with the wrong people and I don't mean me I mean everybody and that whether you're a Joe Rogan fan or Adam Corolla fan or an NPR fan it's all going away if we don't buck up and beat these guys so we just want to fund anything debt comm /pan troll and you can give toward the Legal Defense Fund and it's a pretty harrowing this is a video up there to watch where Adam explains the whole situation and what's going on and and spread this spread it on Twitter spread it on Facebook let everybody know if you can't donate at least spread the word and let people know what the fuck is going on because yeah this is a crazy thing it is a weird byproduct of our society right um I don't like it but there's nothing we could do about it at this point in time no other than this but this is really cool because this could be a seminal moment for podcasting which you guys fucked with the wrong guys we're all grassroots but we all band together we all got our little individual little arm nice and we all got them United and we all fought this common cause you know what I love about podcasting that I do think that that's something that fits with the ethic of podcasting but I also love that podcasting isn't it's it's not a competitive thing in that everybody supports everybody else in podcasting I've never heard of podcast feuds like morning DJ guys always fucking hate the other morning DJ guy right I always talked shit about him but podcasts I don't know anybody who says like you know we would be fuckin doing great if it wasn't for that Adam Carolla Show everybody's watching that stupid that show sucks our podcast is the future that shows for old people fuck up you know that doesn't it doesn't seem to be going on at all I think the internet had the attitude the internet is that what you're dealing with the world you're dealing with an infinite amount of people it's so goddamn big that having that sort of famine mentality that a lot of people have if they are in morning radio in a specific city you don't need it in the internet you know I listen every I feel like a you know last podcast I did yesterday Jay Mohr and Jo koy were both guests on the show and they both have podcasts and 80% of the guests on my show have their own podcast and we promote their podcasts on my podcast yes so that's all you need to know right we do the exact same thing and I'm always telling people you should do a podcast like people are good guests I'm like why don't you do your own podcast all you don't even need a place like this you need a fucking mp3 recorder in a microphone that's it right upload it online takes 10 seconds and boom you have a fucking podcast well the planet is podcasters unite rally your army and let's beat these guys let's do it we're in we're in 1,000% that's not even real number only a hundred percent is possible we're in that but we'll say a thousand like your hyperbole I like that you like it so fun anything dot-com forward slash patent troll please go there if you can't donate please spread the word so that other people can find out about it that can donate I get it if you I totally understand it but if you do appreciate podcasting and you do appreciate Adams show and his network means got a whole network and then on top of that everybody else that you know that does podcast with it's Joey Diaz or Ari Shaffir a Duncan Trussell Adams right that would all go away if it wasn't for if you know if we can't figure out a way around this issue absolutely do it do it ladies and gentlemen
