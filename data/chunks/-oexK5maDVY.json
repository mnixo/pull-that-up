wasn't the right color what color was this word i drowned no I was worried but it wasn't it was just dehydration severe dehydration there was days where I would drink literally like fucking gallons of water yeah you don't want ice I try it without personally you're crazy I was drinking so much I was drinking water and I was adding salt to it I was adding Himalayan salt to the water was cuz I know I was dehydrating myself so much I would have puddles on the ground you still that still wasn't sufficient like they I set up a set off an alarm I remember that it set off a fire alarm in the gym from my sweat I still have PTSD from last year's sub rocktober dude like I get text from you guys and panic sits in my heart and I go wait what is that like it gets it she thinks I'm crazy but for sure I move that upsets wives you're the only one who got low in the home life yeah if I come to New York or would have been coming to LA it would have been terrible we have an extra month but like I saw that fucking stupid device when I was moving I open up a drawer I was like get it out it's like Chucky the little dog yeah yeah I think LeAnn and push you're gonna podcast this entire sober October yeah she threw you under the bus I'm the fucking radio station - I didn't hear that story you guys you do whitey swaps that story she was they were asking about drugs and how hard I party and I just talking shit and I was like you know I go uh I go I spoke a little bit of weed every now and then if cocaine's on a switchblade I'll hit it but I only do mushrooms once a year and Leanne just heard me and she's making breakfast for the girl skills he doesn't do mushrooms and he doesn't do cocaine he's got high blood pressure like bitch I'm trying to move tickets and eatin its waterfall dates available now is it available right now dude yeah we right now right now right now right now Burt calm is it weird you sound like you're coming off a coke bender touring hard dude but stink think about Tom like when you first started going on the road with me you're way far hit further ahead now than he was a trend oh oh right when he was opening for me we are yeah we weren't doing clubs we were doing all clubs we started do theaters when you started to headline in your own places that's true yeah that was pretty crazy it was quick I was thinking about it about that level you were at that we all thought was like damn well yeah I mean you know it's like you you know someone you like it's accessible yeah right right it seems normal right you like sense like oh I could sell out this whole weekend - yeah and then when you do you like oh shit like what fuck median I'm a real comedian I sold out a club and it's just because we got in shape I didn't even think about just because I didn't think about theatres back then like when we were all riding the club I never know we were just doing clubs yeah like I had done a couple of theaters here and there but for the most part it was just about just working yeah that's what I said we were just like what do you want to do with the careers I can I'd like to have clubs because one our theater is like I couldn't do theater it was why cuz you said you could do whatever you want and I was like alright guys got me to go on the road he really planted a fucking seat him I had one day in the back park and loved the Comedy Store so why don't you do the road I said I don't know it was hateful fucking just hang around here and he's like he could make a good living he goes you don't need these fucking TV guys and I was like wow he's right oh I was thinking about it I was like he's right does change my life you I've said this a million times but you and Bill burr in the back of the store telling me your shows not that good you should just stick with stand-up the birther God right Jim I knew that you are way better than that I'm like you're not even doing your stand-up justice yeah I could see you do stand-up it's like you hadn't done it in five months you'd been fucking Thailand or some shit swinging off of a tree by your neck on a roller coaster with special peoples also I was worried you're gonna get killed like you do so many different things in so many different places I called him up once he was drunk on a motorcycle in Vietnam are these uncomplete lee unnecessary life skills what he learned in Rome boards what's harder oh the do those hover boards for in the in the in the ocean I'm gonna be no no I don't mean that I mean the things that the kids run around on just a wheel I'm it all new heels a wheel in the middle rich rebuilds you know that YouTube channel do you know who is rich but wah he's uh he's a YouTube host and he also he fixed is he's like the first guy to ever build a Tesla he bought a junked Tesla that somebody had let get flooded with water and he's just a really smart guy and he's a tech guy so he's like okay what the fuck is in that thing like how do I fix this like so all the wires were fucked up the battery was toast so he bought a crashed one and he took the battery and the engine out of the crashed one and put it in the one that he owned and then rewired and went through this crazy process to get a Tesla to work that he eventually did and now he has his own garage it's cool it's called the electric garage in Massachusetts where he rebuilds these Tesla's but uh what was my point oh he had one of those with a big-ass fat tire were you riding on it like a cord that's hard that looked hard that's hard to do Johnson I almost killed someone on a on a Segway one time I was in Rome and we were on segways and I was just screwing around and then I just hopped off but I didn't realize that when you hop off if you're leaning forward its T keeps going and this thing start whipping around me just and we're in like a big Piazza and I let just like oh of it didn't hit anyone but everyone around us was standing dead still like oh my god I would have been bodied right there you're supposed to dive on it like a good hero yeah do you know what fun than eight there's no way you're doing that fifteen people died just walk out casually boards that are jet skis where you go like forty feet up in the air oh those are crazy loads are funnest those do look cool I like the guy suit like get it turned over and like no put it and then it starts to go down and they just with extra speed just shoot it look hard what are they oh my god dude those things are fun as fuck yeah legit yeah I could do a backflip on one all you got to do is like fall backwards and then kick your feet around I picked up on that one quick hmm yeah there's a lot of useless skills I have from Travel Channel did you you traveled so much oh my god it always bothered me you know why I bothered me because I would have probably done it too if I was you and I was like god dammit how do you get out of that because I know that feeling like it's you have the best job ever you're on a TV show like oh my god I have the best job ever I'm a fuck I'm on the fucking TV show but yet you're still like fuck I got to get out of this yeah it's weird cuz you do get to go to really cool places and get paid for it yeah that was cool but you also mean you were thriller can you miss the end up more I missed Anna well what was happening in Tom's career was exploding at the top the day I fell off a waterfall do you remember that yeah I was in Aspen and Bush called me she's like I'm talking to Tom he's talking about these one-nighters but I want to do the funny bones I'm so far removed from stand-up I didn't even I didn't even know you could do one-nighters I didn't know that theaters were an option I think I was at a store a week later and you were like you know Tom's doing like legit theaters and I remember just going I missed what if I just missed it entirely he could have and some people do you all know guys that were really funny back in the day and then they somehow or another quit I fell apart dude what if you had lit been like I'm gonna lean into Travel Channel dude I was if you became a Christian like super Christian got a cross tattoo on your arm just to let them know you're really down with them I'm sure your reps told you all those things golf shirt on when I got fired from Travel Channel I've my world melted down that was right when we were getting fat shamed I was fat getting fat shamed LeeAnn scheduled uh we were going to you you saying you were getting fat shamed but you got to let people know like you don't really believe in fat shaming you weren't really getting fat at the time I got fired from Travel Channel I was I definitely was one sided and I felt it hardest blunt your friend was fuckin with you because he was worried you're gonna die do it though on a major platform yep it wasn't like a morning radio at the time and you go up now I'm gonna use this for fun myself DJ dad mouth is my favorite characters man with the Maggie show that was the one used to do that that was so fun I loved that you were doing that because I hated those shows I was like why would he do those shows what is the terrible you do morning TV dressed up like a fake rapper she's it this no segura created a character called DJ dad mouth and he would just show up places and the people did not know what the fuck to do with him because the lowest rung in all of show business is morning television reporting celibate I'm so sorry if you listen to this and you're a local morning television host look ice deliver newspapers okay good morning host it's it's one of the lowest rungs in all of show bus it's a weird rung where you're trapped it's like it's like you're broadcasting out of like a Christian convenience store or something it's very strange the worst part too is the four of us plus like 90% of the acts working those clubs do not have a fan base watching that show know you put it together you're like this is definitely a waste of time like we're wasting our time right yeah and then if that's the only one that morning yeah you woke me up at fucking 6:00 to do this to do good morning heartburn and it only works when you when you get in trouble yeah well you sure could like I remember one time I got shirtless and went up it and the in the weather and started saying there's thunderstorms Tom did DJ have you ever seen mark Norman's mark Norman's is great when he just goes up and she goes how you doing he just kind of gay let's get this started hungover horny look at you I mean he just toys but totally ruined it the relationship for the club really didn't know I went in there Tracy Morgan Tracy Morgan's is my first one that's my mating call yeah there's Diane they are dying when he does that big one in Shiki was in Chicago for sure cuz I know you kept hollering at bulls to give him like in the middle of it and yes great his trash I'm just crashed his two million dollar Bugatti today today yep a honda sideswiped him whoa Hell's Kitchen driving savage ran into a two million dollar Italian sports car fan I saw I did a show with him like a year and a half ago one of the oddball shows and he came in a all white Rolls Royce with a profession like with a driver you know I got chauffeured and he came in all white and had like a fucking enormous gold chain with a medallion yeah TM I was like that looks crazy he's like six hundred thousand so some crazy shit this is today yeah this guy sideswipe Tracy Morgan's convertible two million dollar Bugatti what he's letting people know well what's he know the Honda's defense it's a very low car he has a high car he probably looked over saw nothing that fuck you know is the car that was like two feet off the ground yeah small car what these cars are so hard to see if you're right next to him what does that do his insurance when he calls you what yeah I don't know if we can cover this I feel you're turnin fuck they probably that'll probably be like the final straw yeah probably kick him off the country for sure with that Tracy Morgan interview that was kind of but had to be an inspiration during the DJ dad mouth right to me that was the first one I remember like wow I guess I mean someone could fuck what you can fuck with them in that way yeah I mean yeah I mean it was funny because some people would be really into having fun with you like the Tracy Morgan people would they laugh and have a good time and then some people let me like I could see how a clone relationship could because we left one of the clubs when I told him I was coming out as non-binary and the lady was like what this is like on the air different genders and she was like alright and she just turned the TV and she was like oh she's was and then she called in that like we called the the PR person that drove us to the club or to the head didn't realize she's in the car what the fuck was that she was like that was that guy is so weird don't bring stuff like that in here oh we don't want to come in here babe they think that what they're doing is serious we're providing a wonderful morning show for downtown Pittsburgh you're showing them how to make fucking I try strong me saying yes exactly so it's so done what what a great sandwich hey thanks a lot we've got the she's gonna sing for us next I tried shitting on the last I went to Cleveland it was the normal that's why the other relationships still fired but I was like there was a doctor before me I was like why is he worse fucking doctor alpha to do this on the way out he put a sweater on in love I don't know it feels like you're stepping into like Truman Show stuff it's so contrived there's nothing real especially when there's like a 22 year old PA or Associate Producer one time I went in and I said yet I'm already drunk from doing radio I didn't just put the mic on my necklace and she goes why go I'm gonna take my shirt off she goes you will not be doing that and I said you don't tell me what to do excuse me I'll be right back and then came back and she goes what is in your cup and I said whiskey and she was like he's drinking he's drinking hold on oh my god and I was just like I was like we should buy leave he just left his left I was like I don't want to get anyone fired she's telling you you can't take your shirt off so I had a drink or have a drink I love how it's like she's telling me like she found something out you're like I was poor you in front of everybody I don't want to check out the bottle I think she's at an insurance company yeah hilarious if people don't know what job they're in take it more seriously where those morning shows fucked off like the way we're talking about be like the best morning show so much Tom Green had a great great what I remembering now back when he was like public-access yeah he's trying to promote public access oh yeah I'm a Tom Green show and he just took over he did some crazy eyes in the face yeah that's amazing like him and then that other dude Jamie Kennedy they did their best shit where they were like pranking people chuck us and then they just stopped yeah man but Tom's blew up so crazy so crazy some went to Amazon I couldn't it was stuff I couldn't even believe I'm green did Oprah Wow oh yes Oprah was like we're gonna like this it was such a phenomenal what was going on show was so big he milked it out with his mouth yeah but he put slut mobile on his dad my parents and then hid in the bushes yeah he didn't just like let me focus a man of people like my mommy and daddy people forget did people forget Tom Green what happened to before now he know he's all cancer had to take a break came back I can try to do like a more serious show with Humperdinck what's this guy's name but what is people forgot how big it used to be oh one of the man what he did was he did what we're all doing way before any of us but was one band with was too expensive you did I did it as house it was part of the inspiration for me doing one yeah and yes I even talked to his company they were based in Denver I was in Denver doing the comedy works and I talked to the company that was doing it for him and I was seriously considering doing something like that but the problem was that it like the band was crazy expensive he had cables running from the desk all the way through his living room into a server room he had a server room we'll have his house and it was crazy I know how much money is involved this he's like a fuckload of money and he was like I have to have all these people running it - that was Tom Green's green and he so what essentially was was he decided to try to do a talk show host I remember that Joe Rogan the fuckin log sleep under the short-sleeve Joe Rogan and am I look for a while with the torn jeans you were like I'm not coming to Hollywood giving up okay that was all based on once once which he had in his house I know he just go on and flip a switch and the show went on in one life so me and red van looked at it and we're like well how much is involved in this like what do we have to do to do something like this and then you know eventually it just led to with that and Koo Mia Anthony ku Mia was that was a bang yeah he had that live from the compound in his basement and then the way that Opie and Anthony ran their show was an inspiration to because it was just a hangout and it was my favorite show to listen to yeah cuz just a bunch of guys hanging out talking I was like that's like that's what I want to do four hours of them eating oatmeal I remember they just eat oatmeal and you'd be like oh yeah I was a big fan back then oh you tune in early oh and they'd just be eating breakfast and just going Jim would take a shit and be gone for 30 minutes because they you didn't have any at the 21st artisan faction or day they didn't have any advertisers so they had to fill four hours of content so they literally I mean uh everything went yeah when they first started on Sirius XM they had to fill four hours of content oh yeah no commercial there's no commercials that was the pitch crazy that Sirius said hey we don't have commercials your pay then you pay for it and then they just turned solid commercials like wait a minute aren't I fucking paying for this yeah and you get commercials - yeah that's cus Howard gotta get to paper we were people with the Hellmouth no fucking integrity of those dang it skate he gets kicked up so I mean he's he's locked up in a contract for for Liz life son he wants more money sure that's what Howard would do you know I mean but he makes up a sload of money yeah you know there's no one even close there's no second places he has just huge like he's a huge shareholder during that lost atutor that if we can get over let's say the number was a hundred million subscribers I get this gigantic bonus and then they bought serious serious and then I got so there's some sixty plus another forty is a hundred so I get it so we acquired that pay me motherfuckers I don't know what happened with it but well would remove right there you guys are done with the beef be with the legend thing he's retiring for this but yeah basically what he was saying was that the only reason that deal took place at all was because he was a was it serious or XM he was serious serious they were excess right right so the only reason why Sirius was kicking ass at all was because of Howard fuckin Stern period there was nothing wired I would have acquired and also the the model was like so you know suspect at the time you do right and go to a people people have to pay for what they just turn on deserves it here's why no one else could have carried that no no one else he was radio you know and especially at that time during that transition of satellite no one else would have got people to commit to having a fuckin satellite dish in your car never you had those stupid fucking antennas that you said put on your car to get to get serious the water went all the way through your car's gross minds and it would stick up like a pig tail out of the roof of your car and that shit yeah yeah and how I would cut out for like every turn any corner and it's all yours a building in New York City yeah Tunnel was dead the city's existed yeah whatever that country that company makes the only reason is still Howard Stern for sure only reason yeah for sure this it yeah I had XM and it was until Bennington and Opie and Anthony showed up it was painful I'd listen to Yacht rock yeah oh yeah I was cool though you like 90s rock three different channels of 100 different channels awesome yeah it was worth $1 a year I stood for best dude he's been doing on stage lately I hated my storytellers show too recently did the same thing just talking about the good old days of fucking drug addiction all you were to get down he describes the city that you're like oh my god I want to be there what year what first time in the city I went I left I went there six years Oh first I've ever been there yeah oh did you see Times Square when it was time yeah yeah yeah but I was like what's a woman wearing a bra whatever what they did in Times Square they turned Times Square into like no Disney mall it is discussed it's New York's version of like like Disneyland yeah it's disgusting yeah and it's a nightmare whenever you're visiting and also you know like when you're visiting you're in a car no need to go to this and all sudden you look up and you're like oh we infecting time school like you're just driving through and like you gotta get out of here man right like the weird chaos the but it's just like it's too commercialized oh no reason it feels like you're yeah everything that makes New York amazing is like gone gonnigan you joke about if you go for a meeting and then like you're walking and people are just looking up and he's like why Africa is funny that's funny yeah well it's like it's it's very Vegas esque it's like walking down the strip yes it is it's like what are the lights and then it's all fake no there's no Eminem's that's not where is invented so why is it a giant M&M store and when you knew used to know what it was like with like peep shows and xxx everywhere and those it was seedy and weird yeah yeah but ever dangerous yeah I was dangerous legitimately dangerous I mean the worst time what 70s 80s right I was like the worst crime time late 70s into the to the mid to late 80s I was hanging out in New York in the 80s when I was that was my pool hustling days and I was doing a lot of gigs I guess it wasn't the 80s it was the 90s the early 90s because if I 91 was I think the first time I performed in New York not even one or maybe 9m really yeah well this is like you're just starting out though kind of thank you got an billiards yes what was Chelsea Chelsea billiards Chelsea was where we would go to Amsterdam but AM stems on the west side back then it was on a move that's why I was called am stamping cents he was on the west side it was an awesome place I'm sorry that's where I became friends with Dom our era played pool with him in 94 at Amsterdam billiards I didn't know he played like when I wouldn't meet a pool player I got comic would actually plays yeah Dom could play he called me today I can't wait I love him so much but uh New York was a different place man I was around a lot of these like weird homeless grifter type characters a lot of dudes we get arrested for doing three-card Monte at the pool hall it was like the best education of like street culture like people who live on the street I mean okay maybe people are basically homeless like sometimes it's to here they're like my friend Johnny was always like staying in people say stayed in my house for sometimes he would stay in these weird little hostels and flop houses in New York and places that didn't have a roof like you have walls but they would be like no really everybody here I remember like me as a kid in that era the perception that you had of New York is like this is nothing but crime right dangerous you're not a little bow Giuliani you know clamp down on all that shit I remember I'm when I moved and I found a place and came back to get my stuff and I told Neal Brennan I was like I don't think they have bars in my back window don't need that he goes I'll do read the crime stats that's it's a different city though it's just not that city anymore 97 I was I mean I don't remember any crime with although I did get taken the three-card Monte a number of times put money to hell larious dude I so that and these fed this game where they had a nail and a piece of board and yet a hammer and you had three shots to get the nail in that they have that in Thailand dude I did over every fuckin toss so hard there was so many so hard yes there's so many hustlers right back in those days in New York yeah all many people trying to get off some kind of scam yeah oh yes I've been scammed by a driver in New York how what like this was not even that long ago I mean was tell me like seven eight years where no like you get in the cab and you're like you know if you don't live there but you kind of know like the layout you're just like basically I want to go up you know 20 blocks this way right and the guy just goes across town starts going up like the opposite highway like where we where I'm like which what are we doing exactly this already does you could track yourself on your phone yeah I'm just looking at it like what are we doing he's like going up to the I go couldn't have just gone up that Avenue that we were on he was like I don't know what's going on man this is fucking outrageous and then we pull up I see like the meter going going I'm like this is crazy that was suppose to be a 10-minute drive has taken 40 minutes he goes just pay me with you ever you want to pay me what yeah and I go guys he didn't want to get caught yeah and I go to say that so I go like the thing said like $68 and I was like here's 20 bucks he's like that's it we started more pace but won't pay so I'll see you man yeah but it was he he was totally with it yeah because he described me yes yeah yeah yeah I said Ezra once in Jerusalem when I got there I took uh I was like take me to Bnei Brock and it was I didn't realize I was three blocks over because you just told me like no that's right there dude they took me around the city and then let me um I know what I want to go home afterwards I look what I found out on my way on that cab ride because I started texting people at the next place I was like I was just leaving here and I'm going to see you should I be on the fucking highway - I need my passport and they're like no so you didn't speak Spanish in that moment he was a Nazi I would have taken I would have taken I would have gone right to Spanish gone to a language that makes me feel powerful Nigerian pocketed in Florence and I went into Russian everything every word I knew in Russia they yelled at the guy and he ran because he was like oh no he's like Russians are fucking animals she yelled out America you fucking traitor she'd yell that America and take your fucking shirt off and said I'm the machine and started running after a shrub all the fucker was up I'm scared more scared of you than write that down you should write that down you should write that whole thing down about you talking about on the radio that's hilarious Antonio why not stay then because the audience is gonna be like so wait what do you do then you pull out coke and you do a bun and then you start making no sense and then blood comes out of your nose it's an awesome show yeah you could do you want if you don't want to do the coke that night you take your high blood pressure medication on stage hopping around yeah you know what I'd love to start growing his cocoa plants the kind will you just chew the leaves how think you can grow them here I'm gonna find it suitable you can get there yeah you can make you could you could like organize it like a closet with some heat lamps and shit do you think that yeah for sure and I just have just to like chew a little bit well then for a job let's find out how many people are growing their own coca leaves in the United States nothing anyone want to what you're not why wouldn't you I would love to I think you need so much of it that's why those cocaine right me just make the Peruvian leaves I just wanna be like Barry Marcus it's a crazy that you chew those leaves it's actually hot bad for you at all right and the team with coca tea is great I've had that yeah that will settle your nausea you know what can you specially you get to like I'm serious like yeah everyone starts drinking it so to sign me up it's great isn't it crazy that everybody just thinks this one thing is the processed chemicalized fucking version that Scarface and clumpy how many people have died because of cocaine oh my god Laura how many murders is there another drug on the planet that has inspired more murders than cocaine Yeah right and I would love to know murders versus number of dick sucked for it man if everybody got murdered every time they did coke they don't but a lot of people get their dicks I don't like it might not be everybody but it's like 30% right cuz girls can't afford coke too if they're young and they're partying and they're out and and some fucking guy comes along with a fat Tracy Morgan like gold chain that's how good coke is though yeah that's how good it is right you that that people are like for sure I'll just blow this stranger oh yeah so get coke that didn't do coke they would get coke just so they'd have Coke so how it was around for those four women if girls wanted Co Wow cuz some girls when they want coke they

saw I thought I have I know exactly what we're doing okay so this happening though right so part is we're going so coach over Tom's got an aggressive schedule I think we should go no coffee okay really sobriety by on a coffee because I think we should make it harder ain't no no booze no alcohols easy thing uno water it's Tom sober you're not sober you're on a mild stimulant I think it's cheating I think we should go no coffee I like no coffee I like no coughing no coffee oh wait wait wait we really can only drink water the whole month no other drinks oh I'm fucking in no other drinks sponsored water carbonated why it's his water I'm like no that works I like where you I'm ramping up I'm ready to go to war wait only water and carbonated water yep I'll do that I'll do that I'll do that oh so no coffee so what you wouldn't have milk in your coffee well yeah no lunch we should go carnivore diet all month nothing but ribeye steaks that's all right relax why not I'm willing to negotiate with what I think challenge should be for what you think our restriction should be I well what do you think the challenge should be have an idea of a challenge abhi is about health right yes yeah it's not what do you want to be I I think it should be if mental health is a legit part of health you should give up your fucking dopamine fucking addictions and your cell phones yeah get where your cell phones your social media for a month I get your yeah I get why you wouldn't do it cuz your career you can email your fucking ladies to fucking post shit for you ladies I think you have a good point with this I do I really do I think about you sometimes when I when I feel like I've been on like a flight or in a hotel room and I'm like I think I've been look at my phone for like three hours think I've gone out yeah yeah yeah it's just being I just think it takes being the the connective tissue away from this this challenge to the people that enjoy watching this challenge I think a lot of people enjoy your show that won't be up but that will be a problem I mean I really was a rock let's do it and then November first everyone's like oh yeah you guys did so October I forgot about that I could get each of you and I'll Cattell I could and I understand I'm not like Joe who says do what I do and then I'll just fucking have an easy time of it I will go with no cell phones I will do beyond what I already okay let's do what you guys did saying it wasn't a challenge in that like there was no contest if it was I had to do yoga the most my guys alright that's it that's it maybe it's the most 90-minute yoga class Alton can reverse to gauri see you here his mental health it's a good point we all would definitely look at these beautiful I think you can also get a like a legit real camera if you wanted film stuff give it to your fucking assistant so you could have it posted secure this out and post whatever you need to OB how about this how about this we run the most miles in a month retract it track it let me just go for a baseline right now how many miles a month do you run right now it's up there man okay what about you it has to be real running I wanted a real I don't want that bullshit on a fucking treadmill rocky shoes with a Bluetooth capability in them yeah wear the wrong shoes so we're gonna was on we're gonna run for miles but so first you're already doing running Hillsman oh when you go for a right now it's no more than an hour hour and 15 minutes like a marathon right there no no up hills up hills he's probably running six miles I'm running some steep shit it's more like it's it's more sprinting it's like there's a lot of plyometrics it's more like that you're not just flat running at a steady pace so do you sprint run chasing my dog too or have I'm trying to make it hard I make a pretend things are chasing me I play little games yeah nice I pretend I have to get to the top or everyone I know dies yeah yeah whatever you got in your brain give it to me a little bit when I workout you don't want it yeah it ramps up it wraps up this crazy we were going guys we were working out like six seven hours a day it was terrible man but the whole time I was like I do zero working out so this is yeah you looked great when we were like three weeks into the month and you were here we did a podcast together and you use my fucking rower you did an hour on the rower and you were ripped you have a six-pack I was like look at this motherfucker I'm that was pretty impressive an hour on the rower is real work that's real work you were not gonna not get ii did not like it here's what here's what I'm hearing or he wants to do a challenge that Hurley excels at I get it about you dude and you're complaining about Joe is that he keeps logging in things that he is good at so yeah I will take care of this gentleman looks you ready well sir this years sober October physical challenge like you're presenting it like a fucking but presidential candidate it's like an apple when I win it's gonna be good hip hop dance it's been let me solve cell you let me solve son okay we each get a choreographer and we work dance classes as much as we can dance

guys hear me out everyone listen to me are you sure he's putting the fucking bailed on oh okay all right I haven't even touched this thing since October hey was made with any sort of RO belt man we go to dance classes to get our skill set up we each work with a choreographer to create our own dance to the exact same song at the end at the end at the end by the way I'm selling this to the room you're threading that through your jeans at the end of the I bard tempo it melts onto at the end of the month come November first we each submit our one-minute hip-hop dance choreographer choreography video and the fans vote on who the winner of sober October is gentlemen I would like to hear your bottles starting with Tom Segura I got to tell you watching this your rebuttals okay Punk : yeah you put you put your certain mention that here's what I'll tell you what I like about it it's easy to say what I don't like about anything that comes out of your mouth yeah so what I don't like about it or what I do like about it is that no one's great at it I do like sure that it is a workout because those dancers are unbelievable do you think there's not one dancer right now me first Joe seconds not even close what are you talking about it's definitely me what I'm Way better dancer than you guys you out of your fuckin mind do you know whose ants no but I'm not better dancer than you guys listen I could do a lot of crazy shit with my body you guys can't do that's true but I'm saying rhythm you have rhythm yes alright hold on you have rhythm I know I do I'm fucking phenomenal at dancing but no one's saying is that nobody excels I mean I always been better than you but nobody excels so I like the idea of working at something that you know no one's great at and any dancing movie I was in the movie zookeeper yeah I I took dance classes oh all right I dance my ass off bitch I love all the movies make it seem normal that that guy could get that girl I know okay well yes like legitimately I mean I'm not good range oh this is hip-hop dance we're talking about look at his face yeah dance come on son oh yeah they're pretty good they're actually alright I took fucking dance lessons I did do it for weeks are you dancing with Nikki Glaser Leslie Bibb she's from Talladega Nights yeah yeah she's great she's great very funny person - that sounds like a deal there's mathletes the last thing that is great okay so everybody gets to work at it nobody excels too much at it I think it's funny that we're comics and we get to look silly doing something no I did not look great at it and I'm on board with I think it's fun that people that watch that or get really into it would have a say in it okay I'm the only one of the three of us there's not obese so it would look Lilly silly for me I'm medically obese I think up okay how about the BMI son yeah it's all about the BMI BMI is off the tree you're saying that you are in do it or not I'm saying I would look at least silly just in terms of that but you guys that get why you look silly just moving at all hmm we also Neil you're silly yeah I'm not I'm not a fucking fat make yourself always you're always breaking yeah break yourself before you break ankles and elbows and shake your owns breaking I am break the bets get super fucking vulnerable I am it's good point without injury what's injury early no no dance classes are intense do you really think you're the current best dancer easily I think yeah I definitely saw we get each get ourselves choreographers yeah and we create our own dance to the exact weight wait for me to talk about this okay but the amount of Molly I would have to do to enjoy that dancing but you can't be sober but you can November first is that when we post ideas the dance party sober here's here's problems with it number one it's subjective you can't have something subjective you can't have so the whole thing Tom dance better wrong thing or dance better can't have a bunch of morons vote for okay okay let me let me break this down finish up I'm gonna write what if what if what if the dance pros got together that's what I was saying great judge well yeah there Bert better they like me better you don't want that judges they literally go to jail but so we have to agree no bribing I can bribe all the judges no no nothing subjective we got a grind we gotta make it our comfortable pot never make it super uncomfortable if you want to make I'm pretty uncomfortable glasses it's alright eleven born 15 dance dance classes hey pop this up there's something about the fitness challenges that are more exciting to me because baby fitness all the time and whatever goes I'll do something you guys don't do a fitness challenge you guys don't do yeah or that I don't do rather right okay that's your try to say that I don't they don't ever do I'll ride bikes on go fuck my spikes ride bikes everywhere right store accessible ride bikes Tom's on Europe ride a bike bitch you go to your right bike so I'm in Europe in October for a lot of those countries have you scheduled an Australian sort of cancel yet okay it's coming up Oh I know that when you cancel it I can't feel close cancel it I've canceled before uh just once I think it was dry a couple times you get sick yeah the only time it's been in Australia the only time he's been Australian was opening for you with our UFC ticket really no I went I went also another time I did the Melbourne Festival yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm in auckland June 5th take this Sydney June 20th I'll be in Columbus I know there's a bunch of people who've oh we want to like be able to vote no one's stealing this you're gonna have to earn this motherfucker so you say this you're thinking of up here this is mine so the fizz like yeah I like it I'm gonna keep it I'm gonna keep this this is mine the flaw he's saying is that there's not like a clear right that it's yeah you can't leave their hands the judges get the fuck out of here that's rule number one for fighting never leave it in the hands of the judges okay it's not rule number one it's probably like rule number yeah it's down there first is like you know watch out for the judges like oh my god that's funny uh-huh I was really behind your dance I did yeah dancing would be tough I do have a gym for you home it's a place right nearby me Joe Joe I think you're overestimating your dance skills hip-hop this it's not met dance skills don't learn them would it be amount of time is not my body better I'll learn them you know how to move your body better for sure you know how to lose move move my body better than you can move yours do they get your cure easy that is really even say that yeah do you know it is for you to say that physical dexterity or physical if I got through that challenge and you didn't pretend you came in last like you did with this last one put a sock in a fucking with a lock in it like a bike lock and beat your ass school punishment for this I'm cool with punishment that's a good idea barbi openness right like Full Metal Jacket real instrument Baro code right hate you out with a bar soap and a sock and hip hop dance I think that even Matthew Modine got in on this number yeah I did that's right yeah Celie felt bad about being hot about this is the real thing so you don't know what's real I think you need to pump you think your challenge if you like I could see us going through all these fucking things and bird the I was like well you guys be I can't believe it like you motherfucker you're talking shit the whole month yeah talking shit the whole month you came in last yeah that's my game plan that's a good point there's no sandbags a fucking October each beam fell apart dude I fell apart okay when are you started posting these giant he biked for four hours what what oh why fuck my head up Tasos yeah Geoff fucking we started well we started off with like 200 points was a good day it was like it was like that scene and big when when Lovitz is telling what's the things like hey slow down slow down someone you can make it look better a see anybody was gonna take it we're not sure how much we hated each other to the really dry bus to not be well I don't know how you looked at it but I love you guys it was a fun competition stand by it is the most amount of points you ever put in a day my biggest point day was we went you ran 13 mile one day yeah they're all broken up no no just I mean like just a really I'm going oh yeah I did it in the hills and you know just kept a grin like to another city James yeah here in 13 fucking miles that was after he was sick for a week yeah cool why did you take the foot off the gas pedal we should have waited to leave with you today for sure tom was like I'm sick I'm out so I was like Tom's and lasts not have to worry I'm not álast oh is that what you were worried about yeah I was like I was I was competing with Tom and I were neck-and-neck Artie was a fucking cunt and we just post numbers in the middle the night you'd go to sleep he did that like 2/3 in Oh he didn't start like that I posted them away cuz at my gym blink Fitness would allow me to work out 24 hours a day so I get off work out you wake up messy Blaine asked you for giving me late spots it's not my fault it's all rusty it's tricky right yes a lot of gameplay but here's what I love just realizing you guys woke up like I'm it Oh y-yeah I'm not in first so I'll tell you this like this here's what I'm okay keep this I think you guys should do it dance-off anyway well he does have that incredible physical dexterity you would need a way for judge this side but that's not about working out them right hip hop dancing no to hip hop dancing if you're gonna get good you're gonna be dancing every single day so let me show me a tweet I made recently a year ago I'm like how did we get from Bert can run a marathon - all gonna go straight edge for a month he couldn't do it faster than your dad yeah Holocaust survivor and then he was but he was also like I can run marathon tomorrow kind of did yeah you did technically Dan I did blow the doors off you guys you were really real amazed but I think the real test was that tom was gonna try to roller skate a marathon but you didn't take an account going uphill or the fact that he there's never roller-skated yeah but that's easy to learn yeah it's like it's like for us what do you think would have happened on the roller skating part of it after running at marathon yeah uh you would have crushed you thank you probably beat me yeah it was a flat you know hold on LA Marathon was uphill downtown but once you got past the store you would have been hauling fucking ass down La Cienega yeah it would never call from the from cellar to the no B yeah a couple roller skating people reached out to me and they were like the hill like you know they said like your feet are gonna you're gonna be in rough fucking it's not it would blow our warriors I get it from people that have been doing it for years and also like was that the roller derby people they were like yeah you got to be careful well just think about skiing for five hours if you notice great as that would be yeah you want to ski for five hours straight without going up lift hills going up the lifts oh yeah up the hills if you just skied only only on your feet for five hours I bet you'd be hurting yeah oh yeah anyway it's muscles all sore yeah my feet are always hurting after a day of skiing yeah yeah no it would have been I would have been fucked up first you got fucked up did you see me crash Burt didn't know yeah I did I did and then I pulled up and you were like oh only it's broken broken is it I gotta put it put a pin in it this is all cast I saw you we have the big wealthy yeah it's down to this now we show up you got pin in there like a metal piece broke off I have some sort of pin you know it's good about that it give one more reason to fuck with the people at TSA you're fucking my vasectomy do that like how come something's going off to everything you're talking for sex mate it's like everything you're talking like vasectomy like what about belt my vasectomy and like what what what do you think it's I'm like I had my dick cut and you're fucking stupid thing that you're the head of this company decided we need to buy but it points out that I got a vasectomy really how does it know you out of a secta me because it's a little inconsistent it's like a hard thing in there p-nut you want to feel it no your choice interesting so it's calcified yeah I like that yeah Rockne dickhole yeah so no I'm a fucking terrorist threat so I want to ask you one thing about your challenge you say no we're not going are you no no I just wanted the stairs but like that's proposed that yeah there's not enough of it has to be a second part to that right for the month what do you mean yes there's nothing physical yeah good point you know I mean like is there it would just be it would that would we would need a second part because right that is just a mental problem yeah well it would guys I'm telling you you're not gonna do it I know how addicted you are you're never gonna agree to that's dancing Nadia's uh it would make your lives you'd be happier and you wouldn't know why hmm no I've been off Twitter pretty much and it's I'm an exponentially a port witty to Twitter just makes me sad and angry reading people fighting is not fun can I uh can I show you something sure yeah I'm not gay fun for me I won't do anything but just I'm

it's gonna be up there okay so just just tour dates bro yeah okay so today of your life you have a family you have two kids I started morning radio at five in the morning hold that thought so while you're on morning radio you're not using it no I was using entirely to look up who I was talking to where I was at while you're on there yeah you're not doing it yeah okay what time is it right now it's 426 yeah three hours and nine minutes oh I'm sorry three hours i minutes above average today yeah today was it press press for the body shots world tour last seven days starts in September and November 23rd I'll be in Auckland you actually surprised me 30 minutes a day yeah I don't I do not fuck with Instagram a lot is that on here yeah it's we have an hour or 18 minutes yeah I fuck with Instagram a lot that's it what do you do I do die that's it I don't die don't touch Twitter I kindly stay away from everything I see yours no yeah how bad is it it's today's not that bad look up screen time for the week yeah are there totally days I'm totally off my phone you don't talk to a law or the court stuff and post it but I don't read comments the stuff that can fuck your head up Twitter can be aggressive sometimes it's great used to be how to do stuff on jokes yeah I can't I could do time my whole things about I only use stuff to promote tour dates that's it really sorta it's like like I did an hour of social networking it says yeah in seven days seven to seven day okay hold on hey let's get more cocktails I'm down I am pretty boomers are kickin it hey wait hey how're we gonna fuckin switch him over to fuckin hip hop dance slowly slowly yeah it starts with how much but I let me practically say I was on a bus for the last seven days sure so just a good definitely I'm saying an at home not home we're screen we're checking our amount of usage on online on our phones down a bus but this by the way this time could be spent reading book or doing something but it's a day no 30 minutes I think it's pretty look six hours of thirty minutes a day but there's a far better way to spend your time Yeah right you know what I was like you know what you're here's that but you have to kind of look at it like this too I'm sitting on this bus with a fucking thousand movies so you can choose from and I do this all the time where I roll through like I'm gonna watch a movie which is like a normal thing to kill you're an hour and a half two hours and I'm like none of these interests me I'm gonna spend that time doing this right looking at emails looking at social media looking at YouTube videos it's if I'm saying that you can knock off easily through three hours yeah and there'd be two hours spent just mindlessly staring at something else or you wouldn't be having a record of writing or thinking that's true or like but you're saying that none of that occurred we're learning hip-hop dance no I'm saying that I will say this when you're bored and you're looking out a window on a tour bus eventually not the first ten minutes but that may be but seeing 10 minute 30 a minute 40 your mind's eye fuck we're so bored and then you start writing bit ideas yeah that's true and you're just not even thinking about those times because you're on there that's true it's 100% true wait so what's yours eight minutes I would have to get my iPad out I know what yours is yeah take it out is surprisingly high because thirty minutes yeah today was the two hours and six minutes that's that's too much today no fun in this what is it I love the one guy that doesn't have an iPhone's walking you through your iPhone 5 hours and 30 minutes for and 51 minutes a day Wow so uh 4 hours and 51 minutes of your day like you're 16 hour waking day in Joe's defense not a but like he's got to bring new people all the time and I'm sure there's times he's like tell me about that guy dot dot dot I keep hearing in my defense in my defense but I'm never in my offense where I'm like that's too much it's too much it is too much you do do some work on your phone but more more than that you fuck off I have every note transcribed on my phone all my notes from my writing my laptop it's all on my phone all my sets around my shows your productivity on there yes what you using a time line yeah they won't be it's not like it's gonna be four hours and 35 minutes of productivity and 20 minutes of fucking off no no a lot of it is also watching stuff you want - uh fartie and let's take it let's play a game look I can go hey tell me about dot dot dot what you googled earlier one fucking game oh I got a computer give me one like I'm not a computer on give me your phone oh no that's ours a lot of waking time stood looking at a screen instead of your surroundings Wow what is the last things I googled it's writing part of that you can't you're not using it you're fucking it's me and it's you and then it's just some porn hmmm how much - I really like anal scenes you beaten off everyday no I just started again interesting take some time off yeah I took some time off I was having a hard time with it and now I'm no this is his phone this is our ease phone laptop that's the right year to buy honestly cuz a keyboard yeah all the ones the ones they got now are fucking whore the problem is with it that you can't do the same things on Instagram what you can't post stuff for me a fucking computer no I have to send it to my lady you can't post it for a mom an iPad yes he probably could no I can't but I blocked out of my out of my accountant topic I don't like hospital areas yes yeah smart yeah smart knob does not make for a great sober October challenge in my opinion just to watch people do nothing is not it'll still get unless he's saying that it would still get posted everything that's to get posted no and I'll buy you each a good a camera legit like digital streamer of this challenge is that yes enjoy like following along in terms of what we're doing but that it's not our normal thing Rogen clearly it's working out so he doesn't have to change his life that much all you do is promote it wouldn't be the worst for you to not have what you're already doing is promoting non-stop all he has is hip-hop dancing okay so then what's Tom bad at what big a father Oh how do you handle this what yeah what do you do how do you handle this how do we do that no I didn't say what I didn't hear you about what are those pronouns you mean I mean I'm saying like I like the idea of some sort of social media challenge like staying off social media with something that's the thing we're we're missing the second point every cent you're dead on get on with that the bird can go fuck himself with this hip hop dance and shit that's all Joe place right near my apartment that I could go to all the time I told you I'm in you're in do you think so hip hop dance would be a good one I think you I think let's put a pin it out I think for real okay put a pin in it that would be at some level of acceptable we'd have to get judges challenged ov is no one that's assault if no judges judges can go fuck themselves we want real hard numbers you can't have a decision that causes a riot amongst our fans I feel like I'm living if we won film we got the bail even if we don't do this there was something so real about how good you are you said you're a better mover than him that I would love to see I feel like part of the month you have to do something with that you know I mean I think the audience would love it make sense it's got to be here's the deal this one's just put parameters on where of October it's gonna be taking place tom is touring through Europe in a hole for part of it yet really yeah yeah how many days ten days I don't crippled you you get sick to do what any fitness I'm Carney laying it down yeah forget about any fitness challenge son ten days in Europe yeah all that traveling but with those weird European diseases oh yeah that's how

coming to you about a Comedy Store Milo I think it's directly related yeah yeah I think it wasn't a creek in the cave right but that's why they love it no they were trying to do it at the creek in the cave the lady freaked out right she buckled under pressure that's not why they're moving they're already gonna move it they're already gonna move it there's new Stan was opening up though they'll use this as an excuse maybe or people will say that's the reason to do oh you're gonna move it wait start from the beginning for someone who doesn't know you're talking yeah it was a books Legion of skanks you know who they are yeah and Lewis right Louise yeah and uh Lewis Gomez and Gomez and uh Dave Smith and they they're hardcore guys except when they come on this podcast kind Plus out but like hardcore guys for the most part and so they booked yeah they bitched out on the same yeah I don't understand that I thought we just had a conversation that's fucking imagine jackass in the heyday of jackass and them all sitting here politely I'm not trying to fucking shave their heads in front it's like come on dirt obviously they need a second chance on this patient's come up and do something crazy they just came here I had a good time with you yeah been fun nice cotton nice conversation propolis and Milo said they cooked out so now he's running with the narrative so they booked Milo no I go we have this guy who's been fucking out whatever and then uh and then everyone started going doing this thing where they attack the venue if you have that problem it's not enough that they can miss analyze the person or say I want nothing to do with that guy then if you put him up then you're the issue a woman who's gave birth to tons of fucking great LGB a and fucking black performers she's an issue because she's not stopping of a performance from happening and then soon it'll be like if you perform at that venue then you're an ass way right right you know it's nonsense happening yeah what's the AC or a lesbian gay bisexual Alliance oh they have a lot more since I left college but that's what I was told oh yeah that's the problem is when you look at LGBT which is like the accepted use of those letters we say in the end we were like Oh a is now asexual and Finn Taylor does a great joke where it's like they're included but because the reality is the asexuals hate the other ones like you're disgusting I don't care what sex you're having a lot of lesbians you're not really excited about transgender men or transgender women rather trophies so there's that there's turfs you know trans exclusionary radical feminists no I don't know busy fucking living my life for now fuck you trying to dominate or try to dominate yeah I didn't know you were trying down there wait can you fill me in more on this though so tell me about domicile with wait let's not leave dominating I want to write that down but there was a big uproar a lot of comedians started trying to like show how they were woken up and they're like I don't think you should do it kruipen republic lee quit putting rebecca in this position telling the guys in Opelousas was gonna be in here's how you can tell someone is a fucking white knight virtue signaler when they don't go to you saying hey Tom I'm calling on the phone you don't do this but I get it I might not have your number so if I'm tweeting at you I'll just write at Tom Segura don't do this if I really want to purchase things I'll go dot at Tom Segura hey at Tom Segura so it's not just me and your followers and everybody anytime anybody sees if you're listening you see somebody not start with the act that is then virtuous signaling on purpose and own onyx unless they're saying something positive they just want to have sure oh yeah absolutely that's right good point like hey everybody come see Tom you know you don't say Steve Saphir I loved your new Netflix special yeah don't let the Jew our yeah thank you it's great it's great our everyone I saw some of our your Jew buddy Milo he's gonna appear on the show yeah all these comics all these people start saying I will never go to the creek again it put unbelievable pressure on her

they said we're doing this we're not talking they started going to war with these fucking virtuous signal or comics okay and then at some point the Rebecca I talked to our budget I know this is not my thing I don't even want to do it and I'm a Becca what you do is you stand by your comics and so you let them do whatever they want obviously I've been in the room II have down the wrong side I've had

saying that yeah it's not enough of those guys you're getting smacked yes well she's not gonna that's what Dee has always said there's really good sense that delirious delirious what is completely ridiculous it's insane it was crazy is a provocateur yeah he fucks with people he pushes buttons and he does so in the age of the Internet yeah he's a great troll the thing that they got him on which is where it all got weird was essentially him saying that it should be okay what happened to him when he was molested that he was abused sexually molested by priests and this priest he you know he would joke around and say that he was the one who pursued the priest that he was trust me I was the predator like that's that's how he said it it's he's hilarious and that's what got him it was talking about that on my show and then talking about it on this other show wasn't it the amazing atheist show was right the point is anybody who says like you shouldn't be allowed to put that person can't be heard anymore that's what you're saying but that's what it was but it was really just his harsh critiques of liberals and feminists that were so biting and then you know he actually did a podcast with jordan peterson recently we talked about the the molestation I didn't see it but from Jordans explanation it's like he's understanding now as he's getting older that yeah he was a victim of this thing and he was making it less and less actual yeah yeah that he was giving this guy like like a pass that he did it to him almost yeah maybe the creak of the cave is a great place for your comments in New York she's always like is nothing but great it to make fun I saw it's it's like they they bring together young comics and like give them Foreman no one's it's it's it is it is what the Comedy Store was if you take away the socks at fifty twelve plus your class how many seats is it eighty on top and fifteen twenty and the bottom Jesus I walked in I walked in this is my impression of

that's why told me in Hong Kong they like listen if you see hold on not every man Lander from mainland China shits in malls but if you see shit in them all that's a mainlander yeah disgusting they just shit in the mall yeah there's a shit Masek Chinese people just shit in the mall hold on the bathrooms so the ground the ground so case you're walking through the mall you see human shit on yeah they don't know how to be Chinese doors are underrated worst toys in the world well I have Chinese tourists are the worst tourists when they're saying the Trump we're gonna hold our tourism back all that the fucking travelers like please get there so they just some folks who live in rural China's alive the children you've been there yeah well it had these shorts its wide shorts with a cut down the middle so when you open stand-up the cut comes together when you squat so you don't have to fucking lift your shorts out it comes out and then just shit away shit where they're walking ten-year-olds just anxious how do I get those pants for Sunday's what is this why kids keep crapping in public and childbirth with the fucking common sense Chinese tourists not poop on the ground oh my god roll down that for a second five worst tours Chinese foreign away number one like like fucking Richard Pryor Chinese replace Americans as the worst tourists in the world we never were says if they're obnoxious oh my god this is a terrible article yeah although although have you ever been a shit in public apparently oh my god this is on Vice yep UK vice UK vice House the air but that we're so we're reading this folks if you hear those words I have not said that I'm reading something off of a other the title the records people re did say everything far the worst tourists Israel and Russians tied why Israelis I'm missing Australians the bogans arsed garbage are you serious yeah it inflicted them into the world like go learn on their turf Wow bogans are off I don't have the army and they think they can fucking go nuts yeah III don't know but people don't like Israeli tourists really yeah they got a reputation about them they know that yeah it's a way down the line no Americans are not celebrated in a lot of parts where you travel to men we celebrated a lot of people only ones who tip consistently our core people like our money yeah and the ones who travel are not the fucking rednecks I guess that's true gone and gone to the world but sometimes they are that's the church sometimes there's a lot America saying there's plenty of obnoxious yards traveling yeah yeah definitely but we're not in this top five really interesting I would have flown it assumed normally shitting at the mall horse is insanity dude like for you to think that people are gonna be like oh yeah you just gotta take a shit right here sure like I gotta piss in public at other things like block me make it block me you know they're just gonna shit real quick it's like we're in the woods that I gotta piss there's no like embarrassing level that's how they feel they don't even worry about who cleans it up do they my mind is no wiping everybody do that if everywhere you look to have a shit Jesus so if you were to confront somebody like right after the fuck did you just do that really way talking do you think that they would confront you with like what you just got in your car yeah what do you think that it's where they're living is so overrun with people let they just shit anywhere and they don't think that anybody has a problem with the environment well now you're asking me to speak expert and I will and yeah I think they have no expectation of privacy because they're so fucking on top of each other their homes extremely clean take off your shoes before you come inside really think about is this thing like merit I'm not but I'm saying mayn't but there's in on the mainland you know China's over a billion people yeah so you have a lot of like really poor educated rural parts and like saying that somebody in that area does this I'd be like yeah are you saying that like even somebody that lives in Beijing or Shanghai who has a job for Wall Street no they don't no they don't so that's what it's like not all mainlanders with shit in malls right but if you see shit in them all it is a family and let's be clear when they say kids what age group is it high school kids we're trying to fuck or is it like four I wasn't in China I was in Hong Kong Singapore in Macau so now the Macau butts funny when you're in Macau which is obviously big casino kind of tourist destination all the people there they eyeball immediately who that's all you who's like a mainland Chinese person you know because they can tell about well that's a different type of thing where if there's somebody's like you see dudes in Macau in like Versace shades and like Fendi and Gucci and like I mean crazy outfits you're like God yeah what's up with that dude and they'll be like that's just a mainland dude who knew money he just got rich Wow it's all over Macau B we just know and then you see the old money it's like England almost yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll say on country you do the accent without saying the words okay okay go Russia don't say the words just make the noises they make don't do anywhere any words the samurai speaking Sasquatch footage no no one of the dumbest things that Duncan and I did were doing that no no we went and studied Bigfoot one of the dumbest things like our I did the show with me mm-hmm and one of the things that we did when we studied Bigfoot was talked to a Bigfoot expert that was playing us some audio and some of the audio it sounds like a samurai it sounds like the guy was claiming that this was like a secret recording of Bigfoot really oh my god it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard anything by the way in your conspiracy theories yeah and like what you challenged was there anything that you ended up going oh like oh good question not dumb yes really Morgellons disease or George Ellen's disease is a disease where people is it more challenges I was called but you're saying you deem it thank you yeah I thought it was bullshit before cuz I had read that it was bullshit and what I read was that the people would think that they had things grown other skin so they'd be scratching themselves and they would add fibers to their skin and take pictures of it and say look I've got things growing out of my skin and that it was a hoax but then talking to a doctor who had more Jones who explained to me that there's some sort of neurotoxic effect of Lyme disease and that everyone who has more Jones also has Lyme disease yeah and he was a legitimate doctor in a very smart guy he was essentially saying that mainstream science in its rush to prove he's gonna piss in that come on man but you're gonna get kicked off of YouTube with your dick out just cut straight Tuesday anyway that that is a real disease that there's more gel ins disease is what it is is is Lyme disease the there's a bunch of pathogens that come with Lyme disease you know it's not just the Lyme disease it's not like a pure one you know like a one or a zero either you have or you don't it's a dirty tick there's a bunch of fucking horrible diseases inside this nasty little body would you know if you had limes yes you get a bull's-eye like like looking red mark around the area and the area hurts and then you start experiencing terrible symptoms like flu-like symptoms and okay you gotta get really quick bring up the reves to catch it quick washes teeth and he's like he couldn't like go back and forth was like what the fuck my friend's kid got Bell's palsy where's you know he starts oh my god feature that that had Bell's palsy in high school and they kept him out and then he came back and he was okay no but he he came back while he still had the face paralysis um were like looking at this dude we had a student a year older than me our Bell's palsy and we mocked them relentlessly look where you should have stage no that's on stage and his face started going on him and he had to hold his cheek over to finish his jokes then they called his brother in lawyers I think I'm having a stroke I'm about to get on a plane with him I'm gonna stroke the next morning his face was numb and driven his brother-in-law goes go to the fucking doctor right now he means you're having a 20-hour stroke it was Bell's palsy and so what do they do about that if he's nothing fucking nothing just wait at it dude I get I wake up gift at it Eddie IFFT a tattoo I think it's a virus you'd be good at it palsy every fucking morning why have don't you think of that it's my ritual every more like left I thought he was doing Stallone impression he said does he he got it when he was young sometimes it doesn't go away whoa and so he brought so we're about three mouths does it affect the spelling or spell it doesn't help well basically he looks better now I hung out with him this weekend but uh so easy back on stage back on stage just happened he spent like three weeks in his sister's basement just being like it's never gonna come back my career's over I can't go onstage like he tried to do a show and he said everyone was just staring at it like this like oh so what do they do to fix it nothing you just wait you just wait till it starts coming back yeah I think he said reboot was like right leave your face so you gotta get ko'd wait so why do you think about this every morning do ya especially won't get ready for a special I think like what if I got the morning the morning of my special the secret time I woke up and I smiled no one I beat Bell's palsy that's the first thought I had Jesus Christ in this conversation I can't believe I'm involved in this county we freaked out palsy you know what else I forget I think of alopecia this hair before everyone gets out every little every comic at the store had it Byrne had it I met I met had it everyone got it at one point and I just was like don't give all the hair fella just in a circle normal at it weird when I was a kid yeah I think about alopecia too and so a sin that it never that's my thoughts on Mike Tyson I like a weird circle in his head for a while didn't know it yeah wait you said you were gonna dominate earlier well you know just don't like to dominate you got to give it the context again I know but yes I do you like dominating or dominating life in life yeah crushed hearts you have time to dominate because you don't you know on your phone that's what it was yeah I can do so I can masturbate multiple times a day instead of just once like you guys there was a lady though right do we should honestly guys it might not be this year about the fuckin America media stuff your wedding is next you're gonna take that decade shit I'm gonna shoot some hot ones into you I love you so much I got my dick fixed that's real life you might have reconnected yeah they pull the straw out of one of those sea turtles noses and they use it to fix my dick I know this drop video with the sea turtles knows no the most horrific video it's the reason why they don't have plastic shut up if you're like why the fuck do we have plastic cups two lids why don't we have plastic straws the reason why is because there's a fucking video of a turtle and they have a clamp I don't know if this is the main reason but it is for a lot of people yeah clamp this straw in this turtles mouth and they eventually pulled it in his turtles nose rather it was deep in his nose yes you can one of those so see that's a that's a striking to tell you that got stuck it is so much harder it is so much harder to watch this happen to animals and to people how do we not know this wasn't a night of cocaine gone wrong look at that poor turtle so he inhaled this yeah good one so they realize that the straw was stuck and apparently this is not a little eating it's this isn't is not an unusual thing so they have to put weight what do they tweezer guy get a real tweezer guy scaredy scared and just cut he's got little hands to it's got little fucking

Matthew Walker's a sleep doctor it's the best way to describe right five listen to that podcast crazy podcast but you know he talked about it the mechanism like what what THC does it helps people go to sleep but there's certain parts of the sleep that you're not getting who know there's an arson there's an argument that it there that not getting it that not getting that sleep is okay that you're you're getting plenty of sleep because you're you're the reason why THC puts you in that drink you're recovering and you get there's an argument that somebody made online that I don't know if it's correct some someone wrote an article about it that that that is okay to not get that it's a good point whatever kind of sleep that came from the THC let's see you can sleep the most in October I think love that idea love that idea most hours sleep you take ambien oh no no do you take anything to go to sleep no I'll take a xanax every now and then my cardiologist told me never to take them so I may I'll get a prescription for 34 a year and I won't use them he told you never take don't take them they melt your brain oh my god you know what's so funny is they do melt your brain you get so if you take one the next two days you know when you're yeah I'm remember morning radio like old school morning radio when you go in you have to be on on to go to the next subject it's and slide your joke in and you remember like leaving going goddammit um sharp take a xanax and that doesn't happen for two days you can't jump in in conversation like that oh I won't fuck I notice tics I was taking them and I just and I was like oh I'm a lot sharper just trucking nothing so like if you would go on stage and have to ad-lib something no just wouldn't have it in yet first time I ever took when I got on a plane thinking I could I used to have a drink on the plane and start writing jokes I took a xanax again ah these are gonna flow out of me and I just sat there staring at the paper knowing like my brains turned off all the fucking scary thoughts are gone fuck taking what so yeah that's a great one can't believe I have to pee again for real yeah I do too many podcasts in a row or do two in a row I drank like 18 bottles of water I'm in love with Lance Armstrong is fucking coffee Hamiltons so who Bret - it's it's actually as an R in there turmeric turmeric turmeric and what else is it I didn't know what n are in there until like a week to work yeah it's always sounds like tumeric that's what I thought it was turmeric I thought it was tumeric yeah I combined the morning just a coffee and take off is that cool there's so many times I want to come over here do bench press come over anytime you want we're out here yes and then every once awhile up some will take advantage over you want

talking about promoter about it you say what's his name Roger Roger yeah he's great guy that's not his name [Laughter] you know what this place is missing a gun range oh yeah I'm gonna go to one like one of them gun ranges where the fucking Reaper comes out yeah there's a place here it does what's it called no no it does what's it called it does a training tactical training yeah yeah yeah G Watts you're not going yeah and Simi Valley you guys wanna come this yeah that might be the place yeah I just talked to somebody with no training that might be any yeah but that's it yeah Reggie and I are gonna do it and then we're gonna do a podcast afterwards so do you want to do it Reggie's from Montana you know he's like Geno's gun can I tell you something have you ever seen him perform live it's crazy his music just performed yeah just like I've seen him you ever seem to a show or easy you will feel like what you do is nothing is not a talent like it's not a skill I'm not kidding yeah I've seen I saw this dude do a this is years ago this is like at least seven years ago yeah maybe eight years ago he did a 10 - at most 15-minute set and it was so unbelievable that he got a like a prolonged standing ovation fucking 10-minute set like do you know how crazy or 10 minutes that has to be was he doing dude he was like just improvising songs on the spot and then you know he that he would do that thing where he would just make a certain sound then with the Machine you tap it and then loops and started building it and he would do that and then he would just have like a funny aside about something and then take it back but the the songs he was building in the moment were so like it wasn't like he was going like you like that I mean it was like a full orchestra you see it you go there's something about musicians that when you can see a certain musician where you like you don't view a comedian where you go like oh my fucking god cannot believe the level of talent of that person you might think they're really funny or laugh a lot but you're not gonna be like I've never seen something like right music I think that that can happen he's dead everybody up at Bonnaroo a place where everybody was bombing mm just a tent it's not for the comedy anyway got everybody on their feet like he just has a pouch yeah yeah yeah he's like he's like that yeah - I'm super you in the crowd like he's not talking to you you just you also like now you're standing up and doing whatever yeah yeah yeah I talked to somebody that went on a tour with him like around that time it was like four four of them a night you know like doing like 10 cities together I was like what ordered you guys pick he was like what do you fucking think someone who's like really good at music yeah they used to have a problem with that with middle acts that was one of the things that happened with with Mitch Hedberg so Mitch Hedberg was on the road and he head of the middle Act was a guy was doing like raps he had like raps and songs and synched things he did sing on he was crossing and then Hedberg were going afterwards and you know Edwards like super deadpan that man that is the worst scheduling ever fucking book or you ever have a middle act who in a club who just stayed a middle act but for like 15 years but became super proficient doing 20 minutes it would be like a guy who's like you know he became an older Johnson was a monster on stage in Tampa and you could fucking follow that guy really he was a monster he quit doing comedy selling cars in Tulsa now what'd ya do I he was you could not blow that motherfucker save Gillian him had beef because they did a show and there was a secret shopper in the in the audience he's higher secret shoppers to rate the community Tampa yeah and yam everything is boy destroyed I mean yeah now he does I remember I had him for real it was hard god Apollo you work with those guys those guys I'm better than the headliner I do I do I can't disagree with you a hundred percent yeah well right when you're keyed into that like when you get in and on Thursday you see that it definitely raises your game for the whole weekend yeah for sure oh yeah for sure cuz you'll see it and that guy will have that he'll be the guy that stayed and that's the fuck did he quit and start selling cars if he's that funny cuz there's a future for a whole book you know that I think what happened he probably he probably if I remember I probably didn't start it like 20 or 22 you use a little older we start kind of mini also it's like want to stay in town well I think I think it's another relationship friend obviously it happened I'm friends with Roy but no I think that it was the thing that you get addicted to murdering mmm and you don't grow past come above headliner on stage now I'm not shitting on Roy but he just destroyed but I don't think he ever took the chance tree was like I'm gonna go up and bomb tonight and see if I can figure something out you know I think that's ultimately what happens to the features there's a lot of the men I worked with all of them yeah it's a Pro features for sure there's a pro feature yeah Ryan I remember who he was a he he's the story of the guy who was headlining in those clubs for like a decade or more didn't like breakout breakout but obviously was he was like a proficient comedian then like you know has like always has like somebody has like personal stuff happened and then it's like family stuff and you know for whatever reason then they're like still in it but now they've been doing it like 25 years and then just needed the work so it would take middle weeks I mean you know those dudes would fucking hurt you oh yeah dude sure crush no they said they do local references and then they're just like and they've been doing it for 25 years in they're like just do 20 and and do it for like 10 weeks in a row care if you're like tired immaterial all those yeah the Boston guys all they did or sure cuz those guys who do 15 or 20 at night they do 1529 and then they would do it like three four of them in a row and then bring up Billy Crystal I'm not joking Billy Crystal eat shit next Comi stop that way a lot of guys did they set them up it's rude yeah they set up these like big-name headline of sale in a lot of it was like jealousy this fucker I think she can come here yeah yeah and they would they would set him up bang bang bang they would put their biggest hitters Steve Sweeney Kevin Knox Don Gavin bang bang Lenny Clarke boom boom boom and then these poor bastards would come in from out of town and these guys were talking all this Boston talk and then you've got a bullshit-ass act anyway you know you just yeah kind of drifting on though you're just in between movies so you do a little comedy make you so it feel good go up see your adoring fans hey yeah I'm just gonna fuck around in Boston I'll just go down there and I don't really have an act right now yes you're something else piecing it together yeah and then you watch Gavin slash and Sweeney smashing the fucking room is falling apart then you see these poor guys like the look in their eye knowing they were going to certain death oh nothing worse than following a crossover black act crossover black guy Chris Crowley to play to white audiences where you just go up and it's and you're young you're like 32 or feels race taking marketing class feels races I can't hold my piss anymore right there do you think that do you think the hardest that you like the hardest active fault would be like BT oh beef you guys Marty Faust okay hardest active follow this memorize easy always do this but also the place so just to give you an example talking about following Mike Marino I had a fucking cop convention you're not okay go ahead I'm gonna tell you the hardest week I've ever had in my entire fucking life yes I go to I go to Miami I almost don't believe you nope alright no I don't because like I always saw him fucking like he's one of those guys that could just at least kill you let's do well happier words I get booked in Miami's my first headlining week for The Improv and I don't sell any tickets and they give me a call and they said we need to bring in another comic who's already in town to help you sell tickets you did it right now what are you doing just take my shoes off your socks off I don't know these fucking mushrooms I thought they were table you're taking the fucking socks off oh all right sorry so you're in Miami I do want to hear this yeah so you're in Miami yeah yeah what happens they go another there's another comic in town and you got and he's gonna co-headline with you but the problem is he's already brought his own feature he was had he thought he was gonna headline so who was it I'll tell this talking me the line okay okay so they go so we've cut the host so we got your feature his feature him then you in Miami in the heyday of Miami yeah the first day I don't know him I've never met this just like 85 yep they go the breakdown the host is gonna do 15 the feature is gonna do 15 he's gonna do 40 you're gonna do 40 okay right that's a lot you're like this is the intro nonsense and imagine how hard this guy wants to follow especially in Miami where everyone's spanish-speaking ladies and gentlemen put your hands together for Ricky cooky steep'd Robinho and then you dirt biker dude I bombed harder than I've ever bombed in my life I mean Miami's wet dripping off my chin tomorrow town okay that's when I had to bring on that whole set and I bought a black eye on stage and I brought a Cuban guy on stage he like fuck this really guy pulled his dick out no that's the different night but I said to him I go you I'm gonna just you I go you're people understand me so I'll say the joke and you translate it to your people and so then he's just sitting on stage with me so I go I was talking to this girl and the black guy goes man I'll spin game at this bitch and the place went nuts and I said it to the Spanish guy he just said in Spanish I mean whatever and it's fucking destroyed - my whole act that way whenever I had a joke I'd have them translate it they said and stay with you though sat on my stage with already five minutes and drink tequila with me that's good they say like you know figured out no I'm going to hear it out man I've seen Robinho just cause he laid of course he was roid never that's that you have with you Bob and you played it for everybody Tom's kind of have a half memory of that yeah but I mean I played like anybody you've ever sat in the back of a room with that was not good how about Sacramento that's the fucking worst the fun punchline with it what is now it was called the laughs you know what the worst thing about or a bomb what a bomb on a Friday night is I thought you bomb on the Early Show and you can't believe how hard you just motley is life-altering he'd bomb harder in the Late Show oh and they're both sold out so it's not like eight people it's like oh my god to the gills man what was the catalyst the catalyst I mean he got me at because I remember that I was like I everything my life tonight like after you know Jesus it was that bad but then what was what started it what started the bus started the bomb was the opening joke because I was just like by the way by the way before you tell your opening joke tom is great with feeling uncomfortable in a moment and taking it to the next level we're in Hawaii with Russell Peters the one thing they say is do not mention negative shit about the Hawaiians Tom's opening joke do you remember it and they said island life slow I didn't know they were talking about your metabolisms you guys are fat you did the same shit in Australia like that lost one base today luckily I ran into a Japanese guy he pointed me out they know everything about this base he's over there drinking his own poo that's it oh my god you got me for a fraction of a second I was like nobody didn't drink his own piss so wait how did your phone go in Sacramento to the Sacramento bomb was dirt it was the month after the month after Hurricane Katrina so I opened with a joke I don't remember the wording of it but it was like how there were there's reports of people raping people in the aftermath and I was like yeah I was like I opened I was just like you know nothing like a seen dead bodies float by that makes me want to fuck somebody you know and then I just kind of like about like you know dead people and I'd be like and it would eat so much shit there we go you know you have the thing you likewise go to my act now like I just go to like yeah cuz it was like oh it was already too late and I would bomb for the full the facts you know the funny thing is they made in both shows yes this is funny yeah and nothing a dead person on a TV floating by timing the timing off that fucking that Club lady closely you know like your new feature at a club I remember she came up she goes the bomb feels so bad then you're sweating so hard you're like man that's emotionally just taxing right you're just like god damn right I walk offstage and I run like indoor she goes I thought you were supposed to be funny can't read and I go what just like you're supposed to do 25 you did 23 and I was like I fucking alright and then like that's the first show then the second show literally is worse in an inconceivable way is worse did you try to save that joke together yeah I tried to open with it again work so hard eat it so hard that I'm middling MCS like damn dude you fucking suck he's like he's a scorer he's like you're like he was just like it was that big deal i McClane yeah he was like he was just like god damn I've never seen anything like this yeah oh my god and then the next day I was like I don't know how I'm gonna do this man and Burt Coast will give you one piece of advice go yeah just open different just do whatever you want just open on a different joke I was like all right man and at the time I swear to you that fucking first show Saturday by the best set that I've ever had like unbelievable set did the lady go oh okay no no no she goes uh I I was I felt redeemed right I fucking destroyer right and I what I mean like the emcee is like Jesus because I've never seen a turnaround like that I was like I'm like this feels like I I walk around and I see her and I go like and she goes what I didn't hear anything I go she pretended like she didn't know she kept coming up to me going you said he was funny you brought him with you and I trust me the best part about his bomb was Tom you Santa man I lost not a weight I lost during the sweating all those longer hair and comb it back so it would be up right and as he bombed it starts to fall and then it starts to get wet soaking wet it was great like I jumped in a pool like I was fucking soaking wet that feeling when you're eating shit it's not like anything else on earth I remember that I remember that like he was up on stage and somebody yelled at him like some lady he's like well you're a fucking dumb I'm back I remember him winning them back I was like goddamn I used to have some some quick go to Zhaan that yeah favors hey honey your mouth God made your mouth for one thing and it's not talking does that mean that's a joke and it's a irreproachable I would love to hear like a fab yeah sure nothing's flashing flashing red this one is - no they don't usually flash the mushrooms are to be shoot something oh my got me a little bit do you eat them during the show right before the show right before you stop right no I wasn't enough that would've like such a good boy it's nice it gives you like a little nice thing but like my palms are sweaty and I'm fucking out of it yeah definitely is that what it is you get your guys no listen guys I'm serious it's aa challenge if I'm challenged physically difficult though that's the point Ari you want to watch people do stuff have your play there since when is it about anybody else other than us no but people did tune in if they like it they like it but you don't just do it for other people like yeah hold on Joe listen to an artist talking shut up first watch it No watch it no use holding your breath challenge you're like guzik really holding his breath I don't fucking know well Bert everyone doesn't have to be in on every goddamn thing you do every day what the girls say when you're buzzed like dad it's mom trying to stream and provide for the family yeah fuck them they don't realize I've leveraged their futures for our income right now yeah yeah you paid a hefty price dude yeah my kids do not like that I've talked that much about them well you probably not have done that really your kids like he said they're not even gonna know I go what if people come out to in the mall and they say hey your dad was talking about called George on the phone on stage of attack everyone's yelling island they're like no I'm Georgia the smart ones look a hospital 20:20 I was being honest I didn't know no way to do stand-up I get it I get it yeah yeah you do it one way fine for most of the world that's the thing like most things are fine for most of the world it's just a small percentage of people that are just wired all fucked up cause we got a company we got yeah we got to go I got a go soon no they're 10:00 to 6:00 yeah we gotta go no I think you're gonna see the lot online you know I'm not gonna see anything well to you I'm not gonna look they walk your number one has to look at it no music okay just show her videos if we're gonna do it we should breakdance go to stance elements elements and let's watch some of these guys do it look up Chet faker oh fuck this is great yeah some death look I'm a real dancer Glazer I'm telling you this how we'll shoot it I'm a fan of this girl Dee Glaser's her name she's a choreographer she's got blonde hair give her Nelly Nelly uh from the loot and I'm proud we can't we can't play music dance okay let's watch it doing Joe and I really think you're gonna like what do you say I'm ready oh yeah this is Joe anything that doesn't require you to lose weight um I'm not sure look at her body it's in fucking great this is us doing these her name is C Glaser her name's Dee Glaser okay she's great she's great she's great and this will be us imagine how much fun it'll be when you do it though cuz you're fat yeah do you think you can learn to do this a hundred percent you do think she could do a fucking split you remember you could train you hold on you think you could do this I could get my body to move that way if someone taught me and I spent the lawyer I'm not amount of time maybe not in two months one month no I think I was good enough would be better than all of us oh I would definitely be better than you and that's all that counts right Joe Joe Joe come on this is me and Tom and you and Ari we do ass one all together and I'll he lies the belt bro what the god is a bad all right do you think you could learn to do this look over here Bert no huh no I'm not getting rid of this you know so what tell me a challenge that you think spare fuck should weigh in right now what do you think is you know how embarrassing this is that place that place like that is right near my apartment I walk by on the way home from not working out and I look through the window at them doing crazy dances like that understand why this challenge abhi I'm crazy and I'm gonna get agreeable moment I'm gonna keep this this is mine I like this I like having it no you think so you know are you in ok it's a weight-loss challenge you bomb in by the way you should get a weight loss challenge belt I think we should probably make that be great ideas it's a great idea get on it Jamie order it up we need a weight loss challenge BM okay brand it tour bus champ - I want a marathon belt okay you're going to tried that they give you like a button or something when you win America you know why cuz you promote her had one I saw him when I was give me one of them erasers that go on top of a pencil and nobody ever you try angles pencils are so crazy and you use up that eraser boy you need an external right now he'll be ill tell y'all expiry arm now listen what about what about if we let this hold on I have the fucking green he had the greatest idea whole crank it when you remember if if we do it the hip-hop challenge yes we need no one's gonna be there to cheer anybody and queer that the judges it has to be just us you can you film if you want edges yeah you can't you'll have to say that anymore yeah I think it's in the cute my friend on Mirim nakamoto's snacks snack emoto's so just us and then get actual judges you don't know us to decide yeah you have to really make a place where three people learn to meet Joe I think he's gotta say this is give us an alternative let's come up with something where we don't need judges I don't want to bring judges in because then we have other people like then it's gonna get gross we're good wait a minute it's a bad idea bring in judges money judges because it just hands the power over to Alito's other people in our organization to I don't want to even talk to other people okay I'm trying to cut people out of my life I'm not trying to add to hit I get that answe judges now I don't have the time the only dipping idea I like ours idea no social media for a year except I haven't a new era run you know you could run it just go Jamie post it we have another video post it I don't trust him no you have to give a message I got him over there he's sneaky he's sneaky he checked my dams why don't we eat you tell me he judges who's the best I'll see you dick pics come in my way judges is a real thing you're right judges is a real thing but I think we're in the right direction with hip hop dance why because it's your invention who lose again there should be a real penalty for how so what's the real penalty it'd be a real repercussion for you this is a good one if you come in last you give us help spread it out selectively a million dollars you're doing better now it's your bus champ yeah tour bus champ you have to think about that no just sign up for you're not gonna lose if those are the stakes what is it wait hold on hold on one second just let's let aside let's talk to our bus champ comes at a price dude my bus it's just so fucking sick you can't just be tour bus champ for because million I was tour bus chair listen listen but Burt do you understand this is strange that you keep failing at these things and yet you keep bragging so much success when it comes to you guys that I think sometimes you guys forget about it I was Travis chair do you know it minnows tour bus jam this amazing minute yes the minute you know he's really nelson alive don't you or not the tour bus champ the bus that I was on this week when the tour bus championship was going on or you mean who's to arrest Jim what I'd say why it's me of course how come I have the better bus did you ever take a picture of your bus and put it online yeah oh really yeah you know you had a fucking Photoshop two hundred times no that was my bus the outside of your bus doesn't count Tom the inside of your bus that look like a prison yard just like a prison yard too did not did it not have a broken transmission no internet TVs that didn't work I want you to pause for a second imagine a world where the thing you're bragging about when you've been called out for failing to challenges in a row hard as fucks it makes it great first thing you're talking about is this shape of the bus that you drive around in I didn't start how much is prepared was it was the transmission bad well then I win yeah a flat tire we had a challenge you came at last a selector okay what are the repercussions for you fucking pussy out well I'm not pushing out the reasons why I have this right here is because I read but you saying that you're gonna put it on your mantelpiece and like that's never gonna know you're a Mickey Mantle piece Joe can you entertain you can you entertain a circumstance in which you think Burt could beat you hey Bob may make a game like the old hustler make an even game where they could be anybody's at this point that works like you got to make it have to be I'd have to have some form of lymphoma a physical thing but he moves so well maybe you move like the wind is something I've seen you move say that Christopher Cross on Terri Schiavo couldn't move better than you you really can man Burt there was days where I was I was like man I'm tired and I thought about you are you standing now you took your socks off you've got mushrooms we don't have agree we should and also you do need some repercussions for fucking blowing it forget I'm the only one that ran a marathon that wasn't lucky too but it doesn't seem like you are willing to face reality tell me what reality is I'll face it well of reality as Ari Shaffir it didn't work out at all of the way and even did Lana marathon Ari Shaffir didn't work out at oh I a great decade he smoked you like you can tell a cigar why are you asking anything in life and not just like okay are you talking shit d'marie you know it didn't work out for 10 years and the only one that came in with a the video of him on my fucking room is you know I saw here's the deal we teamed up again listen he's my second place guy how do we team up I literally he said he was gon give you know somebody closest competitor I took me a day off that's true I did I've said I've said ad nauseam we're knocking I can't bleep recovering this I've said that nauseam tugging on Joe's tiger's tail is a big mistake Ari was massively surprising and Tom was a fair fair competitor now I will say I am just giving up ideas of what to do next October I need ideas and I believe that Ari's idea was I think us not doing something is not fun to follow if you are a fan of the podcast us not doing it like hey guys let's sleep wouldn't be really fun it would be how many hours of hip-hop dancing we put in there we go now we're talking about something why hip-hop dancing on the lysmer what name it you guys want to do Riverdance Riverdance fuck no let's do some dance that sucked when it was another I'm in I'm in but like I liked what we did was with the hotter the easiest thing to do is something that you don't need a lot to like take with you or you know I mean like really it's not bad I'm not like running a lot I do right Glenn running but I don't want to be the one sitting here promoting running I'm trying to think out of the box runs a great idea great running is that if we did do it for the whole total miles of the month it would get Savage she problem how would you do we uh what Bernie I will seriously lose like forty pounds you just and you do a marathon a day Joe well I think it's physically possible to do a marathon a day I know you could well that would be way easier for me than for you yeah much easier once again I'm real moon I'm too drunk to even talk by the way when you swear that you looked at me like you're like I'm gonna do that Jason are you gonna do a marathon a day it's not it's not healthy for you to keep living in this world you've created which doesn't even make sense what are you talking about my drinking or my no no that's normal yeah the drinking along with this proclamation of awesomeness you know I'm saying it's like this it's not the drink the drinking is fun it's fun you're running thing is you need to be punished if you lose yeah yeah injuries make sense we got way more there's a whole table full of whiskey over there and then we got gas monkeys tequila here to do running that if everyone if everyone agrees on money can I ask you that something's gonna get ugly guys the breasts are ugly I'm gonna do a marathon what are we gonna wear to track our so that everybody has the same thing to try out the shoe well you can wear the rock shoe or you can just get an Apple watch no no but that way we could you have to watch only four phone calls and then talk and do it if you ever send text messages and then I'll do our ease challenge at the same time so we do our need for social media for the month so wait hold on running on an iPhone will do as many miles as we can for the month the whole thing would be how many miles can you run in a month I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna open up the first day with 30 30 30 month day one I'm gonna open that up yeah now are we talking 30 miles in a day day wait miles can you write here's a thing cuz it that part I believe I do believe that I believe that here's what I want to know this this makes a huge difference yeah can you because if we're tracking those miles we all have to track the miles we have to track the mouse with the same brick we're able to track them out the with the same app degree note growth hormone but you should get off high blood pressure medication before you get on anything what you should pull yourself first and then figure out the rest yeah as large as you are you got all the way down the way to 12 or something like that what did you weigh I had an impulse problem did you get up to on this tour tell you a secret it was such a fucking disgusting picture of Burt and burgos was a shellfish reaction to Denmark shellfish reaction in Denmark that's hilarious okay wait wait okay here's the way no this is important for the challenge so we all I think we all have to track the miles the same way right this is is there going to be a stipulation that these miles can only be tracked outdoors on statement yes because a jar at Red Mill fits GPS treadmills not going to show anything on GPS and that's any movement okay actually a speed we're talking about no no I can't just distance run bursts walk there's an app I saw recent that tracks walking longer to walk a mile than to run a mile because you know you should be if you're tired and you're running and you want to walk for a mile that's fine don't be rode that you remember this little all distant huh walk around sober left you everything I know silver like Walker this dude looked like a fucking lizard you just walk around sober like dude he would walk it was all yeah from like 6:00 a.m. and you would see him at 8:00 p.m. schizophrenic he was a doctor yes he there was like a little scandal or he died in this hot tub so we you would see this guy and a hot yes somewhere there he was a guard that's him oh so he would just walk around trying to slink dick I don't know the guys slings dick he would hold the newspaper I just see this dude and wait around like that yes all day oh I would read it said click on that lower picture yeah gonzo I'd said he killed himself look at that killed it off yeah wow this is uncle healed himself la coroner concludes yeah see ya there but that wasn't initially the report of story story that it was a mystery how this guy had died well there was a mystery solved yeah I guess yeah can I tell especially well who says all the corner okay I know all right so toenails dry can I tell you this was late oh yeah yeah they're pretty hmm he has his toenails painted they're all pretty he's got like it's really beautiful I'll take a picture with Kathleen and uh no quickie McGee yeah in Calgary can I just tell you this I was late for the stand this is like about a year ago when the stand was still open and I was like fuck and I started running how was it second I was at 16th Street and 2nd Avenue I started running and eventually I was like I was out of steam I had like stopped and I stopped that was a sixteenth Street not yet to third Avenue so I I tire out under a block so but that's just enjoying the idea of going into this it's just starting to run up you know how last year I don't you took you got into like a fucking zone you got in ozone you have a runner what I do he's gonna win at one point you have a runner's body he there was a there was a moment somewhere around week when you said I gotta go know when you said I go hunting I'm offline for a second I was like yeah oh I'm close yeah I had to go hunting for but I shot an elk on the second day that's right he came back we have been a little more like you think it'd have been a little easier on us if you had hunted for five days yeah but I was wearing my thing my clothes I got six hundred points one W it working out hiking biking man your heart but didn't you share the fuck up you're going to came hunting you did more than that yeah guys can you just put yourself as a thousand in a day on one day it's what happened yeah I did nine hundred and then I came in here and worked out for another hour after I was done so I did I was hard in that last thing can you guys try remember okay October 18th you wait you're gonna wake up yeah and you go fuck I have to just run a bunch now yeah Cristina's like let's hang out no but I know I know I know yeah it's not a bad month and you're all gonna die I'm cool with it there's that two birds the place you think you'll come in probably for a second first thing first Osiris yeah whatever I mean probably first but maybe second if some spectacular it seems outrageous that I'm gonna be getting on growth growth I should only do that but let's sign up we can use that you should definitely some wait shouldn't just get hot stuff you should stop drinking so much speaking of the silver party no one's gonna be easy to do what Australia you're not gonna drink at all when you're over there you definitely won't

yeah you're gonna have to do shoe ease over there you're gonna have to drink beer you should see me do the show either on TV pull up Bernie shoot me it's still your friend dick sir you've seen it yeah yeah um I like running I just I'm cool with it and of course I'm cool with those social media you're let's just walk you're into his own thing again yeah I'm the only one that came up with an idea that was fun it was I jumped on board with it man I think it's a good idea I told you I like errand boy do I like it I like the hip hop I like in terms of none of us have any experience that's a funny can't bring that's great that the judging part is a true prophet parts of real problem it's it's an untenable issue you're gonna bring in these people and they're gonna the reason why I thought Bert won yeah the fuck out of here you're right fuck out of here I see for a different starting point so I gave him extra points for that fuck you Bert fuck you you can't win like that if you're gonna win it's gonna be you have to win and that's what you're scared of you're scared of usually straight up how many things something Bert wins for sure sure definitely 100% I love that you have a Hollywood red line into my brain or you you can tell you can see what can I see anxiety forming I could see it forming in the air above here's the order if we do the running thing go ahead you get first okay your promoter gets second get third what's the promoters name again what's his name the one guy the only use only I came in here today thinking I was gonna tell you guys like I'm out all right we did mushrooms you can't go you are doing this before the show might have been the fucking best way to start this show feels good my whole body's tingly it's like a nice house from high it's like it makes you realize what you really like about mushrooms I got November 3rd off are we are we gonna do it gig together the four of us yes I should be here we're gonna be what the five fly back in November November fourth New York hallway you know what we should do there why your what let's go to New York all week we kid threw people down okay are you still doing winters out here you still doing the winner I could do New York jobs I could do a nice show yeah sure I know venue so are you not coming out this way at all no I I yeah I come in you know it'd be fun if we decide like the four I decided to do a destination yeah like some some crazy I was just thinking Vegas but that's not like really lame no excess co2 you know we should do summer we should do some shit that's like that you don't normally hit on a tour like summer in Wyoming yeah I mean yeah maybe we could do something in like it's our guy Boise break oh yeah Mexico or New Mexico no not Mexico Mexico Pro New Mexico I had Edie called Iran on the podcast today that's where I got this Mexican yeah oh yeah he's super Mexican he's a Border Patrol guys he was describing the whole cartel Wars I went down wild and it all was happening right when he signed up to be a cop and he basically became a paramilitary operator like Jesus just trying to fucking deal with shit that was going down the border don't try to take that and let's pace it out so it's a crumpled-up we go show to do it we'll do a show hang out yeah are we saying November November date we go there unless you like skiing well that's what people go there for yeah November's the season yeah for sure meet Tommy in New York no one in Big Sky Saturday you're gonna be there anywhere Saturday it's known in Big Sky he's gonna be there that weekend anyway in November New York yeah and I got November 3rd off is my only weekend off from stand-up all fall great right after that weekend you'll come back well Neil we and by the way we could just do a comedy club - who gives a fuck yes be really fun man I'm supposed to climb get charged so much normal birds usually don't do that anymore I've never charged for me greeting my entire life that's fair he says I never once I do I do a raffle they just know people that do gross I think it's gross too but I bet you know what teaches on like a friend let's do it I got it bring on running is that really gonna be Jesus crap that's what we did last time have to agree to something Doug just because it's like Oh fucking time is running out of the podcast okay so how I love running hip hop dancing and obviously my shirt I fight it gets weird like yeah let's let's ruminate believe this right here for a show I do from now on like it will get so pretty who made that job what is the company that made it pro-am bills pro-am felt you did a great job can you add an add-on that shows a bunch of pills on the other side yeah just have no weed no booze like that's all there is try to keep it clean you're gonna have it bro you have it November 1st mmm for sure listen I'm well aware of with the training that needs to go into this if we do running no I personally think something sillier would be benefit us but I'm cool with whatever you guys pick because you're happy coming in last with no consequences learn how to board are you you are you saying you'll win another way no matter what it is he just comes in last it doesn't matter that's the thing because I've saw this shit he Rousey up and I'm saying this is a guy who won it's not it's not it's not right wait - wait how about the million dollar pair not right it's not right it's not right it's like fake bragging it's not you bullshit I believe in my own fucking abilities that's the truth that's horrific bolita moment thing you shall leave in my own abilities I believe in myself if Las Vegas will open the action on this this year we might be able to get them to do I'll start yeah I know I'm betting on how many things be honest oh yeah that's one everyday not three we had seven-mile for three so hard a runner they are runners assault runner I used to hate it now I'm like good thing is that's gonna get you in shape for the real running that you have to do when you come in last man because that is harder than wait wait wait those things are harder than running it's like 15% or 13% do you think you'll do come in second again you think so you know he'll get crazy you're dissing the thing I know better than you guys know right because Ari and I have done jiu-jitsu together so I know how competitive he gets play when you're when you fighting for your life which is what you're doing when you're doing jujitsu you know what the guys got inside of him Ari she fears a little savage but my great life and running is a little different no no no no it's his mind that's why I knew he was gonna come in second when we did this sober October thing I was just yeah it's too far running I'm cool it's crazy with stuff my brain I'll switch it over looks like you burped he doesn't you know he doesn't give up he doesn't fold this is already set up what I feel like the only thing that's not settled but yours what is your right that's not good for you what's not good it's not good to talk shit and then talk shit never better listen talk shit and then just wait what is that I am Conor McGregor no sometimes you talk shit you lose sometimes you talk shit and you lose okay what's that you just said I'm Conor McGregor we kind of getting knocked out Josie although when Conor McGregor was gonna pick one person on this podcast to get behind who do you think would be beep real it was weird he's my guy I'll bet mine I'll tell you what he would do can I tell you what he will do are you ready let's team let's help get this is what Connor we thank God I'm on mushrooms if there was a fuckin if there was an audience she would get them all going about how it's you and then when it's like press the button to vote right then he would go Joe likes you just like him do you think you would lose money just cuz you like that you get drunk that's a good point it's good question he loses money cuz he loves that you brag and then fall down and then with his liver yeah I think with my heart Bert what is the punishment but I'm saying let's say let's start with you you come in last what is the punishment yeah we're coming unless we're coming in I know he's happy looking forward to it comfortable he's looking forward to coming in last in front of a fireplace curled up no dude this whatever is wrong with me but ever got me in the comedy all the things that are wrong with me this is the base of it right here I shut my therapist on there what does that mean because I because context I believe I genuinely I believe in myself in this moment but that's great I genuinely believe in myself I believe that you do that I do I believe the evil even yes I think you also know on some level you're coming forth in anything worth but I type I'll be I'll be very honest yeah please much as I believe in myself I know there's something wrong with Joe I know that Ari has this fucking of no interest in Gehrig's disease tom is gonna call me on the last day and go hey you're done running right I mean on a treadmill from the gym and I was like I was moving I was like right are you doing he was like nice where T and then I he's like I do him he goes I'm with my family right now I'm with my kids I heard like kids laughing and Peter's like roasting a thing I stayed on that trip I was like I still on some part of my mind doesn't believe you I didn't believe it stayed on I stayed on and he goes I swear to you I'm done and I stayed in that gym probably 40 minutes he still put up good numbers that day but I did go like I couldn't do it it was a weird thing explain that I didn't tell you guys I got I flew across the country that yeah no you did I tell you that yes so I was like okay about it what I loved about it is that we were seeing everybody's numbers he's high on mushrooms no but I'm just thinking about this it's like can't we start slow it had like an art you did five miles call for the day it's you max out no that's not that's how I was gonna we're going to the dark place here's what I'm well aware of I'm gonna give you the cards in my hand right now mm-hmm I've run 26 miles in a day yeah and I know the Joe's first day I've run 26 miles he's gonna put him back for a couple uses really hard to go right into that No so no he's gonna start an October first you moron this place is smart if we make running if that's the agreement I'm gonna get down to 180 pounds I'm gonna lose 20 what are you right now 200 I'm gonna do that yeah no but I mean like like in your head 20 pounds it's already done yeah I'm gonna lose 20 pounds and I'm gonna run I'm gonna start off like with ten I'll do like ten every other day and then by the time October ramps around I'll be doing a marathon a day it's gonna suck it's gonna suck you think you'll do that every day yeah I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to show Burt what the fuck is up and then I'm not gonna talk to him anymore I don't like the end of the mode how's it last I'm gonna block his number I'm just like I can't do this anymore about dance fun all right this shouldn't be fun I gotta pee this should be fun it shouldn't be fun she'd be terrifying last year was terrified I'm saying is if I come in last this year and there's all these fucking repercussions and then he came in last and had nothing wrong with it right super unfair it's unfair you're right no no replica someone should punish you you should be punished Bert wait why do I get punished so give me a punishment I'm cool no yeah you need your own system and apps eat your own shit how much a spoonful Jesus Christ you're all shit what happens I don't know why don't you just give us each 300 grand it's settled fuck can I just say that I'm gonna be Columbus next weekend so might as well come out of that place bigger right yeah but don't do storm you come and see marshal just don't do it such a great club Columbus yeah it's great club it's a great town for stand-up - it's not as good as the met July 27 - Philly oh my god I'm announcing a shitload of dates tomorrow oh yeah yeah no I can't know where I'm going Cardiff Wales June 25th for Ari Shaffir original Irish beer calm all of them will be announced tomorrow I'll put it but um I got some dates coming mr. your pre-sales oh there's some there's still a hundred tickets left for Chicago this weekend - were you guys cargo so marina Jesus - Brogan I wear Chicago eating salads and they were like this was fucking super sweet the salad and then we asked some lady like she couldn't believe it more like did you put sugar on the salad she was like is it too sweet for you we looked around the fittest person look like Bert it was like everybody there was massive they loved that fat deep-dish pizza those are a hearty Midwest folk yeah I love something I go yeah I love Scott but yeah but they put sugar on their salad sugar in the staff is for one moment take a break no get into it for this one extra pop put your pop yeah more sugar garnish out sugar what are you playing they're a massive place huh yeah some big-ass please is it different than this were like how different is it than the store this is different yeah I explain to people that differs between a small hundred seat room to thrive six thirty thousand but here's the problem is the same material you're gonna put on a special yeah you deliver to six thousand people realize you're delivering to one person on the couch is it like do you it's different kind of show do you find yourself talking louder or like stuff like that it's different I mean if you're there it's fun but I don't think it would translate correctly if you're at home and that's one of the reasons why I think like I did my last one at the Wilber which is pretty tight he's like three comedy clubs stacked on top of each other it's 1,100 seats but it's pretty intimate like the people are on top of you I think that's how you're supposed to do comedy at a special because specials it's hard to be in that room and I've been saying this I don't see if you agree with me I think that a special is only at its best like maybe 80% of what it's like to actually be in the room because you miss the feeling of being in the crowd and yeah I try to get my shirts and I haven't ever got as close as possible to love experience but you can see a show at a Mexican restaurant on a Tuesday with a bunch of amateurs and you'll laugh you'll laugh harder than watching any of our specials alone in your apartment yeah comedy has really it being there live it's amazing I think a lot of comics mess up and they do their special for the room mm-hmm and they go like now what's up what's up here the place I'm at I'm stupid Katt Williams the best part of a special was the 10 minutes he did on Tallahassee or I would hard disagree fucking Katt Williams fan that I love but we talk about that about doing it not for the room shoot a special you guys especially are doing these massive these massive massive rooms but then when people are gonna see your special yeah almost all that we're watching like you know really doing my special in a big room um - it's like less than a thousand I'm thinking to do in LA at the Ice House I've been thinking about doing that already I'm pretty far out of doing special I'm at least a year away from you and thinking about I think the most important thing by special is doing in a place that has not seen you do stand-up that's the number one most important thing I would do a special at the store I would find that to be a mistake because you're there all the time even where on this material front of those people only if it fucks your head up what about the people well I get it on the level of like some of the jokes are surprise ending and they kind of like know what's going there right that's you don't want to do a sign so for people that have seen this material ever you want those people to never have seen this material the same way the people at home never seen it 20 million people in LA burn you have a joke yeah but it's a lot of them will show up yeah a lot of your fans are gonna show up go dude I just saw him like six months ago I want to come and see it well what's interesting about the store right now is that you get comedy tourism there were you getting a lot of people that come to visit the store from all over the world yeah let's see I met some dudes there just the other day from England and Ireland they flew in for the weeks while tandem stories are massive right now right or is everywhere but yes but i but i i'm the few things I have in my head is like a rock venue and I'd like a place I haven't done I haven't done this material and how do you announced that yeah were you doing or no yeah Cleveland good rock 23rd of November everybody special yeah Oh shirt on no no I'm gonna no I'm gonna do shirt on super skinny after this marathon wow so you doing it no it's off come on hi I'm up a fucking knee brace on Forrest Gump running when Ahri's around you open a book kombucha you instinctively smell it first move that thing and held it I got to I would I could do an entire podcast on specials because I feel like I'm obsessed with out late the good ones like what makes a great special yeah aunt Jessel Nick's first chosen the best you'll never die like those first jokes that come out really strong you gotta have a first joke them anyone says hi any of that bullshit fucking walk to the stage like Jeselnik or like nor McDonald and Telefunken Joe you see it now no man I like Katt Williams God some veil I like that yeah it was hilarious in it he's really he's really great but he when you being real man I'm a calming I'm not a fucking I'm being real I did this rule in the guy are you being real like I didn't like it man I I'm not from Jacksonville and I've been Jacksonville I know I know come on come on it was this fucking brilliant man you know what Michael Jackson had he had this this this you know what I got I got this gun trying to fuck bitches man it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where he is dude I doesn't I want to hear your new bow but he no dude clean end this part no conclusion great just great clock in the morning cat no yuddhistir truck cat stevens is a muslim don't get in a fight with him it's a lot of people that guys back y'all what's wrong I'll be your special strong I'm being followed by a moon shadow moon all right this is a wrap ladies and gentlemen sober October we accomplished nothing I promote one thing real quick if you guys have ever wanted
