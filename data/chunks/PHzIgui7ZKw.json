yeah let's go live do-do-do-do-do man on fire ladies and gentlemen available right now on Netflix pause this podcast and go watch - even better enjoy comedic stylings of Chris D'Elia mm-hmm what's up man dude shit it out right now it's actually I'm so happy I'm doing this and we're gonna talk for a few hours because I can't stop checking my fucking phone on Twitter like an asshole I know I know I I think I think oh I won't do it and then I'll be like don't do it don't do it and as I'm doing it I'm thinking I better not be doing it I'm like I'm doing it fucking right now you got to have other activity I know I know I work out but then and then I I do stand-up and I know it's a problem it's probably you know I mean yeah well you're you're very dedicated to it you love it yeah and when you love it you think about it a lot when you think about a lie let me check Twitter I know it's also such a safety kind of just move that you write you yeah I mean we talked about this before it's just like fucking you put got put your phone down for a day so you know what I've been doing well lately that has been more productive when I know I can't give in to the pipe over my notes that's good this is what I find man I find it like what I'm what I'm doing is just distracting my dude I was talking about this on my podcast man I used to I used to think I used to just spend time thinking like just spend time in my house or apartment just thinking about things right I don't do that as much anymore because I just think what's what did this fucking guy say on Twitter it robs you of your life of creativity no it's like I mean it's hard to be prolific when you're just looking at your phone and it does something to you when you just get mindless tweets and you're still looking at them it's just it's like a numbing agent yeah it's weird it's not it's not I mean cuz what are gonna see somebody likes you're special okay good well I do follow a lot of cool people that will post up some cool shit articles when people send me those I try to retreat the ones that I think are interesting so there's a benefit to it there but sure the real you get lost like check in how people like things yeah how's that show was that a good show I know yeah it's a but you're right like you your time is better spent trying to do more stuff like a more comedy but it's a thief of your time really is really yes there is it really is I think we're designed for them no I you know I don't know I don't know what to do I ever see a person who's got epilepsy where they can't watch one of those animated gif files no I had a buddy of mine and I thought he was joking I didn't know he's being honest I had this message board and on my website message board someone made me like there's really flashy image for the face where it's like he turns on and off you know pulsates if an and my friend's wife has epilepsy and he's like dude you got to take that down because if my wife looks at it she'll have a seizure whoa like at Jeff yeah I can animated that I say it gif or Jif though I don't know I think there's anybody say if for Jeff I don't know I'd never say jiff slash gif but he can't she can't even look at so looks at it she will go into an epileptic seizure well how do you police that you just don't look online ever I guess they have to be real careful like what she sees I guess like maybe if she turns away real quick maybe she'd be okay I really don't know how it works maybe just to wear special glasses when she looks at online so I don't know what's like did you imagine you've got some sort of a weird misfire where just lights to make your body shut off it's like someone hacked your brain yeah you can shut it off with some light some flashing shit that's like some yeah that's like the superheroes weakness or you're like well get my flashing lights it's Krypton I know right cuz kryptonite doesn't even work on house no doesn't do shit no such a pussy I know and in the line one of the Superman movies they didn't even have kryptonite in the one in the one Superman movie was just before the one before Superman a Batman I saw it and the bad guy didn't even use crib light so you know destroy Superman so it's what the fuck is this movie even a movie because people are stupid or now they had to tone it down it's like back in the Christopher Reeves days you need to have like an antagonist protagonist you have a lot some people today like I don't want super girls cute yeah yeah because then there'll be some sort of wonder set you find it offensive that's true too yeah right yeah so these flashing things when I found out about it that flashing animated files and then I found out there was a television show in Japan that they had to take off the air no because all these people were watching it and having seizures in Japan yes I feel like every show in Japan is flashing lights I feel like they have a show called flashing lights they have a fleshly Network and they're just can't I mean isn't it every every clip I've ever seen on Japan is like pink and blue and like right but what if all they saw of us is Fear Factor well that that's probably what they would choose to watch but maybe they have some cool shit over there but we're only seeing you know like when right how many donkey dick can you a smile is true what what is this and okay and Pokemon episode that gave children seizures I mean I thought the whole point was of Pokemon was to give people seizures oh my god 700 children were on their way to the hospital after watching that 30 minutes after the show 700 children went to the hospital for seizures is that what it's really saying that's incredible could you imagine a room of 700 peoples like you're killing right if you have a stage oh yeah if you had a stage I always think of it in terms of that dude I always think of how many people in terms of like a big of a room would that fill as a stand up don't say I got Ari Shaffir to feel really good about his Twitter following back when he only had 2000 dude yeah yeah you have a fucking sold-out theater totally it was like yeah go you got a sold-out theater people there pay attention to I was like yeah what what am i doing you're looking at Britney Spears you can't do that man she's a hundred million right yeah yeah but yeah did something about that is crazy man seven hundred people having a seizure in front of you magic you're on stage and the whole audience just seizures I would just be like whoa I'm next level people we should have taped this one to Julia's his bit he strips down to his underwear underwear a bright silver he starts doing cartwheels and people seizure I've never seen it be a hell of a claim well you could probably pull like that off I wonder if you could make someone seizure with comedy you'd have to imagine if you'd have like some sort of back screen on your punch line your punch line you rip your tracksuit off like one of those velcro things those basketball players have terror when they pull their tearaway yeah and underneath it you have strobing lights on the punch line epilepsy just falls to the ground I wonder if it would be silent though I like to hear the noise you whatever we thought you would certainly hear thoughts what a match that a group that crosses across the city here yeah the fuck that would be what seven hundred people falling down their heads I'm terrible for you definitely that flashlights but I don't like you know flashing lights anywhere there's flashing eyes I'm not epileptic anywhere those flashing lights I tend to avoid that place yeah wonder what that's doing do you like Wayne maybe if it's a person like you or I would doesn't have epilepsy maybe just a certain amount of time maybe you can only endeavor certain them I would think so right because when they torture you seen those videos and shit where they like I mean not torture videos but like reenactments or like things and movies were they're flashing lights and shit and torturing the guy yeah that's part of it right yeah senses sensory deprivation the water Chinese water torture every which is little drips drip yeah have you read the Jon Ronson book men who stare at goats yes you've had him on here right have that book is crazy how they would torture people by playing like hip-hop music or whatever the fuck it was there's been a ballpen with um Panama what the fuck's that guy Manuel Noriega what they I think they used to play death metal I think they used to pay like but I get that because if I'm in anywhere and then that happens I leave I think they played uptown girl to from Billy Joel I'm not kidding really I think that was one of the things they did they played uptown girls beer song too I think yeah that's I mean ones not good one time you hear that song like I remember this song is good I have a theory about that song what Billy Joel is an incredibly talented musician but not the best-looking guy in the world can we agree on that oh yeah yeah of course sure right he's not a Josh Duhamel Yeah right who's another one that's like to my uh Chris Pine Chris Pine yeah he's a good-looking yeah there's a good one and Chris Pratt there's another one good-looking guy yeah great-looking guys he dress Elba perfect example you had a little diverse I wanted to go a little good move a handsome bastard Billy Joel is of an average looking fella and then he hooked up with arguably one of the hottest woman that's ever Christie Brinkley yeah and that just fucked him up what do you mean oh just worth it yeah that's where he was too in love he wanted to tell everybody the story uptown girl he's a downtown guy he says he wants to think of themselves as like this rugged attractive rebel bad boys motorcycle and she's this perfect featured supermodel with him impossibly valuable eggs that's interesting yeah rectum couldn't handle it but but he got even bigger after that yeah but she was so hard but he's she's still hot she's 17 my favorite is her in that Chuck Norris what do you call it Total Gym oh that's right when they would do the little dude I I would watch that info I love infomercials I watch them late at night and that was my favorite infomercial and then they remade it oh yeah and I didn't like it as much original that's how much I watch because the original was so good because Chuck Norris was like let's just fucking get through this and Christie Brinkley was doing it really well but it was just so funny to see Chuck Norris's face during that and then redid it and he figured it out he figured I had to do a little better nothing like that dude I met Chuck Norris I met him a couple times this is was a proudest moment in my life and Chuck Norris knew who I was Oh for real meat and Chuck Norris he comes gives you a big hug yeah holy shit Chuck no just the UFC I'm sure you know this was not that long ago no oh wow my first met him I think maybe it was ten years ago 2007 again I think about two years ago I met him again that's funny yeah I was think about guys like that that were like big that got big off of like martial arts in the 80s and 90s and then the UFC came along and like kind of made those martial arts in a fighting sense obsolete right you know like if they would be that bit I guess that's not gonna happen anymore really I mean I don't know it is know what you're saying but like kung fu movies are obviously more beautiful than what's that movie that Callen did that played you in warrior yeah yeah well the thing about Chuck Norris though is that he stayed current Chuck Norris is a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu oh yes yeah he's legit under the Machado's and on top of that at school he was a world champion kickboxer right yeah this was like he could grapple at a very high level and he can part it was a world champion striker Chuck Norris is about as legit as any like movie character tough guy about his legit as they've ever been especially a guy who went on to do all these great movies like Bruce Lee was a phenomenal martial artist and a brilliant guy in terms of like how he put things together but as far as like actual competition Chuck Norris is the man I mean he was he was the guy look when I was a kid dude like Chuck Norris movies are the reason why I got into martial arts really dude he was huge jeans on with a special caution jeans he had a special crotch cut in the jeans like a fucking sidekick cowboy boots on I saw that I I found out about action jeans a late-in-life and I was like that was a fucking thing dude I basically wear them I mean I what I wear now is more ridiculous than Chuck Norrises actually yeah well the times have changed I mean I have jog jeans which is like fucking their stretch I'm talking about yeah that's what I'm wearing this is so much more common way more comfortable yeah these were bullshit like when you rode kick behind your legs when we would get pants if I got pants always got pants that were too big for me just like he kicked people oh I just in case never happened ever my buddy when I was when I used to Train I you know I trained when I was like 20 to 26 and my buddy was like why do you do that and I was like I don't know just to like protect myself he's like yeah but what's happening to you and I was like well you never know and he said yeah you do and I was like yeah you kind of fucking right man most of the time you do he's kind of writing and he's definitely not right all the time because I get fucked all the time of course but he's like you kind of know where you're always gonna be and it's gonna be fine any kind of time Moses I know usually general obviously you never know what's going to happen but but he's right in the sense that you put so much effort into self-defense and it almost never comes out right right but getting like wow your whole life is preparing for something never took place and then you get to a point where if you're known for it like you like nobody gonna fuck with you so it's like then it's definitely never gonna happen no you're right you probably got fucking assholes that one guys fuck with Chuck Liddell that's that's so insane to me yeah I mean Chuck Liddell if you ever look in his eyes he's the eyes of a leopard seal like anybody talks shit any by the way super nice guy yeah like don't get me wrong if you met him on the street he's the nicest guy super friend I saw his thing with on like undisputed or whatever the hell that show is called with yeah you seem like a nice guy anyway dude I was at a club with chocolate al way back in the day when chuck was the UFC light heavyweight champ you know and some guy it said something to one of his friends it was like some douche moment who knows what was going on just a bunch of silly Pia you know and his buddies everybody's meatheads meatheads on both sides this guy came over and said something and Chuck Liddell stood up turned around and looked at him and this guy looked like he saw a fucking ghost he looked into Chuck's eyes there's like there's a there's a type of dude that you don't start fights with right yeah yeah but meanwhile still people fuck with them yeah to this day people fuck yeah I guess it's kind of the equivalent as somebody going up to a comedian thinking that they're funny and doing a jump you know our just clueless yeah they will walk up to the scariest motherfucker on the face of the planet and start shit with him I'm afraid you bitch there's got to be guys who do that alistair old ray brock lesnar people are retarded that's so weird all you gotta do is shake one of these guy's hands and you're like oh you're a tree I mean you shake tape Fletcher's hand you're like oh oh you're a fucking your cattle do you know what I mean yeah he's a small moose I mean even you dude I honestly want one of times we've said hi I shit you not and I'm not blowing smoke we said hi we did one of these and one of those fucking side hugs I might jaw hit your fucking shoulder and for two days I was like I think it's okay gotta get out more you get it to me um it's good for your jaw get that suka but like it just hit the wrong way of what you know I mean jaws are weak man stupid design it's the unfair part of the human body besides dick in Les Paul's yeah have you ever been dropped you've been punched and dropped in the balls no no put in the Chum no no no it's the weird man I've been rocked before but I got dropped once in a kickboxing fight and my legs just gave out we it's never happened like that before where it's like a switch shut off I was totally conscious I could see the guy it clipped my chin and my legs just stopped working so it just went out from under me and see I feel like if I 'red if I got hit in the jaw with a foot I my draw would just break yeah this was a punch I got hit with a left hook oh and I just dropped but it was I was weirder than any time I've ever dropped before it just it was uh everything shut off like but my brain did but my legs just stopped work and so did you remember it totally everyone unconscious I was totally conscious my just my body would like went once he clipped me my body just wasn't working anymore I tried to get out my legs were rubber and I got up to my feet and I covered up and he hit me with like a couple of uppercuts and dropped me again but the whole time like my body was just not working anymore once it clipped me oh really like we've been even minutes afterwards like for sure wow that's yeah I couldn't move like I was trying to get up and just wasn't working right oh my god that's got me frustrated well if you get hit really hard then the whole thing just shuts off it's such a stupid design yeah like it's relatively hard to knock someone out unless you hit that's weird like people get caught in strange ways yeah and they get not like there's no science to when you get knocked out well so you got to worry about like when you're hitting the ground to like active Oh lock you up well there was a UFC fighter named Tim Hague who just died a week a week or so ago rise about a week ago he was in a boxing match and apparently it suffered quite a few knockouts in the last year or so and they really probably shouldn't have been fighting at all and he got knocked out and as he got ko'd his head hit the ground hard as it was out cold he bounced off the canvas of the boxing ring and it sounded hard but it was even even though it's Kansas I mean that's hard but still I think it's canvas over wood dog meaning they'd only have like fin yeah in the UFC bout you got a good thick fairly thick canvas because there's so many takedowns and you know there's no better give to that floor but on boxing rings it can be considerably stiffer and there's different schools of thought like some people like a really soft floor because it makes it harder for guys to run like it's it's like you're almost like running and saying yeah yeah you know and then and also safer if you get more of a mat yeah more than that yeah but the UFC is like a it's like a mat surface but it's covered in canvas which is kind of fucked up cuz you never grab ball on canvas until yeah you're fighting the cage then you get ripped up everybody gets torn apart by the canvas yeah I went back in rough I went back and did a you saw the video I did with the Joe Garson you know Joel yes yes guys met but we never met but I was a big fan of his he he submitted fuck who was it was it saccharide no wasn't sakurai asian guy right rumen Asato he submitted a man yeah yeah I don't know what he told me maybe it was in Japan he went overseas I know but it was a huge deal because Ramona Sato at the time was one of the biggest MMA fighters in the world pull that up if that's the but it was mostly that I think it's ruined I believe it's sato kei sato was like a super high level Jiu Jitsu competitor loke as well as a mixed martial arts fighter yeah cuz Joel said that he it was like a I can't remember he was saying he wasn't sure how practical his knowledge of fighting was until then huh that's interesting because he got the guy in an armbar right after going right to the ground and he was like it was over right then you know you know what man there's dudes out there that you don't know that a fucking world class the thing about jujitsu is there's guys out there yeah this is it is it yeah this is it um how does this go down it's it's not long or a magus it's four minutes but I feel like this is the second fight I think this is the one and he gets him down on the ground in the dozen armbar hmm yeah yeah yeah I don't know dude didn't they fight twice didn't they fight once oh this is it yeah yeah I think you've fucked his arm up obviously oh dude that's that is incredible man yeah oh look at look how bad it's bad man that is deaf too look how he he squeezes with his calf against the chin and tucks his foot under the shoulder that dude is submitted a lot of fucking people that's it so this guy was a big jujitsu guy that he fought I didn't know Sato will thought there was a big MMA fighter but known for his grappling really I think they fought again in a straight grappling thing if I remember correctly but anyway that was a giant win for that dude yeah so you did something with him no I I went to his class because you know we I was in Toronto for like five weeks right doing a movie and what's the movie it's called life in a year and it's a drama I don't know if you planted drugs you being serious yeah I don't even know which will probably be funnier was it weird you know what's weird about it is like you know I do so much comedy that it's so fun to do comedy because even in between your takes you're still in that mood where you're fucking around and right but I was doing this movie where literally I'm taking care of Cara Delevingne who is dying of cancer and it's like so heavy and then in between takes were like sad oh yeah yeah so it's like it was work I mean it was it was definitely I definitely wanted to do it it was just you wanted to do it cuz it's a new thing yes I wanted to do it because dude especially after my third I had just filmed my third special and I was like what the fuck am I gonna do another special you know I mean like I want to do something out I didn't want to do another sitcom because I did two of those right you know I mean and it just I don't wanna do the same thing over and over and over again right but so that's why this even on this special that I just came out today it's like I talk more about myself than I did in my first two just because it's like I don't wanna keep making fun of the same shit right yeah hear you man I hear ya yeah and like doing different things is where you get new ideas from but yeah that acting things are grind yeah I know I know I know it's it's it was it was it was just boring yeah I mean I don't want to disrespect it like that but it's like not that you're disrespecting it but it's just like the shit we do is so exciting going on stage for an hour and everyone's listening and you're in control of what the fucking mood but then when you're just like the fifth lead on a movie yeah and you have one really great scene and the other scenes you're just kind of in with four characters and you say shit like oh yeah I remember that or something I mean well she was always a wild one you know what I mean whatever you say it's like that and you had to do that 19 times in a row because they had a shooter from different angles and even though Cooper getting juniors in the movie and you're like oh it's cool I get to work with Cuba Gooding jr. that's cool for like four takes and then you're like I'm fucking hungry where's my phone and why is there no Wi-Fi in this bullshit do you not I mean yeah so yeah by no means am i complaining it's just like I realize doing stand-up is just such a fast-paced fun lifestyle I mean and it's work too but yeah you know it's like we know it also it is stand-up is you like it's you you do what you want to do yeah whereas like these other things is and that's a you know weird thing to say people like whoa you enjoy work with other people ensuring creativity that's great but there's something about like knowing that you put together your whole set beginning and you figured out which way the shit should go and then like you go do somebody else's stuff you liked this isn't as engaging yeah yeah unless you're playing for me unless you're playing like a real character or like or something that's funny and you get to ad-lib and fuck around right yeah yeah yeah it's but like some people thrive on it some notice just arrived on it - yeah I know yeah I mean you lose a lot of them they start to just go to acting stay over there somebody was telling me recently that they were bummed out about hell and they and it was a good point about how you know people like fortune phim stir who's hilarious like she doesn't have an especial yet because she's doing so much acting work you know yeah and she's like a true comedian I think she's really fucking funny but it's like well Duncan Trussell doesn't have a special that's insane there's another one that's insane but does he act no he just says what the fuck is he doing yeah he's funny as shit though he's hilarious he's also nicest shit he's the best but I mean for a guy that is as advanced as he does he should absolutely have a special DS you'd have another special for sure especially cuz everybody has a special now yeah I mean they're not me especially me call them specials anymore yeah they're our thing yeah maybe it's an hour just call it an hour yeah Diaz is gonna do one on Netflix oh yes you know that fucking guy Joey Diaz coming in Netflix that guy is so funny what if I'm not supposed to say that I might have made a scoop well maybe you're wrong fucked up maybe I may be wrong hey bud just made it up maybe you just fucking her Saint shit maybe I'm just talking about Miami hi mmm could be yeah that guy's so fucking funny I mean I think in bursts no one's ever been funnier the the bursts that Joey Diaz can create on stage I've never heard anything funnier yeah he hurts my my cells yeah like your bone cells hurt yeah he's like like him Brody makes me laugh hard yeah just because he's Holtzman Holtzman is I mean that has killed me there's unknown ones man it's mostly unknown though they're well they're free the could and they're you can't the people yeah people don't know what to make of them you know what I mean yeah yeah but the Mun known ones man there's like there's a ton of those guys there was that one guy from Long Island what the fuck was his name again Bob didn't we do this ready didn't we do this before we're trying to figure it out no not Bob Nelson Elsa wasn't that guy with the boxing gloves yes jiffy Jeff's gym yeah he hit himself and I mean how much comedy has changed imagine doing that now I like 10 15 after you or me you can't even have props anymore I'm talking about this the other day with Judd Apatow you're like I used to be like a legit yeah form of comedy prop comedy I even feel like guitar you can't even bring a guitar nowadays there's a few of those guitar writers out there right there's a few hmm yeah it used to be a fucking hard thing to follow on some drugs yeah yeah yeah someone killed with a dirty song then he had to go on after him like damn yeah all this dirty song but those guys uh though they were like a bunch of those guys that would do shit like like Harry basil with the movies and yeah you know yeah that shit killed back in the day I mean dude I would up until 2010 I would see the guy at the Laugh Factory I'd be like these people are dying yeah I haven't seen him recently but no you new kids coming up have a big bag of fucking Santa Claus bag of props like rendering some big cringe when the Grinch Stole all the toys from The Talisman commencin having to bring a bunch of shit though that's one of the things I love about not being a musician oh yeah you know how people say like comedians secret they want to be rock stars dude I couldn't think of I'd rather be a fucking crack dealer than a rock star anybody who says that has never killed maybe like what are you talking about maybe the rock star get out I don't want to do that that's like a lot of work yeah it does plus you gotta be like with your bandmates all-time view that herbs like you can't work with other people like we can work with other people like we do a gig together on the road the next week you could do a gig gig with cows someone like yeah and no one goes hey what the fuck bro we're a team there's no like comedy teams like that I know that's good well that's just like the movie thing you're on your own it's nice yeah I have to deal with other people you know shit yeah I brought a new drummer bro I'm gonna take a chance to San Francisco with Mike this fucking band is a single unit man no you would have to be like a singer singer-songwriter like a Gary Clark jr. hires his own people like if Gary Clark jr. drummers like fuck this I'm out of here people right man yeah you're good it's all about the lead singer though I mean unless you become like maybe the lead guitarist or something or like the violin player in the Dave Matthews Band yeah like he was kind of see then even there though it's still the motherfucking Dave I know I know and a problem with that son no I know but when is that's when it gets deep that's like a dictatorship when it's like a Dave Matthews bed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers right but when it's like rush right and the Rolling Stones kiss you know yeah kiss yeah yeah no no you can't you can't switch the cat out for a fox right okay it's not cool man that's true though name it something right then everybody's kind of the group everybody's in there if you're a heartbreaker though you're gone exactly you're done you're you know you are you're a guitar I'm not gonna buy it yeah Charlie Daniels Band motherfucker what is it Steve Miller as it's a Charlie Wilson know it says Charlie fucking Daniels charlie cuz it's my band you piece of shit yeah NWA you can't get rid of so much guys you can't get rid of any of those guys yeah and all those guys became except for maybe one I know I know when David Lee Roth left Van Halen van Halen was named after Van Halen how about that shit well Eddie fucking Van Halen is the lead guitarist right David Lee Roth left and everybody went goddamn crazy yeah cuz it's van Halen it's true there's a name even though it's your last name it's not the Eddie Van Halen band cuz if that was the case I'd be like okay cool I get it different people it's like Carlos Santana different people sing for him sometimes right right right but it's still the Carlos Santana band yeah just don't be a fuckin heartbreaker man but if van Halen seems like a thing yeah it is yeah I didn't know I didn't I guess I didn't even put it together that I was his last name even though I knew that it's like a vehicle like a van Halen it's a strong yeah yeah name it's uh it's like a Hindenburg yeah it is yeah yeah you could Rogen that's good Billy is not a good one that got the apostrophe fucks it all up yeah the posture fees are weird yeah well we still use no do we forget how to talk it's very well have to tell me how to fucking pronounce it just drop it by the way it makes it worse because people are like - Elliot Leah add fucking elves and shit do you go to like a restaurant you know what the worst is is when I pull into a gate you have a meeting anywhere and you got to give everybody that's thing and then I said and then they say you're not in the system and I'm like try it with or without the apostrophe whichever one you didn't do and then they're like there it is every fucking time every fucking time you should change your last name spelling - duh deed you ate a h l e eh when I was little when I was little I told my dad I was like can we get rid of the ' I was young I was like 12 and he was like huh and I was like it just sucks like I feel like like what is it like people always mispronounce and he's like you should be proud of that and I was like I'm not and then and then [Laughter] 13 that's rough yeah and then and then and then I started to like it you know because I'm I guess it is my name fuck it you know but when I was little I wanted to chamber I remember asking my parents if I could I mean this is embarrassing actually I remember telling my parents that I wanted to change my name to - Damien Monroe no Chris D'Elia - damn Damian Monroe imagine imagine if my name was Damien Monroe you would have hated me immediately no I wouldn't I know you opened widen yeah but dignity of on contentious name ever my name is Theodore Theodore von but but think about but think about this is why you didn't even know why why I wanted because this is so embarrassing and whatever but okay cuz Damien was is the devil right and then Marilyn Monroe was like pure in my head I was like you have both this so this was like a showbiz name I don't know I didn't get very far with it I wait this time yeah same age like young when I was like boy I could call my imagined day myself Damien Moreau oh my god imagine now I would hate that hilarious I'm you all do stupid things as a kid I didn't get to die obviously my parents wouldn't let me do that thank God I was a fucking weirdo man I would ask my parents I would I would ask my peers cuz I always sat like this at the dinner table and I asked him I was like I was like can you call me crazy legs I remember thinking like like that would be cool like if my family called me crazy later hey it's Damien Crazylegs yeah and then they were like and my dad was like no and I was like but just like maybe just at least at the dinner table I remember saying that and you would be like I'm not fucking calling you crazy like you did you Kris oh my god so funny kid shit that was even younger the Crazy Legs thing was like I was a boy like nine god kids ideas are so stupid they're so dumb they're so fucking funny I remember these women laughing in my face once at me trying to be cool and I was like 12 I had these fucking sneakers on I don't know like they were like these brown suede sneakers and I went through a period of time this is very embarrassing I went through a period of time when I was like 12 12 13 where I got really into Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn oh boy I even tried chewing tobacco Wow oh baby tell you chewing tobacco I'm a little kid you'd be 12 and just by chewing tobacco for whatever reason like that wasn't like cigarettes right right right right you could just buy chewing tobacco like I bought it I didn't have to hide that's so weird Todd's fucking crazy let you it would come in this like wallet looking brick and you open it up and you break a piece off like a real old school II fucking Clint Eastwood style chewing tobacco I was retarded okay so I had these these shoes on they were like a brown suede they were really goofy looking and these next-door neighbors in this we rented a house it was me my sister my parents and then one of our friends of the friend of my dad rented one of the rooms in the house like it likes had those upstairs and the next door it's like a very small house then next door was another small house and these young kids lived there like the downstairs people they had a band and they were fucking horrible but they were like super committed so they'd practice all its not good and they had they had carpet everywhere man like you'd go down in the basement and what they had done is taken like 30 or 40 sheets of carpet and like made doors and and packed the walls and they essentially turned the basement into like practice soundproofing but you could you could hear them super clear and okay I remember there the band's name was death in the shopping mall oh my god and the song called my baby is a mutant you remember this yeah yeah I got a crazy memory man and so these guys be like the baby is a mutant yeah mutant okay fucking practicing blowing their eardrums okay I think there were cool as fuck though they let me go over there watch when I was 12 let me go and hang out with these guys one of them scooped ice cream yeah a giant forearms and everybody was like his forearms vanish scoops ice cream I like to do it scoops ice cream all day so these jack forearms and all the like young kids like 12 like scared of this 19 year old dude with his giant for I'm but they were all super friendly but there's these two freaky looking girls that would hang out with them at night you know when you're 12 blue moon group yeah yeah so are these stupid sneakers on I say the girl I go she goes nice sneakers like she's kind of mocking me yeah I don't like colors and my sneakers it turns me off and they burst in the last no not laughing like they existed yeah look at this fucking dork and I'll never forget the feeling when I said it like yeah I don't like colors in my sneakers it turns me off like the feeling of like oh you fuck oh one more thing we thought your wrinkle and quickly while you're saying this ends you're like oh this is not your lies that's hilarious I was 12 I realized as you're saying it like how stupid are you really get checked by the opposite sex when you're I mean there was one time I keep like I am or hi-c yeah the Train I probably still around I don't know yeah but obviously don't drink it but there was great that's them oh my god Wow whoa they have a YouTube video this is a song called purpose definite shopping malls has a fucking this was a five-year four years ago the birthday these guys are 80 oh no that says that would this was in 1981 oh they recorded it in 81 Wow so that was right around the same time because 81 was where I went to high school in 81 so that would make sense that was like so I was I guess I was 13 a minute later in the career but dude that's 2 years later we're talking about in like 79 in 1979 I'm pretty sure that was the age I was pretty crazy because I was 13 yeah because it was right when I first moved to Boston we were living in Jamaica Plain we were living on goddamn I don't remember the name of the street but remember the name of the street it would help but anyway that haunted me those girls laughing in my face funny haunted me for years I still think about interesting I think about I think about shit like that that's I think about shit like that that like you carry with you like you know it's just yeah but sometimes it's just like like that's I mean nothing but what happened was you were too young to have dealt with a situation like that yet yes so that was why you remember it because you're still foe this is new oh god yeah I was aware right personally aware of how ridiculously stupid I sounded right which I got yeah but as a kid you don't have that right you know so I the first few times you yes the same age did you change your name to Damian Monroe oh gosh so we're both forgiven I remember with a yeah I know I had a high C I was a kindergarten her yeah kindergarten I I think and he was before first grade whatever that is kinda like us and the high C straw it was grape I see I remember and I squeezed it wrong and it shot up on my face and I was with a table where there were girls there and it was lunchtime and I remember thinking oh it's probably purple on my face around my eye like piss or something cool yeah and weight and so I was like kiss is cool like I'm gonna just chill with it and just because it happened by accident so it's not like I tried to do it so these chicks are just gonna see me with this cool purple thing on my face I mean oh God I mean same age no kindergarten oh Jesus Christ so young is shit and thinking all these thoughts and then thinking oh my god and then thinking uh I can't wait to like Mack on these girls like it was whatever it was before first grade that's kindergarten okay yeah gonna go yeah mrs. Antoine fell and so so you get grapes great great not even soda Jesus juice juice on your face and I remember thinking like I remember leaving it there and it was very sticky because it's hi-c and it's candy basically so and I was like but leave it though cuz it's cool I remember thinking like just stick with it cuz it's very cool and finally it was so sticky that I was like I hope that this is like paying off cuz I gotta wipe my face and so I asked the girl like really and securely like next to me I was like hey I was like is it like all purple on my face like but like wanting it to be purple you know and she goes and she just goes like this no and then I was like can I go to the bathroom and I wash my face it was just my face zero purple but but that was like and those were actual thoughts that this idiotic fuckin kindergartner had mm-hmm yeah I was like oh I look like a rock star is what I thought this moment's he can remember when you're just a little kid but you're so fucking stupid they will haunt you all the time I think about all the time it's it's probably shaped me you know it definitely has like one ass-kicking in high school could turn you one way or the next left or right like people's been some people been bullied in high school and it fucked him up for the rest of life well yeah they a lot yeah and even before high school like junior high grammar school and shit some people just never recover from it so weird inclination that people have bullies leave schools like deferred find one kid who's fucking nervous and start fucking me yeah that's very news to me where you going after school Nelson besides sucking my dick in the woods hmm I never understood that oh I hate big giant gay dude once you suck his dick in the world yeah you go to high school with him fight him off every day your parents don't believe you yeah I mean IIIi love to always making fun of people but not bullying yeah well I think there's a lot of kids who get physically abused at home yeah that's a big fag they get their power back yeah and then there's physical bullying that way but then there's psychological bullying too and then there's a certain amount of natural pecking order shit that kids do to each other they're competitive with each other and one will say something shitty in the next we'll say something shitty back and then they form fucking teams a word Cruz Chris piece of shit right you know and then you're like you know what man Mike and I we're just fucking you guys gotta pick a team you are a team Chris team Mike Lions bro yeah there's a lot of animal behavior like I have chickens and one of my chickens like one of them something goes wrong like the other one start fucking with it they peck at it really yeah yeah it's weird you eat them no I don't eat the chick always just i eat their eggs Oh which are non fertilized ladies and gentlemen all you crazy vegans out there not getting enough protein look in the eggs get yourself some chickens they're your pets they're gonna run around you can even if you want to you feed them vegetarian diets which you really shouldn't because they're not vegetarians their little fucking dinosaurs bro but the thing is when they see like something wrong with one of the other ones it's a real problem one of them gets injured the other ones start pecking at it weird yeah makes you think that that's how we are secretively well I think at our base level no but I think what is so like when it's interesting about all these anti-bullying campaigns is that they didn't exist we were younger and whether or not you make an argument for people figuring out how to get a through the natural methods that we've always encountered like finding good people and bad people and finally who you like and finding out about your own behavior and how it affects other people either way it's what I think's going on is we don't want people to fuck with people anymore and I think in the old days everybody just accepted that people fucked people and now we realize we're going older we realize but what's crazy is that that we're figuring this out as a culture in the last 20-30 whatever-the-fuck years it's been yeah but it's it's it's social media that's what it is because now everything is exposed it is that but I think it was on its way there just through traditional methods like books and regular media in colleges and universities that's one of the reasons why college and universities are so important for changing thought especially were there kind of in a fucked up place now but there was a thing where you would leave your environment and go to this new environment right and this new environment would be filled with intellectual filled with people they're trying to change the world and you'd be exposed to ideas you never got before and so through those ideas then you learn a bunch of shit and then you go out with this idea that you're gonna go do this are you gonna go apply your knowledge now there or get a degree here and everything would sort of compound and your understanding of the world would be far better than the people that came before you because just the fact that humanity's accumulated 20 30 plus years of information since the time your parents were in school right so all that aside as that goes by that gets you a certain way it gets you a certain amount of steps past the barbarians and the fucking Romans all the Psychopaths of our history but now once social media kicks in now everything's Exelero yeah in a way we can't even control yes completely out everybody's hands that's why trigger words and save spaces and everyone's going fucking crazy no it's too fast for us to catch up with yeah you know but it's moving in the right direction like even all the ridiculous like trigger words safe spaces stuff all that stuff is like it sink the inclination is to be nicer yeah that's a good thing for sure yeah so some of it's ridiculous it's not well thought out like you're better off having people communicate and having spaces you better off figuring out a way to bake people just not shitty to each other I'll screaming and yelling at each other like find a better method of communication but the point is it's like they're moving in that direction they're moving in a really good direction even these ridiculous like liberals that shut down that evergreen college they're going nuts they didn't want white people to show up for work for a day their inclination is probably correct they just want to balance things out and when things right now they feel like black people are still like in a bad position as far as like racial injustice and by pushing white people down they're gonna balance the black blob but they just don't understand human right he just doesn't doesn't work like that works ya know well we're breaking it down Chris D'Elia I know man on fire is it hard picking a name for you special for this one it was not because you have a bit yeah yeah but yeah I find it difficult yeah do you yeah I was actually before yours came out I was like man if somebody should do like trigger warning or something yeah I just a great title I did it because I knew it you're upset some people yeah but that's but that's but that's who you are though and that's that's what that I mean you talk about all the things that are would trigger somebody well I just talk about what's ridiculous about those things and and with that special particularly I knew like the Bruce Jenner bit I'm like yeah this this one's coming home hard yeah is it they need a trigger warning I don't even know I'm a physical comedian I don't know how you made that bit work and all that shit no but I mean not even just that like the the the the build and everything it was just like it became a bunch of different things like it started out it started out a little different started out you know it was a little more calm and then I realized like you know the only way this is gonna work like worth people gonna really think I'm a demon cuz I try to think this is a fucking goofy thing to admit but when I'm doing that bit I just do this bit about Tigers fucking one of the key that figured out the key to the bit at one point the heat of the bit was to think like a tiger yeah and to move like a top not think of myself as a comedian when I did that bit I was thinking to myself as a demon I don't think of myself as a they kick soft incident so then my inclination was to just climb on the stool right just like and getting this weird sort of going hunched over stance because and plus I figured because I'm really flexible it'll look weird yeah yeah yeah that's funny my oppa sometimes my opener is like how do you do like the act outs like that and I'm just like you just believe that that's what you are for a little bit yeah but if you could do it if you could pull it off yeah you know you ever see Jimmy Schubert's bit about Eagles mating no it's a hilarious bit but when Schubert's doing it it's because Eagles have this crazy thing where they fuck while they're flying oh yeah and when they when they fuck they stay connected until they come so like sometimes they don't make it they fucking crash into the ground and die hilarious but his bit you know he's doing it yeah yeah and like while he's doing it even though you know it's Timmy sherbert you're thinking about thinking like an Eagles funny he's he's an eagle right now he's in his in his element that's funny it's not a truck backing out something that's for sure not too loud right I mean that's so loud yeah squirt indoors we're nowhere near that truck is this how you get your money they just back up this fire broke yeah everything has to be white white Eminem's I want one of the moments white sock someone new sneakers every day of the week son they're the rapper I saw a rapper the yesterday got a Papa Smurf diamond encrusted chain man they just run out to each other you know what I've been thinking to doing I've been thinking to live in two separate ways if they're gonna get in the cabin in the woods right where I live like I have a well solar power just chill out there for half the year the other half of the year I get the dopest house I can afford in Beverly Hills just walk around in furs everywhere I like myself a Lyman's so you use side lasses outside at night always yeah that's great so you have to hear your one half to the other a limo with my face on it you make the driver worth mask of you I'm gonna get a grill yeah that I can only put on for six months a year so after six months they take the grill off and then I go back to being the woods guy I'm bored being one person look I think you know I mean I looked into that right well yeah because look to park had the songs about how lifts are women up and then he would be the other guy be like fuck bitches - yeah that's very configured it out yeah well he was just a poet and also he was a reporter he was reporting on what's going on retreats are you not get a crib in downtown LA like one of them penthouse cribs overlooking the city yeah pool on the deck Oh would your family be with you both on what fuck you talking about one of the year no I'm a different dude I'm a different look I saw a video of a guy where they were this guy said he was trans age he was a young girl he like he identified with being a young girl mm-hmm he was like a 50-something year-old man the identify would being a young girl mmm he has children they let this guy dress up like a young girl and people were accepting it his family's accepting it he was talking to people he's saying how he really feels what's to stop you from being a totally different person I get it to identify as I get Korean just identifies a different guy like right now you identify as Chris D'Elia yeah what I'm good now put that other character what's Damian what Damien Moreau yeah dude was I ahead of my time you might have been ahead of your time this is what I'm thinking you could be this as the guy trans woman lives her life as a six year old yeah has a family has children that someone's daddy so what is the girl that he thinks is six so he said what was he doing for six years ago still the guy six years ago he hadn't been born yet bro so Kenny seven no no no and there's always this identified so age is irrelevant dude okay you can't age someone just like you can't gender someone a piece of shit shit I am God that's him as a woman but what about he's gonna die one day incorrect he called it so there it was he had a gang kids and then fell on his head or something what what what caused it I don't know maybe just decided well so what if you can do that you can do that that's who you identify with now you're a girl you could change your name you could change your name you're Becky now thank you I'm Caitlin I want you to be I'll be nine said well I don't mind going to six so I've been six ever since [Music] well whoa yeah Wow I don't know what to make of that Jesus Christ okay listen to this nonsense well I have a mommy and a daddy an adopted mommy and a daddy who are totally comfortable with me being a little girl and their children and their grandchildren are totally supportive in fact her youngest granddaughter when I was eight a year ago she was eight so she's getting older when I was eight a year ago I was eight and she was seven and she said to me I want you to be the little sister so I'll be nice Oh I said well I don't mind going to six so I've been six ever since well so now he's just changing it though we in a world of nonsense so he doesn't identify with it if he just keeps changing it I'm not even gonna have real diamonds on my grille I'm gonna tell everybody they're real but they're gonna be cubic zirconias because no it's foods gonna get caught no man who gives a shit really identify as real diamond mm-hmm platinum on the outside though for sure Wow for sure platinum and then I'd get it taken off every six months and I become woods guy what's guy yeah I'm into it man I'll vouch for you I know he's two people did you tell me you can't be a different person you can totally be a different person you feel different a lot during the day you feel like one way what some morning you're sad and then that night you're like oh this is a great life you know remember that bitter sweet symphony' song I'm a million different people from one day to the next [Music] not the way you're there was a band called The Verve and it was a great song I know yes I know the song they lost all the money because the the opening riff sounded just yes I remember downs remember that yeah I heard something recently similar to this did you know that that song I'll be missing you that Puff Daddy yeah about that yeah yeah she has made all of the money from that song yeah every breath you take how much 60 or 70 million dollars he doesn't share with the police it's just his money but also police see that's where he fucked up yeah that's right the police well but he wasn't it wasn't a sting in the on the edge no dude it can't be the edge that's as you - right u2's it got the edge what's the other self the edge bro what's that a bansa one of the guys in the band he calls himself he's a white guy he's a white guy any color itself the edge hey no yeah definitely no I always be the thing I just like what I just love when rappers are like that's why they call me fucking the edge and you're like you asked people to call you that dude that's why people call you that yeah you can't do that they call me the love professor no no no they call me it when you say they call me I I'd stop listening yeah they call me the psychological coordinator that's a good one that could be one of your guys that is the Lord's guy psychological coordinator I just sit and write books on people this is what I think I'm a view dome on television yeah I mean why can't you be a different person if you can identify as being just decide I'm 9 or I'm 6 did you see the one about the guy who identifies as an alien or no he wants to have his yeah but off yeah because he wants to be an air well he's done his whole body he's yeah I know you look a ton of money yeah is he that he you not allowed to say he can we say Z Z what he would you say Z Z has spent a ton of money he has fake lips and done some nutty shit 2 Z's eyes $50,000 at over a hundred procedures first of all earth stop stop right there that's not true because that means each procedure is how much you've done a hundred procedures if T divided by 100 or 50,000 divided by 100 how cheaper these fucking procedures 14 dollars each yeah this is ridiculous a hundred procedures well go to procedures a thousand dollars it would be a hundred thousand dollars so you've done a hundred procedures at there making five hundred dollars each make it like a five for one dude it's plastic surgery is fucking expensive that's one of those things it's like a burger you want to pay the most yeah yeah iDevice I mean unless he's got a friend 100 just $100,000 or $50,000 on a hook look at his legs right there yeah that's been taking so much dick that your your cave caves in but what he's just like when they drill from coal they don't do the proper seismic studies so he doesn't have a exactly Aegina or a penis Z he's an alien that's she's Z's trying to become a genderless alien it's an interesting look I mean why not man you know people want to get their face tattooed why not get wacky and do this and who the fuck am I to judge my arms are covered in tattoos no I mean if fucking if it makes a person happy yeah are the alien all over my arms but keep that picture up man what you doing you want to keep it to yourself by the way do you do you scrub down let me see the top one another the top one the face one is it the weird face one no no the one like yeah that with the top top one that one is fucking trippy what is he doing what is he doing to Z's eyes well Vinnie is makeup artist Vinnie Oh 22 from Los Angeles California oh it has plans costing over a hundred and sixty thousand dollars to become a genderless alien he's already spent fifty thousand though so there's ten photos yeah Jesus these are raised is that the others contacts contacts but it might also be oh you look you that's kind of normal ish right that that is normal what kind of pain you have to be in to want to be genderless a genderless alien mm-hmm woof but who am I to judge who was anybody to judge Chris D'Elia wouldn't this world be better if we didn't a judge we didn't exist you and I wouldn't exist we wouldnt have a job in here it's a problem that's like that Breton's joke when he's like who could joy the only god can judge me he's like no a judge can judge you it's funny joke shit you're right the judge can judge dammit I know before I get this done is there anybody else who could judge me yeah I mean be honest with me hey bro nobody could judge you but God nobody nobody our judges an occupation aware what it is oh yeah did you know that a chiropractor is not even a DA did you III love tattoos I always want to get that twos but like I just don't be scared well it's it's just what if I don't like Italy exactly right that's the feel with it so let's go to a good tattoo artist yeah but what if I'm like oh I love well I got super lucky the guy who did me he's a gentleman named Aaron Dellavedova from Guru tattoo in San Diego and he's a just world-renowned tattoo artist and does the kind of style of tattoo that I like like nig bold lots of colours and stuff he's just so I got lucky that I got it took a long time now I dig it I gotta wait and get an appointment and yeah this one took like I wanna say this one took like 50 hours and this one took like 40 so you got that was done done you got that all done yeah once no no pieces in pieces but but for eight hours then I come back again they would do like one part for eight hours I understand that but you that whole thing was a design it was like exactly yeah cuz usually a lot of people just add to it when I started small right I had this little idea and he was like yeah it's like you have too much shit you're trying to do and there's one little thing I was like hmm so what should I go like half sleeves laid your jaw up a half sleeve and then I like fuck it let's just go all the way in so all of a sudden then you were tattooed yeah all of a sudden well it took no I understand the air yeah yeah Wow but it seemed like when people like sort of piece them together like one little tattoo that time there's something about big pieces like when someone has a big flowing piece you're gonna get something done it's all like personal choice and you like you just have your arms yeah I like them they don't bother me I always think they look cool like you know even Conor McGregor and shit like that looks cool he's wacky a gorilla on his neck on his neck you know a girl with a crown but it's like cool it's him you know I mean are you gonna pay money to see that fight I got I gotta see that I mean I don't really follow it too much but I got to see that right right yeah I would see I would say yeah oh I would definitely watch it I'm working that night I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna avoid your shutting out about the fuck yeah and shake you so you can watch it yeah I mean there's no how yeah I mean I'm in DC that night so I got to figure out how I can watch it without finding out what happened if that's it's a possible way but what about what do you think you have an idea what's gonna happen I think Floyd Mayweather is gonna win a boxing match that's what I think it's like how he's going to win and whether or not he's challenged and whether or not he's put in danger he could be put in danger for sure if Connor puts Connors gotta put himself in danger and he's got to be confident enough to like he's got to get a hold of them I think he's got to rough him up he's definitely not going to win it just like a straight boxing match against the best boxer ever right and I don't think he thinks he would do that either I think what he wants to do is clip him just like go after him make a big sprint right away try to clip him try to hurt him yeah try to rough him up the more the time goes on what happens with a guy like Floyd is he starts I mean he's been boxing for so long he starts doing things and anticipating your reaction of those things timing yeah he'll do things not even so that he could hit you but to see how you react and how fast you are yeah and maybe if he did this and then came over the top or maybe if he did this and stepped over here and hit you with a left hook and he gets it in his head and he starts moving around and he puts you in like he sort of like has these parameters for your movements almost like he's a supercomputer you see like Anderson Silva used to do that too you could see him like measured timing he would see how you react that bang he dropped that front kick on your face or something like that he just sees that there's an opening there he knows how fast he can execute a technique he knows how fast after watching him move for a while that you can move and he knows whether or not you can get him whether you can get to her like how fast all right so once Floyd has those numbers in his head then you just get your face boxed off yeah then you get your face that's so interesting that a guy can be so good at that that and and and and work so hard and not get brutally ruined you know to the point to become it and then become a champion you know I mean there's a bunch of facts all this training and shit I mean obviously guys get hurt and then can't become a champion yeah to be that guy that's gotten to that point is just amazing Floyd's got a bunch of factors on the side one his uncle is a fantastic former professional boxer Roger Mayweather is the guy he was a world champion he was a bad motherfucker and he would starch guys with one punch but he had a totally different style and then his dad Floyd made with a senior fought Sugar Ray Leonard and had a really good fight against Sugar Ray Leonard if I want to remember he was stopped late in the fight I don't remember when but so his dad was an outstanding boxer his uncle was an outstanding boxer and he grew up boxing so he grew up knowing technique at a very early age when you know it of really really age you can get real good at it because you can get good at it later there's a lot of fuckin unicorns like people that don't make any sense but when you're young you don't hit that hard yeah so you and your buddies can hit each other you don't hurt each other so you learn how to borrow and you you don't have the consequences yeah if you learn how to box and you're 180 pounds and you're boxing other dudes at 180 pounds and you're fucking savages and and you throw and let it each other a little boxing scary and dangerous but when you're a little kid you can't even hurt each other huh that's what actually Joel Gerson was saying that it's way easier to teach kids how to like throw oh yeah because you know your body fucks up when you're on 200 pounds trying to throw somebody else 200 pounds yeah when you're 40 pounds you thrown another 40 pound or no one gets hurt yeah yeah Floyd's just as good as they've ever been in terms of boxing he's got a unique style he doesn't take a lot of damage he's the best defensive boxer evolved in terms of the amount of time that he gets hit nobody gets hit less yeah I don't know much about boxing or fighting at all but I have funny I got to see that it's a freak show yeah it is it's not a boxing match because Connor doesn't have a lot of boxing matches it's not like we're looking at Canelo Alvarez when he was challenging Floyd we're going whom you think Canelo can get to him well we can go back and look at this fight he did really well no you can't look at anything doesn't the wind the stamina I mean like a boxer stamina he's got to go 12 rounds right true yes he is what five rounds four championship fight but it's five five-minute rounds with kicking and wrestle right wait yes fucking way easier to go three minutes boxing that it is to go five minutes of MMA fucking ways I guess I didn't know that I'm grappling and shit no comparison not that I've done either one of them professionally but I'm just telling you as far as like the amount of work that you put out in a three minute round just using your hands versus wrestling fighting off submissions getting your legs kicked kicking all those things require tremendous amounts of energy I think UFC athletes are some of the most conditioned athletes in the world oh yeah high-level when you get to like a Mighty Mouse level when you know he's he that guy can go five rounds full clip and never get that guy I mean oh we were talking about that guy how much he gets hit dude nobody hits my knee mouse these days he's on such another level right now he's ladies several levels past Mighty Mouse Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson who you talked about the Asian guy know who was the Asian guy that kept getting punched in the face we talked about him we are you talking about uh the Korean super boy yeah oh joy yeah that was the crazy fight with cubs watch my team ounces the pound-for-pound best fighter okay so the UFC flyweight champion du haut choi is one of the most exciting 145 pound contenders yeah and he had a fucking crazy fight with cups was crazy oh my god it was just that was the blood and guts fight of the year yeah because they were playing at the Comedy Store when it was yeah that was a crazy fucking fight yeah it's some it's it's all about like whether or not Conor can and you probably can't hit him I mean just you gotta be honest probably playing not your cell we cannot yeah probably cannot I mean Floyd has been doing this forces the defensive box or yeah it's a different it's a different world man yeah it's a different world is no leg kicks there's no takedowns there's no it's it's a different world was it you that was saying somebody was saying something about Connor has something has the one thing over Floyd that nobody's ever had over him and that's that he can say I can kick your fucking ass yeah I can fuck you up is that you a chance yeah it is me if there was an MMA fight it would be what look Connor as a chance in a boxing match cuz he knows how to box right Floyd has no chance at weight a 0 right 0 its leg kick to take down to smash to strangle every day yes baseball player in the Octagon yeah because even can't even punch him if Connors kicking well if they just let Connor kick if they said ok listen you can't do MMA but you can kick oh my god I'm putting all the money on con real 100% of it 100 fuckin percent you let him kick ya Jesus Christ how many leg kicks you think Floyd Mayweather jr. can take even if he's blocking Judy Connors gonna side kick his nose at the legs yeah that's the worst he's gonna fuck his legs up who's never gonna get close enough to hit him he's gonna side kick his legs he's gonna side kick his body he's gonna I mean there's no chance no chance but first take the legs away and no chance for Conor not no chance for Conor but small boy if you have money well yeah I remember the first time I I felt a kick to my leg I I couldn't I couldn't believe how hard I had it horrible yeah it's horrible yeah dude there was this guy named Pedro his oh it was a one of the top UFC heavyweights fought all over the place and he used to leg kick guys and he was this big fucking Brazilian dude this was a long UFC long time ago back and he would submit guys just by kicking their legs oh yeah yeah if you break your leg he'd break it and his leg kicks were so heavy you would hear them like rings out it would just sound different to say oh no this guy's gonna let him kick him no he's not he's gonna locate a journalist he's gonna hold the pouch yeah that's Pedro his own no don't do it he's gonna let him kick his leg now look at the size of Pedro he's giant you don't yes guys journalists this guy's gonna let him do that come on they're not gonna do it dude he could just I mean that's not even an exaggeration he touch you like that with his leg and you have a charley horse what I'm not kidding dude he was a gorilla he's the hardest hardest leg kicks I've ever seen because he was a big-ass heavy weight is this guy gonna hold a pad or what we're gonna go flying no oh my god this is gonna be awful for him even with the pad here it goes come on son that dude just flew through the air and flipped and landed on its face and it didn't look like it was nothing for him for the other guy dude that's how hard Pedro his Oh kicks you gotta understand there's no way that was a hundred percent either Oh probably was really yeah I was hit again the dude flew through the air that was 170 pound man he went flying through the air that guy flew that's really crying he was terrified at least he went with it he fought Rico Rodriguez Rico was one of the top UFC heavyweight at the time and he hit him with a leg kick lop and he could see the look at Rico's like what in the fuck is that all about he just had a different amount of power yeah like that it was like George Foreman punches but with the legs just had a totally different thing going on you were you a big fan of boxing no back yeah Cuba for UFC and all that oh yeah man I still AM I still am a big fan of boxing I love it boxing is exciting because like when you see a guy like Sergey Kovalev first versus Andre Ward look at the last fight mm-hmm you're seeing like the margin of error that each guy is operating in it's so small and it's just two things this is left hand right hand those are two weapons right and the margin of error that you have won one guy's an expert at punching people in the face and the other guy's an expert at punching people in the face and you're moving around trying to find your openings and these like war old glass top of the food chain guys are trying to smash each other with their punches and that's all they have to rely on so in making something like very limited to me especially because I watch so much MMA it becomes interesting because I'm like okay now I don't have to think about legs right you don't have to think about takedowns all I have to think about is which guy you know like which guy is gonna be able to solve this puzzle right and it's very fascinating fight to the point where people I like fights that people get mad at like they get they go that fight suck I was excited because they thought it wasn't exciting or whatever exactly exactly well that's why I've always been a fan of Floyd Mayweather yeah cuz of what he's able to do defensive right like nobody can do what he does that's cool yeah they say he's an amazing defensive boxer I mean every fighter should watch him every fighter should learn it just like how he could stand right in front of you two I mean we stood right in front of guys just fucking there was a video on YouTube I was watching where the guy was like I want to show you guys the head move that I'll just make sure you don't I won't even block but that's how I'll never get hit in the head and and he goes up to random people on the street and he's like hey I've seen that guy yeah he's like go ahead and try to punch me for like a minute and I'm not gonna block I knew the guy was like oh okay and then he just never gets hit in the face because he's doing his fucking head Bob yeah but he's got him find the right guys well he's not fighting a professional boxer you roll up on Deontay Wilder yeah I'll do it but still I mean you know that's interesting I wouldn't have thought about that yeah a guy who can move his head like like a Floyd Mayweather or Vasily lomachenko like that kind of guy the a guy who can like stand right in front of you you can't hit him that's one of the most terrifying guys to face that's fucking crazy you can't hit him like this is just not there and he's hitting you all the time getting frustrated and you're wind you're getting winded you miss a punch and you realize you're caught a spiderweb yeah you're slowly getting lit up that's what's gonna be interesting to to see what happens to Connor if he does find himself in the web he finds himself in the web whether or not he tries to distance himself with flow it from Floyd and stay on the outside whether a knight tries to clinch up with him and bully him well well he does something like really confusing the Floyd doesn't expect like it's all like his coach John Kavanagh the guy who's coached mmm a very very smart guy and a brilliant tactician and together they're their team is I like their approach the very very unique approach and one of the things they do is they come up with these oh I don't really on earth attacks training routines because his statement that really rings true with me as he says we want to upgrade the hardware upgrade the software without damaging the hardware Cavanaugh says yeah so they do a lot of drills instead of like constant hard sparring and the idea is that when you do hard sparring all the time the problem is like it's hard for experimentation because yeah punished if you fuck up and and it's hard to download new stuff and then the other side the other hand doing things like just doing drills over and over again can get kind of boring yeah yeah so they come up with all these innovative ways it's cool to incorporate new kind of movements and a lot of it's weird like they throw throw cards enemies get this guy throws cards out how many punches the cards I've seen one yeah effective if at all that is yeah but it's a freak show that's what's I mean the crazy thing is what if fucking Conor wins yes that is that's that's like kind of bad for boxing ah it's awesome for Conor McGregor oh it's great for him I don't think it's bad for boxing cuz Conor McGregor can box I mean he really can talk sir the questions Kenny box oh right right right a big difference you know I mean then at Conor McGregor's the biggest star ever oh yeah never if he knocks out Floyd Mayweather he's the biggest athlete of all time he becomes first of all in Europe he becomes the king of Europe they just give him crowns and they make a castle for him that's crazy dude if he if he knocks out Floyd Mayweather he is like literally probably the most popular athlete of all time he might surpass like he's like in Muhammad Ali lives right I mean he's already he's already yeah I think Muhammad Ali was problem it wasn't art time but I think he was probably at a totally different level because Muhammad Ali also represented like the civil rights right right represented this bigger than just the resistance of the Vietnam War he lost his license to fight for three years it's a story yeah he's a he's a symbol of generatio Connor is just an amazing fighter right so take away Muhammad Ali and I think he's probably Ranas away well but if he loses and he gets embarrassed by Floyd even still it's not a sport he's got nothing to lose I mean he's making a $109 anyway the fuck knows I'm sure it's a hun okay yeah so many people gonna be watching how can it not be the craziest thing about Connor is that four years ago he nobody knew who the fuck he was yeah I mean that's that's crazy that's like there's no profession where like all of a sudden you're that big of a star but it doesn't even exist in MMA you gotta understand nobody else does that it's just him so how so what happened he's that well shit by the way he's like 28 Jesus Christ 28 29 I tweeted him when he won the cage warriors title or he made it mine been defending his title I think was Cage Warriors anybody flatlines I'm toodles like this kids fucking good really yeah and I tweeted them congratulations and I said I hope to see in the UFC someday and I was like 2013 yeah that's cuz I access TV shoutout to access TV formerly HDNet they had so many good fights online actually maybe it was the internet I might have been on the internet actually now that I think got your phone's look sensational hope seeing the UFC someday that's a cool man guy that's crazy 2013 January of 2013 but but to think that he tweeted that then and then and then now he's the biggest fighter on the planet hat that was before I even came there that's just pretty dumb so he's so basically you're saying he rose so quickly because he's just something special yeah I got you he's something special and he knocks people dead right you know he's except everybody except Nate Diaz Nate Diaz that just shows what a bad motherfucker he is he's the most underutilized fighter in MMA period in terms of like his star power like capitalizing on it I don't think the UFC even knows how fucking huge Nate Diaz is and Nick is brother Nick branding wise you're saying and everybody loves those guys if they're fucking characters you know like an American version of snatched that's fucking funny right is it snatched or snatched next movie snatched was the goldie hawn yes amy schumer about snatch confused and there's another snatched the snatched is maybe like a TV show on the ID channel or some birthday should i mean i was snatched be great if it was either alien abductions or a guy works as a doctor i like to trim them extra didn't snatch your cleaning up this white pussy yeah i was a doctor yeah no uh yeah but that guy to me Nate Diaz looks like a fucking a guy you don't fuck with oh yeah for sure he's huge people don't realize how his Nate is in between fights motherfuckers walking around like two hundred pounds is huge it's big fella mmm big and super could do so how did he follow you just leaned out to fight Connor yeah just well they fought at 170 both time that's so much weight to lose as a 200 pounder yeah but oh you do it slow yeah you know you do it over the course of you know like I'm sure he's carrying some body fat now when he got down to 155 is fighter 55 before when he fought a 55 before the Conor fight he fought Michael Johnson one of his best fights at 55 155 dude shredded at the way insane in that fight like for the weigh-ins he was obviously in like crazy crazy okay it smokes weed by the way holla no now everybody thinks the weed makes you lazy well no I mean lazy makes you lazy you smoke weed look at that shredded Wow is that from that fight that's it right there look at that boom son that's a mean-looking motherfucker yeah doesn't have no fat that he's got some sensational UFC victories - he got mean the guy should be I mean he made a shitload of money on the Conor fight and the rematch I'm sure he made shitload of money those guys but now what though what's he gonna do well Rhonda right there Jesus Christ his body you could set him up with some good fights that was in Conor was like severely dehydrated that's a 145 pound picture I believe yeah that's fight night yeah so that was a 1/4 five pound picture knows before he had the notorious on his abs all right right fucked up man do that vicious abs just scribbled on them Wow but yeah when you see him at 170 like when you fought Eddie Alvarez at 155 or Morbius yeah he's the 155 champ now what's really fucked up because he was the 145 pound champ and then he just left the title one 155-pound title so now he had two world titles in the UFC and then he just they'd sort of take to see that picture right there's way bigger there yeah jacked well that's the Nate Diaz rematch he was jacked hmm but how tall is he is not tall right he's five nine yeah yeah Nate Diaz is what's ounces to it too so that's the Alvarez fight okay so that's one that's him at 155 actually the Nate Diaz fight well yeah I bet they're real similar in sizes that's the Nate Diaz fight oh yeah that's like his lat now that's Alvarez because it's uh he's jacked Oh does it oh you're right oh yeah that's right UFC 202 right yeah okay so that's that makes sense because he's 117 look at that tattoo yeah that's incredible that's not not I would have say hey man put that somewhere else put this shit on your back or something fuck up your abs son but you know when it comes to personalities yeah personalities and fighting yeah see the difference yeah he looks he looks different huh yeah he was so sucked in for that first fight like Jesus Christ he was like he looks on the top he looks like a guy that would like yell at you on the street corner yeah like a crazy person yeah you're on the bottom his face is nice and full yeah it looks so he's gonna kill you yeah he's gonna make a lot of money whether or not he could beat that guy yeah either way it's gonna be fascinating to see it's gonna be fast isn't it not to talk about this too much but isn't it quit isn't it like soon to have the like they don't have time to Train exactly which is what I think what Floyd wants yeah I think Floyd was probably in great shape and I think actually it's probably good to do it this way I think they prepared for for quite a long time for the accident committed to it I hope it leaves yeah I know he was preparing he didn't take any MMA fights didn't even think about it and it's kind of soon though August just around the corner yeah sure wasn't working also can't can't they make so much money if they waited I don't know man this is such a freak show I think they might be playing it right yeah maybe yeah cuz this ain't something like you're gonna plan out for six months people might lose steam yeah maybe you're right yeah yeah maybe right you know what's the most dragged out fight of all time jean-claude Van Damme was gonna have a was it a kickboxing fight I think it was a kickboxing fight with some cat some Thai guy who won the gold medal in the Olympics and they went around for years and never did losing having like face offs and shit and yeah I never did it never did it yeah that's hilarious oh he had the best reality show jean-claude John there was my favorites I love that dude that Volvo commercial or whatever fuck it was those and he's got his legs spread between the two trucks it's real I mean you definitely do the splits but I really don't think people what way it's ridiculous I mean is what a cat guy I remember I watched Street Fighter twice in one day it was the instruments they got a guy or guy yeah I'm going to kick that son of a bitch Bisons and so Ord he would say so Ord that fucking killed me I see he said Ord what is this I'm a statue in Brussels my powerful jean-claude Van Damme look at him so happy sunglasses doesn't give a fuck I know yeah what a character he's got Russia he's people he just looking at John Claude Van Damme has to have like he looks like a guy who would have the the darkest sexual life you know what I mean like like like has a wife Carlos blow security right now Oh your wife so I want you suck his dick Wow no doubt I don't think so man well that's how he looks and he has his sunglasses on it's nighttime that's it you're telling me come on look at him looking right there it's what he blew security right now dad sit I know guys who have had that happen where they were with a guy and the guy wanted his wife to suck their dick a friend of mine said that this guy was coaching his wife through sucking his dick and he had just met the two of them that night that's some different yeah I don't I mean like what what is he a board or what yeah there's not like a thing that is with you before that and then it just comes out or because that's what is that like that's like that yeah Wow good question like it can't be it can't be one day you're just like you know suck his dick you know it's not like that it has to be when with you before that yeah what a man it has to be yeah who knows why I don't know might be I don't know though you know it's one of those things we got to think why does it bother us well here's the deal man being being in an open relationship is different than watch oh yeah but still why does it bother us it's like why is it bothers but it does like you like for the most part yeah the idea that somehow or another you could blow a fuse and then you're right next to a guy going you like that honey honey work the balls but suck it suck when it was balls yeah your mouth do the thing I like put your hand ma a.m. jerk your hand off like where your fingers are facing him but it's it's a fucking weird day yeah it's super weird because I was like what do you miss a power thing right yeah it's a power thing I guess it's also like I'm a freak thing it's like we're being naughty we're doing something dangerous where we're rebels we're something what are we I never I was gonna got some weird stuff but I've had I had a fan once their driver came up to me and he was like hi I was instructed to come over here and I want you to this guy wants you to meet his wife and sleep with him it was in Jakarta sleep with her you mean to hurry access either way I'm not doing it wrong but I really wanted to fuck him that was the thing he had this face there's like a guy out there sort of how that like picture makes epileptics have seizures yeah there was a guy out there that makes your dick harden great just didn't expect it at all out of nowhere yeah like you might not even have to like see him in person but if it's a guy that's so pretty like they figured out a way have the perfect on a masculine but not even pretty just the kind of vibe you like he's five yeah like a bear like a John good like a handsome girl guy cuz like I'm not gay I like look I'm not gay I never had such the guy but if I was going to I think I would pick like a big guy like a nice looking guy hmm not like a pretty guy right like a Tom Selleck in his prime yeah shoes no socks red car Christian so with some of the flowers in your shirt bro yeah that's how you hit honor hey man what's up with the flowers in her shirt what are you doing later do you feet stink don't lie to me bro some guy guy in Hawaii man right there in Hawaii I was used to think when Tom Selleck was in Hawaii magnum p.i was in Hawaii I always think like does he hate being in Hawaii after a while too about like cuz like lost and then they do Hawaii five-o there by the way that guy there's a guy I mean there was a guy that was on both lost in Hawaii five-o well he probably loves you you must listen man people who live down there you're living in paradise except for the occasional hurricane other than that you living in paradise yeah but it's also I mean dude it's so humid man I mean I was in I was in West Palm Beach this past weekend and I was like yeah it's beautiful but like it's too hot 92 degrees feels like 4,000 degrees yeah it gets funky and you know and then you go back to LA and you're like oh this is the best it's dry it's just Rises best yeah like Phoenix Phoenix can get hot as fuck Phoenix is just yeah but you're landlocked - I feel like nice if you're drew right you're just getting a boat if shit gets right yeah let's have a load on your deck like tight now even if you're just in Santa Monica or like the valley as the tsunami hits you get in get out and you always like freeze-dried foods would you want to be the guy who gets hit in the head by the asteroid or would you want to be the guy that has to figure out how to rebuild civilization yet because get hit in the head nice and quick view if you got a rebuild civilization how many even in how many 40 40 people oh that's it that's it I probably won't get hit in the head then you have to fuck your sister in order to make people I don't have one thank God but what do you do if it's just you and your sister and you're the only two people alive I'd want to get hit in the head for sure but if they're but if you are alive right now and she's alive and she wants to stay alive you're like look there's only one way you can make more people and just have people with that don't you have kids with Down syndrome and shit not yet I think it takes a while he's a few generations but even worse than that you bang each other and then you have to bang your kids well the kids have to bang each other right because otherwise that's it it stops right there so then it has to be go it's got to get to a certain point with us like 30 or 40 people yeah everyone's fucking their kids then you have to make new rules okay let that planning people you can't fuck your kids and him right now your this is how it used to be guys we can do it what when was this 400 years ago before the big rock from the sky shut off the power I can't feel the Wi-Fi but my sister's hot you know they didn't like that I know you imagine it's forbidden now but your mom and dad were brother and sister you like that's a fuckin guys you're fucking hypocrites that sounds like a fucking hulu series I was thinking the Hallmark Channel yeah nah Hulu then you get to see like tits and shit in it you know I mean yeah yeah you remember that uh do remember that movie brown bunny or Vince I saw it in the theater and I brought my ex-wife you know what it was said she didn't and she was like what is it I was like it's gonna be good let's go cuz I love Vincent Gallo and I went to and and when she sucks his dick in the movie my ex goes like this oh it's a porn I left what's crazy is it's a whole movie kind of one scene at the way it doesn't matter I know it's a Lepore yeah I know isn't that hilarious yeah I like anything Vincent Gallo does it so he's so fucking weird it's really kind of crazy though right yeah like if you have a movie one sex yeah if you have a movie where everything is like hilarious but then someone dies like a lot of comedies like someone dies you don't say it's still a pirated movie right it's still a comedy it's a comedy but if you had Harrison Ford Cate Blanchett in a gripping thriller and then at the end they fuck and you see in a nut dick shots like that it's a poor porn you can't Excel area that's weird right it's funny they're like no matter what else or some form point yeah and like coming on her chest yeah you can't do that you could have a scene where like you see them like there's like curtain season right her legs wrapper as long as it's tastefully done she's kissing but if you actually see a penis and a vagina or a penis and a mouth or it has to be in it though right even if you see penis and vagina it's not porn give a see house of cards no this is seen in house of cards where the president spoiler alert is going down on a reporter and he's eating his reporters box and like his face is right on her box hmm but doesn't show us on the phone to her dad it's rough Netflix will fucking show whatever they'll be like you'll watch the fuckin the ranch with Ashton Kutcher and he'll be like yeah it's just like weird yeah you doing I showed my dick in my special did you how many times just for Wow that's all in the beginning though that's a lot for you for an hour so yeah I do at the Comedy Store I guess once you get ramped up you know you doing a special but I was excited it was in Canada Oh in Canada you could show your dick freely yeah there was everyone's French yeah you can apparently walk around Toronto with your breasts out so there was this video that was released online earlier today of this woman activist who was a being interviewed by this guy and she says it's totally legal to take your top off so she takes her top and you know she's a feminist almost immediately after she takes her top off this dude this black I sneak I don't know how to say black eye but it said it was their brazen when they hit on girls sneaks behind her and grabs her tits no hi yes yes and she screams at em and they scream at him and they blurred the black guy's face out which is kind of funny but they didn't blow the titties out off they didn't blow them titties out interesting that's very racist or the black guys face but not the titties I think because whoever finally you know I gotta get implicated for a crime it's I mean you know he can ride one you just found it yeah want to see it here watch this so she's yelling at this dude so she's yelling and she takes her top off look you see her full full breasts now watch this dude with the blurred out face he comes up behind it oh Sh no no you do not you do not do that and they they even lose track of him he started lingering in the background there in fighting with each other now Tim who also can feel you he was smooth as fuck away did that shit well he's probably met girls like that before next thing you know old Jed's a millionaire gobble-gobble sweetest and she's like pointing a finger at him like he looks like a zombies in the Body Snatcher but what are they arguing about what the fuck's going on here ah who cares they do they're arguing because they were poorly parented they never learned how to microphone the whole thing's ridiculous these are just people today people who losing their fucking minds this is the shit that they will play for future generations when they talk about the downfall of modern Western society they'll play this kind of shit when young kids were just so soft and living a life so easy look for microaggressions at every turn and then also girls puller - these are guys grabbing them because that's what some dudes do yeah you can't just pull your titties out in front of some dudes right girls still walking around with our titties out right yeah yeah yeah I think so you super impressive so far only one grab yeah that's amazing so far but that's just because all those other people around yeah I realized the danger people will make act different isn't that the thing in New York City you can walk out with your I think you can they had a gender thing you can walk around then I'll have the shirts off we can do most places most place for women yeah where do you think it's illegal to go topless if you had a guess well you can't do it in LA wouldn't be funny if it was Vegas can't do it no I don't think so hmm I wonder if you can I mean if they can you can breastfeed right so they can but that's different yeah it's like a guy can pretty much everywhere everywhere yeah I can walk down the street wonder wonder like if there's a certain time at night will they arrest you like if you if you have no shirt on and it's midnight in LA yeah the cop might arrest you like dude what are you doing like why don't you have a shirt on right but if it's like noon and you have no shirt on you're sunbathing yeah you're just hanging out so I get some rays this is chilly dude all right what if it's like 7:00 a.m. like what's this derelict doing with no shirt they would definitely keep us unless you're jogging then you like this guy's an athlete dude that's really funny that's like a carlin bit or some shit probably to have a shirt off at 7:00 a.m. yeah as long as you're running yeah it's if it's 5:00 a.m. you probably should put a hoodie on just to let people know you're serious because if you have no shirt on at 5:00 a.m. like did you just have no shirt on and start running yeah if you're running with no shirt on at 5:00 a.m. someone's chasing you yeah and probably running at 5 a.m. and keep running to 7:30 if someone sees you at 7:30 they assume you just started then assume you've been running since like left the club right so basically well sobering up as your brother I looked out at his shoes he's got fucking loafers on and then he still has a sign this is on from last night to be cool but now they're functional yeah the Sun what a douche move wearing sunglasses outside at night nothing worse bro fashion wise nothing worse it is so douchey yeah and black guys can pull it off so much better than welcome or shit I'm not even offended when I see a black guy at a basketball game if he's like LL Cool J he's got sunglasses on so bothers me doesn't bother me but if it's a white guy take those fucking things off what are you doing it doesn't matter the race for racist when it comes to sunglasses when it comes to sunglasses why here your fucking real race one type of racist against white dudes you've always been race against white dude white dudes it sunglasses like E nuff yeah it's dark out you can see fine these are doing TV shows and shit you know what you sit on the tide show and they have a sunglass oh come on really yeah sunglasses on tough crowd comedians that's ballsy dude didn't work out well but they made fun of them right well greg Giraldo shit all over him because they were going back and forth and every time Greg would say something funny Dennis would like Mock the fact that he was saying something funny it was you've never seen this no it's one of the weirdest interactions between two comedians ever it's really vary between Geraldo and Lear yeah oh man it's a classic yeah no that's weirdly played or we get yank yanked right probably right who they know has that anymore that show was funny miss fucking great yeah did you do it yeah I did it think I did it twice it was great fun show Colin Quinn is a shit yeah it was just a great idea he's basically like a podcast on Comedy Central was before podcast yeah he really was kind of in some ways like well the I think the original podcast is Stern Show and then once the stern show went to satellite radio then it became uncensored you know so that's and then Opie and Anthony's for the same thing but opening Anthony even more like a podcast because you just shoot the shit and and then tough crowd came along and now it's on Comedy Central I have no idea why they stopped doing that must have been a whip because that was it wasn't it was kind of short-lived I wasn't I thought it was maybe not maybe not maybe was a few maybe was like four or five Colin Quinn's an interesting dude he might just got tired of doing it I met him in where the fuck was I Vancouver actually that night I did my special afterwards and he was just the nicest guy man my dad loves him and he was like Kaname Colin Quinn and I was like yeah like my dad never so I got a picture of them two together it was like a really sweet fucking night we call the nicest he's he is one of my best examples that I personally use when I say you have to see someone to stand up in the flash yeah live in the flesh to understand how funny their hmm like he's one of those conscious thing because his act is so it's so absurd yeah it's so silly and odd yeah I could almost have to see him live and then you know you want to see a long set you want to see like a headline set we're seeing right hold up and get weirder well he got a lot of attention for the last special he did I know he's funny man is the funny fucking dude he's always been funny no no but that show was a great show how long was it on for Janice over just under two years she enough for it wow I would have thought it was like four years yeah wow that really cool show to do what the fuck happened is there a Wikipedia on that she must have been to hit one how was it not a hit maybe there was just too many shows that back then there were like a lot of shows though yeah yeah and and like hits to I feel like I guess there's more shows now than ever though right well but only because of probably the internet and shit but there's too many channels like when you've found it all it's something that's like a true TV like wait what right where's that how do you even find me I know what is that well the the TV Land Chandler do you watch TV no you don't watch Netflix right in HBO right and occasionally I watch hunting shows right what do we got here was it say does it say white what it white end about notes from Comedy Central the same time that Chappelle show was on and oh no Democrat no oh so they fucked it up the executives fucked it up how we weren't and wrote a blog about it oh okay makes sense executive fucked it up well the last show contained a monologue bike wind who attacked his distractors such as the new york times for being hypocritical and elitist for their negative reviews he also defined comedic integrity is the ability to critique the hypocrisy of society but to be honest enough to admit that you are just as guilty of it as anyone else oh yeah well they fucked up that was a great show and it could've been an amazing show with it just bring it back bring it back how many central you need a hit yeah cancelled our show and also also you can just make it well he probably don't want to do it now but yeah well it's just weird man they like got rid of Moshe kasher show already I said yet I heard huh might I fucking jump the gun on that one too I think actually I don't think they this is what I think I think it was like somebody else's show and that exec whoever was running things as dawn no yeah that shit is I shouldn't be talking shit I don't know anything about show business anymore I'm barely in show business I'm a non showbiz entity I have no idea what's going on except re getting fired from with the show that maybe you're wrong no you know no he's definitely not no I'm just saying you know no this is not happen he always asked me to do it and I always wanted to do it but I never had a story that fit the theme and then I was just like I don't know how to do it and I just never ended up doing it that's the problem I think it's a great I think it's a great fucking awesome idea it's a it's a show designed for Joey Diaz yeah because Joey Diaz has more stories than any human being that's ever walked face the planet yeah yeah yeah but you're special are you exciting man on fire I am yeah now the brazen attempt to craft a new hour I know oh yeah it's like you know when you start a new one and then it's like I have like 25 new minutes and and I'm like is this stuff really though gonna be in my hour I don't know Ryan what I mean yeah you know getting you don't know do you write down physically do you write physically never and I know it's a good idea to do that I just it's it's it's so much less it's so much more work for me to know what I'm gonna say and get up there and say it than it is to go up with an idea and work it out on a stage and I have so much more fun doing that hmm you know yeah and and for me I you know I am able to not to get too heady but like explore that bit way more onstage because I fucking have to right in that moment cause you're trapped yeah yeah or 250 people there or seven even if there's a few but like yeah I just like doing that and that's how I get like I get like I have really long bits you know so that's how I that's how that happened a lot of people do I mean everybody's gonna roll their own style I think the only thing that's really consistent is that you need to pay attention to it you need to like really focus on stand up yeah oh yeah that's the only thing that's really how you do it like whether you do it like in your car while you're driving you shut the radio off and just think about it or whether you do it in front of a computer or whether you you know whatever you whatever you do a lot of sets you do instead of the improv instead of the store and then set the factory yeah it's all just about how much how much energy how much yeah well yeah because if you think about it really the only time the amount of time that you're actually doing stand-up in an hour and a half at all right unless you're doing two sets a night you know that's why weekends are so good right yeah I get to do two on Friday and two on Saturday yeah to do an improv yeah but then like I came up with a new bit two weeks ago that's like a six minute bit oh geez and but it's you know it's fun find it I know something happened and then I'm talking about us universe opened up I know I know I know I know it's so awesome when I have a Z right and then so I've been working it but I've only been really working it on the road so I'm I had I'm like I have to get to the comedy store to see if it actually works yeah yeah Oh on a Tuesday night is a perfect defining 90 percent because people are like first of all it's still tired and cocaine they did on Saturday they're they're they're they're unimpressed waiting to see if they they pass her audition 100% or a lot of them are fucking Russian you know what I mean just a lot of people have been flying to the store why wouldn't they just to check out the line Jews why wouldn't they yeah those lineups are fucking unbelievable it's crazy right yeah it's kind of confusing it is confusing remember how it used to be yes when I first got there nobody was was hit I mean they were are doing well but they would do well on stage but they nobody knew who they were we got to show more love to the Laugh Factory we got to keep that fucking place alive it'll be alive yeah I mean III like going there I guess you I'm there Wednesday Wednesday night me - I'm with meatlug oh that's right we are 10 p.m. Wednesday I've had to meet you Chris D'Elia who else Theo on that I don't know Theo's on that show I don't know oh it's a good show though about a lot of fine people yeah what else go on anything I have we keep going I don't know let's say to you man I'm like we've been doing it anyway two hours really I went quick come on duper fuck bro what are we professional talk eisah fucking lives are saying it's good to come back because when I first did the first one I fucking barely knew you and I was intimidated and now at least were friends and shit then and maybe Jesus we could just bullshit but I still get people that are like hey man sewing on Rogan and I'm like Jesus Christ that's fucking awesome do you ever think one of guys talking like that that really just doesn't know what to say and he really wants to blow you maybe that actually explains a lot what happened afterwards hey saw you on 2 broke girls fucking funny I would love if you did an episode of 2 broke girls by the way I would do it that's Whitney show well it's not on anymore but no no no it literally got canceled like two months ago maybe what was it like I don't even know what it was about 2 broke girls bro but why would it be funny if I did an episode cuz why the fuck you would never do that what do you mean I rather be like Joe Rogan did that why for a goof yeah I do it for Whitney yeah yeah you would but then again you still tight with her yeah she's good but that then you should do then not not you should you should ask your agent you don't even have one right I have an agent ok so she'd ask your agent you've always got to be like knife occasions I still get rid of one eventually so you should ask your agent to find one episode did you want like I would love it if you didn't why it's sort of like CSI like the New Orleans one like nights you know I mean not even like the one but like but one episode in like three scenes I'll be fucking hilarious being interned a interrogated promote it and then be like what the fuck is Joe Rogan doing and you're like I don't know where you know I didn't mean to I hit her too hard you know be fucking hilarious how many of those fucking crime shows can they have one time to the network executives go we gotta stop I don't know I don't know I don't know this is unbelievable when did we get this murder fetish this this fucking crime scene investigation fetish the only ones I like are the Forensic Files the ones where they reenact it and then they show yeah yeah those are real stories I watched so many of those when Marvin Hutchinson came home early that evening to find his girlfriend in bed with his brother yeah just always arrests the spouse because it's them always and they always like go to like the the most extreme lengths worser it's like just arrest that person and then check sometimes it's the creepy guy at work that's in love with the woman but very rarely yeah you're right but but but those I've watched so much forensic because by the way when you're on the road HLN the network it's just Forensic Files all day long really yeah it's like and then Nancy Grace for an hour what did it used to be headline news I don't know I guess is that what that HLN stands for yeah they give up on whatever sport it is like country music television yeah feel like yeah we're gonna do fucking drag races now we're gonna have a bass fishing competition what wait a minute hold the guitar no no I'm gonna give Josh wolfish oh my god he's not a country girl yeah I've watched so much of that that that I'll see the same murder on the different episodes like Forensic Files we'll do it and then I'll be watching snap and I'll be like oh I saw this one on forensics different reason they all have their own reenactment of it because it's the show it's right because it's top yeah it's like it's not their subject it's not like they wrote it yeah yeah they have to allow another guy to do another recreation they probably cheat like get some footage well they did they I like the angle they yeah yeah show the murder like there's a really good one hein there's a really good one on I don't know what child by the ID channel but see no evil and they go through like with Forensic Files all they do is they work out who did the crime with forensics but on this one they find out who did the crime only using the security footage and it's really creepy and really interesting because like you'll see a guy walk into the elevator and then leave with a briefcase and shit or like a suitcase and the body's in there and you're like oh it's really good because it's real footage yeah see no evil you know when you see a real body even if it's like through a security camera so Club somebody over the head and drag them backwards like that's a real body like what I don't understand is I like heat-of-the-moment murders I guess I can wrap my head around because it's like you just got so mad at the person then it happened but like to plan it and and think oh good I'm gonna make 20 grand off this or the for the life insurance and to think you're not gonna get caught it's like you're gonna get caught yeah people get caught but people are stupid as fuck dude there's a lot of people out there that lie so much that they don't have a connection to reality they've severed their tether to reality so they think thinking bullshit people all the time and they think that they can sort of con artists people all the time I knew a guy like that Franco okay this guy was a fake resiliency Jitsu black belt let me fake fake it wasn't really a Brazilian Jujitsu black belt told everybody he was and this is the early days of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts where there weren't a lot of them so you could almost kind of get away with it like people didn't know and then he said like I was like a Japanese jujitsu I'm not really like a black belt black bow yeah yeah change his name forget his real names like because he got caught no no oh made a fake name made a fake Brazilian name academia bro Raphael Torre close so he was friends with Eddie and he was banging this married chick and killed her husband brought him to the gym and strangled her killed her with like killed him brother killed him I say her I didn't say his fake black belt he killed the fake black belt killed the husband right of the wife that he was banging and killed him and then got caught and he tried to get this other do that I know that's an MMA fighter to try to get him to kill him I tried to offer him some money and he was driving the dudes car around after he killed them what a moron dude drove the dudes car got seen driving the guy's car in a small town after he killed them yeah so he's in jail now but he went to the woods and with a bag like a big-ass fucking duffel bag and told his friend hey man dropped me off I'm going to a secret no rules kumite karate tournament in the woods and his friends like oh ok so this fucking dude goes into the woods ok with a bag or with a bag that like you would fit a trophy in ok comes out of the woods the next day with a trophy so he opens the bag pulls his fucking trophy out and says hey man I won this karate tournament in the world oh my god this guy is insane that's me Nev literally yeah yeah he's in jail for being insane yeah dude he went he could put a fucking trophy in the bags like no one's gonna suspect this said totally gonna forget about this yeah that's what super was like this is so crazy there's no no one's gonna believe it everyone's gonna believe it cuz why the fuck would I make it up he says dropped me off in the woods bro the secret karate kumite in the woods this is back in the day like so what he's just sick in the early 90s and he just leave that out in the woods probably camped maybe this trophy soup the noodles can't wait to show this to my friend it's a famous story whoa I have her dad so check this out I was talking to this guy Gerald my friend Gerald who was the guy that wound up testifying against him that he tried to pay him to murder him I was talking to him about it on the phone and the phone was being tapped so then the cops call me up and they say hey what do you know about this I was like yeah I don't know shit but he had already been arrested and it was already like a thing where they're going to trial but I'm like all I know is that he was a fake black belt who lied about a lot of shit and God I mean I at the time I didn't even know whether or not he really killed the guy I was so full of shit if he told you that he killed his wife's husband you what yeah yeah just like you won the karate kumite just like you're a black belt it's so hard to tell with a guy like that yeah but then the dude turned out to protect like we pretty much never can trust somebody who brings a trophy out of the wood do you imagine the idea that you're gonna take this fucking duffle bag put a trophy inside of it and no one's gonna notice when you go back to the duffel bag Smith that's really funny shaped like a trophy see the fucking fist like the rocky statue this fucking guy Wow but there was a lot of that back then man there was a lot of fake martial artists it was like super common they still to this day they'll catch a guy who's a fake black belt okay yeah white belt like put a black belt on and go to a new school and but he really doesn't know anything I can't you're gonna get exposed why would you do that in jujitsu yes but in other martial arts no it's because they're mentally ill it's always because they're mentally ill and this guy Rafael Torre actually had a fake fight he had a fixed fight on king of the cage with one of his students so he actually had a professional MMA fight and you know how my friend Eddie knew he was full of shit no Eddie knew he stole shit because Eddie taught him this super complicated move called a twister yeah a twister is Eddie's signature move and it's basically the guillotine or the guillotine from wrestling with an added twit a couple added twist in the waist secures the finish Eddie has like a very specific way of s gripping the top of the head and also locking down the opposite far side leg so when he does it it's like a terrible position to be on and he's crushing your fucking neck you're getting all yanked up and it's really rough it's it's really hard to deal with and it's hard to pull off on people super hard to pull off like just even to set it up and enroll into it you have to be uh you could get a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt who's a high level black belt and you could teach him how to do it he could probably pull it off on someone just because he understands how to move his body in a grappling scenario but for a guy like him it wasn't really a black mo he's really really clunky he went to Thailand and and fought in some MMA fight dude hey man a won in Thailand I pulled off the twister and he's like what yeah he's like dude I think something's full yeah he's gotta be full of shit and he was like high as fuck worse at having this conversation he's like dude you can't you can't tell me he did I can't believe he did that and so I was with Eddie in the car when he confronted him about being a fake black belt he confront there's the three of you in the car no Eddie was on the phone I was driving and Eddie was right next to me in the passenger seat he was confronting him about it and the guy was like no I really am I really am and then like cut to six months later the dudes in jail for murder it's crazy so here's him so by the way this is a fake name right his real name yep that's him so the other dude was like his student so this is the fake fight yeah this is a fake fight so he organizes I mean this guy had gotten deep into the world man how I did he was a fake I mean he had a few martial arts skills he wasn't totally unscripted right right right right this is it yeah this is it so he's on the bottom here and this dude's on but you can already tell that he's not but they did not really hurt each other you know they're just like he's just pushing them it's a really funny man like these guys are acting here like he he hits him with a couple of punches but not hard you know I mean this is like some pro wrestling shit so he takes him down steps over the leg the guy's punching them but I think these are nothing punches man it's like nothing to this and this is you know for a fact this is oh yeah yeah yeah every watch everybody knows this is like they tried to make it what will you call a hard shoot you know where you make it look real like a pro wrestling style so then he just drops down and gets that leg and he's tapping and he's tapping like right away back up a little so you could see the setup because the setup was like what like here just oh yeah grabs it I mean that is so bad it's so bad he's so high up on the knee that he wouldn't even be putting pressure on the knee because he's not controlling the lower leg or the upper leg rather he's pulling on the lower leg but watch that again like when he's pulling on the upper leg look at the gap yeah watch when he goes you could tell he's not a black belt no no super sloth so big that big giant gap and see where he's yanking the dudes already tapping he doesn't have control of the upper leg at all he's just pulling on the shin like literally his ass is where the knee is yeah and his pulling on the shin which means he wouldn't be putting pressure on the knee it's such horseshit and this guy's like oh my god he wrecked my knee it was a total fake fight whoa yeah so that guy went on to be a murderer I think he might be like up for parole soon or something dude people are Roley murdered somebody dude that's the crazy thing people get out of jail for murder to go to jail for murder and your other children you had in the back by the way that's a new one that's got two it's got two now bro that one you did on TV Oh crazy man yeah that's crazy I mean people have pulled off some sloppy ass knee bars don't get me wrong but I know for a fact that's fact yeah yeah not yeah dude naughty people do but that's the real nutty things like people trying to like concoct an artificial identity like my dad's Brazilian my name is Damien Munroe people are just a softer people are just so afraid of being nothing you know what I mean is that it or does he identify with a half Brazilian Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt maybe we let him just write how much different is that than identify with being a six year old girl it's only different when you get your ass kicked well if you're a six year old girl and you go to school with my kid and it turns out you're 50 I might beat your ass be a black belt I might not trust you me I might start asking you some questions like he has adopted mommy and daddy do you see that yes I saw that and it's not the thing we getting trolled imagine I think that's not even real it's just everything's a South Park episode now that's what it feels like I feel like it's writing itself would you vote for do you vote no I honestly couldn't do it couldn't do it yeah yeah I'm hoping Al Franken runs I'm saying they're here right now really you think I think Al Franken could be the best president we've ever had I really do I think he's gotten tremendous ethics and his comedian that was the amazing if any is a true patriot yeah he really is that guy can you know Al Franken can draw the United States and draw all the boundaries for all the states by memory he actually can draw the outlines of each state all 50 of them ever see him do that no that's crazy pull it up it's a dis video of it it's fucking amazing he walks up to a whiteboard and just draws the United States is he in the right shape like he could be a map if he was living in the 1500s you will be yeah he'd be the most famous guy in the world would be the map maker I would maybe be able to do California and that's it hmm I think I could get the line right yeah oh yeah the inside line watch him do this this is beautiful go fullscreen it's crazy well that's already crazy dude he's amazing he draws the Great Lakes in the right size and shape and he doesn't solve by hand see cuz a lot of people think of Al Franken as you know he was a comedian he's on Saturday live yeah people I don't think they truly appreciate his intellect is a brilliant guy but he's also too self-deprecating and too wise too humble to want to be the president you know he just doesn't have that desire in him that's really such a shame because to be a president like you almost have to be the type of person who would never who should never be president in order to run yeah but like if he wanted to be the president I think he could be like our best president ever hmm who the fuck else could do this you want to talk about patriotism it's fuckin guy really that would be a good plan thing to run on I'd be like I could draw the fuck bitch hey Donald Trump you draw but that's crazy though wouldn't you must have practiced this or and like he's got to have a crazy mind that's just like that's what I'm saying man just drew Alaska son now here comes Hawaii you know the fuck out of here are you crazy back that up to the 2009 Minnesota State Fair first of all loses points were going to the Minnesota State Fair that's amazing yeah but also mighty views is that F I was like they should have a billion but it probably have no million three hundred thousand there's more than one video I'm doing this too doesn't it doesn't like a lot o so it's a large reticle parlor trick he gets put here for that he's doing me to draw America and I have to go oh he's doing this one on a piece of cardboard oh you could do it on any surface crazy bro what if he does it on the sidewalk with chalk can you do this and that would be yeah it's it's amazing we definitely need a better president you know we definitely need something new this uh this system we got going on right now just everybody hates each other so that's a bad thing it's terrible yeah everybody on the left and everybody on the right everybody I chose throat yeah I used to think it was the right that was the danger but now the left is so they're so mad and shit and they're responding to the right there it goes there this way and then it goes that way you know people get super fucking angry when Obama is the president has the right you have to worry about and then try becomes the president everybody gets super aggressive on the left what's interesting is they said that gun sales go up when a Democrat isn't his president because they get scared yeah we get scared they're gonna take your guns what's craziest Trump was a lifelong Democrat is a life long Democrat you know but if anybody's ever had like the back of Gun Owners Trump above a lot because his sons Sons are hunters especially Donald Junior mmm big-time sportsmen conservationists very much into animals hunts a lot like legitimately he's you know go respected hunter but the the it doesn't shock me that people buy more guns yeah well I guess I didn't think of it like that and then once I heard I was like yeah that makes sense if that's the big fear that people have is that one day the government's gonna step in and they're gonna take your guns away and they're gonna control you with an iron fist and tell you what to do and people say no way that's never gonna happen but I'm not advocating everybody go out and get a gun yeah but if you say that could never happen well it's happening right now with people if you go to North Korea it's happened right okay how is it how is that going on right now in 2017 first of all you don't have an armed population you don't you know you don't have a free press there's a lot of factors right yeah but the government could take it over anyway the problem with saying that is we are the government so if you say the government can take over the United States of America with soldiers those soldiers are citizens they might be soldiers but they're people they like you and I they're not global gotcha yeah they're not one percenters who onna like it's gonna be very fucking hard at some young guy from Kentucky to pull a gun on his neighbors because in America dickhead in a suit right that you know as a senator or whatever the fuck it is tells him what to do there's a fine line of control that you have so really good when you say the military will take over the country the military is us they're just regular people right right it's when they get to the highest levels of government then it gets weird when there's completely set when they're in a war room and they've never actually been in a war I arrive and they're making politically based decisions right that's when shit gets squirrelly it's the network yes is getting his guy to do that though like getting especially in America I mean this is not North Korea man this is we we have a way different attitude about each other and about human beings it would be incredibly difficult to get some regular kid from Northern California to join the military I can shut down schools and take away people's guns in a door-to-door raid I guess I just always feel that people are such followers that it would happen but yeah you're probably right fucking hope you're right people are followers until some shit goes down and if some shit goes down people will rise to the occasion like that that is what happened after September 11 if they woke up a sleeping lion and people were excited about going to war again it gets real dangerous when something happens because people look like there's a great book that I just read from Sebastian Junger it's called tribe and it's all about bonding during wartime and how people are losing their connection to each other by not encountering difficulty and not struggling and like he lives in a poor neighborhood this guy's like a super world famous writer and he lives in a poor neighborhood in the Lower East Side because he likes being around like regular people hmm I mean his books are very successful I got imagine he makes a good living and he's a very famous war journalist and correspondent and just he's he's got it's his ideas that the the people that live soft lives and the people that like yeah like your body's on design for it it's not good it's not healthy that's why people feel like shit in that the happier people or the people that are under stress and that if something did happen to us we would probably feel better and what they say yeah they say that the guy more likely to kill himself is the businessmen who's on the top floor that fucking lost it all then yeah the guy who just kind of has had a rough life because he denied it deal with it there was this Bernie Madoff episode of Radiolab Radiolab where he's talking to this guy and this guy made like I think he made like nine billion dollars with Bernie and he had to give it had to give away give seven billion of it back and Bernie was trying to get him not Bernie Sanders Bernie Madoff or tomato I say Bernie Sanders no you said Bernie Madoff I was thinking bring us and there's some reason I'm think he fucked his name up anyway Bernie Madoff was telling this guy's idea to give the money back you know what you did I know we were in on this we're caught we got to give this money back and they got killed himself so he's got two billion he's like not enough well not they found on the bottom of the pool two billion dollars not enough wonder if it was the shame that made him kill himself shame clang clang shame I don't make you kill yourself man well I think if you have nine billion dollars and you're a guy that is just constantly obsessed with money you're probably across the board you probably got multiple Ferraris on their way to you right now I need a bigger jet yeah you know oh how much is the island I'll take it right right you have nine billion yeah and then you're like you say okay I got it I need to make 300 million a year just to pay my right yeah imagine let me scale back and then all of a sudden someone says hey man you gotta give seven of it back don't have it right yeah that's how I had to be how it was well I think the shame too you know maybe just died a heart attack maybe one fell in the pool yeah that's a tough way to kill yourself jump in and start breathing dude they need to make this fucking Forensic Files episode man we'll find it we'll give the shirt or Oh probably exists in the hallmark probably does yeah it's always like some nutty ex-spouse right sometimes a woman yeah well they have that show for that they have like sinful woman or whatever the hell it's called mmm where they call it a scorn wicked wives or you know I mean it's noise it yeah when is it gonna happen on one of those reality shows like those Real Housewives when is one of those bitches someone axe murder one of those other chick I mean it'll happen how was it not already they fight they claw each other right I fucking hate that that's a show even just so they're so popular I know it's crazy a friend of mine went to just one of the Real Housewives ladies has a restaurant in Beverly Hills and a friend of mine went to the restaurant and she said that when the lady walked in that everybody treated her like royalty while she's here she's here she's here so crazy just walking in with her dog and you're famous for being a piece of shit I mean you you you are though like that they that's what they glorify at least in my show and I say the person actual but like yeah those people are the pieces have said yeah you piece of shit and they're like oh I mean that's but she wasn't on the show that's one of the things she was like one of the more dead wife I'd sure yeah I mean I don't know much if I don't know enough about the shit I mean it's just bizarre that you would have so much money and still want to expose yourself to that because like the Amana nuttiness and hate but maybe it's just more exciting than whatever else they're doing and maybe when you're on xanax it's not so bad yeah maybe just pop a few xanax every day yeah yeah cameras are going off yeah you don't even see her yeah anybody ever sees you from the paparazzi find the Google paparazzi causes some of the seizure guaranteed it's happened I just I've not a flashes if some may be wacky dude with screw loose I know Punk starts passing I wonder who is Emily too famous we would've heard about it right but if it was a famous person who would you man I imagine like Johnny Depp like he does coke like every day for a month and then they're like the cameras go off and he says whatever the fucking fine wire in that fuse and his brain blows out like an old light bulb you find something the only person I could find is David Beckham's son and your old kid started freaking out so we just freaked out but he didn't have a seizure did it well I don't know if it led to an actual seizure it says he says he's got epilepsy leave him alone oh he does have epilepsy yeah I might be well find out Google that why do flashing lights cause people to have seizures hmm what do you think Chris D'Elia I think that I would never think about that in my life you wouldn't think about that now cuz it would never affect me so I'd be not interested in how the human mind works or the flaws of the operating system I am a little bit not that much though huh well I want you to tell me I don't have to look it up from epilepsy calm for about 3% of people with epilepsy exposure of flashing lights at certain intensities alright slow yes that's - I didn't know that oh that's interesting well that makes sense because I would have heard of it right you think you would have heard of it but for my friend it was his wife he's everything to you remember shit I don't remember shit so I'm just gonna forget this anyway which sucks you know I remember death in the shopping

the fucking Comedy Store man and like to be I just that I try to think about like I'm so fortunate to like be a part of that like ever since like you came back and like it you know it's just so you know and it was always cool but like I loved the club always and I know I know I think you did too yeah always but then like you came back and then like other guys kept other guys came up and they you know they let it's also Eric and Adam - yeah they're yeah yeah Eric and Adam they've changed the atmosphere of the place it's now super comedian friendly and supportive it's just it's different place crazy how great it is now yeah and everybody enjoys it - like everybody like we look at each other like we're here you know could've been born in Afghanistan could have been living in the middle of the mountains somewhere in Nepal you know we fucking go tits trying to get some moisture we could have been all we all could have been trying to win trophies in the forest men win trophies in the woods in the forest the kumite no rules come back hands are perfect no cuts empty duffle bag maybe rubs dirt on his face okay yeah yeah yeah I wanna do it kill them all if we round everybody dead like something gets seven-year-olds would come up with yeah it is hey this is what I'll do I'm gonna get a trophy I want to write deadliest man in the world and I'm gonna put that trophy in a duffle bag then I'm gonna go deadliest man in the world it's it says deadly strain in the world I never forget when I was first starting to take martial arts there's this kid it came to my high school and he's with this girl and the girl was like really pretty and she didn't talk much she was like in my class and he wasn't like he was from like another school and he had a jean jacket on he looked like fucking Billy Jack this guy is like real skinny and but like why are we looking and someone said he did karate man and I did karate and he was smoking a cigarette and I remember he had he had someone hold their hand up so he could demonstrate his moves in front of everybody ever scared and he did it inside Crescent kick swak swak the guy's hand and there but it was like whew that's the real shit that's the real shit I'll never forget that I'm gonna think of that guy it was watching him going I think that guy's full of shit but I didn't know anything back then because if he was now here he was now I would be laughing but I looked in the back throws like that is not a real kick you could just lie man and just I'm a fucking you know pilot the way he drew it was like it was so stupid his leg fucking went up in the air it just was so ineffective in a real-life scenario not that the Crescent kick doesn't work it's just the way he did it something my brain rigid but I didn't know anything back then that you can remember I told you about that book gift of fear yeah yeah about how you can sense shit like that and then you know you know it even though you don't know you know it that's blink Malcolm Gladwell's thing blink no saint but blink yeah I just read it it's um it's all essentially about how there's certain things where you know immediately yeah yeah I just finished the audio but we have a condition to cover it up and be like no that's not right and then but it's like that's why you talk to all these women and they were like I knew something was wrong before yeah you know I mean yeah yeah a lot of times you know something and there's one great story in the book where they were talking about this statue that was this incredible ancient Roman Stata thing ancient Greek I forget which one but it was a forgery and but it was perfect like the way it looked it was amazing but they brought in front of these art collectors and they looked at it for a second they went this is not this is not good this is not good this is fake like they immediately there's something about it like they had done testing and the surface I didn't know what what it was they they knew they felt it they knew that the stone came from a certain part of the world this ancient part of the world that it was ancient stone by the amount of some sort of mineral on the outside of it they realized that it had been sitting in the ground for thousands of years they thought turned out bullshit they just there was a there's a method that they use to create this artificial surface and the whole thing was a fraud it was all fake they'd you know they put it in like famous museums and shit it's a fascinating story but the art experts just whatever the fuck it was they just knew immediately and they called bullshit on it when all these other people had already signed off on it and even paid for it they even asked one of the experts asking you get your money back no no what what blink huh yeah I definitely would like to read that that's interesting yeah it's really interesting about it split-second judgments like weird things that you make look you think you know something you ever tell you the Kalin story but this is one of the craziest girls he ever dated I don't picture I meet Kalin at the was that place the Irish pub pub that was on silent Dublin's these days to stand up at yep I meet Kalin at Dublin's and he's like I want you meet this girl in dating he brings a girl over the girl says hi to me I look at her and I go come here yeah poem Sanne go dude listen to me she's fucking crazy trainer he's like what I go she's crazy he goes how do you know I go I know right I go I know crazy you gotta listen to me I go that's a fucking insane person that's a dangerous person yeah nah man she's cool she just gets nervous around you cut to she's doing math she's a prostitute oh wow he has a pimp he finds her like like after he they break up he runs into her street walking she's street walking he sees her in front of coaching horses walking the street she's like a lowest-level prostitute you can get right how did he not I come on but yeah that it's that first it's that first reaction whatever the fuck it is the guy never that before I've never done that ever I've never looked at someone really said to my friend that girls fuck yeah yeah it's a it's a bit of a stretch because with Callan almost every girl he dated was nuts until he met his wife they were all out of there I don't Callens off to me about how he's like you got to meet my friend yeah I'm like oh cool like it's four times I did it and then I'm like like a fucking literally like a turtle will show up and I'll be like I don't want to know a turtle he's too nice yeah fucking Cowen just likes everybody oh my buddy and now he fucking texts me all the time his buddies crazy yeah math just trying to get you in the Olympics yeah yeah I'm working out too hard for this shit man I don't like stretching oh yeah that's my favorite blink story though I knew just something about her like what I just looked at I'm like oh this is not good yeah I believe in that shit for sure especially with mime time woman's intuition but haven't you been caught I've been fooled before that rafaeld torre guy yeah yeah yeah of course I must see it with him but in this in the book gift of fear they say that like you always knew somehow though yeah but I think you always think that when shit goes wrong true retrospect oh my god damn oh yeah no no I knew you know didn't follow my instincts could be
