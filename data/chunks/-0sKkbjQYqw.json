three-two-one ladies and gentlemen the president of the megyn kelly fan no fucked it up megan mccain president of the megan mccain fake launched out he's blocked me no she blocked me and i i didn't tag her in the video because i'm not that guy right but i did you know i mean i put it out there into the world she's not thrilled probably i know somebody that knows her pretty well yeah and they said that she is not happy with my depiction of her she did though after the first video she lost a lot of weight soon let's put it back on she did and it's my yo-yo with her so when she gets thinner i get thinner so i can do her and she plumps up i plump back up so that's where we're at is that i just kind of mirror her hmm how uncomfortable she's i would you know i was because you know sometimes i'll go back to new york to do shows and i imagine like what if I'm in a restaurant and i see her and you know what would what would a meaning be like what because I have no real ill will it's just comedy it's just comedy yeah she's just she's a big public figure she's a big public figure and she behaves sometimes in a ridiculous way she call herself a self-made woman I mean these are things that are insane yes that's I mean this is a UH you know she's not self-made and listen she I love I love that she loves her dad yeah but there's a limit yeah to the constant you know if you want people to forget that your dad is the reason you have the job you can't bring him up every five minutes don't you think she's in a real pickle because that show is how she makes a living so she's on that show right so if you're on that show that's one of the things you got to talk about absolutely but I would say if she toned it down a little bit tone it down you can't tone it down though they're off see one of the things about those show that shows it's ridiculous like this conversation we're having very easy it's you and me that's it I let you talk you let me talk right talk express our site no problem right that's a goddamn battle zone it's it's a fight that's a vagina battle zone and you and great and you have a lot of great intellectuals that are battling out all the things you know Joy Behar Whoopi Goldberg these are brilliant people who we need to hear from yes and they speak in three-minute clips but I used to like the show when like Rosie O'Donnell would go on and start talking about Tower 7 that was great that was fun us that was fun well she'd be fun yeah that was that was interesting Rosie Rosie would just go on and start talking about our 7 and it was like oh this is a fun morning show this is ABC morning it's a little wacky yeah it's like I'll get on board for this take her off of that did she not get along with somebody I mean she girl from Survivor right yeah Elisabeth Hasselbeck her and Rose used to fight all the time yeah she's like one of them hot FoxNews fembot type characters I used to I used to do red eye on Fox News which would air at 3:00 a.m. they bring in like all these hot blondes would sit in the green room and they would be nice and they'd be like I'm miss Tallahassee and then they would get on Fox redeye and then the cameras would turn on and they would start going Syria and I would be like Syria what the hell do you know about Syria I mean but they would just go and go right and it was finally you know that was a fun show because read I was to show those on at 3 a.m. yes and nobody really watched it and nothing you said would get recorded like it wouldn't there would be no clips or anything she could kind of just go wild for a while for a while so comedians like me who had no knowledge or background knowledge on anything got it and I would wear like a jacket so you wouldn't know I guess you would say comedian under me but not always and I used to just go on that and just say whatever I wanted to and I'd be sitting next to John Bolton they didn't pay you they would just give you a card wherever you were going and then I would just come on and say whatever the hell I wanted and in a new studio yeah so that was like a funny but that's when I met a lot of those five and by the way they're all fun people oh yeah they're all fun people I think there's a business in being a fembot and I don't begrudge them like I don't begrudge bodybuilders who were on Instagram right no I mean like RINO this is my new app set and what ya would take guys through this alright once we grab them guys either you know I just think there's businesses yeah and we have to recognize that the look a lot of people who are really right-wing like women and they like hot blonde women with the assets who really are not in the immigration they don't like immigration they hate immigration but it's like a fuckin market for them it's me Tommy Lehren yeah I mean it started I guess with Ann Coulter and glory Southern Lauren Southern they have a lotta mm-hmm there's a bunch of new ones now attractive women that are yeah I don't follow as closely because it starts to feel like you're in a loop yes search they feel like with the news that you're in a loop well the best one in my opinion is Candace Owens because Candace yeah yeah because they bring her into these conversations and they underestimate her they've seen that great thing and I forget who did it but it was her and kill her Mike it was a it was a panel that maybe P Diddy sponsored or something and it was a panel with thought leaders in the black community and she was on it killer Mike was on it was a real one the girls from black lives matter it was a really interesting conversation ken is very smart oh she's very I don't agree with her on some of the things she says but she's very intelligent here it is yeah killer Mike adds context to Ti okay Owens revolt some summit or did II was I think in the front route just come gonna get accused of being a racist you know what do you mean you can't can't tell the difference yeah and then Candice was also on something recently where some white woman who was a professor accused her of saying something racist and she shut that lady down so hard yeah because like she was saying she was laughing at something and the woman said the woman tried to check her and shame her for what she was laughing and she's like no no I'm laughing at you why I'm laughing at what you're saying you should yeah we can't play it right no we couldn't play if we play it will fuckin get pulled off of YouTube but it's up it's she shut her down and there was also that uh that asian congressman he tried some stupid janitor to she shut him down down well he tried to take her out of context in front of her like she was going to defend herself well it's also interesting about people like Candace Owens and people they just live in a battleground oh yeah she's actually go to war everything they wake up they get on Twitter I could never live like that I'm sick it's not a bad likeness right she's ready I could never like to me to get up every day and go who do I got a wreck right I just couldn't do it but she's all you had her in real life she's a nice lady a lot of them are but they're like you mean Ann Coulter they're all very nice and mint but they're always you know they're just ready they they're they live in the combat zone but look we're talking about her and more than a million people are gonna hear this so that she's doing the right thing she is yeah like in that and that's a business just like you talking shit about Meghan McCain right kind of a business right you never talk shit about your pretending to be pretending to be her I'm stealing her essence that's kind of what I'm doing and when did she how long did she bark you did you pay attention you know every day I didn't check every day but I think it was somewhere after the first video which was you know a really really fun one and she didn't like that the thing now I'm nervous about is with all the new YouTube rules can they just decide to get rid of my account for or did you say it's not commercially viable you don't have a real problem with that because okay making fun of someone on the right interested but I do make fun of people on the left I mean IKEA I did a video I pretend to be the agent of the climate girl Greta sunburn and cuz I'm like you know I pretended like David absolutely play a play that it's on it's on my youtube channel and it's I'm sure it's on Instagram but I know this i G TV or whatever but so I want to fuck with everybody yeah so I was like this girl Greta thumbr let's be honest she has some good points but little it's a little creepy it's a little creepy well she's like how old is she she's too young for me to say that about is she like 14 yes she could be 52 though yes it's creepy limbs when I turned on my TV and she was like how dare you and I'm like well why are we starting there but there's something about her face - it's like so it's almost like I hear the story of the thing potentially there was a gal that adopted child Russia and they thought as a child was a little kid and it turned out she might have been 30 they don't know how old she was she tried to kill them she's scared there was a fucking horror movie story it's not they're adopting a little kid like a six-year-old that's a fucking 30 year old with some sort of a metabolic disease yeah well that serves you right for trying to be a do-gooder you know they'll never do anything again for anybody they'll never do one thing the husband will try to bring it up she's like fuck you midget I mean the idea that there are midgets dressing up as children and trying to burrow into family so that they can wake up in the middle of night and kill them yeah is truly the funniest thing that has happened in in we she's technically a midget a dunks or something else well she okay me whatever she was she has like a growth disorder that keeps her like looking like a small child you see there was a video recently where it looked like a kid was getting thrown off a bus it was just it was it him it was a like a little person who's just thrown off a but it was it was it was a scam like hey we got Ari and I both got duped I got do because my friend texted me to go there's a pedophile midget - just got thrown off a bus it is hilarious it's the funniest thing ever when when the unzips the hood and you see there's like grown-up face there's a woman who looks like what the foxes think yeah we're in on it no I don't think they knew the people on the outside yeah no I think the guys threw that guy off the bus and that was the scam yeah and then the dude who is this the little person in the hoodie he was in the scam on the scam but I don't think the people on the street were in on so now what happens when that when that when the when these these little people wake up and they're like activated they're like I'm gonna kill the family how do they try to kill them well this lady she was threatening she was threatening to kill the family and they were really worried that she was gonna do that she was gonna poison them or something like that because what was the scary stuff it's a horror movie because you know you got to think who knows what kind of abuse this little kid had gone through well actually a 30 year old rasz as a little kid through in Russia you know and all these foster homes and foster care and you know they are fuckin ruthless over it's rough it's rough I imagine it's not the best place to grow up as a person with a disorder what's up Jamie all right I feel like I'm hearing are you saying that happened in retro is a Russian kid Russian kid okay this has happened in Indiana yeah it's actually Ukrainian kid that's Ukraine is part of Russia that's okay isn't it yeah it's fine they had it there out three years before they found figured this out oh my god now what kind of what were those three years nice like with their nice memories good isn't that odd to look back and be like remember when we all went to Disney World no they're probably like hey this bitch isn't growing I think they said that she was creepy and the article that I read I think they were actually like they would wake up and see her like standing at the door like I think there were things that she did that yeah very very bad what do you what does she look like do they have an image of her I'm trying to find no I might I saw a picture of her now what a picture did she go to jail and it's real weird looking like she didn't look like a little person she looked like a young person it was a very strange yeah I mean I hope she finds another family I hope she keeps doing this to different families because whatever this bitch's life was so bad that she needs to do this let her do it mm you know you do to the wall you do to the wrong fit absolutely yeah it's it's I worry about that though at YouTube because I say is it you build a whole career you build the people that are your fans they want to see comedy and I always thought that like okay I'm not gonna be able to do this on like mainstream TV but these are funny things that I can do there's just look at her oh my god she does look okay so it is a little person she looks like a strange it's not like a regular look at them one down the middle the middle and the lower court look at that that's horrific yeah that's terrifying Ukrainian child she might have it but it's also how is she gonna kill you what's she gonna guess in the middle of the night or sounds you're fucking yeah that's true bro there's dirty that's creepy there's something weird they thought it was a little kid yeah that's so strange don't adopt folks oh my god so strange get that one there yeah wouldn't want your cursors on look at that one that one freaks me out cuz you'd be like something's wrong you would never think that was a murderous young adult he's either eight or 22 that everyone's I don't think they think 22 now I think some people think as old as 30 and I think the youngest they think she is a 16 and there's no records no one can prove they don't know what the fucks you know she has period she had adult teeth well guess what she's not 12 that's an indication that I mean did she never see a doctor Oh scroll back up hold on so you look at this she had periods she adult teeth who alleges that after Natalia began acting out violently attacking a baby boy pushing Christine into an electric fence and making death threats the family sought out psychiatric health healthcare officials including the Barnett's primary care physician who performed a bone density test and a clinical therapist who treated Natalia believe her to be an adult impersonating a child holy fuck you imagine when you're in the doctor's office getting that diagnosis they do a bone density test and the kids are sitting there yeah it turns out it's an adult can you imagine going in and you ready to hear like she's got cancer or brain damage and she go actually you're raising a 30 year old from the Ukraine look at this in 2012 a judge approved the Barnett's application to have Natalya's date of birth officially revised to september 4th 1989 officially changing her age from 8 to 22 shortly after they rented Natalia an apartment that's nice and placed her under the supervision of an Indiana State healthcare provider so she could receive psychiatric treatment as an adult that's an understanding hands moved to Canada they left the country but they rented her an apartment and then left the country Christine Barnett then moved to Canada when I son Jacob and they can arrest a child progeny prodigy who my Road oh is that the parent yeah it's her parent yeah no the Barnett's they're the Barnett's though the ones who would adopt right so Christine's the one that but she took so she left the husband and me Canada divorce not oh well that's that'll do it it's a tough thing for marriage to survive you survive you renting an adult yeah you rented an adult a year it's gonna kill you pretending to be a kid pushing you into an electric fence I feel like that a dinner and they said whatever in our marriage made us think this was a good idea we should just separate we got they got arrested for abandoning her in that apartment why the story goes further it sounds oh my god 2019 prosecutors in Tippecanoe Indiana that's your number one problem right there Tippecanoe Indiana brought formal charges of neglect against the Barnett's now divorce an affidavit of probable cause from 2014 provided by refinery29 refers to tests performed by Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in 2013 that seemed to contradict earlier medical reports about Natalya's age investigators at the time found that Talia's claims that she was Ukrainian child who had been abandoned by the Barnett's credible but Michael Barnett's attorney told the Daily Mail that the charges had been filed because another couple perhaps convinced by a Natalya that she was a minor had petitioned to become her guardian oh my god she tried to rope another family's cook she's good explaining Natalya was living on her own and a couple wanted to become her Guardians thinking she was still a child the couple tried to overturn the 2012 results so they tried to overturn her fucking age and I've got an adopter again despite new tests commissioned by that couple the court upheld the original result which maintained a natalya was an adult the couple later dropped their guardianship petition once she tried to kill them too Wow bouts are currently unknown her age remains the subject of much debate she's touring with Skippy from family yes she's on the Blue's Clues tour she's I mean listen you know that's a guest you want to get a guest that girl I would have someone in the room with a gun you sit her on a stack of phone books I might have you let it just might have a gun you see bring her home she might be you might fall for it you might you know she might be riding Marshall around the house I have real kids yes I understand kids it is wild when you could do you think could you ever get duped like that yeah you could do yeah if someone's really really really good and you're tired you're working hard you just drink a little bit maybe you're on some antidepressants I might be a little loopy I wonder if the parents are like how good if parents are we write that for three years we didn't know that we had a 30 world psychopath living in our house like maybe we're not the best at this she's got a bush that was the other thing that she had a dull boy adult teeth how do you make a death threat when you look like a kid like that what do you I mean it's crazy Chucky he's got the fuck out of every pest but it is fire kill yeah dude Chucky was terrif Chucky was really people say sometimes I look like Chucky which is not nice I know people are mean I agree but there's a lot of people on YouTube they'd like to just let it fly really let if you want to read that stuff I know but sometimes I do I don't know about that but I find a little too famous to read YouTube comments I read the stuff and sometimes it's brutal yeah sometimes I'll answer like never on YouTube but sometimes on IG Instagram I'll answer and say something back i one guy said something to me once and I said something back to him I went because I looked at his page and it was just his chick holding a bunch of other people's kids so I said why don't you impregnate your girlfriend so she doesn't have to run around with other people's kids so it was wild and then they deleted my comment whoa yeah he was going after you he was going after me I went back at him and they deleted and they deleted my comment this is the world we're living in now mmm well you shouldn't it wasn't appropriate for me to go to his page well it's yeah it was wrong but I did it counter punching yeah that's right it was just I was trying to you know this is my job yeah you get him it gotta go yeah you're better like I understand people that are sitting in a job somewhere sitting in a cubicle angry and they see someone like yourself or like me or anything Jamie I'm sure he gets hate to yeah they just get fucking angry maybe you said something stupid I say something stupid all the time me too and then they want to come get you and they want to yell at you or make you feel like shit say some awful yeah something really means sometimes yes yeah sometimes okay yeah but I would rather give them that this is what I feel I'd rather let them let them have it let it go say it take your shot but this is how I feel I'm not it's not personal right like I get it like I used to be me when I would I mean I used to be you when I was young and coming up but there was no internet to do this if I had the internet I guaranteed you I would have said some horrendous ridiculous shit on Twitter Instagram Facebook YouTube comments no doubt we all would have everybody would have yeah I don't want to read them I don't want them I don't want them to upset me and I don't want to be upset at them and if I see them I don't want to know they said it because it's not real right it's not real and that it is the real thought and they did write it but they don't really know me right and their thought and they a lot of it is just it's fun sometimes I'll just respond to somebody and they'll go hey and they'll totally like they'll say something nasty and I'll respond and it'll go hey just kidding love will podcast normal and it's just like oh they just want interaction and that's why they said that I look like a potato skin well just fucking be angry man more people's lives suck yeah a lot of people it's not great right now no yeah and even if it wasn't not not even if the economy is doing better right the vast majority of people are not doing what they want to do with their lives yeah there in most people at some point in your life have experienced like that yeah fucking tear absolutely we've been involved in there and that feeling of frustration when you see someone on YouTube it it's so easy to just say something gross and we all do it as comics you know you know we because we'll see somebody will see the trailer for somebody special or whatever and we'll be like yeah oh yeah and it's like why we shouldn't be focusing on that but it's too much it's a lot of fun yes to commiserate with people yes in the shared hatred of something and when someone's doing well like yourself your videos start picking up a little steam I'll start recommending it it's it's fun to shit on you yeah yeah fuck him he's funny that Megan McCain doesn't even sound like her yeah yeah yeah that's true my favorite comment is just when someone will write he's fat that's my favorite comment someone already he's fat 300 likes thank you I appreciate I appreciate that he doesn't even sound like that right yeah terrible impression right sounds like him right yeah I went to see why I was working with Otto and George way back in the day yeah that's right oh yeah yeah and we were we were working at Dangerfield's in Manhattan yeah and Joe some lady he's you know he would Auto had a puppet named George and he would do the immuno the would work the puppet the pup would say fucked up things and Otto be like hey how are you saying that that's terrible and I remember this lady going his lips are movin right it was like the worst ventral isn't he was never turning you that at all he moved his lips and she could concentrate on the joke yeah the pup was saying the most horrendous fucked up ridiculous jokes and she's like his lips are moving up its yeah they were they were amazing man that to me is like so funny how somebody could just key in on something like that while the entire audience is laughing having a good time she thinks she's focusing in on the important part and that everyone else is wrong right yeah the other 300 people that are dying on the floor are wrong by his mouth you see lines the mouth lunge the mouth goes up and down you can see where the lines are it's not a real mouth I love it that's fake I mean it's tough you know you what we do and you know you're obviously the the big big venues now but like when I was just in a club this past weekend and it's like it's an interesting time in the country to get a bunch of people in a room pour alcohol all over them and just let them go because no matter what I say if I say Trump or IC and my act is not political but I'll mention things that are going on there's jokes yeah and as soon as I say Trump some of the crowd will go whoa and some of them will start booing yeah yeah and I'm like guys that's not this I'm just here to make a joke about yeah this yeah so this isn't a rally I'm not taking your temperature it doesn't matter and they just they're hammered and they're ready to just let you know with it right yeah no it's just like a it's a weird time for discourse right weird time for people shouting things out too because people think their opinions more important ever been before because of social media right people are used to expressing themselves right and I mean and some crowds now I mean I think there's just a you know some perverse pride and I kind of put me through it you know I'll be like you guys are danimals you fucking animals there's a huge applause brain you know I was like where did they hand out ticket to the show detergent cares you know they love it they're clapping you know so well they're looking for something that's different than most of what you're getting on television and in websites yeah getting this fucking politically correct woke nonsense right and people are rejecting it look Charlie's Angels fuck you turn we don't wanna fuck you yeah get woke go broke yeah that's what I'm saying now like they're done with it yeah they're done yeah people are sick of it and the this business people don't realize the business we're in doesn't have a soul they don't care so eventually it's gonna swing back the other way oh yeah because they yes money yeah Joker did great yes these things do well and that's a fucked up it's a fucked up movie and it was great and I think's great yeah I mean you know look at Roseanne 25 million people tuned in to the premiere of Roseanne do you know how much money that must have cost ABC to fire her for that a lot it was so dumb hmm I mean it took me a while to convince her to come on the podcast yeah she was supposed to do it a long time ago on dude we had fuckin camera crews trying to get to my house crazy hammer crews outside our old studio where we used to be Brian madness man I mean it was it was crazy and like and that's that one thing by the way is extremely insulting and fucking stupid and archaic do you think you just find me I'm going to talk to you right you put a camera in front of me your fucking rudimentary interview skills yeah you're gonna be like oh you got me yeah oh well here here let me give you my statement scoop you can you say a bunch of shit you can't talk you can't put on your hair do you will do will you just walk by them I'm like I'm not interested in talking to you right yeah this is not how it works you don't just show up to get an interview you schedule it through right there's a channel their channels yeah you know how to do it they know how to do it they just think they're gonna be like this is news you guys are archaic you're not even real yeah it's a good guys got Chuck and shaman and does anyone care does anyone is there real money in that anymore is here real money and Justin Bieber having sushi does anyone care I'm sure some people care with the websites no I am clicking on TMZ makes a shitload I see other comics sometimes it take pictures with families people I go what are you doing it's not doing that stop doing that no one wants that it do it for the gram the worst thing in the world you have just a picture with a famous person that's miserable I was gonna ask you for a picture after this yeah it's like what snide ah it's the worst thing ever I yell at friends I go don't do it don't do it well people like to be associated with someone who's cool yeah yeah I've got a picture with Josh homie from Queens Estonia it's like a cool thing I guess me yeah but these people pulling out people that would like 90s sitcoms they'll just pick a guy out of an audience it was on like homicide life on the street right and they'll be like hey it's me and I'm like let him be it's iced tea yeah he's been a cop long he's been a rapper he's been a cop forever is that so weird never I'm a motherfucking cop killer yeah he's a good he's just a good TV cop yeah you know that shows gotta be soul-sucking though yeah I bet you just can't wait to spend money I think after a while it becomes just it's a routine job it's like anything else and no one cares anymore like you know this shows that we all as comics do that are just routine jobs you know things we just show up and they're like okay here we go and you're the topics and make some jokes and then it's like boom boom boom I know but at a certain point in time you got to be planning your escape you got to have enough money like when I was on Rock season five of Fear Factor I remember thinking I don't know how much longer I can do it what was it about it that was it was just too much repetitive it was the same thing over and over again we did 148 episodes right it was just after a while it's just like Jesus Christ how many animal dicks can you serve people right how many times can you throw them off builders yeah yeah that's enough stuff already it was just there's no amount of money to get you to come back to do that or something like that did come back in 2011 I came back but I didn't I was I didn't have as much money back then and also it was a lot more money than I got the first time it was like a big deal because they were good I think it was I don't I also don't remember about the money part but it was a big deal it was gonna come back but I immediately regretted it look immediately I was like oh my god I have a job again yeah I do but I had I was having children then you know like ya wanted to yeah my kids were real young and I was like I need like when you have a kid I had an older daughter but I was already paid for most of that good do you think about two children and you think about two children that are like at the time two and one you're like oh my god like this is this is serious yeah I have to may have 18 years yes have to make a lot of and I think like all the money I squirreled away from the original season a fear factor that took care of my family for a long time and it'll probably okay but I felt like this overwhelming responsibility to squirrel away more more money more more money but then once I started doing I was like oh my god this is a mistake yeah this is a mistake you like this is crazy oh my god don't like it yeah and then we got canceled because we serve people jizz who is that the final straw yeah yeah they had a drink donkey calm and that was it that was too much that was that interesting as TMZ saved me that was when you had the moral majority back then and they would this was a problem that's what all the censorship came primarily right from like right-wing groups um sorta yes the Obama was the Obama to return okay but what it was was the show had to get more and more extreme and it was very dangerous like he was freaking me out right because they were taking a lot more crazy risks like one of them you had to you had a set of keys and you had your partner was handcuffed to a tree and they were attached to a bungee cord that was attached to a fucking helicopter okay in the helicopter was had this bungee cord taut and they're flying in the sky above a giant Canyon I mean way to fuck up there right so you got these keys and you're working these keys and the idea is the first person to get the key lock open right you unlock the thing and then boom the priests shooting into this guy and I remember seeing them going what if something snaps what if something breaks yeah we watched someone follow their death like what the fuck are we doing you know you just have a bunch of executives going oh they just make a face you know they would just go yeah not great I had a joke about it that they were gonna kill Saul and then guns down and then blame it on the terrorists all right don't let the terrorists take away your fear back with Mario Lopez and I would just choke her I was always joking around how Mario Lopez couldn't replace did you ever feel weird morally about it because you have these people that are coming in that are putting themselves in these positions no because I would have done it I would have done it when I was broke I would eat an animal dick oh yeah throw puke in my face right there are people that we know will do it now you know nobody the works of the story yeah we'll all do it now and a lot of us have money and there was the idea that they could do that and you know and move it on to a career the only one who's actually moved it onto a real career was Michael yo Michael yo I was on season one of Fear Factor episode one have someone interesting music K is he a comic yeah he's a comic comedian cuz it's doing really well that's wild just film a special he's a really good guy that's great really funny he's hilarious somebody smile and start on tier fact 100% yeah 148 episodes three people per episode yeah I remember I tested for a reality show on Food Network and they had me on set for about of an hour and they were like yeah this is not I said I said like three things into the camera and they go none of this will ever this is not gonna work what is the say well they were just basically like it was called hot spots and they're like tell us what you think a hot spot is well it's a real cool hot spot now just like a hot spot is when I try to get into it the maitre d tells me to kill myself and then they go okay well let's do the joke again but let's not say kill yourself I'm like well that's the joke right so they're like just maybe say something like when I try to get in they say no and I'm like you but that's not funny so then we just tried to work around in a bunch of different ways and I would just keep saying things and you could tell they were just getting frustrated networks like Food Network love the idea of comedians too like we loved the idea of having a comedian come in to spice it up and then wouldn't you get a real comedian they're like we don't want that well then one night but ironic and I am with like three tracks yeah it wasn't like a real down the middle goofy a lot of lane change because I was making fun of like we had all the archetypes of the Food Network P like we had the fat southern woman they were supposed to be Paula Deen and she came in she's like have you ever had a redneck real cheese and I said this woman's gonna explode unsaid and and I cuz they said you can be playful with each other so I said this woman's gonna explode on set and they go oh do I have a hold on I'm like you said we could be playful we had the Asian woman who was like she just talked about wellness she was like out we just I want to be whole and I want to be one and I wouldn't be wellness and then so every you know you had the guy fieri like you know there's a million chefs that think they're Bourdain they think they're profound but in reality they're just making fuckin grilled cheese and they have tattoos but other than that you know so we had a bunch of those chefs who were like I'm a hard-partying I've seen it all I've seen it all I've worked on the line it's a shut up you've made gnocchi obtain with with Kitchen Confidential he changed what a chef is he changed what a chef is but most chefs are not that and the reality is is like you hear people now that travel around the country and they think that they're like and I love board Bourdain at Prudential but sometimes Bourdain show was interesting because like he'd be sitting with a family in Turkey and they'd be like well we haven't seen our daughter in two days and we don't really know where she is a revolution and then they would it would be like and then he would like they would start talking about hummus and I'd be like what happened you don't like what's going on like why are we talking about figs right now there's a revolution happening this whole idea that like food like I think Bourdain was a genius but the people that have succeeded him haven't done it well is anybody doing it that way where they're traveling around the Gordon Ramsay they were talking about him doing something but the backlash was immediately my and fear yeah because people were thinking that he was gonna try to replace Bourdain right if he stays in his wheelhouse is Hell's Kitchen and doing all those shows that he did before everybody would've been fine right but they were like hey fuck he's gonna come come at ya you need to imagine doing no reservations now or what is the the new show what was it watching now and Marzano was imagine it's like parts unknown with your host Tim Dylan now it would not work and I would say it would be thought it would come get you ya know be a problem and it's also like he was a really brilliant guy like most people that like you're like all we're eating food and learning about the culture it's like you're really not you're just having dinner he actually was he was because he was curious and interested but most people that are like that or it's just a lot of people pretentious yeah and they think that they're learning about the culture through food we're learning about the culture through dining it's like you're not really you're eating in a resort you're not going anywhere outside of the resort because you you will get harpoon so you're eating in a resort and then there's a black SUV that takes you back to the airport like bulletproof it's bulletproof armed guards flanking you and he's you know the one time that you didn't have that I was on the Impractical Jokers cruise which they have a cruise they do a cruise and they're they're great guys and a bunch of comics came on to entertain people that we're waiting to see them people waiting to see them but we would come on and go hey and they would they would think it was them and they'd be like okay that's this guy and there were fun audiences and everything but then the cruise would dock and you would go to this little town in Mexico that was like clearly didn't exist it was just like you know yeah all these cruise lines had bought just a certain amount of beachfront and made it a town yeah and they do this it was called Costa Maya they literally do this and you know you would walk onto this beach and then literally they would like drive you to the little tourist area but you would just see people running around with bare feet roosters I mean it was like you would drive through like literal in crazy poverty and you felt horrible because you were just on a boat that had 30 chefs you were just on this disgusting boat with a 24-hour buffet where people are gorging themselves and then you go to this island where like people's bones are protruding out of their body so it's so it's a weird it's a weird thing when you mix those worlds of like food travel and you know education that's often how it is though if you if you stay in a resort in a country like Mexico it was in Punta Mita yeah the four seasons beautiful resort yes so pretty I've been ok so do you have these Gor of these golf carts yeah you just ride the golf carts around the resort yeah well we decided to take the golf cart off the resort see like what happens we go down this way so he talked to the guys hey we said can we go down this way he's like um yeah I mean you can't sure okay yeah so we go down this way me and my fucking wife and my little kids in the car yeah I think the oldest daughter was with us too and we we go into the town and as we're in the town we noticed that there's a fucking armored vehicle with like a tank chase with with metal plate on the front of it with guy with a machine gun standing on top of the fucking tank like in like a turret right and then ready to rock what were you at staying at Hotel Rwanda no no no they have it set up to protect the resort oh and I realized I'm like oh my god this is a military base to protect the resort in case some shit goes down wow this is crazy that's crazy they were sitting there ready and waiting she's just sitting on the tank yeah moppy ready to go just in case they had a drive a few like a quarter-mile in towards a resort that's wild because you got to realize like I mean when we were there fucking the Halle Berry was there yeah I'm his folks are there like oh yeah they don't want that in the news oh my god they don't want Harry the Halle Berry's head on a pike being booked around that town in Mexico so it doesn't do anything good for the numbers no what you saw would happen that Mormon family in Mexico what happen oh every now and then something bad somebody goes somewhere and they just they gunned down this family they gunned down this wife and children and missionaries that master which is sad but it's also like no not missionaries they live there what they is is that what they is they branched off yeah from Utah in the 1800s when they changed the polygamy laws and they started up these colonies in northern Mexico because back then and the 1800s before cars it really didn't fucking matter if you lived in Mexico or the United States right like it was just the kind of the same your horse for open borders here we go there's the clip maybe it'll fix everything right so they you know Mitt Romney his family is from Mexico interesting yeah Mitt Romney's dad was born in Mexico seemed like ever least Mexican people ever they're Mormons Wow but they're Mormons who wanted 150 wives they just wanted to go on a wild fuck fest right Jesus and the only way to do that is over the border you got to go over the border so they set up these towns so they set up these fucking Kampf of Mormons Mormons with guns Old Mexico yeah over the border in Mexico northern Mexico and apparently the the cartel and them had beef and they put out a fucking hit on this family and they shot down the wife the daughters I mean it's just a horrific shit man interesting lunch I think this was recently right and I think weeks ago and Jamie there was an article recycle that with people who said it was kind of like victim blaming where they like the New York Times ran it with like family had a violent history Oh God did they really yeah there was a New York Times article about this family I'm remembering it now where they were basically like this family's had a fight long violent history or their name has been synonymous with violence which is an interesting article to write you know right after they were massacred well it sometimes you read articles that are written and just like do you member went back dad he died yeah they killed Baghdady and they said there was a Washington Post called them an ax store religious scholar that's hilarious yeah like who's the fuckin head of Isis they threw Ryan people off the roof right right yeah it's also weird though that worst I don't even like when they're like we killed Baghdad it's like who's Big Daddy again Big Daddy Big Daddy who's this what no one it's you know what it's like it's like if you're paying attention to likes like division to college squirrels baseball players yeah I can't pay attention it's like so many we gotta get over we can't live in the psychic terror of Isis forever remember Isis that used to just release a lot of content online they would saw people's heads off with those rusty things it looked like they were doing it up the block in a warehouse in Studio City to be quite honest I'm sure they were I'm sure that CIA wasn't doing that but it was a little weird like these videos would drop and then everybody would be like riveted and then they would just start beating the war drums again they'd be like it's kinda we got to go to war look at look at these people they're doing horrible things and then that hasn't happened in a while so we don't we're not even thinking about Isis well there was they tried Isis out yeah when when they need slick to invest us in something well there's not that many of them realistically anymore yeah there's no plotting shit but you know their numbers have been diminished pretty substantial yeah I think you've said it on this show and I had a guy in my show this guy John Kiriakou is a CIA guy who said listen we had decimated al Qaeda within a week or two of being in Afghanistan yeah yeah I wanted to bring this up with you because this is a conspiracy that I just remembered while we're talking about okay do you remember when there was a journalist that was Murphy a girl first got to be beheaded correct and the the conspiracy theory was he was beheaded by someone who is other than was from Iraq that they were supposed to be I believe was it Taliban that supposedly did it to him or some other sect I'm trying to think I don't think there's a Taliban I think he was in Daniel Pearl I think was in Iraq right he was in Pakistan and he was I guess it was Taliban or you know but what the the conspiracy theory was they were paying attention to the size of the men who were behind him yeah they're like this this does not fit with our profile of Pakistani or Muslim men this looks like an American he looks like a big country fed fucking American assassin right and that they did this in sort of as a false flag right so it was just a guy that looked like Brendan Schaub standing behind Samuel Pearl yeah you and Brendan Schaub just back just sawing off his hat yeah they were like that which was involved to him I'm sure he would for these that card anything for it for anything for just free dental we would do it but they said the hands were too big like the guy's well I mean remember all the photos of bin Laden a lot of different photos of bin Laden oh yeah it was like nine different guys yeah it really did look like it was like not the same person nobody in the SEAL community has ever given me a straight answer whether or not they believe the official story well they all died right SEAL Team six no no the guy who killed them is is a lie yeah it's been on tour I don't know didn't a lot of people in SEAL Team six time they not after in a crash yes yes yes I mean it's odd what are you saying I don't know I mean it's just wrapped in foil I'm just saying this this could you know I love tinfoil I mean I think I charge your ham I think right now with with what just happened with Epstein people are you can't get away with this stuff anymore well what happened with Epstein this is what I like about it yeah it's it was so blatant and so outrageous that people go hey maybe they did fucking kill Kennedy yeah like yeah they did maybe just doing shows in Fort Worth and I was looking at these audiences and I was going they'd kill him again yeah they'll kill him again give these people a couple of shots of tequila another shot goes right to Kennedy's well if there was another one like Kennedy like right let's think if someone took over after Trump and this guy was trying to get rid of the NSA and get rid of CIA and and you know and then there was industrialists and there's something the Mafia fucking got him in the office in the first place your percentage they were like hey you fucking piece of shit yeah we're the reason why you're here we rigged Chicago for you and so then it has this military blunder the Bay of Pigs and so that in the military's after him everybody's hangry he says he wants to splinter the CIA to a thousand pieces and give all like peacetime intelligence gathering capability to the military if we had someone like that yeah some guy like that and by the way he was fuckin everything that moved to yeah I mean any war on drugs and everything you know he was enjoying himself yeah that's crazy had a doctor dr. feelgood that's where the name came from and they were currently crews on dr. feelgood and it was Kennedy's doctor yes Wow yes that's what being president was a great job well they all were on it that's how they fucking got the party moving yeah just just methods busy men running yeah you do is hard yeah it's true I mean listen this is the argument for Trump being on amphetamines right now yeah how the fuck else you gonna run a country yeah you have to you have to be a little amped he's definitely amped but I like seeing him I like seeing him you know when he goes big what is it sidebar South Dakota today started a new campaign anti-meth campaign but it is on meth calm and yes we're on it is this Logan that over 50 grand I mean there's not anybody spend how much 450 grand of taxpayer might have figured this oh my god this is why people hate the government cuz nobody was able to stop this and say hey this is not the best this is the dumbest fucking ad campaign I've ever seen in my life meth we're on it that sounds like a fucking onion article think a rap song I love what it says go South Dakota has a problem there isn't a single solution because meth is widespread but we can approach it from different angles so it doesn't take over counties towns neighborhoods let's work together math we're on it guy what's up with that fucking brown water turn that back up put that back on how about you fix that fucking toilet water you got your kids swimming around and look at that water it's disgusting yeah methods are always in one problem yeah math is in the top ten problems in South Dakota meth is what you need to get on to fix the other problems in South Dakota the whole town councils yes unis start cleaning but Epstein they just charged guards I mean this is hilarious this is a very funny comic Nick Mullen on Twitter was like oh yeah this is the Justice we all wanted the guards you know no here's what's not the two prison guards tasked with watching Jeffrey Epstein on night he killed himself they should fucking charged with falsifying records and here's Searcy in conspiracy yeah here's why that's good somebody paid those guys and they're gonna sing or they're gonna die something's gonna happen either they gonna take those guys I think it's a way to satiate the public I don't think there's I mean I don't think that bar the Attorney General has any real desire to get to the bottom of what happened I mean this is clearly obviously sexual blackmail Epstein was involved with intelligence whether it's us whether it's Mossad its somebody his Island was a honeypot he had powerful people and compromising positions he was at probably like an access agent where he would give these Intel agencies access to into insanely powerful people ex-presidents people like that so the if you don't want to open up that wound because it's just gonna it's never gonna stop bleeding and guys like Barr who are in you know this is a guy that's participated in multiple cover-ups he you know I don't think he has any really interest in he's a lifelong government official you could say deep state you could say whatever it is but he's just a career his job is to protect the interests of these power factions in Washington these government agencies there's no way they open this up and there's no there was no way that they could have had Jeffrey Epstein in open court pointing fingers it may be prime ministers and presidents it would tear countries apart it'd be the biggest political scandal in our lifetime I just can't believe they just merked him like that though they didn't just Merck him they murder twice here's what I want to know when he tried to commit himself suicide the first time where the cameras broken then too great question I don't know I don't we never heard that well we didn't see any footage of him I've never seen any footage of him and his cell I mean they haven't released any footage of the cameras ever working right I mean from what I can know but I'm just saying even comment on it remember the first time he attempted to commit suicide I think they got it yeah I don't know that's a good point I mean I think they he they found him they transferred him I don't know if they have photographic evidence of him doing that Google what happened the first time Epstein tried to kill himself because I'm that's that's an interesting thing where is a yes they're very into they know for sure did they watch the footage and see him tying a rope and then and then they went in and go next time you got to do it like this you tie the knot stronger you you take off from the chair my favorite thing was a cellmate the cellmate that they gave oh yeah which is like a long I it was always you know hop yeah real up yeah from Westchester yeah huge skinhead looking dude Italian guy coked out giant muscles killed a bunch of fucking people and sold drugs Jesse just him and Epstein they got along he was so he was like the like Hollywood stereotype of the last guy you would want and you wanted in a cell with big Guido and corrupt cop with giant muscles yeah if that's the guy I mean that would be the guy that maybe he's the guy who killed him who knows means a giant fucking guy I mean guys like that I'm sure would take a bribe pretty easily in there yeah and those guys don't open their mouths you know fucking yeah why not yeah I can't focus now he's in jail right right the guy I'm locked up and they go look and who knows and listen it's Tommy come on right Tommy do this and you're in here forever you like killing people I think they're gonna watch the batter know if they can do this but they got to watch the bank accounts not obviously the people that are paying off people are pretty smart yeah there's ways to hide money but somebody got paid off substantial amount of money yeah somewhere somewhere that might not have you don't think so this is a weird one like this one this one involves so many people money might not have been passed around right you know what I mean like somebody just might have called in favors but yeah where is that hey just hide yeah where is just Lane Maxwell that bitch is in Brazil yeah somebody said she was in LA she wasn't LA at an in-n-out burger with a fucking book and they staged the agents they released a staged photo and I don't know what the fuck she was thinking like all America will freak of me if they see I'm eating fast food I don't even understand no no no she was trying to release a message oh yeah she was reading a book about CIA agents that have been murdered yeah but what's the point of that message I'm trying to say he's a fucking intelligence agent right yeah yeah something that was actually said by was it one of the Attorney General's when their prosecutor has I said absent would belong to intelligence well if you just look at this is hotter than yeah there's a so does it show the book but there's another photo I think you can see the side of the book hmm okay but they also added in that that movie posters that's right somebody swapped out the movie poster they photoshopped you they took advantage of this opportunity to promote a fucking film right the Seth Rogen movie this is an interesting product placement in the in the background of a human trafficker honey sandwich Lou she's got good taste in the list of foods brand deals she's got an old iPhone so she's shown she's struggling a little bit financially it's very she's not on the new iPhone it's a burner she's got a burner well it probably had five different phones but it drives me easier it is you know I think it's hard for people to understand that like elements of the CIA or the Mossad would condone the abuse of children to get leverage and information on people but that's kind of what's happened before yeah I think they just figured look these 15 16 year olds they're gonna keep their mouths shut I mean we're talking about one when this happened this is all a long time ago right it wasn't that long ago like how long ago did it start I mean it's well it's been going on for a leaf or very decades but right but my point was that when it initially got started they probably didn't have the internet right 100% when did they when did he start bringing people out to the island you got the island I think late 90s or early 2000s so nobody really understood the concept of social media or where to go what's really crazy is like no one's ever accounted for how that fucking guy got all that money well less whack snare who was the head of Victoria's Secret was like his mentor and they were bodies and wexner gave them and you know it's so funny about the mainstream press you know the Wall Street Journal ran some article they're like how could a guy like les Wexner who sold women's G forever you know get ticket totally bamboozled by Jeffrey Epstein that's like not nobody there thought that it was maybe a pathological relationship and that those guys knew each other and maybe we're in the similar stuff or whatever I don't know but maybe there was a mutual benefit to them knowing each other they think that somehow this billionaire got bamboozled by Jeffrey Epstein which is just insane to think but that's the way the press thinks so like this guy's a CEO of a multinational I mean he's I'm sure he's didn't do anything untoward yeah I'm sure he's innocent yeah the the prince did you the interview with the prince was fast yeah well my favorite thing about that was I think the prince is autistic or something and the people on Twitter were like don't make fun of him he's got some I think he is he's got something and the people on Twitter were like hey don't jam him for him like okay can we just how do you know when someone's autistic like there's a there's a spectrum right when is it on like when do you did you lick a lot of strip yeah yeah bro you got it a lot of people now for whatever reason it's becoming more and more obvious more diagnosed it's more diagnosed and you I think you've even talked about it before it's people people are not socializing with each other face to face as much and so there's a lot of like awkward people that you know maybe you're on the spectrum and maybe aren't they're trying to ban clapping because real problem with loud noises yeah I'll fucking al Prince Andrew forced to scrap visit to flood-stricken New York as he's called into crisis talks at Buckingham Palace House have summoned recent crisis talks oh right now yeah like something crisis talk he they're gonna fucking hang him to some of his answers were so craziest well if my attorney advises I will he's like I don't know when a man has said like he went into this whole thing that was just completely he's clearly he was clearly had relationship with deputy and it wasn't good I think Epstein knew how to do it yeah I mean facility Clinton so a lot of these people flew with Epstein all the time six times yeah and I've been telling you I haven't flown my mom 26 haven't flown with anyone 26 times maybe Jamie and I decided we maybe flew together 10 times and maybe Hinchcliffe and I've done 26 times Hinchcliffe and I probably won't as many times you'll regret that when Tony gets outed for whatever he's doing I mean Tony looks like a like a like a feudal lord that's disemboweling chambermaids so whenever they find the bodies in his yard you will be answering for that they gotta find home video of Tony with Joker costume on yeah 100% 100% 100% but he's got a joker is on his screensaver on his phone I love him I love how he's the nicest guy in the world but he just has that look that he had a lot of mean and he looks he's a lot of mean yeah yeah you see it come on let's call me sometimes every now and then there's a flat you know on kill Tony which there's so much fun sometimes I'll sit next to and then you'll see like somebody whether comic they might go over by and you see a flash go through Tony and just a flash of anger and you're like this is a real this could be a real issue you see though dungeon door cracks open just a little bit and you get to see the yeah oh absolutely yeah you just go huh I'm like three times the size I'm terrified of I'm just absolutely terrified of making any founder two weeks ago this is the girl oh man cuz she's gonna start dating Prince Andrew I should call up dr. Phil and ask him if I could play this footage I'm sure Phil will be ok with that I don't have a problem they're always a little tiny person pretending to be a baby yes what did she say when he talked to her she said it's not true what did she say she's really a baby that I want people to hear my side they say that you scammed this is Phil talk and they say you scammed them and she says it's not

is I think that YouTube seems like they're done with like small creators my channel is pretty small Tim Dylan show it's not a huge channel to make it bigger let's make it bigger Dylan show you to please YouTube subscribe yeah rid of it in a month I can I can at least get mad about some positive comments only yes they're like sarcastic yeah they'll be somehow the positive comments movie works great yeah you don't look fat at all I mean so we do these videos they're a lot of fun and you you know that we can't do them on network TV they're not gonna allow us no do it no way no she's not gonna happen yeah well what is he at now 18,000 18,000 stupid that bitch up to by the end yeah well thank you I appreciate my pleasure I thought I would be able to do this stuff on TV yeah that's not gonna happen no but it's better this way you don't have anybody telling you what to do right you can't do your style of comedy that megan mccain thing is fucking hilarious and i know where you only fuck daddy's not gonna let me do that a chance at 100 I played that in this podcast least for you you've got you played Affleck doctorates you've played it for like people that Nobel laureates they're like making a point you're like you you see to build you Megan McCain people like what people like I have five Pulitzer Prizes you like take a look at this fact I yell about its wanting to fuck his dad I wish we could convince Megan to just like just just I thought it would be funny cuz I don't know I'm headlining Caroline's in March in New York and I thought be funny to shoot a promo where I show up at dressed as her and just sit in the audience of the view I thought that would be funny but I've been advised legally that that might not be the best course of action yeah Whoopi Goldberg will stab you yes that's a great promo Whoopi Goldberg stabbing me as Megan McCain and then just Tim Dylan yeah I should probably stab you cold times where she gets tired yeah you know what I would what I would think would be amazing is you in the dressing room the makeup chair yeah getting turned into Megan McCain and Megan McCain walks in and beats the fuck out of you that would be great if she down for you she's cool this is how they tortured my dad in Vietnam and they they fucking that she gets you in an arm listen the only person that could make that happen is you mmm I don't think so I don't think I could I think you're the only guy then you got to get Tommy Lauren on the phone that's actually another point yeah who else what else the Fembots how many I don't know I don't know too many of them but I mean Megan is here's the thing about Megan she I do respect how much she is always willing to be you know like annoying did you see the thing with her in Donald Trump jr. yeah that was heavy like him going on the view was heavy it's like wow oh these idiots are like fire hurts like you can't that's to show the show was dropped well this new dummy's good is if the right do you

he goes only Rosie O'Donnell yeah it's only Rosie O'Donnell and it got a huge pop a huge pop yeah look he's fucking funny he knows how to be funny what is making Holly gonna do what's her comeback well she wants to do a podcast yeah they actually contacted me about coming her coming on here interesting she wants to do I mean look she definitely could do a podcast her comments about blackface words were I get that they were tone-deaf but when you watch it in context it's weird that she lost her job they were trying to get rid of her for the way she said it's a good question she's like why can't you pretend to be someone for hire like Diana Ross right it's not a bad question the problem is you can't you could say that on a podcast I just did why can't you write you can't you can't get fired from a podcast right but she what she didn't understand is how they were gonna use that to attack her and then she has this fucking apology video it looks like there's Isis guys behind her with a fucking sword or her neck it's crazy the goddamn hostage video I saw him sorry the week she was not you know I did not the week she was leaving Fox I was again I was in there doing red eye I saw her she knew she was kind of doing the wrong thing she was sitting in the makeup chair she just had this weird energy you can't go from Fox to then being America's Sweetheart on NBC well did and she didn't pull it off but she did make 60 million a lot of money she could tell everyone to eat her ass for 60 for the for the end of time you know 60 million dollars you took a shit together again for the rest of your life that's true her kids are safe she's sad they're all set yeah well I would tell her to do it too right Fox is not gonna give her that kind of money right fucking money money money money make money but it's not as much money yeah as Bill O'Reilly paid out gals well yeah well he he paid that woman least wheel thirty two million dollars I believe checked that Jamie just found that wrong and this is weird for his ever you know my Long Island grandfather had the Patriots welcome Bill O'Reilly Matt every Thanksgiving you would step right on it and you would sit down at Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly voice was bellowing through the house oh yeah because this was a you know this is my grandparents who I love to death they love Fox and they love Bill O'Reilly because Bill was a traditionalist for it was I people yeah and with the thirty two million dollar settlement Bill O'Reilly made millions last year is he doing well he did thirty two million dollars you have to be guilty right there's you and some and it's dark bad like a hairbrush up your ass yeah piss in my mouth she's got your fucking shoes photos and videos of him doing crazy shit well he was renting her it wouldn't didn't he get caught leaving like crazy messages on some gals voicemail yeah he said I'm gonna loot for you before that one that was the sixth settlement for thirty two million he had five previous that totaled thirteen million so he's forty five million in the hole for that six separate instance you know he's a traditionalist he's a traditionalist no scientist is a traditional listen it's only half a hundred million it's fifty million dollars because you made a few boo-boos you made a few mistakes at work all these people don't understand that a man needs to get some things off his chest well I think there's also there was the environment that these guys sort of came up in whether it's Matt Lauer or whether it's Bill O'Reilly these guys who are like they're your button-down on television and then off air they will blow off some steam oh yeah and some are more more wacky than other ones and you know our there was a but was didn't that Ronan Farrow guy proved there was a bunch of other settlements that NBC had denied about Matt Lauer or he just put out a book yeah catch catch him release yeah yeah well the other thing is like the got to remember guys like Bill O'Reilly and Matt Lauer all right they rose through the ranks to the heads in there I mean it's a certain type of person that gets there the details were already known what his new information knows that her agreement demanded she turn over all evidence which she conversed with O'Reilly and furthermore two o'clock such evidence never existed her settlement also required that she lie even in legal proceedings or if any evidence becomes public by calling the evidence counterfeit or forgeries sounds like Bill's got a good attorney yeah those attorneys not fucking around bills attorneys got a fucking knife at his teeth hambo bill sits down at the ladies and goes you're gonna never work again but you're also never gonna talk again you're gonna keep your mouth shut you don't need to work you don't need to work Bill's gonna take care of everything 32 million oh that's a good song 32 million let me just check my account my dick on my phone look at that look at all the zeros that's gorgeous 32 and then after that 32 well holy shit look on them fucking zeros and he's also like listen you're alive he didn't kill you can make it 32 million all right she was scared to go home for a little bit 3200 my favorite thing about Bill O'Reilly heroes he tried to get the Catholic Church to excommunicate his ex-wife she's like I'm not getting divorced fuck her that is the best thing he tried to send his ex-wife to hell daddy's bit and by the way mother of his kids yes like let's say he got it done in his world to you in the Catholic world you she's going to hell so he would have to sit down with his kids and go now you know your mother's going to hell and I made that happen didn't he also tried to get the marriage annulled so you didn't have to get divorced I think so but I remember that he was like if we can annul it just do myrrh to hell just ex communicator and let her sled the woman that gave me children just live on the lake of fire forever well here's the real question a freak like that doesn't just I mean he was a freak deep into his 60 and he's still a freak now yeah he's still afraid people don't and I think now it's there's a lot of NDA's which there should have been back then whatever he had break those yeah I'm not get caught up in fuck Island oh because I don't know he's a traditionalist you probably like some dirty overseas he's a Long Island guy he likes an old woman he can be he doesn't what a young chick on an island he wants a woman who's terrified who's life's been horrible with us Horowitz to test our speech men hearings oh the O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly calm yeah I think it has massive traffic - OH does really yeah I didn't we find this out that his videos have like fucking hundreds and millions of views or something ridiculous it's on his own sites be really hard to know but didn't we doesn't he have some things on YouTube or something like that I so much I'm gonna have to go eventually I'm gonna have to go to Joe Rogan calm and just have videos up otherwise as things grow like you're still under the umbrella of these companies I don't say anything so outrageous other than this episode where I could get yanked off the air I'm blaming you but it's worth oh yeah I guarantee there's gonna be a problem later and I'm gonna text Jamie a bit why are you guys not because you're dumb video no one wants your fucking lives for the biggest show match well or whatever yeah I think um but the problem is YouTube comes with its own built-in audience right there's people that are already subscribing on YouTube I mean we have millions of subscribers we tell those people hey just kind I know you come we come over here come over here I think you'll all go yeah I don't know about that I just don't know what the future for cuz there's guys that are like david dobrik huge youtubers that are making all this money and then a lot of them have talked about their ad revenues been cut substantially oh yeah well a lot of so a lot of them are starting podcasts a globe you all started a podcast a lot of these guys are going oh the ad money's gonna move in a podcast well podcasting is a little cleaner in that if you have an audience it's just an RSS feed and it gets aggregated through iTunes and through the Android apps and all these different apps do you think right now supposedly and I don't know you would know more about this to me that there's something that is transcribing podcasters and there's a way that they're gonna transcribe podcasts that are going forward and and you know ones that have already happened and is that potentially a way to you know do you think anyone's gonna eventually have to have a license a podcasting license like do you think this will not be the Wild West anymore and is it are they gonna come in and try to regulate this to any degree would you think I think the cats out of the bag I think the box is open you know I just don't think you can at this point in time but I think the clamps the way you put the clamps down is D monetization if they've done that you know they've done that with a lot of people they've demonetised them off of youtube they've cut out their patreon they've cut out PayPal they've done all these different things to keep them from being able to make money which is a comment even if I disagree with somebody even if I think what they're saying is abhorrent as long as they're not harassing or threatening boxing people I I'm never somebody who says they shouldn't be allowed to have a platform I agree and also the problem is what you're doing by D monetizing someone that's saying something that's very popular they say if you have a channel and you channel as you know half a million subscribers and you're not doing anything particularly egregious you're not calling for the death of people you know right if you are goofy right you're not overtly racist but if they deem monetize you what it also does it sends a signal to people that are also like that that maybe haven't stepped out that far yet to like all rein it back a little bit wrap yourself sensor it's like there was a quote it's like kill one man scare a thousand yeah yeah I mean that's what you do I mean that is what you do yeah I mean that's the the why the fuck why do you think they put Wesley Snipes in jail for tax evasion just to prove no hey you fuck you're going to jail my hell same thing go to jail you're going to jail jail right regular jail like regular people jail it doesn't matter if you feel like paying the money back oh you know my accountant logic doesn't care get the fuck in the jail they're sending a message yeah they're sending a message so do you think I think after December 12th YouTube's gonna be able to if your channels not commercially viable they'll be able to just get rid of it if they want that is a that's a way for them to stop something in its tracks okay that's what I think so say if some new guy comes along like you you come along spitting fire talking shit and everybody's getting fired up and oh my god look what he said about Meghan McCain I mean Meghan McCain calls up YouTube you listen we're gonna take the view and we're gonna pull it off of youtube yeah get rid of that fucking fat fuck that's yeah fascinating me that is this I sometimes I wonder yeah if like the shadow banning and stuff is cuz I just made Gary Vaynerchuk mad and I'm like I don't you know I made a joke about him do you think he's powerful enough to just go to all these companies and be like maybe I don't know right I don't think you would do that I love you I I'm inspired by you every day it's all a bit it's a bit solid joke I think it's great when you happen with him well I mean I you know I have a joke about him I really you know have a joke I made a little video about him because some of the things he tweets he tweets like kindness is delicious come on what are we doing he puts out a little too much contest but it's also like all my loser friends think you're gonna be the CEOs of companies because this guy is telling them there's a business inside of everyone and there's not there's just not a business inside of every but there's a lot of people that you shouldn't be like you know they should just fall in line fall in line we don't need everyone thinking that they're gonna be the next Slayer he's got to send the message out there as if everyone can be that way the people that are listening and get it the people that get like they're like okay he's saying everyone can that means me I'm gonna go for it and then they make it and I appreciate him doing that but I need to send the message that most people can't a lot of people show in the same way that he has a message I have a message my message is you're not it's not gonna happen and he has the but it's also there's no specific guidance with a lot of these guys not only him but he'll say things like you could talk about it or you could do it but you better do both and it's like well what's the in like he tweeted once because ideas are shit it's all about execution it's like execute what what are we gonna do I need my kids are sick can you text me do I meet you somewhere how do we start this how do we build these businesses are we gonna do it together why do you think he got mad he got mad I'm just kidding I don't know if he's mad or not I wonder if a guy like that has a sense of humor I'm a Keynesian then you get pulled that you did my my did garyvee thing they took it off YouTube no I mean they took it off Instagram IG no I then he walked in a room with a bunch of guys in little hoodies and he was like get this fatty and they did that because I respect power respect power Gary I get it I'm just saying I'm a funny guy me and you will do a podcast Gary it's fine he's a small I respect him I respect him he's a smart guy right he's smart he's I just I wonder how many successful people need that like just Warren Buffett like look his phone ago it's time to hustle I don't know get a parody of you removed from instant probably didn't I'm just a consider to abstain YouTube I want to hear what you said and I want to see what was the trigger well also waved a knife around this stuff that should have done the president it was it my whole point was it when you make these when you'd give people very general and vague I need to see this now I need a smoke district general and vague advice what sometimes happens is that you know you know people can you like gave it hard tweeted the other day he goes it's the hardest days in our lives that makes us who we are so then I sub tweeted it and I wrote okay so no gun control right I mean and my point there is not to say anything shitty about Hogg but to say listen if you're just gonna tweet vague meaningless horseshit all day like that's all that kid does David Holloway company because racism is bad and it gets 42,000 likes it's like cut the shit out well isn't he like 17 he's a child we got to stop listening to children yeah well that was Louie's joke yes out parkland survivors he's back I feel he's back he's killing my fucking French so I showed you have Nettie's think it's the best hour it's amazing I heard he murdered a guy them guy did a review of him he said I have a very complicated relationship with louis c.k i think what he did was horrible i was a fan of his i was greatly disappointed but then I saw his new set and was fucking amazing yes yes no one even knows what he did he's like I think what he did was horrible to describe what he did the guy's like ha well I you know did you see that girl that oh here I found you found okay play this I missed Twitter by the way well it's on Twitter sweat hey by the way stop pausing for a second shout out to Twitter shout out to Twitter Thank You Twitter they let it wither let megan mccain fly they let it all flow twitter lets everything fly that you could take it in the ass on twitter their porn it's an adult website this is for adults I just love that they do that they kept the Megan McCain thing up whereas YouTube or Instagram took it down Instagram yeah two things taken down well maybe it was that who strikes buddy that's why I'm not I'd merely put the videos on Twitter on you on the Instagram anymore cuz I don't wanna lose my account good call let's see let's hear this I learned the most important world ever stop lying and just keep hustling guys we're building businesses here where do I need you man I can do it and so you can say it or you couldn't do it but I highly recommend you do both oh I'll do it I'll say it and I'll do it I used to work in a liquor store for seven straight years and the only days off I took work to watch the New York Jets and you know what that did it made me throw up on myself so that was a vacation sick nobody gives a fuck about your problems I should kill the president stupid maybe it's like 3:00 a.m. come on it's fucking hilarious Gary you know it's a commit we just gotta have a little fun Gary we love you we love you Gary congratulations on all your success opening right on my show anytime you want to come he's been a miner it's more hyped about going on yours honey a pair of sneakers were they're too small I 13 a fan you 12 a fan of his sent me a pair of his sneakers and actually their case with sneakers name on but they're nice and comfortable yeah he sent me like ten and a half so my feet are all fucked up in them yeah did you see that you guys are my making Micheli she has a youtube channel now doesn't know that I'm Megan Mackay her first video that she's selling makeup was talking to the CB at the girl that was fired from CBS Brian putting out that ABC clip and changed like she was falsely fired yeah she said she didn't even do it and then the the guy project veritas guy said it wasn't her either right yeah so somebody so she got fired for nothing right it's but did she was she the one who captured it though she did but in her defense she said that was her job her job was to capture things right Martin in turnover in case anybody wanted to use it the wolf yeah yeah and also for she said for like blooper reels it could have been for anything there's lots of things they market do that when you do a sitcom you know they do the blooper reel where every time you fuck up your line like we still love those for Newsradio which claim at the end of the the season at the wrap party would play the blooper reel that's probably what they were doing yeah thing is about those new shows there's no season it just callin baby it just keeps going and going and I was listening here the thing he did with Matt and Taibbi and he was like yeah they just want access to people they just want to interview like Will and Kate they're like we're not gonna get too sticky in this no you know yeah they want access and that's what they don't want to throw away yeah some clearly depend on people in the government to get access and if you're a pariah and you're on the outside you don't get the White House you know the trespass you know think about this obscene thing is it's like such an open door in cheese beers always puts an open door to a lot of powerful people having to account for themselves and that's not in their plan I think that's part of what's happening to YouTube where they're like we don't like the idea that somebody like Alex Jones can start a channel and have more views than the nightly news we that means we're losing power and we're losing control uh-huh and I think that somewhere whether it was in Davos or whatever Bilderberg conference it was a roomful of people that were like we got a we got a rain Technology in a little bit you don't think that there's some thought to that it certainly is yeah these are uncomfortable well their money especially people that have already done things that are illegal immoral unethical and there's like there's some sort of evidence of them right but this guy was like the cream of the crop right but what he was was like the if you're a conspiracy theorist looking for something really crazy this is a best-case scenario because it has everything and there's powerful people that it's underage girls it is all the equations it has illegal sexual activity with underage girls on an island that he flies you to the temple raising painted the color of the Israeli flag yet there's a lot of but also its unfolding in real time yeah but it's also it's an island that people called fuck Island really a pedophile Island kid fuck Island whatever it is is like a James Bond movie it's absolutely it's like a weird Tom Clancy novel about but this this guy clearly was allowed to get away with this the first deal he got was a very sweetheart deal we all you know he he he was allowed to go home during the day this was a guy that was you know convicted of you know having sex moleska fourteen-year-old what they convicted him off I think had to do with massage well something it was a fourteen-year-old girl and then he was allowed one of the things the provisions was to not name any co-conspirators so that first deal was like he was not gonna have to now this that wasn't gonna work like that this time they were gonna be like you're now gonna sin and nobody was letting out what do you think they're doing with the guards you think they're like putting pressure on the guards then go ahead you tart for me it up fill us in the black yeah they're gonna probably that why the guard said no to a plea bargain which I thought was very interesting that's very interesting too I don't know it doesn't seem I would have to have faith that I think there's elements in the FBI and there's probably elements in the government that want to get to the bottom of this but they're going up against a wall of people that don't want to get to the bottom of this we're talking billionaires we're talking about people that run countries we're talking about ex-presidents we're talking about you know potentially intelligence agencies and they're gonna just hit that wall yeah I like the old ones better with no consequences like the Kennedy assassination it's done it's all over it's just where is this right now it's unfolding in real time and it's great I remember when I woke up and he was killed so many people had messaged me they were like this is kind of what you you know said was gonna happen in it in it in the fucking happen like this is the craziest thing ever prisons chief says FBI are looking at possible criminal enterprise in Epstein's death yeah okay well wow what is that what does that mean what does that mean what does that mean these guys are very good at what they do if this was Mossad or if it was CIA effort was akin Intel or if even if it was billionaires that contracted this out to I mean these people are very good at what they do did you ever read the book the strange death of Vince Foster no no no Vince Foster was a guy well I know that I know that he shot himself what in a head twice or something no no something before he was about to testify and white yeah he was about to testify he shot himself the gun was still in his hand there was less body at the scene of the crime than was missing from his body they think his body was potentially moved these are all conspiracies that I read I don't know how much of his actual factual it was one of the first ones that I remember reading well there was one about was very interesting and that's very interesting but there was this after oklahoma city there was a cop named Terence leaky and he started to investigate what had happened because he just wasn't he didn't think it was just one guy he didn't think it was just McVeigh and and yeah this guy Terry he ended up like again shooting himself in the head and then crawling a mile and climbing a fence because he wanted to die somewhere more private that was like the official story so michael hastings journalist in l.a ended up going you know right by really good restaurant austria matzoh said to his wife and kids hey to his wife he was like listen I've gone off the grid I'm working on a big story I think people are fucking around with my car a day later or two days later his car accelerates into a tree right in the middle Hollywood so things are happening you know not just that yeah the engine yeah I flew out of the car which is never supposed to happen it's indication of some sort of explosion the conspiracy yeah and if any of that think of any of those stories if any of them had happened in Russia if any of them had happened in another country what would all of the journalists in America be saying you know the Hastings origin story do you know what happened I don't know the origin story it's the story he went to Middle East and he was embedded and he was only supposed to be there for a short period of time but then the volcano happened okay remember that volcano blew and they couldn't fly right so then he seized a journal right with that McChrystal yeah um or I think McChrystal Stan's McChrystal Yentl and he heard them say a lot of shit that he wasn't supposed to hear they joked around about a lot of things and he put that in the story they got comfortable with him they thought he wouldn't fuck them and he fucked them they treated him the same way they treat everybody they tell jokes they joked around about Obama right and he wrote the run and we channel men yeah they're fucking blowing off steam in a goddamn war zone the run run away general the profile that brought down McChrystal so this is he's the guy that wrote it and McChrystal Michael hosting McChrystal was like beloved you're loved by the troops and he had to step down so when he had to step down that's when people were saying oh well that's probably why they killed them yeah it's very possible I mean you make those kind of enemies like we talked about Kennedy it's like you make that's the thing with conspiracy theorists they think everything's just five guys in a room it's not there's a lot of powerful people with a lot of money and resources that can make your life very hard yeah they can't are you in the press that can slander you and that guy clearly or they can get rid of you I mean Hastings clearly fucked that guy over he fucked that guy over I mean he said I'm just gonna go for it this way Casey's probably was like listen that's what I do as a journalist here people dying this is a war and I'm gonna do what I feel I have to do but it's also like those people are over there in the most duress filled situations on earth yes and I think it's so weird that we look at that from times of peace or from the land of peace the environment of pee yeah and even comprehend race they just had jokes of course yeah a hundred percent I mean what did he I don't remember what he said that was so awful I forget what he said but I knew it was it made Obama because Obama is still the commander in chief so the idea that you have a higher you know of a very big general openly mocking the commander in chief in Rolling Stone magazine is probably not a good look and and then you got it just because of you know the way that things work he's gotta jam yeah whoo what did McChrystal say about Obama the gun fired Trump just pardoned somebody and I forget he was a controversial military guy he was a seal that I was accused of taking a photograph with a dead body that was and it was he but what Trump did he didn't pardon him he gave him his rank back okay so he was his rank was stripped and that would have cost him a lot of money and benefits yeah and Trump reinstated his his military status okay yeah yeah it's a very I know there was a lot of opinion Republic story it was a very very very controversial story the whole thing was I get that things happen in war time that we you know sitting here in the cushy environment in Los Angeles like couldn't possibly understand but I do think you know you you you can't just let chaos of it become its own law right because then it kind of defeats the purpose of whatever the hell were trying to do yeah sure yeah I'm sure for sure he says Obama angry after evening McChrystal's remarks yeah I'm sure it does found a couple in the actual article it said like he looked intimidated in front of brass or something like that did Obama - yeah oh that's what they were saying first thing that it was said hey this is what you said it was like this is what you would talk about with your friends you had a couple of drinks Christel thought Obama uncomfortable intimidated by roomful military brass their first one-on-one meeting took place to Oval Office for months later after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job didn't do much better it was a ten-minute photo ops as an adviser to McChrystal Obama clearly didn't know anything about him who he was here's the guy who's gonna run this his fucking war but he didn't seem very engaged the boss was pretty disappointed now let me let me defend this for a second if I was Obama um I would be intimidated as fuck of course you're gonna you just became president and you're going in around these generals who are like the the the baddest military motherfuckers on earth in the middle of a real war but they have to kill bad guys yeah and this is what you're relying on to kill these bad guys who could be very very dangerous and Obama had no experience he does you're gonna be intimidate other thing it was like it wasn't engaged he didn't know this has always been my take on it there's no I mean about being a president there's no fucking way you could be on top of everything camp there's no way I don't think we even comprehend all the different things you have to be paying attention to if you're gonna be the fucking president but whether it's social issues economic issues climate issues military taxes did write decline in the stock market this and that and then you're in Twitter Wars or people to spend time and then this foreign policy get like Korea holy shit there's so many things it's impossible and he probably didn't know how to assert himself and he probably even though it didn't work out so well I mean what the fuck do you tell a guy like McChrystal who's running US war if you're Obama do you fire and probably doesn't know interesting - you don't get rid of them no really no the president he's right the guy's right right I know it's fucking intimidating right now you you bring the guy and you give him respect do you have a conversation with them and you say look I'm not a perfect person you know if I handled that incorrectly I'm just learning how to be the fucking President of the United States it's a crazy gig I mean he's only in his 40s right reign as amazing as he is his intelligence is so as well read and articulate as he is he's still fucking kind of young to be running the greatest army the world's ever worse everybody is nobody's qualified yeah it's too crazy crazy I wouldn't know I got in I mean let's have a fucking drink man yeah look I disrespected you if you felt bad I'm someone you kill Michael Hastings together together Obama brings McChrystal in ago let's kill them together that's it if that's it Jesus Christ imagine that getting you whacked well that would be less an alligator you act I know but that seems to me like men could have worked that out they should have I mean yeah I seem like it I mean I'm never gonna be the fucking president I have no desire to be a mayor of anything are you can his moderate debate live people wanna charge I'm just talking people walk away from all this stuff don't you you're not leaving well no more moving away from more but one thing I would try to do in a situation like that is set an example of how I want my neighbor's to act I don't want my neighbor's to fucking cancel each other if one guy says the other guy looked intimidated about something to his wife and you hear about it part of that is because you're a fighter and you came up with that conflict resolution and you have you know isn't that do you think part of that's martial arts what you look at situations are now I mean maybe but it's also a sense of camaraderie I know people can work out a lot more problems and they think they can that's probably true I think it's better it's a better plan for everybody most people will fucking engage you angry if you engage them angry but most people if you go Kyle come on man I'm not looking for any trouble and they know you're sincere you like this this is how I felt maybe you felt different they made this maybe this is how you felt but let me tell you how I meant what I meant what I said and I fucked up the way I said it or I did this or maybe I should have been more sensitive let's work it out yeah what's working out it's becoming harder to do that with technology but when you got the president who fires the fucking number one general he's like you know you said something about me being intimidated get the fuck you can't man yeah LC say you say something else Oh in person in private T McChrystal likes to talk shit about many of Obama's top people in the diplomatic side one-eighty calls Jim Jones a retired four-star general fetching the Cold War a clown who remains stuck in 1985 but listen this is what guys do here's the thing you're asking this guy you're asking is got to be a fucking assassin for freedom right that's what friends do right right out there Merkin bad guys and other parts of the world you send him over there and then you want him to follow the same human resource codes that a guy who was the fucking manager or Morgan or something does even like fucking go anything yeah yeah yeah perfect right you're asking of course the guys on edge right friends are getting killed right you've got make the decisions that will send thousands of men potentially to their debt of course yeah of course he's on edge yeah call someone a clown it's amazing that's all he does right that's just amazing us and find the people he hates and cuts their fucking heads off yeah okay that's what he's dude you're you're turning him into a warrior right yeah he's a warrior he's a professional soldier you're sending him to these insane places of conflict you're upset if you call somebody a clown yeah that's stupid it's insane yeah men should be able to work things like that out I know but this is you know they don't they should be able to work things out people hold grudges for a long time and that those grudges become you know policy and that's so ridiculous crazy meant to be a man you have to be a clown every now and then you fuck up absolutely that's just part of being a man it is that this illusion of the involuntary if I don't do this I will look weak I sure sure I don't know I could never imagine never imagine that gig that gig is fucking Impostors if they're any human it's a very good chance I will not be the president I mean look at Obama I mean like a fucking Harvard graduate brilliant guy lawyer super articulate as polished as they ever get smart even he can't do it right no it's not designed to be done right you can't do it man yeah well we're doing if your truck it can't eat if you're old what's the end stage of the Empire it's like we've had you know basically we're just trying to land the plane or we're trying to sustain well I know everyone knows there's too much kind of comfort there's too many things coming that are no president and no political solution will help right and that's AI and automation yeah Brian and rege I love Angie angry I don't know what like his rallies he's on a skateboard all the time he's like we have a lot of fun at our rallies it's like but the whole point of your campaign is like in five years forty percent of us are gonna be fighting for water yeah and then he's like skateboarding around his rallies he's just he's gonna dance that dance of making people like him yeah that's the thing about low for president very very nice guy and he's just he gets what's happening he scared me yeah we started talking about uh the automation taking over jobs and about universal basic income people gonna needed to stay alive and survive I'm like whoa like me maybe this guy's like the fuckin you know the beginning of the Terminator with someone's warning you yeah you know we'll kill him he'll be going into a tree next week if it keeps this up he won't be because no one's in charge of the Machine right it's nuts with this machine of AI no one really once it goes once god I'm so scared of it I really think that we are with the last human era where the last two do you think with the end of the human era well this is this is the path that I see this is what freaks me out I see technology right technology is innovating on this accelerated pace super accelerated and it started out very rudimentary it started out when we were really complicated so we were really complicated and it was like flint tools right went from flint tools to a bow and arrow with a flint on the end of it to a fucking canoe to a house to this to of that to elasticity and solar panels and it just kept getting better and better and better and better at an insane accelerated rate but we look like the same people that made the fucking arrowhead right right we didn't evolve we're not at fault we may be devolving we're going the other I'm sure we're evolving in terms of intelligence we certainly have more access to intelligence or if to information yeah anybody's ever had ever and it's hard to tell exactly what gets passed down from parent to child but I think it's pretty likely that some data gets passed down and not just from interacting with the parents while you're growing up I think shit you I think you get some that maybe you don't know what it is right maybe you don't recognize it right some memories in your head or something nice yeah understanding of what's bad and good absolutely I think that's why some people are afraid of spiders because it's some shit that's in their DNA no you know they're like they have a particular fear of some right because somewhere in their memory someone's DNA had I got bit by a spider right interesting she was again in print yeah and I think we are just slow as fuck like every other thing on this planet when you see an eagle a thousand years ago it looks like a fucking eagle it's gonna look like a fucking eagle a thousand years from now right got the design down that's it it swoops in against the salmon there's no it's great it's got out but we we're not we can't keep up with this fucking thing we made so one of the ways thing we made is gonna take old why don't we slow it down why don't we legislate it and say let's just not why do we have to be victims of this we can stop it we can shut it down right good question I mean this just don't think anybody would ever do it because I think everybody is profit I mean there's so many countries that are profiting off in so many businesses that are profit offering so many people like you and me that use its all the time the conveniences expedience now art a lot of our lives at careers are at the mercy of algorithm 100 person the algorithm now is that it's the gatekeepers are done they're done it's the algorithm yeah they're deciding who sees your stuff and and who can see it and who becomes a fan and who doesn't yes so that's AI already running our careers in lives well that's programmed I mean what that is is like computer learning and it's their algorithm is essentially just set up to figure out how to make the most money possible right it turns out that's keep us arguing with each other right most money possible it's really kind of fucked up yeah imagine if it got like if it got extra money for us beating the fuck out of each other like would if someone made like a Twitter or a tender right for just people to meet and beat the fuck out of each other legally yeah like what if like people that'll happen oh right now maybe I just invented it but you have a tinder where people could just meet up somewhere have fights just beat each other's asses and it turns out that's more profitable because more people want to watch you beat the fuck out of each other then even turning you on to the new abortion article Facebook doors yeah because you really really really engage them people are beating the fuck out region what is it that makes when people are fighting why is it that these guys are making more money is it because we're just on more we're online more because we're fighting yes so I'm gonna get the Starbucks gift card because I'm fighting with my aunt who thinks she's queueing on or what also because they also because they know what you've been googling say say maybe you've been googling a Rolex write a specific role she's like you really got my eye on right and it's like showing you those ads um you're like if you google something I will Google something and I'll Google Hotel because I'm like I wonder I wonder how much of cost for that hotel I'm going to this town and then they will give me on my facebook you know newsfeed for the hotel oh yeah so as long as you're also negativity will just keep you on those sites yes if you're if you here's the thing most of my recommendations are all muscle cars and martial arts stuff and and hunting stuff like that right those are the things that are watched that's most of the recommendations that I get but already did a trick where the monkeys yeah the puppies thing and it really worked but if you're a person that's just mad all the time is looking for fucking conspiracies looking to get pissed my facebook is all negative like Facebook doesn't have anything positive now every status is like I just had a knee operation there's dead dogs everywhere it's littered with dead pets everybody's like I you know can you help here's a GoFundMe my neighbor's house burned down like everything is just human tragedy yeah and finding there's money in that right you know what it is nobody on Facebook's like by the way I had a great day and I just love my family everybody's like I I need help right now or I'm gonna die what when didn't Facebook it turned it was college kids try a bit about it was like these were college kids just trying to fuck yeah and now it is the complete opposite which is elderly people screaming at each other well it's gone I'm more of an old person's thing it's a Boomer thing and my aunt loves it she's on Facebook all the time talking about she thinks she's talking to Trump on Facebook directly well she has a few glasses of wine and percocet and she goes in and you know you know somebody's good when they dig in on Facebook can they go I just got out of facebook jail that's my thing oh yeah when they come back that's when you know you got a live one they go I just got out of face book Jail so they go I'm gonna take it slow but and then they start within a few statuses they struck getting back into light hey here's Nancy Pelosi's address and Michelle Obama's a man or whatever that's a big one that's a big one huge that's a big this is a giant conspiracy that Michelle Obama was on this in the he was an early adopter I had somebody who's kind of intelligent and then I respect tried to tell me he was like it's true oh dude there's a lot of people that believe this it's hilarious the kind of wild though they thinking that she's a rapper dying or saying she's a transverse it just based on the way that her pants like bunch up this is nonsense of course not yeah the image is based on her pants bunching up a hundred percent but somebody like pretended I mean listen he wasn't wrong about appstate hey he's right about a lot of she's right about a lot I don't think that's true I don't think he's drinking when he's having fun August 27 alex has been that summer and the showed who's getting torched then Alex told me he is ninety days clean ninety days in December my goal I really want to go in for is in December where Santa hats with him and sing like Happy Holidays this is what I can do it I really want to do that just schedule something that cap city I would yeah I would love to do it and I want to go on there put during the holiday so we could have Santa hats on and it would be nice and festive I did a show last time Rosa yeah I love cap city two crazies up one of the graves is a great town for comedy because he's a great they like to laugh themselves well they're very unusual yes that they're Texas but they're also like a little San Francisco right you know it's like San Francisco fuck Texas absolutely no Texas would fuck Sam Texas is fucking Sanford Texas is doing the fuck but San Francisco would only comment there's weird shit involved yeah yeah yeah like you gotta you'd have to dinner to bleed or something Austin's fun because they laugh at themselves it's that weird collision of we aren't certainly Texas you're in it's a capital of Texas yeah but you have a lot of progressive people so that fusion I think anytime you have a like Boston's great comedy town or DC it's because there's a natural tension that you can kind of just touch on this tension points as a comedian because Boston I was like a lot of working-class people a lot of Ivy League people there's a lot of race issues DC is the whole political divide so I think if you touch on those tension points and Austin certainly has them yeah they it's it's got everything yes it's like it's a weird mixture of like cowboys and hippies and yeah really liberal folks barbecue restaurants we don't wait nine hours to get in psychedelic culture yeah a lot of artists it's a very interesting look like I'll point at a restaurant I'll be like is that a homeless shelter they'll be like no it's the highest rated restaurant in the state you know it's an odd place things that don't hang themselves senator Kennedy drops Epstein joke demands answers at hearing so hearing today and the Senator Kennedy said he cracked and ever since one of the Kennedys I guess right that's okay oh we don't need to hear it I like that they're having fun we don't know who he is he's trolling he's getting his name out there he's having I like that they're having fun with the idea that a cabal of pedophiles run the government just having fun dude I mean let's listen maybe that's not the case I don't know I'm sure we'll get to the bottom then everything will be okay unfortunately I'm sure everything will be okay it's just what a it's what a sick fucking reality it's a sick reality and whatever whatever we do know of it for sure is a problem is a real real big problem and I think that there's a lot of people that are just like I said when we talked last time I said it's not in your daily life you don't think about this shit right you don't think about those crazy sites on the dark web they're getting three or four hundred thousand hits mm-hmm where it's like who the fuck are those people right who are those people signing on to the dark web to watch all this fucked up shit somebody out there you're somebody in a cubicle right now is sitting next to somebody who's a monster yeah and you would never know it because you're like hey how are you and there's a coffee machine working and they go home and they it god only knows right because it's like there's just a lot you know these human trafficking sweeps when they sweep these people up there's like a lot of them yeah it's just really why do you know that I read somewhere that there's more slavery today right now then from then was in 1865 when they made slavery illegal that is interesting so when slavery was legal in the United States and 18 sixty-four there's more slavery today in places like Libya all over the world in Africa the sheer numbers of the world do you think without people that are working electronics con you Google you think they count people that works very skeptical I've read that more than once now I'm pretty close to being Jaime checked out at Michelle Obama was a man these guys are on the road I'm not going down Eddie sent me like a boomerangs 40 million suppose I mean they're what flavory that including us sex trafficking any human trafficking victims there's lots of they including people that work for Apple and like those factories Foxconn those are crazy nice that seems odd it seems odd that we lo well you know that's how they do it there what incidence modern-day slavery are likely to increase as a result some of the biggest challenges facing the world today so they're saying there's an estimated 40 million people are enslaved around the world and a quarter than my children now let's be crazy when an American will argue how many slaves were there in 1864 in America were arguing about whether the chicken sandwich shop we like supports our views yes it's very important that's what we're behind but fuckin right or not well if they have the world very fun watching fat people threatened chick-fil-a well the chick-fil-a thing is strange is like are they affecting policy if they're affecting policy understand what it means they're probably listening they're a corporation they probably looked at themselves and said we won't expand into more liberal cities and shit they're not you know okay here it goes yeah Wow there's only thirty 1 million people back in 1869 that's total that's the whole population that's everybody yeah million three Wow dude yeah we had last season look about that in 1860 the census counted 31 million people in the United States right right three thousand nine hundred of them were slaves man 3 million excuse me 3 million 950,000 960 Oh 760 of them were slaves and most of them were Irish so it's one tenth yeah one tenth of them were fuckin slightly more it's more than one yeah one tenth of the people it was Bay it was one out of ten people was a slave that since yeah it was not a good that was not a good period dude that's insane yeah that wasn't our best time just stopping that that's hard to believe well that's what people don't understand I think when they when they talk about like you know racism being over it's like this was a massive thing and it didn't stop at slavery it was like another hundred years of people not you know being denied opportunities not just that people have murdered murdered lanch hold not only got being pulled over by cops and yeah bullshit wrapped up tribes and they just sent him to jail and they come work for now crazy they basically reinstated slaves as a lot of these jails yeah they have a lot of prison labor what tulsi called Kamala Harris out yes come on Harris is like one of these people she went hard on her yeah what's going on what do you think Tulsi is I mean she's not polling well I don't know about she's tough - yeah she's wrong guy I'm if I'm talking about it you know what it's like it's like a guy who doesn't know jack shit talking to me about the UFC right that's that's how I sound yeah yeah that's really how it works right let me explain yes the situation and I think she's I mean I like her I like that she went back at Hillary that was if do you think Hillary's getting back in I think so I don't think so not with all this Epstein thinks she's probably gotta kill a few more people probably busy great conspiracy theory Biden wins he has Hillary is his VP he gets impeached cuz the Ukraine stuff and the Hillary becomes the president he'll Tulsi gabbard's feud with Clinton helped extend her time in the spotlight yeah well they're always going negative at her well because she's doesn't she taking their bullshit honey she gets all her money from the from the public looks like Sanders day when they don't fuck with Sanders either mainstream outlets don't really fuck with Sanders but no they're not going to and they're not gonna fuck with her either and the two of them together but almost beyond style they're trying to there's a coronation with Elizabeth Warren those two together policy and Sanders would be crazy I mean I know she wants to be President totally and I would vote for I guess I say I guess because I look I would vote for I would vote for Bernie too though burning is a lot of interesting things I'm I'm curious yeah I'm curious as to how this is all gonna play out I really am really curious yes the whole thing is like whoa where does this go it's a crazy election and it's crazy that when you look at the dissipative Democratic candidates you're like there's nobody under 70 I wish Bernie didn't have a heart I know me too but I think you listen people have heart attacks did you hear that there were it turns out probably false but there were rumors over the last couple days that Trump might have had a heart attack or had some sort of heart problem because he was in like some people were reporting that he was rushed to the hospital over the weekend and they hadn't seen him for a couple days mmm he came out this morning and said he didn't have a heart attack so I can actually addressed it yeah yeah when someone tells you they didn't have a heart shot you like why did you tell me that I just loved it with me yeah we're being run by people that are just getting ready to leave the planet yes yes really crazy they're all scrambling in this power game that they're playing it's really weird yeah can you imagine being that old and being billionaire I mean he's at least 1 billion dollars it's got like three out of those and still wanting the job being the president well cuz I think money is an clanging anti-climactic yeah I'm sure I had a very routine physical yeah excessive speculation intensifies I just listen if you're going to bed at night and you think this guy cares about you or you think any of them care about you I just don't I I can't get on board with that well that guy is like he's in he's in constant conflict not like a soldier is it's like but almost and you have to really think about that if you really think about the constant conflict that you're engaging in if you're the president of the United States whether you like that president or not Obama was in constant conflict this guy's in constant conflict these guys are freaking out to have that many people upset at you that many people plotting against you that many people that want to impeach you that many people that don't want your policies that many people that want to hold you by everything you've ever done ever in your whole life and bring it up every time you hold a press conference every day is a fucking whoa all right yeah it's war you can't be worried about you could be worried about people in a very general sense yeah but I don't think it's possible like when I got shit because I said when Obama was crying because of a school shooting I was like listen presidents kind of choose when to cry yeah you know people got anatomy about that I'm saying that's not that he doesn't have emotion but this is also a guy that's ordered the deaths of people daily you know it being presidents like yeah it's like every four years they hire a new man or woman some day maybe two Hill the unkillable dragon right every year the person tells you I got it I got it I'm slang I'm gonna fucking nail it I got a plan we're gonna put it together if you make me the Dragon Slayer we're fucking peace here and my veil and then they come out of the cave and they're like I've made a deal with the drag you know they go and try to kill the dragon they get fucked up nobody ever kills the dragon now it's not meant to be killed the system is not designed to be but you can't say that people get mad because you're like oh you're cynical you're this but with this system that we're in right now is not really designed for a wholesale reimagining well it's also a house it's not designed for 320 million people no right ever thought that was gonna happen right that's that mean these fucking people that came over here man they were riding around on horses do you ever read those the Pentagon estimates for like the future like megacities what's gonna happen to places like LA in New York where you just kind of have a endless you know populate and then strife and unrest and problems with yeah I mean it's kind of terrifying when you read that stuff well with with the Andrew yang stuff with his theories about automation and and then on top of that you put them all together it's a population it doesn't matter what Acacio cortex or Trump tweets we're fucked did you see that one with across yo Cortes and this giant transsexual gal in this album I already love it beautiful outfit I mean she's I don't know how tall a OC is she looks ladies about five seven to me probably this this lady next to her is a Gigantor and what was she's painted orange with the with white face paint and he's clapping and what was this about was for apparently a OC went to a show and she was just given the gal props yeah and clapping and she was like super animator you don't really see a congresswoman do ya and and this this trans woman was beyond thrilled I'm assuming is it true man did you see the one where they're at the rally and they start talking about eating the babies that's amazing where a OC somebody stands up that I mean that's one of the funniest days is that someone who's doing like an onion I hope so I think so I think that somebody who's just doing a you know character you know or someone who's like legitimately mentally ill somebody's legitimately mentally ill but it was too funny and too good I'm like now this this is somebody who's really cuz they got into wind you could see I love that it's like the scene from Borat where he's doing the the speed the thing at the rodeo and you could see their faces started to change they're like oh wait something's off yeah you could see Acacio Cortez's face start to change as a woman started talking about eating infants yeah and you could see ha Acacio cortez yeah I remember this we start eating babies we don't have enough time there's too much co2 god this is amazing like watch here I'm like maybe there's a real person I think it's a real person I love it there's something too good about it if it's not a real person she's gonna be the star of one she's amazing she's amazing she just we just heard her say that and as I was googling it Snopes came up and it says did US AOC supporters suggest that fact-check mixture of results but I'm not gonna go with the thing to read okay but like why wouldn't it just say true well it said because it might have been a joke I think Snopes leans pretty hard left and establishment yeah they're very establishment like they check things against you know mainstream organs of opinion yeah oh this this is cracker it might be might be was it say a woman true yeah they have stunts of doing this a conspiracy she wasn't a OSI supporter okay they say the internet troll was to troll or Cassio Cortez a jockey crew great job she apparently was working at the behest of a fringe conspiracy group of the history of such stunts of course yeah why not of course have fine right have fun have fun it seemed fake right it seemed I mean it seemed real seem like there's no way someone really would want to eat baby it would it's it's an extreme position it's an extreme position I just see the ver the video with her and the translating yeah that's insane this lady's like you think she would ever come on this show Acacio Cortese yeah interesting I'd be nice to her yeah yes sweet she's 28 she's daft yeah just I'm gonna get rid of planes yeah she's silly girls bartender two years ago porn Sokol I'm shot you need a fucking far left to balance off the farmer yeah you crazy people reasonable and see it's great that we have a game show host versa bartender trauma and then she's a bartender and this is how it ends listen why not she could be the resident I will make Logan Paul president he's a smart he hires he will run you tubers are going to have millions of dollars millions of fans and no skills when they're all 40 it's true I will make him the President of the United States he will not be that bad at it he's disciplined he's got a heart I I will I will be his Steve bad and I'm gonna get involved in that I mean why don't they had two fights yeah - boxing not surfers have the whole world I think the next the next group of political figures may come from the internet they may be maybe youtubers it's possible yeah did you watch that fight I watched a little bit of it what do you think they're not bad yeah they got wild their works their asses day yeah I think they clearly did they were in real good shape to fight sick second thing that happened when he hit him when he was down that two-point thing be lost is that legit you're not supposed to hit someone when they're down okay there it is look at that use of volume can you do that or no bad idea somewhere PAP you can and is sitting there being like you see that's really up so hard we were just talking about before that oh yeah so they got wild it's hard to keep your shit together when you're fighting in front of all those people but if one of them had been able to keep their shit together and not go wild in just box like I no which one box is better it seems like logan paul is training with shannon the canon briggs who's legit as fuck i mean he's like you know he was one of the top heavyweights in the world former world champion i mean he's he's he knows how to teach bach he knows right fucking box right as good as it gets yeah so he was working with logan paul and he said some crazy shit like logan paul could be heavyweight champion the world is white he got money i mean i don't know about that but i do know he's real athlete he dedicated himself to it i mean i did a podcast in his house and he was training all day nice bath all the thing you know whatever you can tell you can tell what and the same thing with ksi they're both athletes there but i know how to fight a little bit and they probably fuck up someone who's not as good as them but it's they both got wild and what that means is you start swinging for the fences and sometimes you land and sometimes you don't but if one of them could have stayed technical and just boxed and just fired off sharp jabs and clean right hands and moved a lot and kept your hands up and boxed don't get emotional if they could just box and not get emotional they'd start landing if you start landing you start hurting the guy you guys start hurting the guy with punches that aren't your heart is shot they don't you're not winding up with them you're not exposing yourself yeah fighting technically that's the difference between someone who knows how to box a little bit and and start slugging versus someone who's smart someone who who understands that when you're on the ice yes when you're under duress you have to keep your calm and be able to see everything and the more you tighten up the harder is to see things and then you start swinging and then you barely pay attention right yeah you might land and might knock the guy out still you still have power it's not an absolute thing right but when you look at guys who are really good boxers like Floyd Mayweather does not get into fucking slugfest right you know he's just executed every section he's figuring you out eyes finding the holes he's popping them in there he's not getting hit and it eventually starts chopping people down and breaking them down and right and that's what he did with Connor and Connor I mean it was a great money grab for Connor but that's right that didn't make any sense right but that these guys what they are is they both like at a similar level the reason why it's so fun to watch is because they're both like they can hit a little bit they both are good athletes yeah and they're kind of learning how to fight and they're both super fucking famous yeah online yeah and then they get together and then they're even bigger I mean it was explosive we sold out the fuckin state what does that hold oh that's crazy twenty thousand people a lot of people it's a lot of people it was one of the many internet events you know because yeah it was a good fucking fight meanwhile in terms of like entertainment value they went after it yeah but I think if one of them learned how to just box just stay like a fucking samurai and just box and never let that emotion get ahold of you hard to do at the yeah in the Staples Center it's always hard to do but it's even more hard to do when you talk shit to each other is it is there a similarity when you're when you you're playing arenas now is that different when you're in an arena versus you being a smaller venue well it's nothing like a fight like course the thing about fights is like here comes here comes here comes it's happening right it's like all the preparation all your nightmares you get knocked out all the weird feelings you like you get hurt and training you have to work around it it still hurts me get in there all that stuff that they're dealing with when they go in there is like stand-up times a million like the thing about stand-up is if like if you do your prep work and you get your shit together you could do it many many nights in a row correct they can't do that sure there's got one one chance one chance one chance know that one time you did a joke and it just came out like shit yes no like fuck I wish I could do that show again Brian rots you wet in ROTC oh well they sometimes people have moments like that athletically like you just you fucked up your chin was up high you came in swinging you got clipped once you got clipped in the first round you tried to box in the second and third and then he takes you out in the fourth you're like fuck if I just played my fight right and played my game right I could outbox them yeah but instead I did something stupid and I got clipped but then it's also like as part of it is the show yeah part of it is a spectacle it's so much one scene there make so much you do company know the clothes of course of course I will I do want to fight Chelsea Handler then it's a good fight that's a great fight me and Chelsea fine with that um first of all right over I mean that hurt latest documentary it's hello privilege it's me Chelsea we'll fight over that which was wild I mean you know it was a little what did you see it no it's her talking about white privilege in the back of her Bel Air Antron in the backyard it's a fun one and I just think she should go around and apologize for all the things like she should go to Gaza Strip and do hallow Gaza it's me Chelsea and ski gear man hello Tuskegee to be saucy yeah well right now it's gotta go to graves she should just apologize for everything America has ever done go to Native Americans you know no I mean I I kid around but maybe these it's a joke don't you know this is a joke but maybe these celebrity fights are gonna be bigger things like didn't Bieber challenge Tom Cruise I mean it didn't except out of nowhere yeah just watch the fight I'll be I think Bieber's hilarious he's my likes he likes to fight I think he's sober now right is he sober my friends on the other Dan'l in a luncheon at Beverly Hills and sober wouldn't be the first word interested would be used maybe smoking that reefer yeah I guess she can have fun he's in a war zone his life's a war zones wild became famous when he was like 6 years old as a young yeah wild and he could you imagine we have type of gals that put that pune and a fuckin yeah he's grown up he's grown up with that he's grown up with NDA's god yeah and bodyguards everywhere i never where you go you're yeah so he wants to fight Tom Cruise yeah hoping Tom Cruise kills him like take me well somebody was somebody was on a flight when they would Leonardo DiCaprio and the plane was like going down and Leo wasn't nervous and my friend was like losing their mind because they were nervous and Leo just kind of had to cool and I'm like yeah cuz that's the only thing he hasn't done yet he's been in a plane crash he's done it all he doesn't what experience do you need to have if you're leo he was also absorbing the emotions of almost dying and plane crash just to use them that's a real sociopath that's a real that's a real sick person I'm just recording it yeah actors yes not sick he's involved in charities oh sure they are yeah pieces no one's laundering money no no money no it's real charities who how many people had to do with that fire festival how many people well how many people a lot of people ja rule a bunch of people yeah that's one of them things were you like wait what what happened there yeah well it's you I mean yes one of those things where they the original fire festivals like Iraq war you know and it was just like I couldn't even watch the documentary i watch all the good range they're so hard it's so great though yeah it was fun to see I'm squirming in my seat it's obviously it's fun to see people who want to do something stupid or something ridiculous yeah you know people that are status obsessed and everything get get what's coming to them what's this ja Rule dismissed from hundred million dollar fire festival classes located a West how does he get dismissed like he didn't know he gave it away he probably didn't have anything to do with the business aspect of it he's a fuckin rapper right you probably got together with that dude think of the fat dude lied to him he thought the guy was telling them the truth next thing you know he's involved in a lawsuit and give the people the think of the people that day of fire festival this is my favorite part of the documentary when they know that it's never gonna work right they know that's an interesting there they know that it's all over and then the people are hitting the island that day she imagine thinking your first promotion what is your first person you do a theater gonna try to fill a small theater no no my first one I'm gonna do an island island private I'll have people fly in and I'm gonna feed them baloney sandwiches on white style people with supreme charts are gonna come in and eat Katrina food wild wild country no what is that is that the sex cult yeah yeah I've been told by multiple people to see that watch that I gotta get in I think that fire festivals cringy if that was bad she's gonna be like what is happening yeah yeah yeah it's like six episodes is next six for something like is it one of those ones by the end you can't feel bad for the people like oh you feel bad I feel bad about cults cuz I've been a moron most of my life you know I've never got roped into a cult but I've been lucky me nice parents yeah you know I've been lucky I grew up in a pretty nice neighborhood you never like God like you never look cuz every now and then I look at the Scientology building and go huh oh I did when I moved here yeah now sometimes I go what's that when I moved here I bought a Dianetics book on you know the TV app yeah yeah I didn't know what it meant know what it was you were curious help I had Anthony Bourdain's not 14 Anthony Robbins I had all of his all that fucking he's great your shit together Cosette yeah yeah shit together I was always trying to get my shit together so you just dine out and did you read it it was and we like yeses I ordered the book I got the book in the mail and like most of those books back then I would read them like four or five times to pick it up read it for ten minutes Mike what am i doing and I put it down like maybe I went through a whole chapter maybe right best-case scenario most of time I just say I'm like this isn't working for me I wasn't I wasn't wasn't disciplined like I was scatterbrained and so I was always looking for something back then when I was in my 20s well yeah something to give me this that's a lot of people in LA - a lot of people come to LA looking for something to fill a void in Alaia cults thrive here now if you grew up the thing is if you grew up in an orthodox religion in a religion that's like very rigid and you trust in them even if it doesn't make any sense like I know a lady who did that where she grew up in the Mormons and then she got out of the Mormons and once she got out it was really hard for her to tell if people were full of shit she felt like she was it was too easy to dupe her or she'd get taken in by cult people taken in by spiritual people taking him by kook's just put that yeah or out there that well she just was not aware of bullshit where she believed such crazy bullshit for so long like if you're willing to be that Joseph Smith found golden tablets that contain the law stories matching underwear and only I could read it because he has a magic seer stone and then when the people came to read them the English took him away because that God was didn't believe you've trusted him right nuts that the the Native Americans were a Lost Tribe of Israel right if you're gonna do that why not throw yeah why not believe any Xenu and so if I grew up like that I would be like that that's the that's the insidious part about cults like I got real lucky my parents you know my my stepdads a hippie my parents were kind of hippies when I was a kid we got a chance to see all different parts of the country Sam Francisco Florida Boston but I never got roped in any religion all right caught but if I was there they took me in when I was six or seven you chant me I would I wouldn't have figured it out or I wouldn't have stuck I would get stuck most of us would he got stuck yeah most of us if we were young and impressionable it's interesting I was a part of our community I get roped into it I know people that came out of you know really religious upbringing exhibit does it's interesting it does something you know some of those people are a lot of those people happen to be very trusting when they get out of those it's interesting you'd say to me yeah you'd think they'd be more skeptical but they're actually very trusting when they get out of those things it's a weird thing man yeah think about getting roped into a cult yeah you're a young person you've been targeted to well I know quite a few people that have had those kind of experience when they're younger too you ever talked to Metzger yeah I mean Kurt was it was a Jehovah's Witness yeah yeah his story's crazed it's a wild story it's it's all these wacky different ideologies there's so many of them yeah you know and I love that his mama's in sales that's what me and him talk about I was a sales guy and that's its own that's another call mmm oh yeah so getting in that so me and him always talked about that like that is also like really good salespeople must be really good at picking up checks they're really good at everything I mean they're really good at arranging the world in a way that allows them to and I think a lot of good salespeople the ones that I've observed they don't overthink mm they they don't they if there's a simplicity to what a good sale is I'm sure that you can write about it make it more complex but at the end of the day there's just a a a it's like our lizard brains there's something that happens like on a subterranean level where you walk in with with a certain amount of confidence and you know all of those hack lines in sales work mmm like hack comedy sometimes work hack sales lines work once I'm all right so if I can do this in this does that make sense that makes sense to you and you say it like when I was first telemarketing and selling mortgages and stuff I would say I can't sell that and I can't say just on the phone people gonna laugh at me right if I say like if I say something patently ridiculous like listen you if I don't help you I don't need so let's just you know I believe people gonna laugh at me like this guy's ridiculous but people like okay Wow yeah I'm like really I was also selling them in Long Island but the point is they those things work like those somewhat formulaic trappings work a little psychological trap yeah B sales is a business of imitation people team that's a lot of comedy as well a lot of it yeah I think on the until you get really good at it and I can either innovate or you really find what you're doing but even like with sales it's like a personality driven thing like you're trying to get this person to like you enough and also enjoy the product up so you're trying to hype them up about it yeah you got to show a certain amount of enthusiasm itself so it's contagious they gotta like yeah yeah someone who's a good salesman will talk to you about certain objects with such enthusiasm that you don't get more hype than I about the I was always so bad that I wouldn't shut up so I wouldn't shut up and a bad salesman just keeps going yeah and they hard to know that when a good salesman can turn it on and not like you might be a bullshit customer they don't want to give you the a game right well I I would just talk I would get to the you know there's a moment in every sale where you're supposed to leave it all on the table not speak yeah and then whoever speaks first kind of loses that's like a tried and true sales method so I'm like Joe if I could do this you know Wednesday whatever at this price is that work and then we just silent and then neither one of us is supposed to talk you're supposed to talk first and then you're you're supposed to submit and you know we're supposed to do the deal but I would like just go right back and I think there's more we can do and then the guy was like oh this guy's a clown yeah yeah I mean it was it was something I was not meant to do yeah you can't you can't really I think those guys are really good at that it's your you given an indication that you should do it but I was around a lot of bad salesmen and those that's it's just like bad guy it's very sad it's a weird thing right because you're you're basically a charisma person right like you're trying to smooth some like you shouldn't have to have a sales person should be like this is the price on that right you want it yeah okay if you want it go talk to that guy and you can get it yeah but no guys like sir can I help you welcome to Mercedes well yeah you know what I see you in this car I've seen this cartoon villain oh my god the convertible laughs the one button look at that phone dude you're driving the skies overhead you're the king of the world yeah I guarantee the way you'll feel hyped up yes car it's gonna make you kick ass in the office yeah but see I'd be so bad then welcome a lot I'd be like do you like cars like that's how fucked I was I tried to sell copiers mortgages and sales guys are not guys who went to school these are guys that are gonna work around the system and become millionaires right that's the way that we believe so we don't know anything about structural organization or right we're just thrown it at the wall like a lot of comics like a lot of color a lot of comics you throw it at the wall and I on one of those people I'm guilty that sometimes - I'm like I threw it at the wall Oh special if you don't have a lot of sets like what if you only doing three sets of yeah but when you when you tell us like the the work ethic when you're like in the car and you listen back you do two hours you listen back to the thing it's like we're all just like okay well yeah this like especially as you get older like me and you run out of like I have to make these fucking premises work and I'm doing a new special like every couple of years like you can't fuck around a heavy workload you've gotta you gotta get that shit out there and you got it you gotta tighten up those bits with the most like focus that you can get go on that stage in the store and you turn the lights off there's no crowd work there's no you just you just you just you let it's like you're doing special every night I'm just trying to tighten up these bits I know and adding to them and taking away from them and fucking with them and it's the only way yeah I've done it other ways I've done it half-ass before where I only did a few sets a week and I recorded special one wasn't that good and I've done it where I really hustled and it's always better and I think you know I think I think it's like a thing where you just gotta kind of stay on it and then know like okay I think I got something here you gotta know what are you what do you look at you look at crowd work cuz every now and then if I do bidding doesn't really work sometimes they'll try to crowd work the audience back to being on my side and then try the next bit is that cheating no it's never treating it's never cheating I mean there's nothing wrong with crowd work crowd work is great right some great comics are great at crowd work right it's just I feel like every comic owes it to themselves to have material - of course of course there's some guys that know developed material yeah that's why I only had a crowd work act right yeah but it's look they can still work but that seems like so crazy now you want to say what you're about and tell your jokes it's a different thing too it's like it's a fun thing we work the crowd but you never get a well-crafted well honed bit natty we're real proud nothing works again like a crowd work there's no legs sometimes I'll try the next night to reference something that happened that I thought was funny and if it's not in the moment it doesn't work it doesn't work yeah it's crazy gig bro we got the craziest gig ever it's crazy except logan paul and ksi it's a crazy okay but our gig is weird because no one can teach you how to do it someone could teach at a box that's true yeah learn how to counter now you have to figure it out on your own it's you can vary your approach so much in boxing only so much but in comedy do you think people getting in a stand-up now because of the way the things are everything's social media-driven do you think that we're in the last era of like that traditional type of stand-up we're live now people say it's like martial arts people are gonna get better at it they're gonna want to do it but still want to do yeah it's like people this people still doing jiu-jitsu we're always gonna do it's not it's it's not ever easy right it's never easy to do jiu-jitsu now you're trying to kill you they're fucking grabbing your arm driving you're always sore but people are gonna keep doing it most people are not gonna do it this is the same thing with stand-up all the way more people are doing jiu-jitsu than doing stand-up you know most people can do it cuz you don't have to have a certain personality like you do in standup yeah but if you could just put the time in you put the time in you know if you're a reasonably funny person and you start doing it and you put the time in and you're a driven person you realize you can keep getting better if you keep paying attention to it you're gonna get addicted that's what happens you do get addicted what's your telling nothing is more fun than killing when you especially like your two years in you just sorta yeah try to figure it out yet and every now and then you got one just starting to get paid doing gigs wherever you can you're driving around with your friends there's nothing funner I look back at those days I'm so lucky that I'm still good friends with Gregg's Greg Fitzsimmons yeah I almost forgot his name Greg I almost fucked up his name but we we started out like within a week of each other yeah yeah so we knew each other forever and Boston yeah yeah we've got a shitload of terrible gigs together it's hilarious we yeah I forget about some of them sometimes and he tells me about him and yeah I'll tell him about one that he forgot oh wow yeah yeah look back horrible bro and this is all 1988-1989 Wow 1990 so you've seen dish to the whole you know explosions and you know the bomb booms and busts in the whole thing dude I got so lucky it's like I was on a video game yeah and the video game led me to like challenges in a very unusual spot like I got so lucky that I walked in to Boston right at the cresting of the wave of the comedy boom I got here right before it hit the peak and then I hit the peak while I was there and then dropped off right dropped off and then I left I left it right at the right time not that it's not a great time to be at route right now but back then there was three comedy clubs on one block there was Nick's comedy stopped and there was a comedy connection on the same street and they loved it was a comedy stuff the comedy comedy what would he call it the comedy club at the Charles Playhouse yeah that's that's what it was and still some people in the world are from that area embossed and then over here right across the street was a place called Duck Soup so they're all four of them within walking distance three of them on one blog yeah and then there was a dick Daugherty's comedy vault there was an old bank vault that was like a block away from that yes he could just bounce around and dude it was fucking crazy and these guys were murderers what made you want to do it initially like what was the thing that made you want to do it well I definitely didn't know if I could do it until I went to an open mic night but I had friends that had talked me into doing it okay guys that I worked out with I thought it was funny but I was saying do they think they thought you were maybe gonna go bomb or no no like you're funny as a young kid I was 20 you know yes time 21 when I first started doing stand-up but 21 I was thinking about it and I was just I just wanted a lot of attention and so I would say funny things when I knew that everybody was nervous right and so right before sparring was a big one everybody be real nervous cuz we were sparring this part it was hardcore man right a bunch of dudes like as good as me or better or kicking each other there's like woo dangerous we started I knocked that was scary you scared the shit out of you like sparring sparring scary and I want to make fun of things when we'd go to tournaments I'd make fun of people I'd make fun of myself I'd make fun of each other I do impressions of my friends having sex right this is what I think you sound like everybody be laughing but I was just trying to make them laugh right but I didn't think oh I'm gonna be a comedian my friend Steve Graham oh I'm still good friends with this day was it one who told me you should be a fucking comedian I was crazy yeah and you and if so what's the first open mic night that you walk into artist twenty seventh nineteen eighty eight stitches comedy club it's this little comedy club still there no it's not there anymore it was like Massachusetts to another place that was like larger I can't remember the name of the other place but the other place was that was next to it that was really pretty big next two stitches fucker which remember was like a rock club and they occasionally have big acts there and I went to see Jerry Seinfeld there Wow with this chick I was dating when I was like 19 it's 88 yeah this was this note this is even before that I went to see Jerry Seinfeld there before ever did comedy I went to see Jerry Seinfeld I was maybe maybe 20 like maybe somewhere around there and how does that first set go it's my first full yeah it was Terra's my first it was okay but was in like a coffee house who cares that barely counts it was you were in an actual Club I was in an actual job actual open mic night real you know I felt real weird weird hear your voice on a microphone for the first time yeah barely got laughs got a couple ha ha ha ha oh your friends Darren yeah yeah a bunch bunch of my friends guys that I'm still friends with shout-out to Jimmy to tell you and Jimmy lawless those guys were there um some other people that I went to high school with were there and it was terrible it was what they were you'll see a guy young guy whose family's in the audience and then they'll go up and just have a real rough time can happen you shouldn't bring your whole family was a stupid move my part I've done it I didn't want to drink before I went onstage yeah one thing I did make a decision I said look if I have a drink right now before I go on stage and probably didn't want one every time I go on stage it's true cuz this is like right when I started legally drinking right cuz I had turned 21 on August 11th and this was August 27th so it's just a few weeks it's a couple weeks right it was one of those precedents I was thinking wow I was very aware of those like just go up there cuz I was so scared I was I was hoping that they didn't call my name there's nothing like the fear right before that first time that's a lot of fear dude I had fought so many times right I don't even know how many times for years and years travel all over the place kicking people in the face getting kicked and I did that all the time that didn't scare me as much as going on stage that first time I was shitting my pants but once I did it once as it alleviated a lot of that and it became less and less like after you did it did you feel its daughter was only still nervous well you like I'm gonna do this again yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought immediately this was what I'm gonna do like immediately I've never had a voice in my head ever but that time I did that time I did I was about to chicken out and I heard a voice in my head say no this is what you're supposed to do now clearly I think that's my imagination and clearly I think it's probably me knowing that I was gonna be a pussy so come on it's stupid so was probably talking to myself right inside my head but dude it felt real yeah I felt like a voice was telling me don't be a pussy this is what you're supposed to do come on just do it I think a lot of people have this what you're supposed to do I think a lot of people have that I think I wanted the first time I did I said maybe I should do it in a week maybe I'll be more prepared in a week maybe I'll push it off but then you just call I gotta just do it well the host of my first open mic night was Jonathan Katz oh yeah dr. Katz yeah famous Boston comic great guy and he I put my name in for the list but there's a lot of people on the list and he wasn't sure when I was gonna get on and sometimes people would sign up then they would chicken out right so I'm in this position where he's like I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to get you up so give me a couple minutes and I'll know for sure so during those couple minutes I was thinking I should just say fuck this I'm getting out of here right I'm shitting my pants right and then he came back and then I had that thought that said knows what you're supposed to do come on and you got in there then he goes oh hey I'm gonna be able to get you up yeah that's always the word and that's the word that's happened to me where it's like they come up to you and you're almost waiting you're ready for him to go we can't do it tonight it's great don't worry about you but he goes no no you're good you're on next fuck yeah I think I had one or two people in front of me everybody's doing five minutes one or two people in front of me where I could just relax but it was amazing you know it's like it allowed me to get my feet wet it allowed me to move my feet and I and it was also the first time I'd ever been I'm first I had never seen like legitimate professional stand-ups performing in a club like that right like in those environments with amateurs like the first time I ever saw like the stark difference between a guy like me and there was this guy Teddy Bergeron who's another Boston legend yeah fucking animal he was so fly and the there was a couple other guys would stop by those open mic nights back in those days like pros like little girls they'd do five ten minutes just works a material out stay sharp there was always everyone was staying sharp yeah you know you got to watch that was a first time I got to watch that you have to see that you're like holy shit but you can get to this level yeah like you see like a real pro all smooth yeah I think murdering seem do that same joke again and again and again yeah break down the mechanics now and you say okay I get how he's doing it yeah yeah that's a cool thing about the store as well it's great yeah we all get to watch each other work and everybody's you know Tony rock is different than Jeselnik has different the news death and Joey Diaz right everybody's got their own style everybody has your own so Joey Diaz the other night in the original room just he was like it was like no one I'd rarely seen sets like that where it was like he was just so fucking in a zone yeah then it was like you for that ten minutes nobody was on the planet anymore nobody was in the you know was just like everybody had been elevated to somewhere else was wild watch he goes happy I was not after him yeah very happy I was not suppose to people I but then then it's like well I'm gonna go I'm gonna go at from one day not tonight yeah one day not tonight us in the back that's it he's a tough guy going tough do you used to bring him to open all the toys and one times I ate shit New Jersey yeah hate shit and Rascals going after him yeah he was loose as fuck and when I say I pulled it off but not right you know I mean like I didn't didn't get booed off the stage but I know it wasn't very good and he fucking murdered and I remember it something happened in the crowd he's fucking with them and was crate it was just crazy there was a wild crowd and I was stiff you know it's back then I was just that's my biggest problem is when I feel stiff on stage and I feel like I'm not in a groove yeah I'm like I got it this is a problem yeah it's hard target break out of that sometimes and back then I was terrible at it I just said yeah and that but I thought to myself like taking him on the road with me is a great exercise it's like bringing a training partner with you that can definitely strangle you yeah so you're forced to really up your game yeah if you're working with Joey Diaz you can't a lot of the great you have a lot of really good comics great comics bring openers that are there you know good I think that's the move yeah because I've seen guys do the opposite and they do it on purpose they do it they think that what they're gonna do is they're gonna give people like shitty comic for like 15-20 minutes and then they're gonna go on after them and look like a hero right I just don't I don't think that's the way to go now it's it's also it doesn't help anybody because the shitty comics the reality is a lot of people that are really really shitty they're not gonna get much better it's to hit the ceiling yeah I mean it's occasionally people do you can never say never some people just figure things out some people have you know that you start meditating they fucking turn it around they turned around they gotta give themselves out they mature maybe they get their heart broken maybe they become a parent that's - small minority yes small minority I mean it's a small minority of any of us that make it but out of all of us that do make it to a professional status the ones that are like really terrible in the beginning are rarely capable of yeah progressing that's the one thing to understate like really shocked me is the amount of people that go from amateur to professional in this it is a tiny fraction it's a tiny fraction it's a tiny fraction of people that go from open mic nights to headlining at the improv yeah it's a super super super small fraction and it's not that they're not capable of it either because sometimes people just a little wrong Zig or a little wrong zag and then they go off the track and then they don't come back you also have like getting kicked in the face a little because you're kind of I mean you're gonna have those times when things are not good and you know you have to deal with that yes yes like I remember one guy looked at me once he had a really rough shot and II ended up quitting like two weeks later but he looked at me you could see it in his face he goes this wasn't fun and you could see he was internalizing that in a way that was gonna lead him eventually to the exit door I think sometimes that just you know it's the pain of the bombing it's just like you're not equipped for it right you know it's at different points of your life you're equipped for different kinds of pain right and sometimes the pain of that rejection of bombing it's just you're already an emotional mess and you're already so fucking barely hanging on you know you're so fragile yeah and that that hits you that pushes you pushes you off the ledge and sometimes people aren't they're not equipped to handle the killing oh yeah that yeah the other side yeah people get like legitimate fear of success right the pressure of the unknown is fucking scary it's scary like you'd rather know that you're not going to make it right rather know you rather - lovey Lou yeah because if you fail you if you succeed you can fail yeah like if you take the real risk you can that's why I like a lot of people don't move to New York or LA because that's you can fail yeah in a real way this if there's a bunch of fears right there's a fear of keeping up with people's expectations like when a comic starts to develop a fanbase you see that sometimes they get scared yeah they get scared these people gonna like not like them some would turn on them yeah or turn on them yeah you know people sense that - yeah they know they know when you say no that they own you they control you yeah yeah it's um we've all seen guys go bunk I honestly think people use to grow more bonkers back in the day when they got development deals yeah they were just handed hundreds of thousands of dollars millions of dollars not only that but everybody had like some crazy story about the show definitely he's gonna go and already picked up by Universal and they have a 1 million dollar backup deal and Warner Brothers is really interested in right dude you'd have these conversations with these people and back in the deal days you would say to a comic like hey man what's up he's like hey well everything's real good right now Warner Brothers picked up my pilot and I'm in the middle of this process where I'm taking my life story and gonna turn into a cartoon right yeah well I just want to say first he goes you know you used to do a 5-7 minute set at The Improv and if you killed there was a chance somebody in the back and a bag of money sometimes sometimes sometimes definitely festivals were big for that right 90s if you could kill at Montreal you could get some sort of a deal if you kill you know in front of all those executives that are on vacation Montreal was a big one that was huge a big when I did at my agent bought me at lunch that's good I did great that's where it's worth lunch now but that's what it's you get you killed at a great set and they go anywhere you want which it wasn't it was where they wanted but it was still fine but the development of a meat sandwich what would happen with the development deal thing would be you would get a deal and then you'd be convinced your show was going to go and then you started acting like you're famous and there was a lot of that that's now people do that after damn one Conant said that no one watched a lot of that well yeah my agent at the time would get she had clients that would you know they would just run up to her and just any moment want to discuss their career like in depth like at the Laugh Factory you know phone calls at 1:00 o'clock in the morning like people are nuts and they started demanding that you treat them like the up-and-coming star that they know they are and shit ton of them just went away man and a lot of that and it was just people they were like this it's all happening and they just let it get to their head well but and then if you're the head of a show like you know I talked to Roseanne about it she was talking about how she went fucking bonkers yeah when she was running her original show and was making all that fucking like out of nowhere right you know this one of the reasons why I worked so hard to like get her comfortable and talk to her that show and get her to open up about who she really is most people don't even know the story about her getting hit in the head by a car when she's 15 spending nine months and a mental health it's crazy like that's what she is man she's like a legit head injury yeah head trauma victim and a brilliant comic and one of the best comics ever right but people need to understand like you got if you guys really respect mental health right like you say you do if you're really compassionate like you say you are this is not a bad person she's not a bad person she's a person who was hit by a fucking car yeah and she's 15 and brained and she lost her ability to count yeah I couldn't do math anymore yeah she has challenges other people don't but it's you know a lot of these people you know what Shane Gillis do you know these the same thing I want to know these are the same people that are like talk about mental health all day and then they're tweeting this kid every single two minutes that yeah you know he should be enough thrown out of a window it's like you know no you don't know any of these people personally right and the idea that you could just wield this online mob is and then the next day be like hey self-care is important I know it's crazy it's so hypocritical but it's also like what we were talking about earlier about people leaving comments on your YouTube yeah whatever it's like I get it yes yeah I get it yeah no I don't think it helps to go back and forth with people I think it just inflames people right but I do get where they're coming from just like I get the people that are hating on Shane Gillis right get the people that went after Roseanne that we people see you limping man they start kicking you yeah that's it's a normal part of being a person yeah we've all seen it you know we've all seen one of the uglier components of our nature dude world star hip hop's got some of the best examples of all time holy shit one guy gets punched he goes out cold and everybody starts kicking them yeah wow dude it's rough yeah I've seen a bunch of those all right bunch yeah yeah it's weird it's a part of being a person you know and mob mentality is fucking real it's real in person if you've ever experienced it I've been in a couple of situations before where it just felt like anything could break out at any moment and things got wild last one was at the Conor McGregor fight okay when Conor McGregor fought khabib nurmagomedov and then Eve jumped out of the Octagon and had a street fight with Dylan Danis and people are flying into the Octagon jumping over the top punching Conor in the face and it was one of those feelings like holy shit anything can go on right now and I'm still broadcast pure chaos yeah but there's a feeling in the air and then if it did go crazy people would be swinging everybody'd be swinging be brawling with each other for no fucking reason people just look at you and try to punch me but what the fuck is this things just go haywire right sometimes things go haywire and I think there's a built-in part of being a person that recognizes when things are off the rails and you go off with them right you know what I mean and I think that's what the mob mentality interesting because you're just scared of being alone no matter what it is you're scared of being alone you'd rather be in the chaos with others have you ever talked to Jimmy kill Steen not a little bit yeah I know he follows me on Twitter as it he's a nice guy a nice guy he was a super-duper social justice warrior right and they turned on him right and you know he realized like oh my god this is what I was doing and he realized that he would go after people just to like get this charge of seeing people respond you know dopamine Rock a politician or an actor and call someone a bigot or call someone a pedophile or whatever the fun ever it is but I mean I don't think did that but whatever you wanted to call us what you just you're just trying to press a button and then the things coming back at ya and get addicted to it yeah this game yeah and we're all doing it yeah all doing it and what we need is not that there's anything wrong with it I don't think is anything wrong with using Twitter and Instagram or any of these things don't get me wrong but I think we gotta spend more time just talking to regular people I think a race is slowly getting sucked into the machines do you think that maybe the next generation will be like Luddites or do you know they'll be anti-technology or they'll at least know no there's no shot right there's no chance that the wave will recede a little bit and that people will recognize this I don't think so I think a few people screaming out while of the herd of us is running towards a cliff yeah my friend my friend Jesse Reid who's a very funny comic her mother was saying you know you she has daughters she goes you know you let the kids on the phones too much she goes mom and ten years they're gonna be the phone yeah she was like the phone's gonna be inside of them soon yeah so it's like wow what am i fighting you know what am i fighting when I limit my kids time on the phones except the older ones of course do you like I just don't think that it's you can't yes I just don't think it's a challenge that we ever face are they allowed to watch in force oh thank god they were projected what else is the the keys screen time screen times a big key yeah tell her about epsteen epsteen didn't kill himself that's big before they start googling yes I got it now they got it now it fuck's up your sleep when your honor I fall asleep to a podcast you're gonna let all this up I used to fall asleep too Alex I would listen to Alex's clips on YouTube and I would fall asleep too just ladies you know and I would be able to put me asleep you know I think his best video is to this day he's the retainers of our time you got a boat but you got a watch on when I first met him yeah he wasn't people see today and I see n the I was shown that he is today is changing because of his not being not drinking he's in oh yeah interesting decks he's clean $4.99 interesting sounds different but what I'm thinking is when I first saw like 9/11 road to tyranny was one of the first videos I've ever watched I was like whoa like it's one of the first videos that ever opened my eyes up to certain conspiracies and one of them was the conspiracies of using agent provocateurs to incite violence yeah in riots yeah to incite that feeling of chaos yeah and then that they used as an excuse for the police to come in and start arresting people because now it's no longer a peaceful protest and it's they do it all so he was making this argument about the World Trade Organization yeah WTO yeah yeah and so he showed all this videos of these guys coming in with government-issue work boots on they have like fucking the same soles is like government-issued work boots they're wearing ski masks breaking buildings light and shit on fire smashing everything and then the cops come in and clean everybody up and then they actually made it a no protest zone interest so you a guy went through or a woman I forget which but had a pin with a WTO on that with a red line on it they told me how to take that pin off yeah the the America yeah well it's just every every protest resistance movement has been infiltrated the FBI did a coin tell Pro they did it with you know the Black Panthers they've just done it with every man who plays that video and you see that and it's like real clear and then you hear the how it all played out that all the agent provocateurs wound up going to a safe house and then the police released them that's right they ago she ate with the police the police release them wait a minute what yeah are you there's not even arrests made it's probably somebody's job in the FBI to dye their hair pink like go into Portland and start throwing rocks at ben shapiro back then they were just allowed to wear ski masks and shit ready just start smashing shit and yeah I don't even know who they were yeah and you just assumed that that was good it's such a crazy way to stop a protest and I never thought about it until i watch smart way to when you think you know it's these guys know what they're doing but they've been doing that kind of shit forever yeah that's like standard operational procedure 100% fucking this is a weird time for conspiracies it's weird they've gone mainstream which is not good it's very dangerous bumps into a lot of them he's into a lot of them and I think there's not a huge there's only a small group of people that want a rational discussion about them right people really just want to be emotionally fed does this feel right to me and there's a I had a guy call me today it's a very smart guy who wrote the Franklin scandal which is a book about the original epstein thing like the original sex trafficking thing what's that well the Franklin scandal was a it was a scandal out of Omaha Nebraska the frankly credit union where there was a guy who was embezzling money and then he was being investigated for that but they said he's all he has all this money because he's running an interstate pedophile Network and he's pandering kids too you know people in Washington DC in New York and there was a headline in the Washington Post of the Washington Times that were like coal boys get a tour of the Reagan White House and you know this was a scandal with real victims who wanted to testify and then people started dying you know the private investigator they hired his plane broke up one of the girls that testified was found guilty of perjury and then she was put in solitary confinement they had to use two grand juries in Omaha to get rid of this scandal and it's one now it's not as sexy as like a pizza gate or something because it's happened the 80s and 90s but this shows you the blueprint for the government you know using marshaling resources to to silence people that were victims of this stuff this is not new congressmen senators blackmail being used by intelligence agency's none of its new it was pioneered by the Mafia you know intelligence a Whitney Webb who lives in Chile and I've had around my show she writes a lot about this stuff you know this is you know if you want people to talk you need info you need leverage yeah there's nothing there's no more leverage than you having sex with somebody who's underage then they own you forever if they have photo audio video of you doing that so these things have been going on for a while in Franklin scandals one of the first but you know the guy who wrote it this guy Nick Bryant called me the name he goes I can't get any agents it's very hard because like you know the reality is mainstream media is uninterested in in in a lot of these stories unless they're current and they're sexy and online fringe people are only interested if they're insane well there's so many of y'all though too yes so many it's hard to keep track you you was just saying that you were just in Dallas did you get Drive did you do the I didn't do the drive but I went to where he was shot there was five Canadians there and they were like I was just started giving them an impromptu tour of Dallas because they were like is this where Kennedy got what and I'm like yeah this is how it happened how many people you think of stood there well it does right yeah I thought I wanted to do it yeah there is there it is I wanted to do with a Popeye's chicken sandwich and just write you know this is America says this is where Princess Diana was killed yeah how's that fun is that really where Kennedy was killed that's exactly where he was shot that's exactly where and how cryptic is that angry you look yeah crazy well I'm just trying to have a little fun I understand it's a weird thing too it's I know but then you go to the school book depository and it is super close it could have happened oh for sure listen everybody who says there's no way he could have made those shots is out of their fucking mind that's not that far that is not the thing that makes me think it's a conspiracy it's literally everything else yeah it's every other component of the store yeah there's Oswald being shot immediately yes I mean that's Oswald sure surely could have been in on it of course yes he could course he could have definitely been in on or he could have definitely been set up I notice like those things are possible in Dallas is an interesting energy because of that yeah it's a great city but it does feel like it feels like a city of thing people to keep their mouths shut mm-hmm a lot of big for steakhouses pie in hotels a lot of people carving up you know deals you know it just feels like you know something's going on yeah there it is there it is so that's where he is and that's the building up there see that's not that far it can happen I think they said it's just like a hundred and fifty yards or something like that it's not when you're actually there it looks even closer than this yeah how many yards was it Jamie find out how many yards Oswald had to shoot to hit Kennedy but it's totally doable and people that say that's not you're crazy they're not some people that say that you can't uh uh like load a gun that fast maybe you can't I bet you someone can do it faster than you yeah I've seen guys use bolt-action rifles fast as fuck yeah could they get off three shots in that amount of time I don't know but I'm not I don't think it's magic I don't think it's like something impossible the other thing they said was like that the scope was off like anybody said that doesn't a shit about scopes all I ever do is handle it a little bit drop it bang it against things it was the idea that that guy was killed immediately and then obviously I've read a book a couple of books on it but the idea that he gets killed immediately yeah that's where you go something's yeah oh yeah something just completely 183 metres is what I just found 183 meters what is that you noticed about 200 yards isn't what this says I don't know if this is accurate our measurement was that that's why I just found that's interesting this is about much of a disparity this is it was never more than 90 yards from from the Boswell's supposed to the location so there's a lot I mean okay so where he went when he got the final shot was that far it was 200 yards no that doesn't make any sense he was never more than 90 yards from Oswald location how's that work to separate I didn't know that a hundred and eighty-three meters was 200 yards that's crazy yeah a meter is pretty close to a yard yes pretty straight but that's why I thought it would be like 185 or something like that there's actually a formula for doing that for converting meters to yards you add one of the last numbers or some shit it's it's a it's an interesting thing because it really is you know Christopher Hitchens said that the Kennedy assassination was the movement that the that moment was the psychic movement of the 60 started like that was the fracturing of reality for a lot of people in the same way that maybe Epstein was where it just kind of no presidents got to be way bigger it's huge it was huge it was this big thing that you know it was a traumatic event that people dealt with in a bunch of different ways no one's sitting around going do you remember where you were you don't have the friends I do a lot of people on reddit saying that but it's like 9/11 of course almost yeah you know sim yeah like those are the events unless you knew somebody in 9/11 yeah it's probably bigger do you think it's possible that down the road not that the government like did it but that they we find out that there was a substantial cover-up you know we didn't know about Saudi Arabia their involvement for a while there's it for 9/11 yeah do you think it's possible that we just you don't know the whole story let's totally possible I don't I don't have any idea what was being done or who was involved and yeah I know that there was a bunch of hijackers and they flew planes into those buildings but who was behind that who the fuck knows yeah how would we know okay a question what part of you know what part of Saudi Arabia where they all came from a cool where'd they get their orders from like had they organized this yeah I think they know a certain amount and I think a certain amount they'll probably never know yeah and we'll all go to our death not knowing what do you think about that one that got shot down they've shot that let's roll one yep yeah they shot that down yeah you know yeah they said that thing the the flight the the rubbish the wreckage was scattered for miles yeah I mean there's there's no way they didn't shut it but there's a lot of things about that day where you look back at it and you go this is just weird yeah it's weird that a building fell that was it hit by anything it's just weird I'm not saying it can't happen but that's odd it's definitely odd that's the way the way it looks is odd it looks like a controlled demolition but yeah if you watch the full version there's a guy who used to be like a full-on 9/11 truther and then he started like Tennessee I attention yeah I start just paying attention to the flaws and his way of thinking sure and one of the things that he found out was that the version of Tower 7 that most people see is a version that's very quick it's just it implodes and it just falls down but for a minute before that you can watch the center of the thing collapse inside of it I'll interested in the way have you ever seen never I've never seen that version pull up can we see that one yeah it's very interesting full version of Tower 7 collapsing yeah somebody's fine one day so crazy they left there were no buildings it's all Holograms there were no plans New York you know I mean it's great snots yeah but I want to see the uncut building seven Jews maybe a plane hit the Pentagon it's I mean well okay but just released I just want to see one video of it happening right just show me one video do you think they have a video there's somewhere on the panic just show me one video what happened eyes they're wobbly over plane hitting the Pentagon there's one but it's very weird the frames every weird yeah that's weird I just showed me the video I want to believe they might hit the Pentagon the rover on the fucking moon is taking beautiful video you imagine if you have some shit that's like a thousand times worse than a yeah like one of them doorbell cameras yeah I got a thousand times worth viewing the yeah damn they're putting it together from cell phone cameras I get I understand it that was technology was different just show me a video of a plane hitting depending on I'm good I'm with you what do you think it could be a missile I don't know but I just want to know why we just there's no one video we gotta see yeah isn't that crazy why am I crazy for saying can I just see one video of the thing happening that you said happened well did you know that maybe this is not true in Jimmy's gonna be checking this one out soon the area in the Pentagon that got hit was refortified was the same area where they were doing the accounting yeah where they were trying to figure out where the trillion dollars is missing that was filled was talking about camera just that I think the day before right yeah it's an interesting situation did he say that there's like missing money yeah later I wasn't what I feel like out on the lawn like these peers what are they doing I just do you're not as a bunker you're out on the lawn I don't know what happened me listen it was something crazy like trillions of dollars four point three the two point three trillion Oh Mike I mean you know and so the next day to see if that's true that that area of the pentagon that held the accounting I don't think they tell you what you see if you see if you can google the area of the Pentagon that was hit contained the accounting offices I don't do that the double have it you're like I read that though III know the I understand your suspicion but I just like you know I'm trying to lie or you're building 7 had a lot of financial records in oh that's that's what I heard I don't know all the satellite dishes that were pointed out the way I look at conspiracy I don't want to believe in any of them right that's the whole thing like I want there to be a plane hit dependent I want I want it all to be what it is i-i've know best we know that a bunch of elites were going to an island to have sex with underage they could do whatever they don't we also know like hey how much of this is true like this like this is a wacky one yeah this is one that have you told your mom yeah ten years ago she'd be like Timmy you're back on the drugs yeah you would yeah the fuck is wrong with you no one's going to an island to fuck kids right but it's the same thing it's like now that that's on the table you look at other events and you're like well we don't know necessarily how all of these things happen no we don't know we don't know we don't know we just have to go there's a listeners conservative firefight like fire companies from Queens right from out by Long Island that like because they've gotten sick and stuff have demanded like a new investigation and these are not like crazy people these are people that just go listen we're all dying from first responders and things we just you know we want to know exactly what the hell we breathe in and what the hell's going on well it's all the burning chemicals from the basement of the building right was nothing yes fires burned forever yes that's what it is those guys got so many of them got sick so many of them got cancer is horrible it's horrific it's really it's really fucked Donna summers died from that Donna Summer the disco person uh well I don't really care about that I'm hot stop I'm don't what how dare I like her she's amazing she's great but saving people at night alone I know she had an apartment that was near the site of the building on the summers running into the building I think you lived down there man if you have an apartment down there and you're self locked you're breathing that air man interesting she's died of lung cancer I think yeah I thought she was a smoker I don't think she was I thought she would just smoke cigarettes and you know do coke and live a fun disco love to hear you I think she found the Lord I had no idea she was a first responder after she uh you know she gave up on all that hot love she's gone through the rack edge yeah no son was not going to she was just living just living in their apartment okay I think that's the the idea of course people I'm there there are people that are probably very sick oh yeah yeah it's such and they were lied to about the risks well I don't think anybody knew that's nobody had ever had to endure an inferno in the basement of a gigantic building in the metropolitan city that lasted for weeks crazy right after planes crash all the dust is in the air all the fucking pollutants yeah particulates and everybody's breathing all that shit in I mean you got to go back to work eventually right yeah so one day I work a week later two weeks later guess what the air still fucked up yeah well I'm sorry to hear about Donna Summer yeah I'm pretty sure that's correct yeah but I'm a song a lot can we see if it can you pull up a video of Donna Summer breathing in the fumes at Ground Zero oh he's great John's beach was really good did you saw Jones Beach live she was she was older she had you know she was it was her comeback it was like the 2009 11 for lung cancer it was like mm she was coming back she released an out like a greatest hits album you and your ad blocker you son of a bitch those ad blockers yeah my dad has him too and he's always got a Donna Summer 9/11 9/11 gave me cancer well that's not a fun song is it no that's not a fun song was convinced that inhaling toxic air after 9/11 gave her the lung cancer that eventually killed her TMZ has learned source close to the singer tells TMZ what we're hearing this morning that Donna was in New York in New York City during 9/11 living at an apartment near Ground Zero Donna became almost paranoid about breathing the air which was heavy with a rancid odor got him you got to move in the months and years following 9/11 Donna's feelings intensified one source tells us that when he was around Donna she would constantly spray some sort of disinfect in the air Danny Theriot the horse host of dance fever tells us when a post 9/11 she would hang six sheets in her dressing room to prevent dust from coming in well she sounds like she did die of it and she also sounds like she was being annoying in the end she sounds like she's being a little annoying with her sheets it's a little annoying Donna um yeah I guess probably didn't have the money to move I mean I don't know you would think last dance I mean they said but yeah my dad saw her once performing in bars it was rough sometimes people just spend all that money yeah I have nothing left it's tough man it's a tough it's a marathon career well especially music and bent back then like who knows what kind of fuckin crazy contract they were under oh they were under sound yeah we're like you only get a certain percentage everybody else gets all the real Roy Taylor Swift has that right now right she's like that she's got a problem yeah someone owns the rights to her song and she's not allowed to play some songs and she was she was complaining on Twitter telling but I guess it's like someone buys the rights and that's wrong yeah it is what it is yeah like if you're an artist and I think I think it's formatted your scooter her former manager right our former manager bought all the rights to her music yeah man dirty game that's the dirtiest this is what it is now I think in all Hollywood that's the dirtiest game um is there they take a full 360 deal like they'll
