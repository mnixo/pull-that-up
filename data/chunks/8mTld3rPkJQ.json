hello freak bitches think you're totally right and the amount of discipline it'll you'll need on two fronts is great but here's the other thing you're such a here's the last one real stakes what does that mean well there is stakes man like you get you lose your beard listen you had somebody oh yeah ask you for what happened what's its BMI is it is a measurement of the height and weight yeah I said okay you have to height he's clearly lying about his height so just some fucking measures hi I'm six after you right now for enforcing negative stereotypes your voice breaking like Kevin McCallister you went to Asia for four months so at that point it became him taking this opportunity going to Denver being with Dwayne getting paid to the muscle firm thing and then the whole thing with Conor happened on the TV show before this before any of this happened Conor McGregor started calling him a coal mistake because me and Connor had one conversation we were sitting there and he goes he goes man congratulations on TJ defending his belt cuz he was so on her team his last title defense and I go thanks he goes but what's up with Dwayne saying that no one on your team wants to be champions that's weird I said oh he's just bitter cuz you know he's trying to get everyone to go out to his camp but you know he's just being a hater this and that and he goes he took that little bit of drama between me and Dwayne like Dwayne saying that no one on our team want to be champions including Kody who sent him a text tweet that said hey keep my name out of your mouth you like a jealous girlfriend or whatever and he said he took that one little thing and then next time you saw TG goes Oh this is a snake in the grass and just built it in this big thing so that crazy the how well he is so good at seeing people right yeah so that took like what really happened which was TJ got paid to go somewhere else me saying alright fine if you're gonna do that school but like you know if you're on that team you're on that team and then then Connor turn the public around on him you know because it came out later after the thing and so then TG became the victim and then he and now TJ's new stories that I I I got mad that he was training with Duane Ludwig and I kicked him off the team well you know TJ now has a snake as his logo but I know yeah we're on the Ultimate Fighter he brought in snakes you know I mean even just he's at home with it you know yeah it's cool with it so it's all good I'm weird like if you want to be friends let's be friends but don't don't don't why do you think it was a good idea to write that memo like if you had to go back again if you were in front of your computer and you ready press send would you uh maybe I would wait for my year-end bonus I I mean I think I would have pushed harder even harder on the diversity programs although like I met with them personally and I kept pinging them and I sent so many emails just trying to have a discussion about this and I went through multiple other programs and sent this document this exact document to them so it's really unclear of what I could have done differently but I mean I for example I didn't know so much about the underground conservative Network before all this and Google you mean yeah and even within Silicon Valley like there's attempts to sort of connect them between companies but there's like so much verification that you need to go through to be able to join one of these you have to have a pseudonym uh you don't need to be totally anonymous but you know you you don't want because there's active attempts to try to infiltrate these groups really yeah I this happens a lot where they'll try to join a group act as if they're one of them and then just you know record what's happening then expose them and you know you can take anything out of context and it would be shown as you know racism I'm sure well I mean think of what we've said well not you but me joking around in this conversation you could clearly take something I've said out of context and make a look at my monster but if you're in an email and you're complaining about some sort of diversity program yeah like what they often do is they will find someone that they disagree with and then they'll scour through their entire history at Google and all the emails that they've sent and try to look for some way to blacklist them or show that this person is evil therefore they should be fired it's horrible and supposedly this is happening in other companies too and they even have like these automated scripts to try to find these negative things on people that they don't like remember the Verizon green belt yeah used to be call people up sometimes you still call people up and we'll play a song yeah I guess they still have it probably why Wednesday right you still have king of rock and call okay my favorites when you had to move you have Run DMC you had for a year I am beautiful we would just be like a normal conversation with like adults and it's sullied I think it's Blair I like sometimes I'd like things and I don't like that I feel pressure not like them you know I'm like why how come I can't like that song it's a beautiful song it's is it is it too girly is that what it is Oh what's going on a lot of prejudice that's how I feel with Taylor Swift I was blaring her some new song the other day and I was at a red light as a car dealer gonna roll up my windows you go boys fuck it's weird you gotta be scared to sing things out I was playing that one see a song in here after you left one day and you came back in like your fuck man shit yeah man this I like a lot of shit that I probably shouldn't like what's your biggest latest guiltiest pleasure ished um I like Taylor Swift yeah I like her music I like I like so your team Taylor I like Justin Bieber I like his voice it's not beautiful voice couple of his songs are all right I'm dude I think kid could sing his fucking ass off I heard some people heard of that kind of music they're upset right now because Justin Timberlake is rumored or he's gonna be doing vocals on the new Foo Fighters album but he's just doing like some background mmm you won't even know it's him but his name made it out in a blog post or something this is that guy's not gonna do if this is Timberlake yeah he's smart guy he's not gonna do anything stupid kidding if he does do that he's gonna smash it he wouldn't do it if he didn't think he'd smash it worse yeah he'll just smash it yeah he's great I don't know why people shit on him he's like one of the best most talented people handsome too tall too pretty it's too rich he dances around it's too good at dancing don't like it do not like it yeah guys don't like some handsome fellow dances real good and sings his ass off fuck that so people are hating he just gets all the poison hey Luke dances fucking dancer can't like dancing too much if you're a dude but it's that same thing the same reason why you're not supposed to like that I am beautiful song it's goddamn beautiful song but you know people prefer you to be like you know Enter Sandman which is great to get its balance in this life right you want a little Ozzy Osbourne every now and then you want a little shell crawl I like a little Sheryl Crow yeah I'm hauling notes all day I can't get enough of haul notes I can't go for that I can't go for that oh no can do Halla notes old school son [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
