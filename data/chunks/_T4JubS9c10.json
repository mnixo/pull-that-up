you see this and we're back Trump's latest conspiracy yeah what is it he's I guess he's saying that there's a New York Times piece that contains a paragraph saying Trump suggested that the axis Hollywood tape wasn't real so he's like saying that never existed no you know he said well I think those are the two microphones on or something so I was at the TV was on so it's I think he said like in passing to someone like how do we even know that's real dude you know how tired he must be I'm so tired just listen just think how tired you are right just doing normal stuff doing podcast do a comedy shows you know having a girlfriend right yes tiring imagine being 70 and being the fucking president and being in a position where you're like why did I do this why did I do this he's got I mean maybe look maybe let's just give him the benefit of doubt maybe he went into this job with the best of intentions but he was just overwhelmed by conflict every step of the way he's tested in a way that his character was never tested before and all these people are mad at him but it's just hell hell on earth 70 so tired and he's getting the worst comments ever every day like this tired but here's the thing there was an article that was written not Merrick man not meaning in any way to disparage the great president of ours there was a article that was written a while back that where this guy found out that Trump had some sort of a prescription for amphetamines like way back in the day which again that words a dirty word but let's just break down what that means it's a series in a class of drugs that's a stimulant and there's a lot of people that use stimulants including me I love coffee I drink these cavemen nitros for a lot of people this might as well be a drug seriously 270 milligrams this little can 270 milligrams of caffeine so I'm no hypocrite or trying to Billy's so I'll just be honest it's nothing wrong with stimulants I enjoy coffee but that's the only one I fuck with other than that new vigil I've tried that stuff a few times and a will try it like say if I have to drive home if I'm driving home from San Francisco it's like 10 o'clock at night I know I'm not gonna get home until 3:00 in the morning 4:00 in the morning I will take one of those because it'll keep you from falling asleep that's what it's made for yes it's not apparently what I've read was that it that's what they prescribed it for but what is made for the guy and it was originally called provigil right no no that was two different ones but they're pretty much the same yeah but one of them's a new one new video and I think new vigil is a new one right and I think what they did is like there was probably some sort of I don't know one of me maybe it's an improvement or maybe it was some sort of a copyright thing or a trademark thing I'm gonna ask Jamie to Google a bunch of shit what did we start with but start with a Trump amphetamine thing yeah but here's the thing that's what a troll is folks and I know a fucking shitload of people that are on that stuff and I've talked about it at nauseam I'm sorry if I'm boring you I just just for people that have never heard me talk about this you got to get it out fun fact 19 excuse me I said I think it came from this tweet is which this guy that was contributing editor for Vanity Fair yeah Kurt I can Wald I believe is the way you say his last name I says fun fact in 1982 Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives he says abused them but that's that's his classification right only supposed to take two for 25 days stayed on for eight years really the second tweet ever the one below it says wow the White House admitted to it to me and took it for a short amount of time for a diet a diet when he was not overweight I counted with med records they cut me off people miss reading dread was drug was diethow propene 75 milligrams a day prescriptions filled at Duane Reade on 57 yeah not that I know things he gave out the fucking address of the Duane Reade where his prescribed was fulfilled yeah man I think for sure without doubt right like there's a lot of people that enjoy stuff stimulants could you see him they like just getting tan his tan on and get it taking diet pills that's how you get that's how you get ahead and this is gonna sound fucked up and it's not entirely true okay this is why it sounds fucked up because other people have done it with nothing there's people out there they're just fucking getting up early and running mountains and drinking water and kicking ass there are people like that but there's a lot of people in business in a lot of different walks of life that enjoy stimulants and I am NOT knocking them I just I want to be really clear about this this is just sort of a discussion of it I'm not knocking them maybe it's awesome I'm scared of adderall I'm scared I'd love it I've tasted it you know I mean I've had it you know what it reminded me of I tried to do it once my friend gave me one and I took half of the one and I went on stage like later and it felt like I was on coke like in a you know like if you try to do coke on before you do comedy your timings off you know you start like you're just going through your shit superfast and that's what I felt like I'm like I'm never doing that again you know and then I had it one more time like years later when I was doing something I had to stay awake and I just felt jittery like I I I didn't like it compared to like nuba Jill where you didn't have like the jitters or the the adderall type feeling a new vigil doesn't give you any of that right yeah you're just on yeah yeah it's weird but it doesn't it doesn't I don't feel like it stimulates you I feel like it just doesn't it keeps you at a level but it doesn't take any heart Jesus sounds like a new video addict so this is a thing about new vigil I had a conversation with Tim Ferriss about this you know Tim Ferriss didn't put that in one of his biohacking books specifically because he felt like if he did people would eat it like candy and I went holy shit like when a guy like Tim Ferriss extremely influential guy it spends a lot of time doing like biohacking and improvement shit like he does for that guy to say he didn't want to write about new vigil or provigil in a book because I didn't want people eating it like candy like holy shit listen to him and one of the things that he said that I thought was very portant he said there's no biological free lunch so there's got to be some sort of repercussions for taking that and maybe we won't know for 20 years right that's the thing like something's happening right you're doing something if it gets you fired up now it's not a natural thing so it's not you're taking vitamins and those vitamins like b12 or something like that stimulates you gives you energy it's not that okay so is it bad that it's not that is it bad or cash how much how many chemicals are bad and how many chemicals are okay and how do you know I mean look at Sugarman we are now learning a sugars like the worst thing in the whole entire world because the sugar industry and back in the day was like settle this sell this fats bad you know and and now we know that sugars of women the biggest things for heart disease and all that crap and yeah they're weasels wouldn't would you pull up there a comparison chart on new vigilant provigil they're almost the same thing one is modafinil and the other one is our modafinil and so they have some sort of a herd the mechanism of action is slightly different and that's the only thing I can tell that's different is one an improvement of the other I can't really looks like new but Jill has shit yeah it's something about electronic coupling anyway think about the fact that I've taken this no now listen to what this is this stuff is it may activate or Rex in peptides via stimulation of orexin receptors oh x1 and oh x2 it may also increase ready for this one glutamate glutamate a-- metallurgic glutamatergic glutamatergic gouda matter Jack said I said it sounds right glutamatergic concentrations decrease ga be allergic activation and increase electronic coupling whoa it fuck knows what that means Rhonda Patrick well she probably would have to go okay lay it out and then we would listen to it laughter whenever she talks I always feel like I'm some sort of like a stupid monkey person I'm like a stupid monkey person enough questions for smart lady please tell me how the body worked what is electronic coupling now we've got to get to the bottom of that because that's electronic that's a problem how do we have something electronic in us you have to worry about we're trying to stay awake what is it the fuck robots dude magic that's how we found out by looking at the ingredients of new vigil and we're like hey hey hey what does this mean then all sudden the fucking overlords turn the switch and we can see them in front of us sorry you guys are robots this entire time was that goddamn ad agency the whole time that let it out we're doing the bid the bidding for the robot world you know what the creepiest fucking quote I ever ever read it was God Marshall McLuhan he said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world I want what the fuck man and he wrote this McLuhan was a bad motherfucker and like are one of a really underrated visionary like you read some of her stuff you like Jesus like this guy had some insight and I'm pretty sure he wrote all this stuff in like the 60s you know see think of what find it see if he could find when that quote was said by McLuhan or written however it was human beings are the sex organs of the machine world I feel like it was in the 60s you wrote this which is like wow did he see that that's what it is we are some sort of a weird being that makes better and better technology every year we get pumped about it which is why I wanted to show you the razor phone 1964 64 just stop and think of that 1964 that motherfucker figured it out that was all yeah so look at that that's beautiful man is the razor phone that's supposed to have the best speakerphone do the speakers insane yeah like it's like a Bluetooth like that loud not that loud yeah no it's not as loud as a bluetooth but it's fucking crazy like you watch a movie on it it's dope you play games on it it's incredible yeah sounds like goddamn ad for this now new vigil and razor no no it's made me they gave it to me for free in all honesty but it's pretty dope razor makes quality products I have that big high end there high end laptop but the blade Pro and its really good is that the iPhone done I did I just got 1/2 inch yeah I gave in I saw Jamie so I'm like I give I tap 2 things about it that I like good face ID 100% legit hundred percent legit the only times like when you wake up you know and you've pillows like in the way or your eyes are puffy though but that's you just go to the passcode but anytime you look at it it just unlocks you know you can close your eyes and it won't unlock so you when you're sleeping you can't like just put that up to your face and the the size of it this is the same about the same size as the the plus which is what I've held that bitch but it's like having an old small phone again so I was starting to get carpal tunnel in my in my finger and my thumb from the Plus after a while so you can just swipe up and I can get to you all of your I got all your notifications yeah there's different swipe Association shouldn't say anything other than notification though and he looks at it back shit yeah yeah that's the one of me back now it's trying to cancel it doesn't trust me cancer bitch won't let me cancel him it's making me enter a password oh there's some notifications now can you see anything cuz I'm no no wants to fake ID now look at look at me look at look how I lock it for you that's why perfect example so it fucks up sometimes sometimes but I'll tell you what man this the form factor is very interesting it's my security cam so it's a huge ass camera but it's not ii three or four cameras i think i mean it's a huge s phone right but it's not a huge s phone right it has a killer camera what a weird world man just ten years ago the first iPhone came out and if you saw that thing today but that thing was made out of wood I still have mine do you have all mine and two of them are starting to explode like and it's not fair because I bought him and I wanted to keep him like a collector but my like iPhone reads like bubbled up and it's about to blow up any day now so do you get used to all this difference you have different swipes now because you don't have a homepage like how do you you have to shut it down to get out of there yeah interesting yeah if the swiping system actually is very like I can't believe I used to do it that different way like if you want to go in between like like programs now you just go to on the bottom left or right you know so we'll just do that and now now the top right gets you to the control center I mean and it took me about two days for me to finally go oh this is so much how it's supposed to be really yeah well yeah sometimes figure you know if they figure out a better way even though it's a better way like you know QWERTY typing do you know the whole deal behind that apparently that's not the fastest way to type like the keyboard QWERTY is set up the way it is because in the olden days they made it that way because old keys would get stuck on each other and they would mash them and they get stuck together so they had to separate the more commonly used keys so they changed the way they did it but the right way to do the typewriter goddamnit I forget the name of it but some people try wacky fucking nerds you wacky nerds these wacky nerds they touch it they take their keyboards and they reprogram them or they buy a specific keyboard that's in this way and then they learn how to type with this super unusual keyboard but it's supposed to be faster there's a plug-in I think that you can do it on your iPad and your iphones and stuff like that over does it like what does it call James the Dvorak Dvorak that's it yeah it's a little different layout yeah so there's QWERTY and Dvorak so yeah like it's a Oh UID H so it's not QWERTY at all p YF g c are L on top why what like you it would take a long-ass time to relearn you can't read learn you'd have to start from the beginning I don't know man I don't think it's worth it just I just I would I'm too stupid I'm too stupid it's like my thoughts about learning a new language like I'm good voice recognition so much already there they're not gonna have keyboards very soon anyway what have you heard about those google earbuds that you put them in and you they translate for you in real time my friend has him there they they they they're not good I was thinking like huh they'd be good when people have like crazy flow to their language like you know you talked to like some serious Puerto Ricans and like you know there's like all these words are like flowing into these other words you know I mean there's like a flavor to it that I just don't think that little computer thing is gonna be able to figure out what the fuck that guy just said I think you could already do it in Google you know so you you don't need the headphones you just need your phone and so I think you can hear it yeah does it on speakerphone oh I see okay but the new pixel by the way that camera on that's the best camera of any any phone than you pixel - it's crazy this is a single camera where all these other phones are doing it with a dual camera it is interesting you know what's really interesting is the level that all these phones are at now it's it's everything is at a super high level like technologically speaking the jump has been giant it's like where is this fucking thing going like we're where are we gonna look at for the iPhone 20 you know I mean is it gonna be in your skin are you gonna get it it's gonna be where - it's gonna be where well I think one day there's not going to be a divisive phone you're just gonna be wearing it somehow like you look at your sleeve to make a phone call you can check your email using your shoe - some mad scientist it's gonna figure out a way to make eyeballs that work better than our eyeballs they're gonna we're gonna swap out our eyeballs already have that they're gonna be the first to go swap out your eyeballs for these super electronic eyeballs but everything is like a shade of color off like red is purple they got to get it's like one of them OLED screens he's got burn-in I'm gonna get we're gonna figure it out but right now you just give up your eyes you give up your eyes for the computer world that's how to start us off to start us off with better eyes first it'll be our blind friends abroad of blind friends we'll get new eyes and I see so much better I'm actually happy that I went blind like what the fuck did you just say and then next thing you know you're gonna try it is gonna be some someone some crazy fucker with good eyesight it's gonna go I want to be able to see booter it's like the the girl with the perfect on'y that gets boob implants like no why'd you do that you know the girl already has double D's and goes to like triple e like no no no why'd you do that it's interesting it's interesting to think of like all the blind people would be the first ones to get all the new eyeballs seeing better so they're all going to be like this people with the glasses to blind people and they take off their they're all robots like could they live yeah Piper rest appease respect remember when bratty Roddy Piper was a movie star for a little bit doing some action movies he was like one of the first guys like the rock to break through you know and that they live movie that was fun I miss that guy dude this is it's a real possibility that this could happen like this is not it I mean I'm not saying it's gonna happen in in a decade but human beings live to be another hundred years we're gonna find they're gonna have better replacements Elon to tweet about that out robot was scared everybody just the way he worded it he said this is nothing in a few years that bots will move so fast you just robe like to see it sweet dreams shit out of me but he's right yeah listen man he's probably one of the smartest human beings on the planet Earth that guys you know that they think he might have invented Bitcoin there's a lot of speculation online you know what here but here's the thing I want to talk about this in this podcast I didn't even read the article I looked at the headline I'm like probably and I kept moving he started all right didn't ya Peter teal started yeah yeah I believe so I believe that's what like made him and there's a video of him from like the 1990s where he got like a million dollar car delivered like just start in a ball and he's just starting to ball out of control he's probably one of the smartest human beings ever that new sports car there's Tesla Noster he's a fascinating guy man do you know he just like made a whole town out of like a battery like a turn he made like the biggest battery in the history of the world what did you hear about that one yeah they just is some new thing that he just built they just built the largest battery in the history of the world it's like a building it's like this guy is fucking Nikola Tesla we're gonna have some madman we're gonna have battery explosions in the future that's gonna be a big fail for sure now right like this whole town Tesla has built the world's largest battery in Australia why in the fuck tech Italian musk le ela Han Elon Musk is making good on his promise to solve energy the energy crisis in Australia can you make that bigger who says screw that up oh you're gross it's fully installed the world's largest lithium ion battery in South Australia the state government said in a statement Thursday tesla teamed up with a french renewable energy firm and a local government to install the battery which must promise to deliver within a hundred days of signing the contract or it would be free he's a madman he's like I'm fucking mad scientist from he's like a guy from a movie right like if you had a movie and there was some mad billionaire Robert Downey jr. type character that just kept invented the newest crazy shit and was at the cutting edge of science and was telling everybody to look out for the fucking robots they're gonna kill us it would be Elon Musk Kem no I'm sure one night I was panicking he watched you though right I think you what I think he did he had a nice army with him yeah I brings a lot of people with guns move yeah very good especially if you worried about robots fuck man he's right though that's the scary thing when you watch that one robot there's one mini robot is this little yellow one in this video and it's running on the ground and like a very fast rate and you're like wait wait wait like you're trying to wrap your head around this thing like what if this thing has guns what it's got a little camera and it's got guns and it's running at you like this it's like the size of a 44 Magnum it's like a series of 44 magnums pointed at you it's about that big and it's running like a hundred times faster than you could ever run like what hold on this is like probably how people in Yemen feel like yes I've been telling you you can't you can't let them use robots you know like the people that get bombed with drones we've just sort of like that's not real you don't even have to like tell us about it no one has to tell us that they're gonna do it they just do it right and something like 80% of the people that they kill or innocent there's some crazy number of people that the drones have killed I know we've gone over this before what is it like 80 percent do you remember something let's see if we can find it just because it's so you know you're a good Rogan your surgery begun probably it might be like 78 percent whatever it is but it's even if it's more than 50% that's fuckin crazy we just have robots that shoot things at people we hope we get the right ones you would never think that transformers it like look actually happened one day you know we're gonna have like good transformers and bad transformers oh my god and then the good ones are gonna hack the bad ones or vice versa Michael Bay was right all along we need to bring Megan Fox back into the franchise well yeah I just that's hard to imagine man but it's probably inevitable right it's probably inevitable that someone is gonna make some super smart robot that does his bidding and this game we're gonna have like a war of worlds yeah we're gonna have Robocop's to fight the bad robots and then drones you imagine if the argument would be let's let the robots fight because therefore it'll save human lives will dictate how the world is one sort of just like the Olympics but with robots fighting to the death to see who gets to run the world and what Elon must should be doing instead of making batteries is trying to invent force fields you know like for real we need only personal force fields we'll see he's this is the thing he is at the cutting edge of science in terms of like implementation of all these new inventions like lithium-ion batteries that are hooked up to giant fucking whatever that structure wasn't in drone resistance on ESPN all the time they put on like uh almost a VR headset and race through they do have them in arenas oh that's crazy a lot of times it's that night with lit up like neon obstacles they're gonna go through seventy miles an hour I think they are really fast so cool that's incredible that's so much cooler than a video game because this is an actual thing out there that you're moving around you know like to play a video game like that's the new video game the new video game is you put something like 10k camera VR headset thing on and you put these cameras on these robots and then you go do shit where the actual thing is really doing it it's not vide it's not a video you're just watching some real physical thing take place and then you have these physical wars so like instead of you know like if you built together an army of semi indestructible robots right and you had a Duke it out with another army of semi indestructible robots and that would be like a television show or drone laser tag where it's like Star Wars and you're fighting and if you have you shoot your laser at it it like turns off the drone it doesn't destroy it maybe it makes our fake yeah but you have high stakes see I think things would be so cheap back by the time it gets to this point it's like everything gets cheaper and cheaper like used to be like you had to be a superball or to have that Michael Douglas brick on the beach right remember in the movie greed or whatever it was Wall Street greed is good he's walking with that giant brick like you had to be a super baller to be able to afford that but now that's like nothing and everyone has a cell phone that's way better than that like every person walking down the street you go sir do you have a phone on you yes I do and he pulls out his phone it's way better than Michael Douglas's super baller all-time high money guy cell phone except Ari Shaffir way better right it's still way better than that stupid piece of shit that Michael Douglas had so if we just keep going in that direction they're gonna get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper to do crazy and crazier things remember this movie that came out a few years ago with you Jackman oh yeah they had fights what is it it's called a real steal oh that's right he's like Rock'em Sock'em robots yeah how did he how did they did they do it with like remote control we're almost like we're describing there's some capturing their body movement and that just like copies what they do oh really it also has AI and feelings I know how dumb was it but wait a min he's on the ground how's he fighting was it someone else doing it and then he's gonna go back in there oh god he did the thing with the nose oh is a training montage don't you Rudeboy oh don't you ruin Wolverine for me you piece of shit oh that's so sad he's gonna show the little boy little boy tells him hey come on man you gotta get in there win for us pulls his sunglasses down well I'm gonna have to start training did anybody watch that movie yeah I don't know that's why don't I don't know much about it they must a game huge Ackman money to make that look like a good idea he had to be sitting in this house in Australia going hot when how much again how much okay okay so I'm a fighter robot guy is that what's going on how many weeks I watched it on an airplane no sound that's about it when you're so high you think you're gonna fall out of the sky they watch that and go what that guy's awesome as Wolverine even though he's not supposed to like Wolverines not supposed to look like that Wolverines not supposed to be a big guy that would be like a bear a Wolverine it's like a little little blockhead guy Wolverine would be built like he would have to go like who samar Paul ha res perfect example who some are Paul Harris is a guy who fought in the UFC he got he got kicked out of the UFC for I think unjustly he's got a he holds on to submissions too long and people get really mad at him because he fucking mangles people's legs but I think the last one like these the people are they out there on him so hard that I think the last one was just it was a tiny minor infraction I think he just gets super excited and I think he's definitely held on to things too long in the past but I think he's learned from that but anyway the UFC has a zero-tolerance policy for that shit he doesn't fight for the UFC anymore I get it but my point is the guy looked like Wolverine from the comic book he's just fucking jacked he was like this 5 foot eight 5 foot nine he might not even been that tall 185 pounds go Willa just ripping people's legs apart well who's one of the scariest guys ever see if you can find a good picture of who some are Paul ha res just try Paul Harris there's no way I'm spelling who some are correctly who it's who some are within our reach tomorrow are you yeah it's it's spelled with an R but the the Portuguese see please use these H they call me Joe Hogan Joe Hogan there he is right there Jesus Christ man Wow look at that fuckin picture which I've jacked he is man that's what Wolverines supposed to look like it's almost exactly like that just like so per jacked pit bull of a man because that's what a Wolverine is a Wolverine it's a crazy fucking animal is he still fighting look at the size of that guy is he still fighting he got fucked up a few times and some other organizations he got beaten by some tough guys like a meal meek meal a meal meek sorry I'm saying his name wrong Amil meek the mad Viking dude he fucked him up and that that's what got him over into the UFC that's like a GI jail body yeah yeah he's ridiculous but that's what it's like Wolverine was a human that's what he'd look like wouldn't look like Hugh Jackman but Hugh Jackman pulls it off like you don't have to be totally I mean he kind of get a movie star in there sanal you let Paul Aras play Wolverine like Wolverine has to say a bunch of shit and you got to believe you means it you know so it's probably hard to find like a super jacked movie star who could be a savage unless it's jack man Hugh Jackman could be a savage I'm buying it I got mighty levels results today how's everything going I don't know what it means but I'm in the normal range like hears that there's like the normal range of a chart yeah a doctor I just spent I Spit I used this everywhere every well thing and he's spitting this little thing in like two weeks you get like full graphs it's like 20 for me but for you and 24 hours there but it's like I showed you like I'm on the low side of normal mmm but so I don't even know what that means and I guess I should test it every couple months to see if it bounces up and down but I definitely have lower normal well you could fix that I know I bet do you here's the thing you should do like if you really really like we having a conversation about health no I mean I'm just checking my T levels bro what I'm saying is I guarantee you if you just changed your diet it would have a significant effect on that you just changed your diet I'm gonna go I'm gonna do this new thing if you want to do it with me all through December December discipline this one they do I'm gonna work out five days a week at least minimum I owe five days a week no bread no wheat no pasta no sugar all month two drinks a week geez that's it so if you go out have a drink wine you get one more of those in a week so what you're gonna eat mostly just steak healthy food man that I watched another week documentary on the plane shit my fucking pants I was terrified it was talking about the stuff that's in roundup and how it's only supposed to affect bacteria and the scientists in this documentary like yeah but you have bacteria in your gut like they're not taking that into consideration that I've taken into consideration gut flora and they were talking about how many people are having issues because they're eating bread that has pesticides on a mic okay is this like some pseudoscience shit is this some nonsense like I got to get to it and eventually I will but I can't imagine that stuff that kills bacteria would be good for you I just can't imagine I don't know how much of that you would actually wind up having in your body but how the fuck could that be good for you like all that roundup stuff that's done should scare the fuck out of you what is going on there man you know till are we sure are we sure that's okay for you like what things there's a certain amount that's allowable per is probably but who set that standard and is that standard been updated based on what you know there's too much money involved in all this stuff you have to realize like anything that's gonna slow down the money when it comes to this old Brewer you couldn't talk and conspiracies but no like for real this is important when it comes to environmental regulations if you look at the fight here's a super good point when it comes to this if you look at the fight when it comes to environmental regulations who the fuck would be arguing against preserving the environment just stop stop and think about how crazy these conversations have to be where someone saying hey no you can't dig that oil well right next to this river because it'll kill everything in the river you fucking cunts and the people still wind up doing it somehow like how how is that conversation even taking place that we're we're in we're getting involved in doing things that we know for sure is going to have some consequence and we're willing to accept a certain amount of it some consequence on the natural world around it might you might just the Keystone pipeline just just the other day released two hundred thousand gallons of oil a little bit just a little bit just a little bit whoops he'll spill want to fix this we're trying to fix this thing whoa like we should be like before we agree to anything right I guess I guess there's got to be some trade-off right if you want to do a big city you want to have all this power it's got to be some sort of environmental consequences at this stage of the life is that this stage of people like the way we're running things unless Elon Musk can make us those big-ass batteries everywhere solar collectors man likes like LH every building should be required to have solar collectors on them in LA no shit and it's not that crazy expense of it like it's not that you could do it yourself on Amazon Prime but it's dropping that's for sure it's dropping you know they make some things where you can like charge your phone like they make these solar panels like you could sit them out on your patio it collects electricity enough to you take it with you the next day you could charge your phone with it you charge your laptop with it they have backpacks that have solar on it I mean like why at the sunniest places should have be required to do shit like that you know in the windiest places should have windmills and what I've read is the only issue on any of this stuff is where are the minerals coming from to make these magnets you know there's things called conflict minerals there's minerals that are you know taken out of the ground in the Congo by slaves you know there's little children working in these camps that they've documented pulling I think it's called coltan that's the name of it out of the mountains is the stuff they used to make cell phones it's very depressing and I don't know if they still do it like that anymore I don't know if since it's been exposed it's had any sort of an impact on how they do it but Shane Smith was the first person to talk to us about it and I remember talking about it going why wait a minute like stop and think about like what a cell phone is like your flip that bitch over so you know just area notifications everybody's so scared not be connected but you know if you just think about the the pinnacle of like what we use as far as like technologies like one of those things right and if you take that which is like the most pervasive technology the most advanced aspect of our society right the Internet in a phone that takes pictures and you can ironically connect that all the way back to a child slave that's digging rocks out of the ground with a stick whoa that's dark Isis did as a kid it was fun just dig in my backyard kick rocks I collected rocks polished them oh yeah it was fun yeah I met a dude once who pan for gold we were coming across the country and I met a dude who was a legitimate prospector and he was not making a ton of money but he had like this idea that he could at any day like go in one of these rivers and pull out some serious gold happens it does happen especially like in Alaska there's those TV shows where it's in Alaska where there's these guys go and they they get a certain amount of gold out of the ground every day and sometimes they hit good pots and they can really really collect and stack them up but this dude was like I brought him some shit that I thought was gold but dude I found some gold he's like no no that's pyrite that's fool's gold and I started thinking about I was like wow why is gold worth anything like woah come this pretty stuff is not as much is that pretty stuff like what the fuckers fool's gold might be worth more than gold one someday like you fools it was right there in front of your eyes now the lettuce fool's gold made out of fool's gold looks pretty dope I think I should have some shit made out of fool's gold since I'm a fool good move and we should make it happen how would it be to have a fool's gold watch movement get on that shit Rolex with a bass imagine a dope-ass fool's gold chain why not it's pretty like it's we're not like some shit is like worth a lot of money that's pretty and some shit like we don't give a fuck about rubies the only thing that's coming up as the Matthew McConaughey movie called fool's gold [Laughter] there's a lot of singing wait this flow school to actually exists or is this something we've always thought it was described that's beautiful and the watch that he's wearing it keeps popping up and yeah and they both have their crotches leaning towards each other they do they do look at the shadow worse I notice they're like moving in on a deep dicking right their clothes actually bigger this he's just like a pirate there's a treasure hunter I think have you ever seen anybody do that or heard of people that do that they like find a place and they can't tell anybody about it because they know there's probably like two million dollars in shit down there yeah and they've got to be careful because oh yeah those are real and they'll kill them oh yeah that shit is real yeah there's a whole industry of that and there's people that finance these guys see there's the madmen that know where the fuckin mad woman's are a non-binary folk that know where the treasure might be and then there's the people that need to finance that bitch and usually they make some sort of a split like the guys like hey I'll invest and people have invested hundreds of millions of dollars and come up with zilch and they just think around the corner around the corner it's gotta be my pot of gold a Roman ship that crashed just filled to the fuckin brim those greedy cunts they used to bring so much gold with them that had killed their boat poisoned them from the inside imagine that you just got hundreds and hundreds of pounds of gold there's another movie he's an actually came out last year that's sort of about it - or he goes to somewhere like in Thailand mmm and they're like they know the spot where they're prospectors are gonna like dig all the gold out of them out of the mountains and anything but it's not a in the ocean a pretty dope wasn't as good you know what was good that I'd liked a lot of people did not like the Dark Tower oh yeah it's not good right that a Juris elbow guy he could sell me anything I'm buying it he's a little like he's a guy that's like you believe is like a legit badass but also can act like like I believed him in this movie it was a wacky movie it's like very wacky it's always whacked when you have a Stephen King book you try to make a movie out of it he have a British accent in it no not quite but he has like some sort of a noble accent like the way talks you know like I do not aim with my hand to aim with your hand just to forget the face of your father that kind of shit you know it was like intense weird world that they live in in this movie it's very strange but I enjoyed the shit out of it you know but you just when you watch a movie that's a Stephen King book you gotta realize like they have to abbreviate the fuck out of this like this is a complex story that gets woven into all these different places and you got to condense that to an hour and a half to make it palatable for a movie critic just it's very hard to do like you add those it's almost like Game of Thrones have made movies obsolete it's like movies are like clunky they're like CDs like why can't CDs do you don't have a phone like who are you I I think the same way about Game of Thrones I can't get into it oh my god damn I'd rather watch fuck you fuck you man I heard that the Punisher the guy John burned on yeah last name he said that gets a 13-episode movie I could thirteen hour movie it's how it's supposed to be watched sorta that makes sense that makes sense that guy's a good fucking actor that guy was great in the walking dead he was fucking great as the best friend wants to fuck the wife and then turns into a zombie boiler he's still watching that no I gave up man I gave up now I read people getting mad about episodes I'm like no no what shows are you watching right now like what some what some shows that you would never think like just like a reality show or like to not watch anything like that but I do watch Ozark that's that's the shit that's the Netflix show Ozarks or Ozark Ozark that's awesome stranger things hose arc is a like I don't want to give too much of it away but it's Jason Bateman and it's this it's it's like a it's like a drama but like a based on like financial shit that's all I want to give away I don't wanna give away anything but it's fucking crazy good it's really good and it's fucking wild like wild shit happens in this show and you're like what the fuck I don't want to give away too much of it but it's about money laundering and the guy's like a legit finding financier and he gets himself in a bad situation this fucking good show man and that show got me what's the last five episodes on our own accord yes it's a good fucking show is a toy fridge fast is that one of those that pullian faster you have to give it some time you know what man it got me like five minutes in I don't want to say like right away you go what oh my god oh shit I mean they just they start off like a Quentin Tarantino movie I mean it's guns blazing all right I don't want to say too much I'm gonna stop right there I'm gonna stop right there cuz it's good stranger things stranger things it's fucking awesome I love that that son of a bitch I said great doctor okay it's too cheesy for me I don't know it's supposed to be cheese I know but it's like they're just copying everything I love and making make it better and making it better okay no Jesus I love it it's great what do you like like stupid shit like fixer-upper what's that it's where they buy these houses and in Waco Texas for like $50,000 and they spend a hundred thousand dollars and it's they make it like this huge mansion it's cute I like fixer-upper shows those you don't like stuff like that no I do I'd like those there's something satisfying about those yeah like Adam Carolla's show was good satisfying well you'd bust people but then they'd fix it he'd bust people that were like shitty carpenters they were really Gruen bad contractors are doing terrible jobs on people's house that's the clothes show too I mean I always when I was a kid I always watched this old house with Bob Vila and all that shit's like I prefer the positive shows though man I don't want to watch all these contractors do like ripping people off like chef Gordon Ramsay shit you don't like suck or deal I love that motherfucker I do he gets very upset about food but I think that this what the style of show that I like is when they take a house and then they redo it right those are the those are my favorite ones yeah this show is really cool because it's a husband and wife and she's like a badass designer like she she'll take it like just her paint style and like how she mix this stuff is very very cool and so these houses and makes you depressed living in LA when you're like I can't buy a house $50,000 anywhere in Los Angeles at all no right so it's it's amazing to see like that exists well if you want to live in the pile space is expensive because there's not as much of it that's the craziest things New York City you know New York City they have apartments that are 20 million dollars and it's an apartment you're like wait it's not an apartment apartment no it's an apartment you have an apartment you have a great view it's a great view but it's a fucking apartment and it cost 20 million dollars like wait a minute how many people are in the building with me thousands no really yes you're in the top floor there's thousands of people and you're all in a giant metal and concrete box that'll be 20 million please like what in the fuck are you talking about who wants to live like that if you have like a pet is it like 1.2 mm in a month like well your pet you know you have to pay extra no I think if you're buying it you own it but if you're renting it I bet there's a lot of places that won't want to rent if you have a dog so the dog runs up fucking things up you know want dogs we bite things and shit on places and piss on things are not supposed to a man can happen yeah but I just it's hard to imagine that that's the right way to live I bet it's exciting as fuck I bet living in a giant apartment in New York City at ppph and everywhere you go they're just overwhelmed by giant numbers of people it must be exciting as fuck it's really interesting it's like you're in the middle of the high but I just don't think that leaves you a lot of time for quiet and reflection I mean you can like force yourself into a room and shut the door but I think this is just a theory but I really think we need a certain amount of actual space between each other to relax excellent this is just my feeling I feel like if I go over someone's house they live in the country and I go sit out on their porch it's like how come I live like this this is how you're supposed to live like this feels great like you go you look you see fucking rolling hills you see birds and shit like this feels great like you see the trees you see water dripping off of them the sunlight speaking through the leaves and you go god this feels so good like why don't I see this all the time instead of bad babe fuck you fuck you go back to your fucking country queer you know I can't fucking smoke and farts and cigarettes and people smell electric are uh-oh what have we done pissing in the streets garbage bags piled up ripped at the bottom nobody cares guy picks it up some of it falls out they drive on fuck Pappa or just sitting chillin just sitting on some soft grass you back against a tree just sitting there feels better than on some stupid-ass fuckin park bench watching some wino eat his own shit right I do not understand how people do it like he loves it he loves it you talked to Ari about New York see I love it it's the best it's supposed to go ever I'm living there for a toy dock definitely fuck the winter though he's the best he bails every winter fuck you New York I'll see you dummies later he comes LA he lives here for three months then it goes back it's awesome it's a fucking funny shit man it's the way to do it it's a funny way to do it I mean I think he's gonna do some winter time but that winter time did Duncan in solid we had him for a little while we lost him no he's back he's coming and we're doing a shrimp raid Christopher Ryan him and me yeah I knew Duncan would be back but just like that winter is a different thing man you're either used to it or you're not and if you're not you better change your to change your expectations for for your the way you interface with the world because if you're not wearing a certain amount of clothing you're going to fucking die okay get your kids bundle them up no you can't wear sneakers no you have to wear socks okay it's it's fucking zero out zero and the streets are all covered with black guys so we can't walk very fast and cars are gonna be sliding area they can't stop bang you get knocked around like bowling balls that's real shit that's real winter stuff like you you tried shoveling your way out of your apartment building you're like wait a minute what what what the fuck you can't drive anywhere sounds stacked up on the sides there's nowhere to put it like you better be ready for this your feet are cold okay wanna go back yeah it's cool let's go back good move but never again I'll tell you what dude I liked it I'd like to want to go in the snow now too like one of the things that I didn't really like skiing that much but I like being the snow that's what I like I like I like I like this feeling like hey we barely got this one under control barely like you can go out but you got to be wearing down and shit all bundled up you got to have things over your little fucking bully bullshit fleshy digits these little soft bitch-ass hands of yours cuz those things break off they freeze they freeze and they turn black and snap off your feet if you if you keep your feet too cold your feet you lose your feet they hack your toes off and shit you gets frostbite that's real people whose toes those ears oh yeah fuck yeah frostbites no joke man frostbite kills your skin like that's a wrap it's over you know you want gangrene no we got to chop this piece off this piece is done that happens to people that doesn't happen out here except for the cryochamber or whatever and that's only one girl never and she fell asleep that is a very unfortunate story she was apparently working there and she did it to herself she like she set the Machine up for herself alone and she's too short and the nitrogen got into her lungs she was like breathing it inch wasn't breathing in air and she blacked out horrible horrible horrible story ooh just hearing it makes your fucking whole body clench up whoa way to die that's so crazy frozen to death in a cryo chamber you seen this map going around there's a little County right here is Los Angeles oh there's more people in this county then these other 41 states together not combined but each of them none of them are have are more populous than this little tiny bit that's crazy I think that's only with the 10 million official population count yeah we're a mad hub of people son yeah it's so crazy 526 square miles which isn't even that big I feel like I mean big ok we keep talking where we going where we going where do we go well if we're gonna bust a move how do I say Seattle's don't need a good internet yes yeah so now it might be the spot you know why cuz you get like a little bit of weather you go hey bitch listen you better appreciate June okay you better appreciate July because November's gonna roll around just like it did last year and everyone's gonna be depressed okay okay I appreciate it so if you go out and Seattle and like August people are so happy what about working because it's in between the mother hubs of Google and Amazon bad spot right between them you know I think the move is Eugene we move in next to damn Carl into Cameron hands on that mountain Santa Barbara that's a good goddamn spot it's like LA light yeah and it's good wine and places to go yeah nice people yeah I like Santa Barbara it's a chill Beach to go to that Beach people are super friendly cute sooo yeah yeah man that's a good spot Santa Barbara might be the perfect spot mm-hmm it's a good spot shit I should have told everybody [Laughter] yeah they promised Seattle is the you know like many live we're from Ohio where it's gray sky every day in Seattle I think it's gonna be kind of like that I think you there's way too many gray skies here's the thing though are you willing to trade some gray skies for cooler people the thing about and I'm not saying everybody in Seattle is cooler than everybody in LA I love people in LA I'm not saying that but you're getting a kind of this is just my opinion and this might not be right but I have a feeling that you have you develop more character in an environment where your comfort is tested I think if you live in a cold environment where it's cold in the winter if you live in where would it really rains you get soaked and you hear the Thunder outside it's a humbling to that experience that people that live in LA just don't fucking get and it's one of the reasons why people in a lot of these other states get annoyed as some of the attitudes that people in LA have it's because you we're not experiencing anything other than traffic like these people get snowed on every year every year they're digging themselves out we're like yeah well what the fuck man I'm stuck in traffic man like if you don't have any constant like it's one day it got too hot and you had to turn the fan on you're gonna be okay you're gonna be okay just drink water and go buy ice at the store like you're gonna live even if it sucks you're gonna sweat a lot drink a lot of water you're gonna live it's 110 stay inside stay in the shade you're gonna live it's gonna suck but you're gonna live you might not live if you're living in Chicago and you can't in your old lady and your power goes out and you're stuck in your house traffic without traffic do you see the traffic last night of everyone coming home it was just as bad look at that that's insane yeah it's a video it says Thanksgiving traffic Los Angeles 405 freeway at complete standstill and it is fucking miles I mean miles and miles and miles of people that look at the go in five miles an hour in either direction and when sightings are read because of the rear lights and then the other ones white because of the headlight that's crazy their video is crazy yeah fuck this place we got to go go Joe just tell me when I'm where do we go here's the thing where do we go I'm up for Seattle or Santa Barbara maybe we should go to Arizona No maybe go right next to where the walls being built I'd be a party I know it doesn't it's still like we saw those sunny days in Denver but does it get cold there like like zero yeah yeah it definitely can yeah I think about Denver is it super flexible Denver will go to zero you get nine degrees for a few days and then it'll be 60 it's weird it's weird cuz you're like way up high you know you're you literally at a mile high I think Denver is 5,000 feet above sea level five thousand five lakh that's exactly a mile yeah so that's it's a it's a very high City when you're talking about it's a very interesting place man it's a it's a different spot because like Denver either they're in this weird like combination world right this is the way I put Denver like you have a city that's like a real City you have the Comedy Works it's one of the best comedy clubs in the world they have two Comedy Works there I think they have an improv there too don't they have a Denver improv I don't know I didn't profit everywhere those fuckers they're out there they're constantly bringing bringing the funny to the people yeah they're everywhere the end problems are everywhere right but Denver has like everything that it has restaurants it has like a real urban life it's like real cities real buildings and shit and then on top of that you're next to the goddamn Rocky Mountains like you look out the window like we were just there the other day me and Tony did a gig at the Belko and we were driving I was like dude look at that that's right there that's the Rocky Mountains it's right there like these fucking people are staring at the Continental Divide I mean they're just sort of looking at the Rocky Mountains you could just good you could drive up to the top of the hills like up in your neder land and shit like that and see these like quaint towns that still exist on dirt roads into the woods you're like whoa whoa I'd probably do Denver that would be the only place that had snow I would move to that's the spot yeah I think Denver's the spot it's a Seattle might go might go with a good quake good quick that volcano now yeah yeah the volcano could blow and it Mount st. Helens yeah volcano could blow tsunami there was some tsunami shit about the sea that was in the newspaper a few years ago that was actually causing a drop in the real estate in Seattle because people like wait what like they were talking about how someday in the next hundred years a giant earthquake and tsunami is gonna level Seattle what what you can't just say that I'm trying to sell my house the disaster want waiting to happen at the northwest huh see if you can find the article like the article was something about can't damn it if I can remember earthquake and soon what is it hmm I don't think so experts they on the really big one here's what will actually happen that might be it anyway point being scared the fuck out of everybody because mmm it was one of those stories that was kind of like one person reported on it and then it went around you know you know those like you get them on Digg or something like that and then you go to Twitter someone will have it it'll be linked to another website you go and check it like whoa whoa whoa is this really happening see how about going under what's the fuck and like out of nowhere but uh it might we might lose Seattle so let's let's think this through yeah off the list how much you scared of bears all right Toronto see if you're not scared of bears the move is Montana Montana is the move you know why cuz Montana is like Denver with less people like you got an airport if you're willing to give up a day you got an airport you can get out okay you got to give up an extra day though for travel because you got to get out and fly somewhere and then from there you fly out and so like the odds are you doing a show that night you really probably couldn't do it you'd probably up to leave Thursday for a Friday night show but you get back the same day same weather yeah but bears like the big kind of Canadian people grizzly bears for cool people what do you start a fly fishing camp why you laughing cuz fly-fishing is awesome and you could do it there it's a great place I mean I'm in at night like after the night yourself and you put a gun right by your bed in case the wolves come because they're wolves - whoa did you see the rocks new movie that has the 30-foot yes perfect movie fan you see his new tattoo neat Hurtado I made this fucking dope like bull skull he used to have that bull on his arm and he updated it with this like insane bull skull that uh Nicky Hurtado made mmm here make that larger so he could see Wow look at that sweet that is an insane tattoo man I mean the other the old tattoo still in it see it how the old tattoo is like the cracks no that's so yeah he made the old tattoo like a part of the new tattoo I mean it is fucking dope and it doesn't like you have to look at it to know the old tattoo is in there because he's turned it into these cracks in the owns of these the bison skull fuck man it's awesome or the bull skull whatever it is that guy's a bad motherfucker you ever seen his tattoos yeah pull up some of his tattoos go to his Instagram page his fucking tattoo work is amazing amazing he does all kinds of weird shit and a lot of like photographic stuff where you know he'll have like a photograph of you know Elvira or some shit you know just like perfect I don't know why I said Elvira fuck go to Nikko Hurtado uh oh but go to his page I said I said Nikki its Nikko sorry sorry Nico are you done with tattoos you know no lower back yeah I'm gonna do a tramp stamp I have hurt my back the game of thrones Lady Queen of dragons mother of dragons oh my god how dope is his artwork though it's wait look at that it's dude his artworks insane where's he from what he's a California guy look at the lips on that thing oh my god crazy it's just crazy what does that woman supposed to be she a demon or something he's got a skull well it's amazing when you zoom in on you see how good the details are he's incredible but yeah I mean there's so many really good tattoo artists now I mean this is a weird time for the art form because it's for whatever reason I guess probably a lot of those tattoo shows in specific they they made it seems like more people understand it more as an art form you know but give more like legit world-class artists world-class word way to put it but legit talented super talented artists that decide to become tattoo artists you know what is it temporary tattoo printer on your arm machine I mean I think that I don't know if they last as long as a contemporary tattoo which isn't very long at all but it's full-color and probably just works off a JPEG or something so you could try out and how long does it last for I don't know I was guessing as long as a temporary tattoo but I feel like it's a little bit longer it's like a sting up it might say great better design your own tattoo on the app oh man we're getting little kids there's indoctrination there trying to get these kids to accept the numbers when they come and collect us all four camps okay what was he saying the other day about robots yeah who was that what it was you like said something like you couldn't you tweeted him back like you know what was that sometimes he says shit that I just go what you need someone like me next to you all the time that's what Alex Jones needs he just needs me to go hey man what stop stop stop stop that might not be it some people need a rudder you know I'm saying yeah and by the way if I'm your rudder you got a serious fucking problem got a serious fucking problem I was hoping that flatter Thor was gonna like yeah I was waiting I was so excited for this he's done it before he shot himself like 160 miles into space no he did I think he did shoot himself like 1.6 miles into the air something ridiculous in the past and he recovered took him like several days to recover from the g-forces I do believe that this is something that was in the article it might be something he said he might just be crazy yeah he's trying to be like Evel Knievel he was trying to a bunch of different things and he jumped onto the Flat Earth thing about a year ago to gain money he said oh he's trying to like jump a limo over a fucking board sometimes you like that but no one believes wait a minute how do you know yeah you know what I read one of the craziest fucking arguments someone said one of the Flat Earth proponents said about it if this is going around apparently so forget me forgive me if you've heard this but the idea that a ship doesn't really disappear over the horizon you could always zoom in on it if you just have enough of a powerful lens in your camera so they think that that in some way is proof that the earth is flat that's just proof of how far you can see that's all it is like you don't understand like the the curve of the earth it takes forever it's fucking huge like you're I get what people are doing like who who come if you zoom out you can see well you can't for that's why you can't see Mount Kilimanjaro from your fucking living room in Santa Monica right dipshit right alright it's a curve do it it just takes a long-ass time and you can't see the boat long before it goes over the curb because unless you're talking about a giant ass boat and even a giant ass boat at 30 miles away which is where you still be able to see some of it that's too far for your eyes so if you zoom in with some sort of a crazy spotting scope or something like that yeah you'll be able to see it for a little while and then in another couple hours it'll be gone it's gonna come over the top link but they wanted to be real so bad they wanted to be real so bad that they come up with these things that aren't true as examples why the earth is flat and the big one was how come every photo of the Earth from space is a composite you didn't even bother to look into it because that's not true if there's a fucking satellite that takes a high-resolution photo of the earth something like every 10 minutes so the Himawari 8 it's a Japanese silo you go online you can look at the pictures it shows where every fucking storm cloud is all over the country in real time so if there's a storm that's hitting Cuba you go to that you look at that image from that day where the storm is you'll see the fucking storm like it's all real if you don't believe that's real do you believe that someone is so good at hiding shit that they've kept all the images of the Flat Earth from ever being published that no one has been able to train the history people it's been able to travel past the ice wall into the the nether region of hobbits and gnomes and pixie elves it's just mental health you know we have a huge problem lack of education it's lack of education and then it's also being committed to these ideas to the point where they're a part of you it's I it's idea identity politics this is what it is when you when you believe in an idea so much that you don't and I've been guilty of this and I think everybody has at one point in your life you've been guilty of not really looking at it for what it is but instead looking at it for what you want it to be and for what you've already committed yourself to believing in that's a big part of the problem big part of the problem with people is you commit yourself to believing in something and then when you commit yourself to believe in something anything that's contrary to that believe gets fought viciously you shut it down you interrupt by all means necessary you mock it you divide it you don't examine it objectively you don't look at it objectively you just look for a way to shoot it down look for a way to shit on it look for a way if it any fall back on the government lies all the time I never believed them fall back on all these different positions but at the end of the day if you look at it from just like well okay what's the most likely thing the most likely thing is it's round they figured it out they know it's round you can see it from space they've taken pictures of it people have absolutely flying in the space station there's videos of the the fucking the thing landing on the sky people pulling people out of the water they've seen they've gone into space okay they've taken pictures this is all real there's satellites they're real if you get satellite radio it's real okay it's really from a satellite when you get DirecTV it's real it's in space it's orbiting the fucking earth there's flight patterns that are carefully calculated that are going around the earth everybody would have to be lying do you understand how crazy it is I'm with you on a lot of conspiracies I'm with you on Operation Northwoods I'm with you on the gulf of tonkin shit you get me high enough I'll go area 51 on you I'll go Bob Lazar I'll go I'll go deep on someone who the fuck knows wacky shit till you get to the earth being fat and that's when I go you're just chasing your tail you're chasing your fucking tail these angry little pricks call me a shill there just shit all around her she'll show you put a perfect perfect advertise Jimmy calm young Jamie calm yourself around earth shield t-shirt vote by Christmas and they're very soft cotton feels wonderful yeah I think it's almost like a troll what do you not man I'm telling you I used to think that - it started out as a troll this is what I think happened I think it became an exercise in psychology from what I've understood what I've understood and I might be wrong but from what little I've done poking around about this it seems like this might have started on 4chan and it might have started as a joke that there's always been a certain percentage of people that believed that the world was flat there's always a certain percentage just like there's a certain percentage of Muniz there's a certain percentage of people that you know or Satan worshippers ooh people just there's wacky beliefs and people get attached these wacky beliefs and they fucking cling to them yeah and they say in whatever it is whatever whatever the belief is there's a certain percentage of people that have always thought the earth was flat but then what I read was that someone on 4chan started rolling and that by trolling and trying to post this fake evidence about the world being flat a bunch of people bought it and they ran with it and not only they run with it they started to ramp it up and add things to it and Flat Earth theory became a thing and these people all decided that this was like a legitimate pursuit that there is some Illuminati some group of Jews it's always Jews that are hiding all the information that somehow or another they've talked all the mapmakers all the people that work in commercial shipping all the people that are flying airplanes all the people that are making satellites anyone in aerospace all these fucking people all these people all these people are all together and they're all lying okay and I am don't I am too or maybe just listen to this maybe you're chasing your fucking tail and you're confusing the shit out of some people that are dumber than you because of your inability to look at what it is versus what you want it to be you heard me don't give a fuck I'm right about this there's no fucking reason why someone would lie about the shape of the planet there's no benefit in it there's no reason why anybody would conceal that information there's no benefit if someone found out the earth was flat they would be fucking singing it from the rooftops any real scientist any real person has been in the space station any real persons flying the space shuttle they're real I know you'll do you know I've met him I had that Chris Conrad guy is that his name Chris Hadfield Chris Hatfield forget his fucking name commander Chris Hadfield he was wonderful he was in space for a long time talking about the effects of it when he came down and how how bad it fucked up his body that was a fascinating podcast I remember I think I got like 40 minutes with him then he had to go it's like one of those quick little things and he was amazing you're talking to a guy that's been circling the fucking planet in a metal box no it's not real it's real no it is real this is the reason why your phone works understand this the people this is what's ironic the people that are doubting the highest minds and the most competent technological innovators in the world like the most competent people are the people that are involved in like aerospace airplane construction jet putt construction cell phones computers those are the people that are at the top of the fucking heap and these Apes that are using these devices to say that the world is flat you're doing just what a massive disservice you're doing to the very minds that have created the thing that you're using to complain with this ridiculous idea that someone's hiding the information from all the people because they don't want you to know that the world is like your phone man I get it I want to believe Bigfoots real I get it I want to believe if you show me some fucking half-assed Bigfoot footage I'll watch it three four times in a row huncle one day maybe maybe maybe hey baby you never know there's a lot of parts of the world we never go to and also I want deep in the Congo I wouldn't be surprised right I want to believe but I'm also objective you got to be both I know you want to believe the earth is flat I'm super sorry but it appears to be round as fuck just like every other planet we've ever look at all of them imagine how crazy would be if earth was flat well here's the problem with this idea you fucking dummies a lot of the people behind this idea believe that it was created by God like on a pizza tray like that that this is part of a religious belief is that God made this Flat Earth in the cosmos and it's all about us this is part of it this is this isn't connected to your group Joe you're so arrogant with your idea no I'm fucking dumb okay but I'm smart enough to know the world's round crazy assholes said have you talked about net neutrality yeah you know I saw Mark Cuban saying positive things about net neutrality yeah it's and I was really surprised but then I realized he's a rich old white guy and follow the rich old white guy be like listen we don't need regulation he also has a lot of money so no matter how much it cost he doesn't give a shit you know there's that for sure but then he was making some arguments and I'm too fucking stupid to know whether or not he's right you know I've heard the arguments against it and I think those make most the most sense but apparently there's some big business people and a lot of I get you hippies you like drew of course there are those fucking assholes they never have enough money you're right you're right but also like you gotta let them you gotta let them do their thing you know you gotta let them do their thing it's like I I don't know who's right and I would love to hear a really educated objective analysis on whether or not that enhances competition or hurts it whether or not that's good for business or bad for it most of the stuff that I read says it's bad for it but I need to look at it really closely it's definitely letting them censor the internet and that's like like what is the exact restrictions do you know it's it's up to the ISPs to be - like hey you want this website we might give it to you so they can start editing stuff say as an example Viacom who is owned by Time Warner or whatever say like something comes out against the CEO of Time warmer they can actually go in and edit the internet where it's not as see right now it's free you could do whatever the fuck you want no one's editing it really you know unless it's like pedo websites or something like that right but so it's gonna be like in the future like we're China if they don't want you to go to myspace China be like MySpace off dude I was reading about a Vietnamese blogger today who was sentenced for seven years in jail a 22 year old Vietnamese blogger is in the New York Times he was writing about an oil spill and they said that he was talking negative and doing propaganda against the state they locked him in jail for seven years for doing journalism on an oil spill and for pointing the blame at the government or whoever the fuck was responsible for the oil spill Jesus 10 years did lock them in jail for 10 years because somebody was different one that's the girl right that's a girl that's another one she's from earlier in the year I went I went deep do they deadlock and bloggers up over there Vietnam apparently they have great good issues with like gay rights and you know a lot of progressive ideas that we subscribe to in this country but they do not tolerate criticism like it's it's apparently in that way very totalitarian and that if you do criticize them in the form of like propaganda like blogs against them they'll lock you in a fucking cage for like a decade scary you got to really appreciate this is one of the reasons why I mean I don't know if Trump understands this I guess he does but he doesn't give a fuck I think his idea is like you're going against me fucking I'm going against you fuck you CNN you know I get it but by just like completely deriding them like that like you you you run this risk of getting to a position where there's not like this objective powerful force that's watching over the president and reporting on all of his actions right there's a chart that I read today though that was a little disturbing and it was like a truth chart and it was like how many times cNN has said things that were not true how many times does it have to correct itself how many times do they say things that are true and I don't know if it's right I don't know if that that might have been some more shit that I read but if it was right I was like whoa are they wrong that often what that's crazy well any news especially when it has breaking news guys it's at least they're correcting themselves we're like our president won't correct himself maybe that's what they mean by being incorrect and they're like you know the latest report says but you see that's just what the latest report says like the latest report might not be correct but if you say though that's the latest report you're not wrong you just don't have the right information right and I think everyone knows that when you're watching the news you know right like if something happens like some crazy shooter type situation right right it's just very dangerous when you see the president and the Free Press going after each other like that today what he said we should have a contest as to which of the networks plus CNN and not including Fox is the most dishonest corrupt and or distorted in its political coverage of your your favorite president in parentheses me they're all bad win or to receive the fake news trophy in all caps our fucking president wow that's so weird this is so weird because here's what's weird it's not weird to think this but to broadcast that to write that down and to put that on that's like that's crazy that's a crazy thought I think I would like him so much better if he'd never tweeted like like yeah if we just had news and that's it yeah but you didn't see look we're talking about this the stress of this thing I mean this is how old he's always been he always fires back at people when they fired him that's his thing I mean should have known but people for some reason expect him to be different once he got in there they expected well he's just doing that for now dude just trust me it's gonna get in there super cool have you tried to bait bait him yet let's Batum no no I don't ever do that to anybody I just I said look this is the world that I'm seeing you know I'm just I'm reporting on what I'm seeing I'm order like a journalist so I'm seeing I'm seeing a bunch of like whether they're justified or not there's there's a bunch of this pettiness to this all that should be avoided by advanced human beings that's what's the problem this is the lack of humor to it all and the angry pettiness of it all is what's most disturbing not the idea that something wrong with this system because if that chart was right and they're wrong a lot and if they're wrong about him but this there's one thing but the way that that should be handled as always pointing out exactly and specifically how they were wrong how it could have gotten back to them that was the wrong information and what they've done to correct it if they have it acknowledge it and then that's it like that's that's what should be done when you're in that position when you're just a regular dude and you want to just go on Twitter and talk some crazy shit and you know say the sunna is fucking food news I feel like some firefighter somewhere I don't think you should be fired if you say that like I don't care like you can say that right this isn't bother me when you're the president you definitely are you're setting an example like as weird as that seems to say to someone that like this is a part of the job you have to set a good example you can't you're setting the tone of the country that's the problem like I wouldn't write that would you write that don't you write that to somebody never fake news trophy exclamation point so come I hate Iran that's crazy whoever let you do that needs to get you some mushrooms and have you seen as boomerangs like a boomerang no in his snapchat oh yes snap Jones that would be hilarious if he did you know people get tired of all this anti Trump stuff and you know people get tired of just hearing the subject it's almost like just it hurts them but those those kind of things that's like fuel for the fire it's almost like he's doing he's doing the work of the people who hate him for him he just keeps providing more and more ridiculous shit do you think Trump they can get mad at him for do you think Trump's a flat earther no no I mean some of them probably man I would like to know what he thinks about Kennedy but he keeps releasing these documents and I'm happy and some of these documents are crazy you know they've there's a lot of like one of the ones was about Jack Ruby and Jack Ruby saying the day that Kennedy was going to get shot get ready gonna see some fireworks today like what like what did he really say that like how do I know he really said that I want to know I really I really oh but if the FBI got it from a credible source and that they really believe that the problem is like the people that Jack Ruby was hanging around with some crazy stripper was doing like some 1960s version of speed yeah he told me he told me fireworks what's gonna happen yeah then she runs off into the fucking forest and what the fuck knows maybe check Ruby just had a nice party they surprise party later could have fireworks would be the best evidence that you would need right now to like know that that was true it's a good question right because I've seen people argue that the photo of Lee Harvey Oswald is convenient photo of him in the backyard with a rifle in one hand and newspaper in the other hand that is photoshopped not photoshopped but photo added it is I don't know if it is I don't know if it is I don't know if it's been proven that it is but I know that's a common statement and then the people have broken they've done some analysis on the photograph and I do not know enough about photography to know whether or not they're right the shadows are all off I think that it they found out that they the magazine did it too for some reason like it the magazine did it like the government or anything maybe I remember it being a controversial photo but then I remember someone saying recently that they believed it was not faked and that there was new evidence to indicate that it was not faked just the problem with being like a surface reader yeah yes the one on the far left yeah that's a dallas police reenactment yeah how do you know they're there at the exact same time you don't have a camera when he was come on stupid oh good you can't take a photograph as a reenactment unless you know exactly when he took the photograph and you have the scene clouds in the sky and shit because I guess they're trying to like find out whether or not that was a real photo or whether it was Lee Harvey Oswald's head put on somebody else's body but the body matched his body go to focus in on his face don't go to this one there's one that's like a better resolution version I find that make sure you go to the one right above it actually that one right there yeah yeah that's the photo it looks a little off like the head definitely looks a little weird I guess the shadows is what that they're they're talking about the shadow that's coming from the bottom of his Chin's not the same as what the shadow is blahblah on this video no man that's I'm not smart enough to know whether or not that's true but it looks okay to me but it's also this so grainy look at that photo imagine if that was what pictures are today I can you know check out a girl's tinder account you're like hmm what do you really look like this is see there's the full one no no look at his feet like zoom out Louis is his feet shadows see it there we go well see how the shadow is going that way on his feet and then you look at his face the shadows like Kanye going you make that picture a little smaller so we get the whole picture in there I don't think that's correct the thing that would make me feel like something was weird it's just that it's so old that you can't really tell whether or not someone doctored it and they might have had reason a doctorate that's it that's what makes me think that it might be fucked with not the actual picture itself when I'm looking at the picture itself I'm trying to find reasons why I was fucked with you know but then again I'm but who's boring story oh that was legend to the FBI that was chocolately he was the best and you made fun of him your stupid fucking vodka sorry sorry in advance just joking I'm sure that guy has great stories but those days man you get away with a lot of shit you know there's an interesting article that David was his name David Frum from the he's a conservative writer New York Times bestselling author he wrote something about it shit and trying to remember what it was oh it was Richard Nixon's letter to JFK's Widow this like hartfeld articulate interesting letter between an opponent of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon I mean that's who he was the opponent of John F Kennedy wasn't just Richard Nixon like they were running against each other and so he writes this like really heartfelt letter and it's like whoa you read it you know Wow Richard Nixon wasn't as stupid as people want to think he was he's very smart of course I just was fucked up I think this job just does it to everybody I don't think anybody gets gets out of this one alive I mean look at Donald Trump's hair it's already getting kind of white yeah but it's all painted yeah the real color that stuff is it's probably all white it's probably just given out fuck it not going in today like so it's ER today's die day no no it's a Cheetos in the couch day fuck you golf I'm gonna watch Fox News they gonna tell me one wasum he just sits there stroking it watching Fox News Fox News loves them it's interesting to see white one one Network just going full gung-ho we're gonna go trump all the way yeah supposedly that's why he's like getting involved with that merger of Time Warner or what everything get rid of CNN or something this is oh god that's crazy if that really happens yeah that's the idea right like Time Magazine's being bought out AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner yeah little company or something dude these gigantic companies see the thing is I don't know shit about this net neutrality thing I don't I need to know more about it because I need to know if in some way here's the real scary thing that everyone who owns a giant company would be able to control their own internet like you would have like a network like you would be on you'd be on the Verizon internet thing and he'd be on Comcast like oh you're on Comcast ah you can't go to my website shit yes that's what we don't want them there's there's a there's an article I tweeted the other day we're on the I think LA Times or something like that where somebody a woman who works for the FCC wrote like like please don't let us do this you know like I read that and there's there's a website you can go to where it's automated where you can put in your information and it will write an email or a letter to the FCC so I recommend doing that I mean there's there's it's okay I think we have like 10 days till they vote on this see that's what's crazy this is this should be something because this is a very important issue this should be something that's debated on primetime television absolutely I need it really should be I mean all of these kind of really crucial crucial this is where you stop listening to me personal memory all these crucial issues they should all be discussed in the like the public forum they should be discussed in like the center of the town that's what these shows should be like what's CNN and any of these shows should be part of what they should be is like a town center where people talk about these like super important ideas this is an important idea that needs to be like they need to interrupt television shows for this because we might be signing off on a terrible idea and we might be letting companies get away with having more and more control over us I don't know I need to go look at it I need to really look at it carefully but we all need to look at it carefully if this is really happening in ten days the average person is not gonna have it the time nor the ambition to go and investigate this yeah scary think Jamie there's there's another thing that happened to that they're voting on I think this week monsters the another problem it is - there's five people on that panel of the FCC board that that does make these decisions it's usually one person that's the flipping vote that makes it a 3-2 vote it's never like 500 which one showed up in the solid gold Bentley which one got out his next covered in lipstick there's this guy the FCC wants to relax one of the broadcast media's biggest rules has to do with like a small like a small city what having one company owned the TV station in the newspaper in that area which is like a media rights issue oh so they want that to come back they were trying to like yep stop the rule that prevented that or like redo the vote but I get that rule I get that rule but the problem is like if you're if you want to open I mean it's also I get the idea that you should be able to open as many companies as you want there should be some sort of fair competition but the problem with like fair competition in the news it's like in the news you don't always want to get the most ratings like you want to like report like an app like an honest account of all the issues that are actually happening but you can't do that if you want to sell ads you got you got to be spicy you got to go to that fucking fire quick get to that fire let's see you'll see the car accidents like these chases yeah please chases a shit we interrupt this basketball game to show you a guy that's never getting away from the cops did you see the Oregon one what the you know I'm talking about there's one in Oregon recently and it that was the craziest thing ever he was like going through fields bring up a second ago called shot in the dark it just came on Netflix it's sort of like the TV show version of the Nightcrawler movie so it's following some news crews around Los Angeles every night while they're going to find these like crazy news stories and they actually the first episode they catch a parked car on the ten and a they're like thinking a it's gonna be an accident real bad and literally like five seconds later boom fireball guys to go save the guy pull him out of the room like burning car whoa there's really intense um but that's just happening all the time - and the news that they're catching and so I saw last night when I was watching the news popped up there's another thing hostage situation but some guy got paid 500 bucks for going to find video of this it's real weird mm-hmm do you ever see that night what was that movie Nightcrawler Nightcrawler yeah that was great movement how dare you alright for my movie my past cocoa have you seen cocoa yet no cocoa Coco's the the new Pixar movie with it's all about you know Mexican holiday Day of the Dead you know I did see one other Mexican day the Dead movie it was crazy where they went to this other dimension yeah that's Coco but I saw this is this a second one no this is the first one you might have saw it earlier though no I saw it on like I T on iTunes on Apple TV there was another one sinteres there's another crazy-ass movie with Day of the Dead characters that I watched recently in the book of life that's it the book of life dude it's fucking amazing you haven't seen this no is that just a hole up like a trailer because the animation is fucking insane it's so why wait this is it so this is like wooden people and then they they get somehow another taken into this other dimension and in this other dimension it's like they're on drugs man dude this looks like the same characters of no no see this is like oh why is no one talked about this yet I have no idea this is sort of like when they did those two would you go what is this another now here's that new one so what yeah but go back to that one cuz it didn't quite go totally freaky yet they can start getting really freaky towards the end square mold Deltora uh yeah see this is where they they're entering into this other dimension and everything is like super bizarro like the people are weird it's really strange like everyone's dead it's so bizarre that and that's exactly what Coco's had but it's like remember that when deep impact and Armageddon came out at the same time like somehow know that somebody figured out like hey these day that dead things are dope look there's two other ones that volcano movie and then like Tommy Lee Jones was in one and then Pierce Brosnan was in one but there were like two movies about volcanoes and they came out like the same week in LA and one was not once next earthquake movies like look at this new dimension that he enters into same shit yeah this is the same shit it's exactly that that's I can't believe no one's talked about this or weird man this is like more dead people and the other one was more like bizarro weird wow this is pretty bizarro dead people I mean look at this yeah it's like they find like a Bugs Bunny and you know whoa we're gonna have our own bunny our Bunny's name is Tim Daffy and Donald yeah Daffy Duck and Donald Duck like hey which one was Martin which one is Warner Brothers Daffy I was a Daffy guy Donald Gaza og though and they were the only ones that have the balls to have a hunter dead like a bunch of moon Elmer Fudd yeah and then a bunch of other mean hunters and some of their movies like the Bambi movies a mean hunter it's a bunch of other ones me may 9th but the Elmer Fudd that was like the first dumb white guy you could mock in a cartoon wasn't he no I think they had a lot of dumb white people you can mock he's knew the first homer Fudd like the rabbit gets away all the time the rabbit like treats him like a bitch like you fucking dummy you're never gonna get me like he's never threatened bug explained he's never threatened by Elmer Fudd he's a rabbit and somehow another Elmer Fudd is so fucking stupid an Elmer Fudd wants to shoot this talking rabbit he's such an asshole look at that it's wabbit season he's got a giant head like a baby like what is that suppose he have a baby boy head weight homer fun is an enormous baby head I never even noticed that he's like a baby with a gun what's the other one that was Elmer and then there was another one that you looked exactly like Elmer but it wasn't Elmer it was a Gomer and that's right there was another was another guy there was another dude who was the other guy I always thought that was strange like yeah there's more than one hunter right yeah was the other guy it was like the second mr. Roper changed Darin and B which do you have exact change the husband the husband got crazy and he asked for money and they're like mmm nah bitch no no no we got a new dad he's like well I'm a cold star of the show no no it's I Dream of Jeannie motherfucker nobody cares her Darrin is just house yeah they pulled the fucking cord the floor dropped out he disappeared I don't think there was another hunter yeah there was that it was another dude there's another dude didn't have another buddy with him might be like one particular cartoon that maybe his brother showed up or something they were hunting together he we were who scored in the fake homer yeah I solved that a long time ago but that one freak people out just like it should have been a different name yeah you dummies wear that Shazam movie where who was it yeah Kenny says hey what are those called when people like collective memory it was called fake collective memories those are super common chronic coupling yeah those are super common apparel the Mandela effect yes that's it that's right yeah that's simulation shit yeah um so we were talking about this Elsa gate thing yes this is this is weird now this is not a conspiracy theory ladies and gentlemen so before you go oh I can't believe the show used to make sense you're sorry - son listen there's something going on where they're making these YouTube clips and they play like you know how if you watch if you watch a YouTube clip say on the brand-new 2019 Corvette zr1 like I'm a car freak I love watching those videos like wow gofast look at it go what a beast if you just let that play it'll YouTube will suggest another Corvette movie or video and play that maybe a video on a shootout between a couple different types of cars see what handles better and then you'll just keep playing like car videos because it thinks you're on that loop well somewhere along the line if you're on a kid's loop you can get looped into one of these Elsa gate videos now some of them like the one Brian showing me is like really shitty CGI Second Life and it's like these cartoon characters get together and they become like sexualized and they drink sometimes and the babies keep getting their heads busted open like the babies fall and the beer bottle flies through the air and hits the baby in the head and cuts the baby's head open and Bloods all over the place and that one happens all the time it repeats itself over and over and over again that same scene in a bunch of different weird cartoons with like babies and baby animals and you know there's anthropomorphize asian videos where it's like you know the wolf has a bunch of pigs with him and shit and the pigs get drunk like that kind of shit but there's like hundreds and hundreds of them and YouTube is they had to be alerted of this stuff you know people we're watching them with their kid and it would go on autoplay and your one-year-old is also watching a beer bottle fly through the hair and head and fly through the air rather and bash a baby on the head and cause a big gash have you seen any of those I've seen yeah I just cuz I used to watch the ones that you know the Second Life ones where it's just ridiculous like this stuff is crazy it's weird I didn't even know about this they dress up in these cartoons they have little babies that are dressed up like spider-man or like Elsa and like this this scene keeps happening over and over again where they have beer they get fucked up and then as the baby falls the beer bottle bounces off his head and shatters and lands on the ground and the baby's bleeding it happens over and over again and so in this one with the minions a little baby minions they fall BAM gets cut in the head it's the same scene here's the Mickey Mouse one little babies get fucked up they fall beer bottle hits the baby in the head there's another one with little foxes they get fucked up beer bottle hits the kid in the head it's always the same shit it's stupid it's not just stupid it's weird yeah it is which is weird because it's not it's not just things happen and it's it's the same violent scene over and over again and the babies are the ones that are getting brutalized in these they're getting hit in the head with beer bottles giant gashes blood like what is that yeah it's almost like that what's that yeah the the YouTube crap or the that you used to be really popular where they would just edit things together real fast and and with like ah like screaming it yeah what was that shit called but that was user-created that was a bunch of people like you could see those people doing them they just decided to try to talk real fast and cut out all the breaths in between it right and glama together like you have no attention span whatsoever mm-hmm now this stuff like in what we're watching now I feel like they're all they're all using the same characters right so it seems like to me it's from a message board it's like when we were back in the day on your message board and we would like make all these videos and stuff like that it seems like it's from a group of people that all are doing it you know collectively like to me it seems like like we'll find like a deep 4chan thread in it or something we're like oh I did the baby falling that video or something no there's a bunch of different ones man I mean there's there's this was like with real people but the ones that you're talking about with the the cartoon ones they're being made in other countries are they they're not speaking English in any of them it's all like noises and stuff and they're generating like if they're ad friendly and some of them were approved for ads they're generating a tremendous amount of money right yeah think about how many hits these fucking things are getting and how am I like see if you could pull up one and see how many millions of hits Hadad yeah I just pulled up at five million five million okay so five million hits is the business all right if you got ads on a video for little kids it gets five million hits that's a business now if you've got those things and they're generating them by computers so you're making hundreds and hundreds of them and you put them all over the internet and they all have five million hits each you're talking about a substantial amount of money that you're getting every month and they're just making these things and then the real fucked up thing is like apparently there's some again I just read the beginning of this and then never read any further into it but reddit how to thread apparently where these people were trying to decipher some of the things that are being said in the comments and they think that they're using the comments as like ways where child trafficking people can communicate with each other this is like speculation which sounds like wow that seems far-fetched but doesn't child trafficking sound far-fetched I mean you know it's real all right Charl trafficking sounds crazy far-fetched like the idea that someone's so evil that they're selling children right doesn't it well that doesn't it yeah so if that is then why wouldn't it be that they would communicate I mean is it more far-fetched that they communicate in code in some sort of way in the comments yeah because they probably wouldn't do it on kid videos that probably do it on like just like any video like tractor it could be a video source oh yeah I think yeah it could be maybe they're not that smart that's where the trauma Lester's right but but also that like these wild kids are not gonna make comments so who's making comments on these videos it to me again it seems like it's a it's a group of people somewhere and it's making these now the fact that YouTube's letting sell it as kids they need to change YouTube needs to change how they have kid videos kid videos should have a team of people you get approved then you become you know 40 kids that's it they you can't just upload anything and put the kid tag on it the kid yeah kids find out about it yeah you when you give your kid the response yeah when you give your kid like the iPad and you put on YouTube kids that should be selected videos only it's been approved by eyeballs and and so on I should not be able to make a kid video you know that's true and definitely not be able to make kid video where a kid gets hit in the head with a fucking bottle right now if that shit was like just on it like once somewhat one of us did it we're like I just made all these stupid videos of kids falling down on the ground and it wasn't for kids then you'll be like that's just a stupid cartoon that you would see on like Adult Swim or something like that 4:00 in the morning right in there you could see something like that on Adult Swim especially especially the ones that I watched those stupid ones that could actually be like some sort of an in like something that what's that called what's inner spliced inside of a show or like a non-sequitur video comes in and right what's that called it's like an Adult Swim cartoon where you're like what the commercial were commercial yeah I don't know where that's just it just get stuck in there where the Mickey Mouse daddy is drinking with the babies the babies fall gets hit in the head with a bottle like what the fuck and cut to some wolf that's telling you about the past Robot Chicken a lot just a real quick 15-second thing anyway what was that what is the word interstitial what does that word I don't know there's a talking about it blank interstitial that was Matthew McConaughey was in that too but he was in this uh he was in The Dark Tower movie he was the bad guy Matthew McConaughey's bad guy I know I could think it was all I could think of was Louis CK's bit about Mad Mike and Louis CK's bit about Matthew McConaughey do you member it and he's like the law says you can't touch but I see a lot of law breakers out here absolutely does his impression he talks about how he he was he loved the movie so much he was walking around his house saying that banging over and over and over again so when I was watching this movie Matthew McConaughey is the bad guy all I could think of is louis ck's bit don't have things a lot of long buggers out here that's all I could think of that fucking happens mad that happens where a good comic will do a bit about something and like that oh that subjects ruined he's got me every time I see Matthew McConaughey I think there's a lot of HBO pulled all the louis c.k shit offline today really yeah okay that seemed silly it's still funny comedy wasn't jerking off in front of anybody when he did the comedy like just like you can't invalidate everything everybody's ever done if they did something bad it's not good that he did it but it's kind of fucked up that they did that even though he you know the the situation of him asking permission and him omitting it and coming out and apologizing but yet then there's that that masterson Scientologist guy that all his shows are on there and then there's like real war people do you think that those are real those stories are real I think a lot of them are real yeah I really do I mean like why haven't they done something if that story's real that seems like that one would be something that would get a lot of attention something happened yesterday and I guess sports world in the Ohio State world to the so the defensive coordinator who used to be an NFL coach was rumored earlier yesterday afternoon I think maybe even Saturday that he was gonna be hired as the new head coach for Tennessee's football team they were going to make the announcement yesterday evening I believe but at some point after the agreement had been signed it hit the media in Tennessee and there was protests in front of the stadium all of their fans and alumni were pissed that this was gonna happen someone outed that he was on the Penn State team he was one of the assistants to Jerry Sandusky Oh so the tying to that although he's already been vetted by Ohio State like he's already the coach there and Urban Meyer's team has vetted them and backed him and all that so before the night was over they already canceled his contract well and now he's I think even gonna sue them for money that he was supposedly gonna be owed because he probably he could have already got rid of his house like in that day because he believed you know so all sorts of things happened and just it was like literally 24 hours or less that how close did he work that Jerry Sandusky I don't know because he was an assistant of like he was younger there's other there's a couple other coaches on there that claim to not know anything too I believe man and so there's some other people like Kirk Herbstreit all tweeting out last night that this was a like do you really think that you should do this with no evidence there is no evidence in this case apparently right and like he's lost it doesn't have that job opportunity now I guess I think you need a real investigation before you commit something like that I mean I don't know the case he might have not known it's possible that he didn't know but if you didn't know it don't you think there would be like a story you'd hear something meltdown over potential hiring of Greg Schiano is a bad look for Tennessee program hmm what's a bad look hmm but I don't know what him see I don't know what the fuck is going on if you knew that this guy knew then you would have this feeling like hey fuck that guy but if you if you knew that he didn't know you'd be furious he'd be like no you're labeling an innocent man and saying he's a bad person if there's needs to be an investigation if there has been an investigation you got to accept the results otherwise you're on a witch-hunt like you got to figure out what's really happened I don't know see I don't know the particulars but if you know the particulars you know and you you're you got to make a case for it he's like look at how Franklin I like it like that little picture of him like I'm like he's grabbing that girl's boobs and then you see that all this stuff that comes out about her after where it's like oh she's she was like groping all these people the whole time and we didn't know yeah if there was a fake news no dude I didn't see any of that there's video he apologized for what he did though like I mean what he was doing was trying to be funny he tried to be funny taking the picture and he wasn't even uh he was a comedian back then it wasn't even a state representative but either way it's like you don't do that that could be your mom it could be your sister she's out cold it sound like it's your girlfriend you're joking around it's one thing it was your girlfriend if your girlfriend's out and you take a pitch like and you be silly right she loves you that's your girlfriend she knows it's a joke it's like I've heard she takes a picture like sitting next to your dick while you're unconscious she goes like this huh it wouldn't be upset right right um but she wasn't his girlfriend she was working he was working they're always doing this charity tour and she said that he tried to kiss her it was like it was more than one thing so he apologized for that and then there was the other women that were saying that he grabbed her butt well you should dance to that he said that was just like you know when you're taking photos and he said the one girl said like he put his hand on my butt I mean when you're taking a photo you just put your arm around somebody maybe it touches your butt I be I be old dudes like to grab butts too though it's an old dude thing George Bush george w bush likes to take picture with people around as they go to take the picture he squeezes their ass but that might be like some old Texas man thing is plus he's almost dead leave him alone like people have to realize he's the longest living president ever at this point he's the oldest one yeah no no he sounds old oh yeah Herbert Walker but she's older than Carter I think right now he's the oldest surviving president as what they say but Carter is the Lawtons longest ago that he was president yeah man he's almost dead like he's gonna grab asses he's going for it and see that's that's what's also ridiculous look if you if you became like like a president or something like that and then you went through all the photos you've ever taken with fans after a show or at shows like that you could take any of those photos my oh my God look he's making a blowjob face to a woman under the age of 16 yeah if you freeze everything you know people take so many pictures they're taking pictures when you're not looking in your mouths open yeah but it's like I think that those old dudes just grabbed asses I think that's what's coming out they just thought it was a thing they'd get away with they grabbed asses when they took pictures they probably grab yours do ya look in your finger you know totally it's probably a joke sports I don't think anyone really slaps butts anymore it used to be a thing all the time with a black butts they slap butts there was a video that Morgan Murphy posted yeah it looks like I think it's on her Instagram and it looks like some dude comes from behind or a referee and smacks his buddy in the ass and the guy like goes yeah like see if you can find it it's on Morgan Murphy's Instagram from I think yesterday I think soccer players constantly do crazy shit like grabbing each other's dicks and shit whoa it happens in football but that's like gonna scrum they're not like a friendly this is two referees this videos are referee doing it to another referee it's hot this is watch this so this guy all times yeah they talked to each other and watch the guy comes by that's another thing barely pay attention Aaron said to me hoping that it was a black pitch that's why I freaked out look at things I'm like just show me any reason why this is more exciting than it really is Wow just seen a guy get hit in the face of the flag my brain was like not good enough yeah not good enough I've been drunk for five days you guys yeah did vacation and just got hammered every night was wonderful wine drunk wine yeah wine why just put you out man like I don't know how the fuck the barbarians invaded countries on wine just seems like they would have no ambition like wine just makes you so tired we're lucky they didn't know about like whiskey imagine the barbarians had whiskey instead of wine there's been way bloodier I can't I haven't done wine in a while it gives you a pussy about bad morning I think yeah there's something going on right where you get like a weird headache sometimes I've talked to people about that I never got a satisfactory explanation that I find upper men remembering yeah I bet that's it I bet it's like eating a lot of cake he eat a lot of cake man you get that fucking feeling the next day like what did I do I didn't watch anything I hate all week eight whatever the fuck I wanted to eat that's my go to vacation move now yeah yeah cuz then you come back you feel so bad that you want to like get back on a diet and be like real cautious and that's why I'm gonna do this no wheat nope no pasta no sugar work out five days a week two drinks a week that's it I've been trying to eat steak a lot just just steak like steak kebabs those aren't my thing dude watch his wheat documentary you'll throw pizza away forever no more sandwiches Pete's no more burgers I mean I can't wait for the meat doctor to come on soon right yeah yeah the meat down under better way to describe yeah the carnivore he's a full carnivore it's all he does is eat meat he thinks he's been he's a like this crazy proponent of meat eating only there has to be badger study or something right cholesterol I don't know it seems like it would be he's super fucking lt though I just I don't know I mean I think one thing is like I would think you would need some nutrients from vegetables right and there's some things you can only get from vegetables but then are you getting any of that from me because they eat vegetables like that's the idea it's like lions don't really eat a lot of salads they just fuck up zebras you know and zebras they do plenty of salad eating for the lion and the Lions are good you know they don't really have to eat it on their own and if that blueberry affects the bear meat so much that it changes the shape and color and taste of it then it not all the shape I didn't mean that put like that definitely yeah changes the color and the taste of the meat it would only make sense that you're getting something from the grass when you eat a steak which is why grass-fed steak is better for you like proven for you then corn-fed steak because corn is basically sugar I mean well it's not good when you shit and you see hey that's not even digested like what 3z corn in your shit cuz that your body's like what am I doing with this this guy's eating plastic just spit this out that's such a weird thing you're assholes just like yeah get it out we're never gonna try to process it we're not gonna break it down did I tell you a long time ago I think I already told you this but back in the day when like Hands Across America and all that shit we were supposed to write in school like how do we help starvation and stuff like that if we have any ideas and I wrote about I always just feed everyone corn and then they could wash it off the next day and eat it like a few more times and I got in trouble for that like my mom had the brains always been gross my mom's like had to get called in and it's stuff like that because of that and I was thinking like well you can eat it twice like that's like makes sense to me like it's untouched well do you know that some Native Americans used to call it a second harvest and they stay eat their own shit really yeah see yeah yeah read that somewhere I think they cooked it or something they call it Second Harvest and you gotta be hungry as fuck oh by the way the person who told me this might have been crazy might have made this up I'll remember who it was I'm trying remember oh okay it was one of the Wardrobe ladies on Newsradio she told me that I was like what she seemed pretty cool so I just listened to her and back then you couldn't really look anything up yeah I haven't is it true confirmed by urban dictionary but hashtag whoa anyone could add to urban dictionary that doesn't mean it's real a method developed by Native Americans to conserve as much food as possible during deadly winters the act involved sitting through sifting through Oh feces for chunks of corn and nuts sleeping wolf my little bear your poo is rich with the Second Harvest that's not real connected now to a group of all right furries I am I'm investigating I'm a journalist I told you earlier today and I'm investigating all right furries because white white people who go crazy who are very reactionary and quick to jump the gun and call everybody a racist wrote this article about trib I'm an awful white person run it I just assumed probably wasn't about these Nazi furries like neo-nazi furries well the obscure subculture of furries has a problem with neo-nazis any groups of sexual abuse there's a lot of Nazis I mean cut the fucking shit please just please cut the shit please please I can't I can't keep going I can't I can't keep going it's just too crazy every day it's more and more fucking weird this stuff I get and I think this is the same people that watch those YouTube videos or make the YouTube videos I think the people who make the YouTube videos dude I think it's just like their lit there in Asia or somewhere like that and they have a script and they just keep doing the script over and over and we're looking for like hidden messages in the script I think the scripts probably just fucked up they think it's fucked up to have a cartoon character hit himself in the head with a bottle and I think you're probably right like maybe these fucking child predators maybe they communicate on all sorts of different websites maybe they just decide like hey let's meet on this tire forum and we'll just say things in code and a tire means this it wasn't that always the shit with pizza gate like they thought that they were talking in code like all the conspiracy theorists thought that a slice of pizza meant like a kid and the YouTube one I mean the them beings there's being so many of them sort of says that there's money in it yeah they've tapped into the algorithm and they're just beating it to death yeah and they just have the same script and they just do it with a computer change one more thing a little thing here and there and that's what I think it is I think it's not as nefarious as everybody likes to think but it's really fucking weird to keep seeing the same video playing out over and over again when the bottle flies through the hair and the baby gets hit in the fucking heads utilize so I think that weird it was a little weird or when it's people actually people doing it you can't just have a computer make it people are goddamn nuts they're nuts and they're out there I like furries uh III get that I I have a bunch of outfits that I make videos with and stuff and that's pretty much what that is that's just icicle II cross-play like any role play yeah there's having fun yet having fun they don't feel like normies right I say alright yeah and I'm sure having sex like that it's probably fine that's kinky like hey you're dressed up as my pretty pony and I'm spider-man a lot of dude-on-dude crime underwear of these hats they're wearing fucking weird animal hats and they're boning each other okay why not man B you know why cuz this is crazy so why not why to do it why not do it see just like a fox and you're fucking each other and the Fox is fucking the chicken why not why really why not I just I don't know why not I can't tell you why not why is it okay that people wear crazy fake eyelashes and extensions in their hair and they pump fat into their ass and put silicone bags and their tits why is that okay but it's not okay to dress like a big chicken and get fucked by a big rooster mm-hmm alright why isn't it why can't you pretend to be like a Fox in the henhouse right why not like if long as everybody agrees like do you agree to be the Fox okay cool dog I'm gonna be the Bulldog mascot the big Bulldog head we're gonna bones they're gonna make some some rendevouz why the fuck not why not yeah I'm down for that they should do whatever they want I mean I dress my grow up as a schoolgirl you know guess she's Asian dress her up like a anime schoolgirl oh oh do I where would it be the boner with a big fake head on big anime eyes you're kind of crazy oh the fake ponytail I got her I got her some tentacles the other day wow tekna-cool buffalo that's the weird things like tentacle porn how did that ever take off member that was the thing like when we first found out about tentacle porn I remember like collectively the internet was like what wait a minute how much of this stuff is existing come on how much is out there what the fuck is going on Japan tentacle porn was a loophole for bestiality before insertion because you can't show insertion yeah see like energy fines away you know it finds the weakest link and it makes its way through you can't suppress it that's why I like well you see with Catholic priests that's why you see in this you can't show penetration huh huh huh okay how about Krakens with a dick on the end of every octopus arm and they're banging eight different school girls how about that good cool here's the here's the magazine Thanks they're all schoolgirls Japan is so weird man yeah like big veiny dicks that are like ripping their lower jaw out that's just coming out of an octopus so it's okay have you seen their game show called like slippery stairs I wonder what the like the cheating would be how would you cheated slippery stairs seemingly someone in America would figure out a way to buck the system right I would say it would have something to do with pulling the other guys down and right yeah I don't think you can touch them though I don't think so can you yeah I think if he did I think people would just get ahead and you would never let anybody get close to you but I think the problem is for people listening oh my god he was there he took everybody like a bowling ball this is amazing it's amazing and then the other guy went down to the guy was ahead of them he got cocky and he fell all the way back yeah this is a great show that looks fun looks like a they should call it like a tooth the chipper or something like that who would be a good host of those you know who'd be a good host Tony here's good host hey guys get up this stance I would love it dude Japanese game show cuz they won Jesus Christ yeah yeah yeah Koreans and Japanese people don't get along so it'd be even better yeah let's go to be people mad at him did you know that Koreans and Japanese people have a sordid history oh yeah absolutely you know oh Jesus Christ to speed skating down out like a slope oh my god this is insane well I saw there's the two other sports and this was one of them and

the edge I hope people don't smack them what's this called ice loads lazuli crack crashed ice I think is what it's called but it's like speed oh this is insane it's like a downhill hockey speed cross x-type I don't know it's real weird event just a matter of time before somebody figure something like this out right yeah like eventually people just make things crazier and crazier like this is way better than like a lot of shows like just look at this right now just the just the intensity of this race and now compare this to golf right if you watch golf on TV this is riveting like this is way more riveting than people racing cars isn't it people stopped playing football they're gonna want to do something crazy yeah this might be it roller derby downhill pretty much but this is an agility thing you know like Wayne Gretzky was not a big guy but he had incredible agility on the ice but you have to be like one of those badass hockey players like Bieber its Bieber occupy oh yeah Justin Bieber yeah yeah imagine if he became like the top dog and this stuff just people are so mad at him you little punk you can't be good at this too piece of shit he's also spawn sex under it's also

branding branding that's disgusting Peru has that he's a top UFC light heavyweight he's got that uh like one of the fraternity things at his arm he's a football player yeah Tennessee yeah he does I think too many wins sometimes yeah he makes the what is it it's the say it's Thursday it's a lot of basketball players used to do it I think Michael Jordan is also in that frat fraternity shit they do they band of all fraternities in Ohio State the other day too much rape yeah it happened yet it just get to rape and all shut down there that's crazy hey all the hazing or something was going probably that they should never have fraternities anyways well you're guaranteeing some crazy shits gonna go down it's like you're just gonna you're gonna have to have some sort of an agreement like how much crazy shit you're gonna allow because if you're gonna let a bunch of dudes who are just starting to have boners all live together in a house they have a house like they let girls in can they let girls in they can open the door girls can come in can they drink they can okay what the fuck are you doing you got a bunch of people that are dudes shacked up with other do they smell each others butts getting crazy together all fucking drinking watching movies of every bachelor party every fucking fraternity movie ever were you get a group of guys together every fucking what is the The Hangover The Hangover is another example every time you get a bunch of guys together fucking chaos chaos every single movie you get 10 guys together they go somewhere it's out of control people getting punched someone gets shot always right so imagine you're letting these 18 year olds it's not even now to control their bodies yeah you're barely in the thought you can't believe you can think for yourself you can decide when to wake up your parents aren't there with you anymore finally your dad is not fucking pissed at you because you forgot to mow the lawn let fuck you dad I'm not here to mow your lawn bro okay the next thing you know a bunch of dudes are just like you and you're all drunk and girls come over they're drunk too like holy shit this is the best lore about life make some mistakes you are in France right you know frat parties were crazy though I mean there whatever like hookers there that's all the drugs you need to prove saw-like drugs you're like what the hell there's drugs here the most the closest to a frat I live with two dudes once and they're good guys sort of one of them was a little fucked up but it was uh just how much I men together like that just super sketchy it's not necessary it's super sketchy you can go you can go bad but bunch of young guys I remember hearing stories of it wasn't even a frat but it was like the ski clubhouse at Ohio State would have 30 kegs at their parties on Saturday yeah there's 15 people living in a house what good that's not good Plus Alka + liquor + yeah plus all the other things yeah man when you get a bunch of people living together and especially when you're young you make shitty decisions and then the three of you are making shitty decisions are the four the five or the 10 all like the same age all just as dumb all fucking trying to outgrow each other all-out hammered come on you know and then on the other side you got some crazy bitch you've only got away from our dad and she's fucking Jeff and nobody tell me shit and everybody just figures out life together we should keep sororities definitely they have sorority still at Ohio State right because they're late mouths got I think oh really I only heard I only heard fraternities I think so right he's like good about dorm rooms I mean dorm rooms what about that dorms are crazy everybody know dorms are crazy they're just not this the thing about dorms is you have to join right dorms are like more egalitarian because like you can have a bunch of people they like different things they're the different interests different they're just different men and women different parts of the world everybody lumped together in this dorm they all just can't really afford an apartment and I'll living together in this University setting but it could be anybody your new roommate could be anybody share a bathroom with everyone yeah that one shit in the news recently where that woman was didn't they didn't get along in a dorm and so the woman was like putting her toothbrush in her ass and she started getting sick and they found out that she was doing all this shit Oh how'd they find out hidden camera toilet cam no I don't sued because she got in the films nothing something in her ass white woman arrested for torturing black students she called Jamaican Jamaican Barbie whoa she admitted to it on Facebook or something like that oh yeah she's a thousand people rallied at UCLA and sent fired to a trump pinata unrelated story it's unrelated I mean it's showing up on here but at the video so this is all just about various pieces of racism that people are finding huh that's crazy man that's fucked imagine sticking someone's toothbrush in your asshole and then watching them brush teeth with it clam dip in our oceans yeah I've been used tampons on her backpack for a month oh my god that's what she did she like did crazy shit to this poor girl you probably wanted to it's just probably like fighting off the gay guys look at this and then she tweeted about it oh my god she treated it yeah come on I can finally say goodbye to Jamaican Barbie oh my god make that a little bigger finally I did it yo girl got rid of her roommate after one and a half month of spitting in her coconut oil putting moldy clam dip in her lotions rubbing used tampons on her backpack putting her toothbrush in places where the Sun doesn't shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye jamaican Barbie she said she was making that up as part of her defense but whether or not she's I don't know couple weeks ago yeah see the thing is like you might think it'd be funny to say something like that and make it up and it might be made up that's true you might think it's funny to make but boy did you fuck up by saying that I could make something like that up and then put on the internet where anybody can find out about it that's that seems crazy I guess you can you know test your toothbrush and stuff like that for but every just look you have the time test of your toothbrush for but juice everything well has it yeah that's one of those things people just don't test for you know test your toothbrush see if it's been someone's asshole just a lot of things I'm thinking about it's not one of them yeah that's how bad they hated each other with that girl and want to stick a toothbrush eyebrows bitch eat my shit well that's a sick type of person will sit there and watch you brush their teeth mmm with their asshole juices good weekend the gums getting the gums allegedly hmm I wonder if she did it she did do it that's a sick bitch mmm imagine that isn't a thought that has to go through your head to do something like that maybe she didn't realize how gross other people would find it that's the crazy thing is that she told everybody like people have probably been doing that to each other forever right isn't the first thing she did or like it's just a slow build-up right deep she goes you know she's just like this is a spin brush oh right to the lower ribs Rod's at the lower ribs and she's she's got the toothbrush like this with her fingers well she's like barely got the bottom of the toothbrush she's knuckle deep in her own asshole and she really has the bottom of the toothbrush and you just got to kind of use her shit muscles to force it out where she could pinch down on and pull it out sometimes she has to do it over and over and again man imagine you had a drink prune juice truck get that tooth brush out your asshole and you got a key you don't want to hit the wall coming out and then bounce back up so you got to really open it wide so like you're probably gonna have to wear like lawn gloves you know like Lube your asshole up and they just wear like some of them gloves you wear when you like cleaning bundles of sticks and shit those you know those ones be nice ways yeah pulling your butt apart trying to get that toothbrush out and right when it gets out you hear the keys in the door back and put it in the glass clink you shut the door and just wash a toothbrush off real quick but you got to dry it too because I though I should pick her toothbrush I forgot why the fuck is my toothbrush already wet like if you put toothpaste on a wet toothbrush you know that's a fucking wet toothbrush you're looking down that thing it looks different why is it when you feel with your finger you know wow it's cold and wet what the fuck who was just using my toothbrush you think about I'm gonna work for nine hours how the fuck is my toothbrush not dry it would be dry you smell it it's a ninja potent eh it smells like roundup garage got some lawn spray do you see that new thing that's uh you put in your mouth and it brushes your teeth for you yeah in 30 seconds brush your teeth is it better I don't know it's an interesting idea that but like you know you could just put it in your mouth in the car or something like yeah and and 30 seconds later I don't know how proven it is and it seems like it would get down now and it's just weird I wonder how much of an impact fluoride in the water has on preventing tooth decay if any I've been reading about fluoride in the water and it's so hard to figure out who's nuts this 10 second automatic toothbrush could save you hours every year she's hot I hope she brushed her teeth I'll put that even pussy hurt No imagine her breath smell that she's that pretty I would suck look and if she goes this is like a ball gag this is like if you were gonna like practice strengthening your neck you'd bite down on that thing and attach that rope to like a bungee cord like the iron neck device I think that thing that you chew down strengthens your next make sense do this guy go back to that guy like come on bro I don't care how much they're paying you for this he's the same one and his girlfriend comes by kisses him on the cheek and leaves like he doesn't have time to get a good kiss on the lips because YouTube is he's sucking on this robot dick this thing is just cleaning out your face how about you brush your teeth like a fucking normal person maybe have the newspaper open beside you I just wonder if it's better I mean that dedication here's my question is it better to go to the car wash or wash your car by hand hmm hmm of course it's better to wash your car by hand that's why hand washing cost more money well it depends what carwash you get what's better what's better to give your teeth the attention they deserve and go over each one with a fine brush or suck the robot dick and it cleans your teeth out hmm there should be just a save time or not I don't know it's good question yeah but how much time should you save and how much time should you like I've been reading a lot about meditations from something I'm also considering I'm getting get into during discipline December invitations cool because the tank is not gonna be here for another couple of weeks so I gotta wait so I'm looking for other ways to expand the mind so I'm thinking to do a little

levels of Legion Area bacteria Wow causes Disneyland to shut down cooling towers notice shut down cooling towers not shut down bitch I'm sorry this show must go on 15 people have it when 15 people whole little shit now what it how dangerous is this stuff mmm we removed our reviewed our water quality testing data including testing performed by a third-party water quality maintenance contractor and learned that two cooling towers had elevated levels of Legionella bacteria Legionella a Genoa Legionella bacteria fuckin a man that's like some 28 days later shit right that's where it breaks out but when is it gonna when when are we gonna get a disease it turns people into crazy people yeah some we already have it 28 days later talkin shit though you just get sick from it it sounds like maybe diarrhea or getting the chills fever it's diluted with antibiotics insensitive people hmm well that was this week document are saying that everybody is more gluten sensitive than you realize right

is more compromised than that old yeah the body can't fight it off can't fight off the funk fuck man 52 that's Dean Del Rey's age isn't it weird that that's uh all of us are eventually if you keep going you're gonna be a hundred like if you live like one day you'll be ready if you survive you'll be mean who knows with medicine science you could easily survive wouldn't put all my money and you naked under know I'd be 77 but if you did I mean you never know the idea I'm telling you we're so close to like innovation breakthroughs medical breakthroughs what's this what do you got 55 cases were found in Orange County last year and they don't know why oh my god Orange County has recorded more than 55 cases of the disease this year and has seen the number of cases jump in recent years similar upward trend has been seen naturally and elsewhere in Southern California according to the health care agency though what's causing that is unclear gone down to the two towers ever shut down were in the backstage area more than a hundred feet from the nearest people huh oh that's why only a few people got it huh yeah Wow maybe that we could weak immune system Bishop maybe just some dummy didn't clean the thing he was supposed to clean because he was lazy because he wanted to put on his furry outfit and go fuck go on a furry fuck fest maybe that's what happened how many furries work at distant lands probably all of them ran if you were a furry that'd be a dream job magic and walk around pretend to be goofy go to Goofy's kitchen away with the kids what's happy for security is on top of furry showing up on the park no you won't get them out of here you'd have to use a incognito social media account which all the furries do anyway that I've come across over the last three days of research especially by someone that would be super careful especially the alt fairies to be super careful what's the differences in off all right there all right people they're Trump sport they're fairies furries and maybe fairies too bronies bronies are yeah they're right up there I like bronies now I can get down there own I don't know if that's real by the way if you're if you're an alt furry and you're mad at me now that's not I don't know if it's real I don't know but one guy was called himself fur Nazi yeah that sounds like a troll to me when maybe like but but a lot of this stuff is being silly yeah isn't that I mean what we're supposed to pretend that that's not like the spirit of the internet sometimes that's what got me so mad about that whole Pepe the Frog stuff it's like listen the spirit of the internet isn't fucking with people it has been forever people are bored they're at work they come up with hilarious memes and some of them are really fucked up does that mean that guys are real Nazi or does it mean he's just an asshole who's bored at work and he's mad at everybody it might be that you know I don't know how many of them are like real Nazis and how many of them were just people fucking around that's like the Internet right the Internet is all right like so much of the Internet is people fucking around so hard to tell what's going on in any given moment you know like this flattered thing doesn't change I can't change do you think it'll change do you think that really it'll get to a point where they'll have so much control over the Internet that they'll be able to stop content like that like they'll be closed down like message boards or social media where people are allowed to talk about stuff like this they do it in every other country almost you know they just the main reason they want it is because too many the I mean Netflix takes up like 75% of the bandwidth right now does it really yeah it's like something crazy where all these videos and we're all it's getting to get worse for k-8 k12 so they want to have control of you know if you're gonna use video or if you want they want to like pretty much its that's what I think they're saying or well I kind of get it from their perspective if say they have a limited amount of bandwidth and then one application like Netflix is using up most their bandwidth of paying the same amount of money right I don't know if that's the case though that's the question I'm not sure about is is there a limited amount of bandwidth it seems like there's always been an infinite amount of bandwidth right why would there ever be true socialists I don't army I'm just wondering you're bad for business pipe the pipes might get clogged which could be a thing opening at once yeah I don't really freak me the fuck out when I found out there's a real pipe and goes across the bottom of the ocean and I went wait what so if you send an email from somebody from Australia there's a goddamn pipe as someone laid across the flat ocean of the flat earth all the way the other side if that those people have to be in on the flat earth conspiracy as well by the way why doesn't just go by satellite why have to go through this pipe anyways I don't know it might not be a pipe to Australia but it's definitely a pipe to Japan I believe transatlantic communications cable transatlantic communications cable transatlantic communications cables a submarine submarine communications cable connecting one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other after mid-century coaxial cable came into use with amplifiers late in the century used for optical fibre and most now use optical amplifiers so that's only one cable so anyone that goes probably really big and their motors it can't be just one but this just made me think of something else I wanted to show you that I just found the other day that's kind of scary that has to do with fiber optics time for another episode of Jamie Vernon scares the world someone sent me a link that showed that people can hide a microphone I don't know how big and how well it can listen inside of an Ethernet cable Oh and they're like check all your cables cuz you never know what could happen and they're looking through the tweets of that and it showed there's a link to a company that made a fiber cable and the description of what the fiber cable could do is that it could listen the entire length of the cable and it was sort of saying it was just to be able to listen for like water underground like water pipes that are leaking and things like that but it doesn't say the limit of what it can hear and where it's being used which is alarming could you imagine if it turned out that everything every wire in everyone's house is secretly a microphone and the government has been years ahead with this data and tuning into everything you said at every moment all all your life so here's your phone inside okay saying what that little tiny thing is a microphone oh my god and then where's your God now whoa seriously kids I bet he spells it l33t know if I'll be able to wait turn three seven is leak three three seven oh yeah seven three three one yeah yeah sorry I can't I don't know if I'm gonna go to find this I was like taking a shit I was looking through this deep tweet there's like 5,000 things in here now so but it's a scary thing and the fiber I didn't really know you could even hear audio through fiber that way I know that it's used like the light cable you could use in the back of your any box that little red light that's always on I was looking for a fiber audio cable which is the best but that's how I what Mike Swick told me once Mike Swick was working for the United States government in Russia and they had like a Russian ambassador Russian embassy building you know American u.s. embassy building in Russia and they developed these devices that they found in the walls of the building that were powered by the movement of the building because the move because it's a skyscraper would have a certain my sway through the wind and they had figured out to how to make a device that didn't require any sort of additional power source other than the movement of this building right and it could transmit sound there like this stuff is so far ahead of anything we knew even existed and they were using this in the building to spy on people Mike Swick told me about that in like 2002 and it happened to him way before that so we might be you know who the fuck knows what they can I mean John Edward Snowden this might be the reason why they kept that guy running like because they want to discourage anybody coming out now at any moment we're gonna find out that all of our phones are on 24 hours a day whether they're a de batteries or not there's a certain amount of battery life like your phone retains and the government can listen they know where you are the GPS tracker is tracking your phone whether it's on or off everywhere you go you know a lot of those phones actually do work with GPS when the phone is on airplane mode oh yeah well it's just yeah yeah there's a GPS chip in your phone that's why find your phone works mmm like you can go on Apple find your phone hey my phone's in the Bronx hey leave it there don't get shot but listen there's a that's how they can do that once they take your eyes man they give you those robot eyes it's in the air pod that's in the Apple watch - I'd send all your Apple computers why it's everywhere that's it shit fuck well what if I try to lose me so tell you what I'm digging these ear pods I've been using a lot less fucking awesome okay god I was so skeptical there with me old times you know my favorite thing about him is that the case like you cuz that's one thing I always had both Bluetooth headphones I always like fuck I forgot to charge my head and look at this yeah welcome to the Future bitches yeah yeah nice ticking away I'm even worry about them falling out they don't really fall out they're hard to fall out I had to like then hit it I made him fall out of the gym when I was doing chin-ups because my shoulders touched my ears and I made him fall out and when one goes out the other one stops yeah it's just crazy and if you have the Apple watch - with much no but then you don't need your eye for music no too much you're using your phone just gotta draw lines no it's better for jogging so you have your phone in your pocket when you're listening to music I have a fanny pack there's a neoprene waistband my phone sits in there perfectly car keys it's extra weight bro bro miss dud I'm running with my dog I'm not shaving any second it's doing a lot of calling him trying to get him out of the bushes my dog fucking loves it now I still hates going in the car but he's more reluctant he's less reluctant he gets right up to the car cuz he knows we're gonna go run and he loves running and then when we come back a lot of times I give him a bath - he leaves no leash no leash man always he's really good he really listens he'll wait me obviously he's a something so some fucking goofball in line I posted a video and I've wrapped like a fool I read through some of the comments one of them said don't let him get ahead of you bro you're the Alpha oh yeah I'm like look I hope you're either joking around you may be trolled me you might have told me but you be just a dummy I'm thinking you're probably more of a dummy no I think you let your dog ahead of you when you walk on a leash stupid otherwise you're not your dogs walking you you dumb cunt no you know you're always gonna be in the back see the dogs in front that's the other leash that's where you're wrong Joe you has to walk next to you I mean no because that's what Cesar Millan tells people yeah he doesn't run he's not riding with his dog I run with my dog my dog totally listens to me and when he gets too far go stop dude and he stops like he's smart now go come on back buddy I gotta take a breather like he'll come back and hang out with me like he's I let him off the leash oh I like the fact that he likes to be free he likes to run around I want him to run around he's a sweet dog he's not gonna be mean to anybody you know my new dog is doesn't know how to use a leash and it's been trained to not use a leash but I don't trust it so much because it's like one car honks his horn or something he freaks out and runs into the traffic or something there's cars I always have my leash anytime there's cars that have him on the leash but when I get out of the cars and we go off into the trails you know I mean if people see him he's like the nicest dog ever anybody meets I was like oh he's so sweet you know so it's not like you have to worry about him being dangerous he just likes to run around man it's fun to watch it's like you're watching like a little dog little kid why don't you bring him here so we can look at him well because he's at home likes to be in his yard man go in the pool swam he swims whenever he wants to that'd be funny if you're the new comic that always brings his dog everywhere but you bring a fuckin dog out here man so many people are so stupid with their dogs like their dog is like a baby like they can't leave it alone anywhere Elijah can't leave it anywhere Eliza's I've seen her without the dog occasionally yeah he holds it the husband yeah he cleans out of that thing she's sweet dog she's definitely a super super loved and friendly dog I love Blanche yeah she's awesome I love dogs man you know I mean that's another good argument for not living in the city live somewhere where your dog could be free you know live somewhere we can go out back yard and throw a frisbee for your dog you know go go on hikes goddammit don't be stuck in that red and white horror show of taillights and headlight traffic fuck man yeah what's not gonna be like in 20 years and this shouldn't we be planning for that you know that's just gonna be in the sky this is gonna be like 20 feet up you might have been right with Santa Barbara you know why I think you might have been right because Santa Barbara is only an hour away mm-hmm so you go up there it's an hour away important shit we could always come back drive us in is that how that works then oh yeah just literally want honestly drives us in oh one of them jammies yeah yeah is that gonna happen I think he's just doing LA though he's probably gonna do the Santa Barbara same County right he's probably gonna go right up to San Francisco have you heard of Tesla Loop in Los Angeles where you can just rent a it's like uber excited you have to go to San Diego you rent a it's somebody will drive a Tesla for you and you it's pretty cheap like $49 down to San Diego and you just write in a Tesla 4:49 Ober type thing I don't know when I got to the airport last time I was there it seemed super cheap yeah how they gonna make money the thing is that new sports car they came out with that new roadster goes 600 miles without a recharge now you're talking now I'm interested now I'm listening 600 miles huh City just is not a top speed but you can just go wherever you want to go they go to Los Angeles San Diego Orange County Palm Springs that's crazy yeah that's amazing starts at $29 that's amazing smart smart it's free advertising for the cars people get in them they're like holy shit this thing is nice and then you see that guy giant dashboard you know you got an iPad in your - what is that is it like airplane seat you're biased you could be sitting with other people yeah yeah I mean it's 39 dollars you could buy the seat next to you have a someone who's before a bus that goes every day now from San Francisco to LA that's like an overnight sleeping bus were you sleeping a pod and they have like really yeah obviously not the fastest way to do it but if you need to go overnight you can have that time to rest long as it driver stays away okay that's this guy I mean hope the same with the pilot but the driver sleeping I don't know if it's still an autopilot yeah pilot can adjust but maybe those Tesla buses maybe a Tesla bus like when them big-ass those those big giant trucks these making now yeah put pods in the back of the truck there's only girl under your drives there miles all right so far I think 500 miles I don't think so you go you stop in San Luis Obispo I still carrying batteries charged how long have they charge for yeah what is the distance in miles from LA to San Francisco if you had to guess no no no no not nearly not nearly I would say probably in the 400 it's like 424 7470 you think okay I've never done it you okay you say 800 I say 425 600 you say 475 you say six on it okay that's good it's good bet I don't think it's right though I think it's way less is it from Los Angeles to San Francisco let's see 381 interesting as the crow flies what's that mean that means you have a raven bro and they got straight yeah cuz it's great they go above I'm used to it I thought you fucking city slickers let's go so yeah a regular Tesla can't do that but they said the new one would be able to drive all the way there and back that's not true because that was one of their sayings they said you could drive from San Francisco to LA and back well you definitely couldn't do that because that's more than 600 that's that's more maybe the edge of that County maybe do you Carolee let's a lot stop lying stop lying you're gonna leave me stranded in the desert I'm gonna be somewhere halfway back where there's no water and that stupid piece of shit batteries stop lying just say it's awesome it goes 600 miles don't say you can go to San Francisco and back you can't you should make it they should make it electric cars they should make it wireless charging and then have this have roads be like big mats I think they've talked about - he'll really yeah I think they have talked about doing that it's good they've talked about having people in some sort of tracks where you know you can't change lanes unless like you're in a specific spot and that that track charges the the lane up basically being your own little trolley car it's cool yeah man I think the idea driving your own car though that's on the way out for sure I think we only have like a few maybe a decade or so more of that shit yeah my car just with the Lane Guidance you know that's I did it on the way here I barely drove up from Burbank to here just because of my link my car just drives itself pretty much I just have to put my finger on it so it knows that my fingers on it yeah what do you think man you think like do you think people start moving out of LA you think people will realize they'll look at this and go this is unsustainable I got to get out now what do you think it'll take something like a fucking earthquake or something earthquake or Thanksgiving Hollywood continues to die you know Hollywood's not gonna continue to die well now with the YouTube and people are doing it in their houses you don't need to be in Los Angeles anymore you could people are making shitloads it's a money just from their fucking basement you know that is true I mean and then the tech community is booming in other cities too like Seattle has a huge tech community you still have to come here though so if you're only here for four or five days out of the month what are you considering that why would you come here for I don't know there's a reason why when YouTube started all the big people moved here they didn't have to move here then they're all making money at home well it seems like a glamorous thing to do and YouTube does have offices here yeah but the glamorous thing to do I think is part of it let's come over to LA they made the offices here though cuz everyone was here that's right bitch so well we're here hey why are we here they got a facility here well the one thing that keeps me in what does the Comedy Store there's the podcast and having a great supply of guests and being around all my friends those are the reasons to stay here what we get to just have our mass exodus I'm gonna hit everybody to make enough money when they could just pull up and bail yeah that's what everybody's got to be able to just pull up and bail and just like start a new community we could just all move next to Doug Stanhope you got to make you something I think we go to like Santa Ynez we go to some weird cow country type place where people have their own chickens yeah that's the move now we're like that the purge happens like that and then they have five years into it everyone comes and just kills you and look inside your city you know it's a ghost town fucking be prepared bro it's gonna be like the Dark Tower movie you gotta be prepared when they come let's just move the solving that's not a bad spot if you like to drink a lot of wine yeah right and listen the ladies talk about the health problems and Yama's or llamas or yeah they have like alpacas up there that's right they have to fight off the mountain lines mountain lions come in Jack they're all Paco's mm-hmm yeah there's a there's a bunch of amazing spots up the coast you know it's really interesting we lost like hundreds of yards of Route one from a giant landslide and they still haven't figured out what the fuck to do yeah it's good still right it's still closed yeah they're thinking about putting a road over the landslide but they don't know when and they want to let it settle like hey what we do in word a little if you were driving near that thing you'd be like oh my god oh my god please don't fall please don't fall like those 300 yards or whatever where the landfall was look how big it is late 2018 how far is it how much of a landslide it's oh it's pretty far dude yeah look how tiny those cars are that's hundreds of yards for sure doesn't well pull up just so you can see it it ruined five million cubic yards hold on go back up a little bit five million cubic rained five million cubic yards of rocks and debris on the third of the mile okay so it's one third of a mile wow that's a lot so big you know miles 5,000 feet is that what it is and if I divide by three so it's like holy Sh you need to interface oh my god so they should disconnected a photo again scroll down so good look at how big that fucking slide is just comes off the mountain there's a before and after - will they show the two stages of the landslide they show it before and then they show the second stage and then the third stage where it finally is now it's fucking crazy man mm-hmm Wow yeah it's um they have satellite images of what it looked like see look how much fell off man look at that oh that's crazy so what do you have to do now you just can't even go that with anywhere near there no no don't drive there it's like somebody's house is right there - fuck I'm screwed he's so he's so fucked it's gonna keep following like more parts gonna fall and they think part of it is the root system isn't strong enough to keep the like the more trees and roots you have the less likely it is to have the landslides I guess because the trees in the root system keep all the dirt so then if you have poor rainfall than the the trees don't grow as much and have as much weed so you know as much shit on the side of the hill and there's like you ever seen me drive by Malibu and they got like cement all up on the side of certain hills and like mash and shit to keep things from falling but these people like holding on to their chunk of dirt with every tooth and claw like yeah they're supposedly like a lot of places because of all the fires like this winter it's gonna be a land look much slides and for us that's what I've heard yeah Burbank they say that the fire one thing that the fires are good for though is like you need to burn some of that shit down that it's supposed to be healthy puts minerals in the soil and then it builds things back up and that these fires through like lightning strikes we're like super common and then the things would burn down and the rain would come and they would repopulate with new new seeds and shit see this guy figured out how to you know sands you could stand on it yeah yeah are on it yeah he put pieces of paper in between the sand and then he pulled the sides off of it and people the paper being compressed in between these pieces of sand allows it to hold tremendous weight without losing its form weird yeah it's super weird see how it is it's like each thing is like a slice right like see if they show how we did it yeah it's pretty crazy it's just sort of how it works similar how side of it that you said this side of a freeway maybe yeah so that's what they do with this side of the freeways thing that's how they reinforce those things yeah if you see them slowly build it up it's kind of crazy to watch them do it but dude I watched something really crazy you ever go to the if you hi I started falling because you retweeted it yeah if you go to if you hi they have a thing where they're building a bridge and they're moving a fucking gigantic girder and this girder is like a hundred yards wide and they're picking it up look at this this thing it's a machine it goes to the end of the bridge where the edges because they're they're building the bridge it stops and then this other thing comes down and then it moves forward and then connects it connects with the other side you've seen this yeah this is sweet fuck dude it's crazy so it connects to the other side extends and then once it does that then they bring in this huge cement girder I mean it is fucking you see how small the people look next to it it's fucking huge this is cool it's like a football field right mm-hmm I mean isn't it is that close to a football field how far is that yeah at least half of one if not at least 50 yards right 50 yards of solid concrete and steel it's huge and they set it down on top of these stone pillars and everybody must be shitting their pants go wow joint machinery company I mean that's how they do it man right that's like the crazy thing is to think that they built the Brooklyn Bridge back when when they built that goddamn thing when they build the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge when the fuck they built that thing I mean that was a long goddamn time ago and I think still up it's so weird the idea of building over water to like go to the point where you drive a car over yeah that's not 1933 the Golden Gate Bridge was built oh that's crazy calling you to take them people back then worked harder they were different did stronger hands what how many years do you think that took the build I want to say it took two years I say five years what do you say Jamie I don't know at least 10 10 ok let's see I think I'm right I think it's like 2 years would you say Brian 5 2 5 10 all right how long did it take how many workers what do we got 35 million buck that's it shit looks like J Lo's house why don't just Google how long did it take what I came up determined how long did it take Golden Gate Bridge four and a half years hmm yes four and a half years you went over bro that doesn't count you went too far one no you said hit me and you fucked up they're gonna like it on with one and one yeah you won with one with one because I too so I was close one day yeah you won a wand yeah you would have won that would over that you would got that we're not playing by those rules that's amazing that they built it that quick back then think of that like less than five years they built this incredible bridge that's still up when I did it in the Stone Age there's a lot more slaves back then they weren't they probably were though right that's the Chinese people that built the railroads they weren't technically slaves but they weren't going anywhere either Brooklyn Bridge was in 1870 oh we did it first crews started in 1870 beginning of technically 1869 because it was January 3rd you know what's interesting about that they're tearing down a bridge in downtown LA right now umm sixth Street bridge yes exploded it last year I think yeah they're there they're rebuilding it because it has something called concrete cancer but the concrete was rotting out like how these dummies do such a shitty job there's a goddamn la thing a bridge smoked a lot fuckin shitty traffic and bad bad air imagine if that like pollution actually destroyed concrete yeah pollution has been bad this year in Los Angeles Wow beautiful bridge last night we were on a no chimney we weren't allowed to use fireplaces if you had a fireplace that seemed weird they can't just fix that yeah it seemed weird I mean I guess it makes sense if it's the concrete starting to break down just what a shit design can you get your money back you know that was built 1932 that's what was always said to those 9/11 truthers you know everybody was a they were pissed at this guy that owned Tower seven did you know he said pull it pull the building you know what always drive me crazy like why didn't that guy freaked out that building just collapsed if that was my building and it lit on fire just collapse like that I'm like who the fuck designed this piece of shit like look at the building look how it collapsed like did you guys not know that maybe it could catch fire did you plant you didn't plan for that okay will you make me a new building motherfucker make it so they can light on fire I just rebuild it so make it so collapses shit about the extended warranty the AppleCare that's what about conspiracies about that he told them to pull the building have it all collapse our insurance company's alive you know like look at all the houses in Puerto Rico and Texas and all that stuff that happened this year how is like nationwide still fucking not running out of money that's a very good question yeah I mean that's a lot like the cars you save a lot of cars of all the cars I got ruined for in Houston like just yeah like thousands of cars and you can't do anything with those cars you can't sell those cars no and what if they can even use the frames I mean the frames might be rotten rust and shit probably not to melt everything a million cars in Houston and they're saying that a lot of them are being sold in like Los Angeles and stuff people are buying them and trying to like clean them up to make them look like they fine why wonder if you get is rewire them no there's I mean there's so much like mold and stuff in there and although mechanic no I saw I saw a thing on the news like like why they can't use I might forgive the car got flooded woman like in the 90s when it flooded in Ohio we lived on the bottom of the hill whole ship flooded a lot of people's houses her own car was fucked and didn't even get that much water in it Wow shouldn't they make a car that you can get wet yeah like a little water real car you can drive it in the lake but like no one ever wanted that piece of shit yeah but like number one they couldn't do that with iPhone so there's no way karemera waterproof oh that's one thing to raise the phone's not waterproof it's not days but it does have a the power button right here it's also thumb print sensor yeah I mean it's a beautiful phone it's it's weird how the designs like a square make it say what's the battery life on ours you know phenomenal that's 4000 milliamps are using as your main phone right now no hmm no mostly using it to play games on fuck around with it yeah just yeah it's the sound is amazing when you play music on it's fucking incredible game the game is supposed to be bad absolutely if you like watching a YouTube video like it's fucking loud like you're watching it on a laptop with really good screen speakers you turn down the 120 Hertz right yes that's the other thing is it's one of the very few cell phones that it has 120 rate Hertz frame rate refresh so it means that you get 120 frames per second sometimes you know depending upon the game which is like super silky smooth if you're playing something like in your watching video and think most things it's not gonna be able take advantage of it but games a lot of games can is this out yep yeah yeah yeah yeah dude there's a lot of there's one called I was watching unblocks therapy unblocks unbox therapy he Lewis had an article or a video rather on the one ft is that it yeah 5 T said it 1 plus 5 teen said I say something like that yeah see if that's the right thing to say but that thing looks fucking incredible the big one yeah and it's it's half the price of like a Galaxy Note 8 or it's like $299 500 bucks yeah five - yeah that thing so so like my point was that the level of self unbuckle your iPhone X and ten sorry sorry nervous don't get mad it's a fucking turn bro or even you know any of the new the new Google pixels the level so high now everything the Samsung Note it's like these everything is like I was watching a video comparison and there are nitpicking I mean these guys are nitpicking yeah try to find anything wrong with any of these phones like these things are like they're they're literally like science fiction from 10 years ago it's 10 years ago the things that these things can do the opens with your face you look at it it opens the 1ft how's that - yeah oneplus love my t my note has it my note 8 it does have that or whatever yeah me know a has it but it's not it's the same love no like you have to like stick it in your face and I do like that was the thing that loot without think the the note has retina detection which is different this is facial recognition yeah and then the 1 + ft has an even better version of facial recognition than the iPhone and Lewis was showing how quick it opens yeah yeah and it also has a fingerprint sensor in the back which the iPhone doesn't have yeah and a big-ass screen it's got a big a scream a little tiny ass bezels look smooth like the level my point is is just super high right now we're dorks like you and me yeah they're saying the next year one they're already guessing at what neck next year so I unfold is they got a patent for folding the unfold which is cool in some ways like imagine having like a normal-sized phone but then you could fold it and make it an iPad you know apparently they're really close to doing something like that and that's I think there's at one point in time they're gonna figure out a way to put it in your in your glasses yeah I think it's going to be more like like glasses or even just like a contact lens that you never take out they have some dope sunglasses like some cool like frame like Elton John style frames and you have like just a full screen computer playing a virtual reality in front of you all the time yeah that might be the way to go I can't believe Google glasses didn't really take off too much there is that good yeah it was too small we're looking at it I tried it once I did it I weren't during one of the UFC weigh-ins you're looking at this little thing over here and you look down you can see it and you can look up and you don't you kind of look past it but it's kind of there wasn't right it wasn't the right thing I think augmented reality were you either looking through your phone or you have glasses on like that's what I think you're gonna have like clear glasses on and you're gonna have your phone and you're gonna be able to switch to glass mode and your phone will be in your pocket and a Bluetooth with the glasses and the glasses will be able to pull up anything that was the other thing that's pretty crazy about some of the new Google devices you take a photo of something and it tells you what that thing is mm-hmm if you take a photo of the Coliseum and it'll say this is the Colosseum in Rome like what yeah the new pixel does have a built in like this they have this thing called the pixel book we see the pixel book you buy a pin and you circle things on a screen and it tells you what those things are yeah my nobody has that yeah I know eight my know eight you can just circle like a sentence and it will translate it on for your dude how long before that becomes just standard you know and how much we're gonna get to some sort of rosetta stone type situation where we can read each other's thoughts like you'll be able to talk I mean right now the note-taking software is pretty goddamn good it's a pretty goddamn good like if you talk into your phone whether it's with Google notes or with anything else with Apple notes it'll pick up your voice very very well what what is it gonna be like in five years from now it's gonna be incredible and you're gonna be able to do in real time like they're doing with those earbuds those Google earbuds you know they're gonna be able to do that in real time all the time and so there's gonna be no language barriers and anybody ever has with anybody else it's amazing isn't it it's weird yeah it's crazy yeah when you have the robot fights between the robot fights and no language barriers yeah a range what is this I saw this that twitchcon is this eye tracking new it replaces your mouse basically using your eyes yeah it's a little sensor that's on the bottom right below your right below your screen kind of like where the fold is on your laptop basically and you do a little bit of setting up and it literally tracks everything your looking at oh my god I did it really well I thought I saw a little tests right in front of me okay will that work for games that's the idea maybe they'll be insane you imagine if you got that down the games and your cursor moved exactly where you wanted to go it might be too easy be fucking people up with that wait a second this is is this an old video because it just said like they were just advertising the head us 2.0 instead of 3.0 it just works over two point doesn't need three point oh I see Wow tag your enemies by glancing at them boom boom oh my god yeah so whether or not games actually need it or it becomes something actually useful in the future we'll see but that's it's been announced and it's coming soon or it's out now it's amazing where laptops to think are having it built into it I do not any with my eyes yeah we're I mean we're at the cusp of some really wacky virtual reality augmented reality type shit it's just around the corner it's gonna happen it's gonna take us by storm and it's gonna be just like all these other things that we use like automatically we don't even think about it because before Twitter existed do you did even think about it before podcast existed you'd never even thought this would could be a possibility that's gonna be the new one that's gonna that's gonna be fucking crazy some augmented reality type shit that you wear and then eventually they're gonna have the robot eyeballs Brian's gonna go he's gonna be an early adopter I'd do one of them Spurs Hardware closes yeah can't read my phone I've lost my glasses but I would do one first if after a few years of you know testing and stuff like that but uh do one try one out I think there's gonna be a bunch of options I think there's gonna be options in terms of like augmented parts and then I think there's also going to be options in terms of like them being able to regenerate parts I think that's just around the corner too cuz they already being they can regenerate a lot of shit now with stem cells yeah they grew a woman's bladder they made a bladder with skin cells and she had bladder cancer they grew her a new bladder there was that guy that's growing a new nose on his forehead how do you see that it's not from the same thing from stem cells yeah Jesus and it's weird like on his 40th he has a nose growing or it's an ear and he's growing it for him his nose when how long does do that for no wear hats no one would know I saw a dude word video rather where a dude was getting his hair we go oh Jesus it's gonna have a crazy nose God wouldn't yeah that's so weird yeah it's real what's wrong with his regular nose I think something I forget what happened wow that's so strange Oh looks like it was burnt man that's the that's another really crazy thing have you ever seen what they do with with skin that's been burnt now they spray stem cells all of the skin and it kills the burns and regenerates fresh tissue in those areas and you don't have a scar that's sweet that's like science fiction I mean then that's literally out of Star Wars or something like when you see it they show people with these like really bad third-degree burns they're pretty fucked up and they spray this stem-cell mist all over them and then their skin just regenerates tissue like this right yeah but it's really essentially we're talking about something that are just a decade or two ago would be absolutely witchcraft you know fuck man and they're they're blocking it too like we could be farther ahead in this whole field if they let stem-cell shit be a little bit more legal Penn State it's more legal now then it and then it used to be but I think the real issue was during the Bush administration I think it was like fetal stem cells they had a problem with their really worried that people are gonna get abortions just on purpose so they could sell the babies to stem-cell places and that people would be is super immoral and just have a bunch of abortions and make money off the baby tissue which that's the problem right the problem is like like no nobody would do that yes they would mother fucker doesn't been approved yet so put it on people change crimes when you waiting forever yeah dude if you got burnt and they offered it to you take it okay this videos videos are good just here's the thing all the people that are like crazy conspiracy theorists and worried about science and you got to realize that science is responsible for this kind of shit science might be able to save one of your kids science might be able to fix your body these people are smarter than us we need to respect them and they're not lying about this stuff yeah there's people in the medical industry that are making a lot of money off of pharmaceutical drugs and a bunch of things that make people super addicted and fuck up your life there's that too but there's also this it's like it's not perfect you should definitely call out the parts that are bad but you kind of respect the people that are smarter than us they're making all the awesome shit cuz it's not you and it's not me right but Jesus Joe Jesus Jesus made the people that made the awesome shit so there I'll give you that how about that we'll leave and walk away friends you got a show big show tonight tonight yeah zero Moshe kasher Marilyn Wright's got a bunch of people bringing up Brenda job Lucas role yeah well my watch and my Watkins Pat Regan motion and be fun season three comedy store any store and then
