she and she's talking about this might be my last fight bla bla so I don't think she said that I think she said she's close whew yes right which when you hear that yeah right thank you how about having one foot out Balzac so let's say she has two fights left maybe three who knows but she's not the same draws Connor it's just not it's just you look at the number she's not the same draw but if she comes back beats and Amanda Nunez armbar and then fights on board and then fights Holly beats beats Holly gets a rematch on this biggest counter you don't know that because as that happened you like to bet much everybody but here's the thing as these people win their star gets more and more giant as Ronda if Rhonda came back and started winning again her star would get more and more giant it would get bigger and fuel more the more body she claims the more fuel her fire will have that is what happens all the time it means pure speculation but really win the way Connors been winning she can win in spectacular fashion or the way she was winning when she fucked up Alexis Davis and Sara McMann Merkin girls marking the men she custom 1:15 she could never make but you know a good fuck no why not she's way too big but is she okay yeah yeah because she really runs away and sometimes that's this is nine the animal but if for Connor and this and again I'm not rooting for favorite sir I'm just saying from business standpoint for Connor he's such a big draw right what's gonna help him and there's a negotiating power if Rhonda were to lose this next fight cuz then he's like I'm the only motherfucker in town you guys were claiming me and Rhonda that's cool she just lost I need my fucking money well and by the way Rhonda has a tough fight in front of her Amanda Nunez this goddamn scary she's a scary girl she's what I was saying before Rhonda lost to Holly I was saying she should've got the title fight and I said I said that I think she's the most dangerous one yeah and I was talking shit to you the way she stopped Sara McMann she cracks with that right hand she hits like it match she hits like a dude but she well cyborg hits I could do demand hits like a strong girl big difference cyborg like tyron woodley with braids let's be real she hits so hard it's no love cuz she's so goddamn scary and can't make the way she also has a better arsenal like she'll throw kicks and knees just on the ground yeah I think Amanda's new yes Amanda's but Amanda has lost on the ground before yeah she got beat up by cats and gone on the ground correct cyber will grip your limbs off yeah she's getting no love but she's too big I know it's late you know 155 150 will I'm again if like if they did that whole thing where I'm talking about the eliminated weight cuts there'd be two girls cyborg would fight at like 180 so I worked at 180 and be it be her and that big-ass girl Gabby can see 280 but that's all we got pretty good after cut weights you and Dad we fight every other weekend about that like Tim sylveon Andrei Arlovski let's do that like every other weekend just always the old days but I think for Rhonda the mana newness fight stylist kink and we don't know we don't know where Rhonda's mental state is that but stylist Kate's a great match up for Rhonda I think so yeah I think if she comes ready prepared as a good camp she mercs her but don't you think that you look at the way she fucked up Miesha Tate you like that girl presents a lot of danger with those punches especially considering what happened with Holly and Rhonda yeah but yeah I think she presents a lot of danger honor percent Joe I think you're riding that but I think her marching forward is the perfect antidote to get murked by Rhonda because she's like I'll come get some of this Judith I'm an armbar yes right if she marches forward which is that really all she knows how to do mmm you know I'm saying it could be interesting it's a great fight either way but it's also interesting to see would where Rhonda's head is now she's coming back that's the x-factor because if it's run 100% she beats her I think nine out of ten times strong words did I know but if it's Rhonda who's kind of I wanna do movies I don't do this I this isn't for me you're gonna get murked because that girl hit so hard well what Rhonda has and what you wanna has you know and not a whole lot of other women have it is one thing that they do were they're really fucking good at it and then they have all those other stuff correct whereas like Paige Vanzant is kind of learning the whole sport she's learning as she go - go yeah now is she what she does that what page has is just toughness and she's hot that ridiculously almost definitely helps but there's not other girls you know other than Valentina Valentina Shevchenko she's another one that's badass who is another super-powerful striker yeah I mean the way she handled Holly Holm standing up I know man yeah handled her just countered her at will that that looping left hook that Jack cook that just rolls off the right side yeah she's another one but there's not do they need more of those you know I agree like that's where McKenzie turn fits exactly because they don't come and do work and she's gorgeous but I'm saying if collars like listen I don't wish battling anyone before on they were to lose we thrown a party in Ireland because I'm the only show in town now give me my fucking piece of the pot well nobody has that sort of personality that yeah it's no one ever I think even he eclipses all we have the eclipses all of them I think he's bigger than she'll Sonnen for sure - as far as like his ability to talk shit not even Oliver but yeah I think yes Ollie but all he stood for a different thing yet like his message is more important fight for equal rights was also fighting to stop the Vietnam War act like there's three times he had several things currently form that were bigger correct Connor is white privilege yeah his nice suits nice suits if the government's not trying to send him over to fight in a war even him they're not stripping his belt for how long three fights in Spanish prime as prime it's like basically taking the belt from Colorado right three years we'll see you soon
