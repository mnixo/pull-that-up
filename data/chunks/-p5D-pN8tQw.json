and we're live hello Michael Shermer thank you good to see with you a pile of your writing look at you got this what more arc heavens on earth look at you stiff dick magazine it's the latest issue why is there something rather than nothing we like to tackle the little questions that's a deep one you've dealt with this on the show yeah too much it's uh that's one that just you know when you're in traffic you know what is this you have someone like Neil or Sean Carroll or Lawrence Krauss talking about this it's like whoa yeah I'm not a physicist I'm a social scientist so for me I come at it like what do you mean by this word nothing because most of us have this idea what I mean oh no in physics it means this other thing like okay yeah well I think our limited understanding of what they are talking about when I see those guys writing down on legal papers with all that scratchy Scratchy crazy looking for a fake alien language and mathematics like thank God you guys are out there why open heavens on earth with imagine yourself dead and you know most people go well you know I see myself in the casket and my friends and family around and hopefully they're mourning no you wouldn't see anything of course you you're dead I mean to imagine anything you have to be conscious in alive so you can't even picture being dead so you can't picture not existing and it would be the same thing imagine there's no universe yeah okay I see blackness no there's no blackness I mean nothing would literally be not just no light but no no perception of darkness nothing not even nothing I was going through Instagram the other day and there was this one person who was talking about the purpose of life and when you die what's going to happen and I immediately just started laughing I'm like you don't know if right how are you saying this like when you die what happens it he was like one of them spiritual type characters is just kind of a huckster there's a lot of spiritual hucksters out there these days there are yes the in the 90s we debunked all those psychics talking to the dead that was a that hasn't been too popular in recent years but that was a big thing people caught on to that little earpiece yeah yeah the earpiece or just the cold reading yeah I see a father figure is this a grandfather father uncle friend of the family you know you can yeah and he's saying something about you know it's okay for you to forgive yourself oh okay like well where was the will yeah he hid his will somewhere where is that because that's what we want to know is you know that ring he had where is if you're just vague enough I mean like horoscopes if you're just vague enough people like oh my god it's right all the time it's always right like that's not even a real horoscope if you really want to pay attention to actual astrology that you they have to know the date you were born the time you were born it's not just the month of August right you know it's like they got a note in the morning or evening yeah you know we think about all that stuff it's all bunk yeah yeah why has it been around so long well because the well it's called the Barnum effect where you know PT Barnum you just offer something for everybody so if you make it general enough you know I I sense you're an intelligent wise person that people really enjoy your company and and you like going to parties and being with other people and yet you like the quiet solitude of a walk on the beach and on people going yep that is so me well I pretty much describe every scenario you can have you're alone you're with people but it's one of those things where if you talk to someone who is an actual believer in astrology like they they are so convinced I got a friend of mine who's trying to tell me that he makes all of his decisions based on consulting with his astrologer mm-hmm well Reagan well Nancy Reagan yeah for his travel after he was shot she got real paranoid about that well so part of the problem is these astrologers and psychics are themselves remembering their hits and forgetting their misses the confirmation yeah so I knew a psychic or a magician who was working the Psychic Friends Network it back in the 90s when it started to make a living as a magician doing kids parties they all want to have their own Vegas show but only a few people get that so you got to do something on the side so this guy was doing Psychic Friends Network and he told me all about they gave him a book a three-ring binder and you know here's the kinds of things you should say and you know people are calling for love health money career questions so you can spend 20 30 minutes at 395 a minute just going through there you know I sent you in a relationship right now and one of you is more committed than the other tell me about that 10 minutes later you know they're still talking and you're thinking about travel you're not happy with your job there's some financial stress in your life right now and then you told me about stuff like now go get a crystal and then a candle I want you to set it up here on your desk and this would go on and on for hours and they charge by the hour and they are so one of the problems that the psychic friend networks had was people were not paying their phone bills because they you know come back an $800 for so just not pay it so the phone companies cracked down on the Psychic Friends Network company going hey this is getting out of hand that people aren't paying their bills so they had to ratchet the pack a little bit that's right they would do it through the phone that's interesting yeah they wouldn't get a credit card from you they would just stay on the line with you right so he told me that when he first started he got like 60 cents on the minute for the 395 that per minute but then they bumped it up as he got more experienced and kept them on the line longer they gave him bonuses now you get a dollar per minute or whatever how is that not illegal he's not even a psychic shouldn't you have to like if you want to be a doctor you have to go and you got to you know go to medical school get a degree shouldn't there's a interesting history there because in New York City for example it was difficult to outlaw like the three-card Monte guys on the sidewalk with the cardboard because it's just kind of a game right now now it would be illegal to sell fraudulent stocks or something like that or sell a product that's advertised as a health product when it's not but if say in that case it's under food rather than drugs or say no health products like vitamins are under different standards than say medical drugs a psychic is more like an entertainer so this is for entertainment purposes only so we can do whatever we want as opposed to a medical doctor that's dispensing advice so maybe doctors a bad example maybe I should have said engineer but the point is like if you're going to work as a psychic like on a psychic network if you have a business of selling psychics yeah like you should be able to you have to exhibit some sort of psychic something yeah well they can't you know under controlled conditions they always fail there's nothing that's ever been done no what about the one thing that I've read that statistically more people can recognize that people are staring at them yeah like when they're looking at you from behind that horseshit well it's not been it's not been consistently replicated so is it possible some people with a certain sensitivity can detect well we okay so one explanation the skeptics explanation is that if I'm in a say a Starbucks or something and I kind of have a sense that people are talking about me maybe looking at me and and I look and that catches somebody's eye and they turn to me and I think oh that person's looking at me mm-hm I'm looking at them and then they send something or whatever so there could be some element of chance to that now the guy that does this Rupert Sheldrake you know he believes that it's actually some kind of like psychic power through the medium like when I'm looking at you something's coming out of my eyes and particularly your neck so that's his morphic resonance or morphic resonance now richard wiseman a british like experimental psychologist he's tried to replicate that and he always fails and then this other woman Marilyn Schlitz she also tried to replicate it and she was able to replicate some of it so there may be an experiment or bias it's not clear if it's the skeptics that are biased or the believers that are - but in that case it's best to just say you know we don't know it so the default position the null hypothesis is that it's not true until you prove otherwise and if that's a that's a difficult one to prove now if if they say if I say well why is the effect so subtle why can't you go to Vegas and become a millionaire gambling or play the stock market you know we know traders just need a tiny you know one point 0.01% advantage over the other traders whatever they can mean in terms of just psychic ability yeah so if the psychic ability is a very broad term right it's almost like saying drugs because like yeah there are certain drugs that put you to sleep and certain drugs that make you hyper they have very different effects so saying psychic ability like maybe you have the ability to see if someone's looking at you but you don't have the ability to pick the lottery right so the hard part in testing psychics is to pin down what exactly are you saying you could do right and that that's where it gets pretty fuzzy so these like why is it legal for the phone psychics because that you can't pin him down if somebody says look I'm just giving relationship advice why is that illegal if I say like the Tony Robbins Netflix documentary I'm not your guru which is basically I am your guru he has that moment in this huge auditorium there's like 3,000 people there and he gets this woman up on stage and she's got relationship problems he says do you have your phone feels yeah take out your phone and call him right now and she he talks her through dumping this guy on stage on the phone and he's at work or something he's like what and then she hangs up and everybody's happy that she did this now is that a good thing or a bad thing I have no idea it's great for show business but would have you know so how the fuck I mean that seems crazy like how do you know what kind of relationship they really have now somebody to talk to both of them right wouldn't you somebody that I brought this up at at an event recently a party and somebody said oh I know the back story his staff had been working the audience and they they knew all about her and the relationship and it was about to go sour anyway so we brought her up it's like okay so this is the thing with you see the psychics on TV there's a lot of stuff you don't see they work the audience they know people fill out like the psych the faith healers they fill out prayer cards yeah they put their name and address and their ailment and then you know the faith healers have a little earbud in there and they're listening to the person in the back reading okay here's the person they have you know glaucoma or whatever and you hear them calling this out so so there's a lot of that that we don't see but Anthony Robbins is not claiming any kind of psychic ability he's not he's just trying to provide positive paths for improving your life and if you're in a bad relationship that would be a positive path let's get out of that relationship and there's like move forward with it with emotion and power and love and he fucking probably throw a karate kick and get everybody pumped up and jump around so Bobby Brown headphones on no it's like but he's he's a showman - yeah that's right so this but but my point is that the psychic could say the same thing look I'm just you know I don't know if this but here's not I mean it's it's weird to put him in that right because he's just trying to get people excited yeah I think he does some good I really do because he did me some good when I was 21 years old I used to listen to his I think it was called unlimited power I think that was the name of the book and I listened to it on audio cassette by the pool shitty apartment that I was living in when I was trying to be a stand-up comedian yeah and it helped me he had some really good advice in terms of setting goals and in terms of like the way you approach things and look at things but I I agree all of that you know any of these self-help books you know Jacko's books or amy Alcon there's a lot of stuff that very similar to what Tony Robbins issues and okay that makes sense set goals and and be motivated and think positive maybe air a little bit on the side of over optimism so you can push through the failures but don't be blind because maybe it's certain times that cut and run and change course in your life something like that the the hard part is getting is studying that which you know experimentally which are the best techniques versus others and there's a guy wrote a book called sham sha em self-help actualization movement and he was the head book guy for Rodale press that publishes these self-help books and so his takeaway on in this book was that that the number one predictor of people who will buy self-help books are people who already bought self-help books and they continue buying them yeah so if you say does it work well it works if you work it sort of consistently like you got to listen to the tapes like every weekend or I mean every low moment it's not like taking the pill and your cancers gone you have to kind of keep practicing it as a lifestyle change for it to work yeah that's you know so what do you mean by work like so Tony goes into a corporation and they get a bump this is an example in this book to get a bump in sales so they get the salesman all motivated they hit the phones on Monday morning you know within two weeks they're there let the sales are kind of back to where they were so you get it so they got to bring the self-help guy back in every month or so to keep them super motivated well you got to give them some sort of incentive to stay stay pumped right I mean some financial incentives like it's one of those old-school phrases the inspiration is like bathing it works but you have to do it regularly in order for it to be effective I like that yeah I mean bathing works but it doesn't mean you like hey two months later I smell like shit it works yeah daily yeah you have to do it all the time or it's like saying why can't the NFL teams play the whole game like the last two minutes cuz it's so exciting the two-minute drill because they can't do it physically keep that up yeah yeah well I think you could physically keep up that enthusiasm that Anthony Robbins provides but you have to be either you have to have some sort of an office environment that is incredibly enthusiastic to the point we've you guys have engineered this environment where everybody's pumped up but that's gonna be it I mean that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for the individual to be themselves I feel like that would be terrible to wear a place like that where everywhere you go there's motivational sayings and people are you know chanting things in the hallway and everybody just got energy at ten let's go you know that's that's what a guy like Anthony Robbins will provide you for with a short burst yeah we just hope that some of it sticks right well this is you know an Amy Elkins book unfuck ology it's great but yeah she calls these small wins or whoever calls some small wins like make your bed in the morning or shave or whatever or like Jacko's little Twitter post at 4:30 a.m. yes now I'm never getting up at 4:30 but when I get up at 6:30 we'll occasionally like 5:00 like this morning for the morning rides that leaves at 7:00 a.m. I get up at 5:30 so I'm not happy getting up at 5:30 but I think okay Chacko has been up an hour he's already worked out it's already done working out okay I can't really complain come on Sherrod get going that that kind of little thing this is Jordan's Jordan Peterson's point of the you know make get your life in order what is he talking about just stand up straight make your bed or lean your room what's he talking about he's talking about these little winds like if you can do that then the next thing that's a little harder kinds of lazier and so it's also those things that are in the background if you know that your your life is a mess your car is filled with fast-food wrappers here you know your your you've got that thing that you haven't taken care of in the back your head that will that's gonna disrupt it's gonna be flowing in your thoughts for the most part it'll be a distraction right so those little things apparently do matter there's a theory of crime called the broken windows theory that is favored by criminologists to explain the decline the crime decline in the 90s what happened in New York City they started cleaning up the graffiti they started catching the turnstile jumpers they started cleaning up the streets they started you know boarding up windows has no broken windows or replacing the windows the theory is that if there's a signal in society that no one's paying attention there is no law and order here there are no rules or norms do whatever the fuck you want you're gonna get more crime if you send the signal through little things like we're not gonna allow graffiti on this wall anymore and no more turnstile jumpers in the subways and so on and so when when that happened then there was a trickle-down effect and then crime decline so that's the the most popular theory for that and I think there's something to that yeah that makes a lot of sense and what they did with New York City is really kind of fantastic if you if you go back to when I was a kid and I traveled to New York City the first time and I saw Times Square I guess it was probably like 18 or 19 I was like look at this fucking crazy place like this is madness and you know you see it in movies and it's just always this horrific scene it's always peep shows and hookers and pimps and thugs and drug dealers and you go there now and it's like a mall threw up you know it's it's like a giant neon mall of America I'm square if you took a person if you grabbed a guy from like 1988 and you put him in a time machine and said hey man I'm gonna bring you 30 years in the future and you're gonna see New York City the way it looks then like what do you expect like oh my god it's gonna be like like Blade Runner people gonna be shooting people and selling body parts and now you get there it's like Guy Fieri's restaurant and it's huge gigantic LCD screens and there's there's some people that would long for the old days the dirty seediness yeah Lenny Bruce talked about you know and he lived there it's like and I mean well that has a certain charm I guess going into the nightclubs or whatever but the surrounding daytime neighborhood or something you this is it where you want to you rather live in them vomitted mall well I'm not crazy about that either but but so there's a reason why cities have certain restrictions on those kinds of stories coming but but in a crappy neighbor like you know downtown Old Town Pasadena now is kind of a hip place to go yeah but in the 70s when I mean I went to the Ice House maybe you know back in the day in the 70s just as a spectator and but it was terrible down there and was it really oh yeah it was a dump I mean there was a Sedin Oh terrible yeah it was horrible the word was according to my friend Bob Fisher who owns the ice house he said that what it was was in the early days of Hollywood the producers would all buy homes in Pasadena these they have these beautiful old estates in Pasadena yeah but the stars would all live in the Hollywood Hills right so they would all be just boozing it up and partying it down and the Hollywood Hills and the producers like let those crazy animals go have at it in the hills we're gonna back out a little bit and they establish that community out there in Pasadena right right so to turn it around like one of the key things a mall can do is get in what they call an anchor store someone like a sex 5th Avenue somebody that's really respectable big and then you can call the other guys go look we got sex Fifth Avenue oh you had sex with a veneer and then I can be next to him and then it's you know stairs going and then little by little each of them cleans up their neighborhood a little bit more and pretty soon you end up with Old Town Pasadena no well I was telling you guys before I had an issue today where my credit card got robbed and you know whatever credit card fraud someone got ahold of my number which is really that's the one thing that people worry about the most about shopping online right but I guess that could kind of happen everywhere you know but you got to think that if there's anything that has changed malls more than anything it's got to be the ability to just shop online on your phone like Amazon that the fact that they figured that out yeah I remember when Amazon came out and it was just a book store I was like who the fuck is gonna buy books online you just go to the book store ridiculous right what a stupid business meanwhile that guy has more money than any human on the planet that's right yeah poor bastards getting divorced too I heard last night that there's a role in wash Washington that everything that you make as a couple you have to split I'm gonna go there for over 25 years well California California law is yes 50/50 well long term marriage is 20 years or 10 years or more it's 50/50 and that includes downstream income oh you know from anything you did that you're still getting paid for say ten years ago you wrote a book or whatever well mrs. Bezos is getting hey he's worth a hundred plus billion dollars thirty-seven they said Wow so she's gonna get half of that they're probably gonna because it's a lot of stock that's that they're gonna have to just be stay friends oh she should be super nice to him he would he feel he gives her a quarter she's like I got rolling I got wrong the richest people and you know but after all these bookstores are in that business there's some irony that Amazon now wants to start opening physical brick-and-mortar stores that is kind of ironic but it doesn't make sense though because there are some brick-and-mortar stores and I think that guys are Konqueror I think he just wants to take over everything well why also be by Whole Foods you know I was like oh the supermarket business I can fuck this up too well I don't know maybe get order Whole Foods delivered to your house I think the I don't know if that's available yet but I think it is right yes gonna say now most grocery stores even like all the Ralph's have home delivery within two hours to compete with Amazon Prime yeah Wow or and if they don't do that you can just order it online and pick it up bring out this yeah I went to pavilions the other day and they had a bunch of delivery trucks parked in the parking lot I was like look at this I think of these cool delivery trucks have to one has that one right the store you can walk in there's no cashiers they just trust that everyone's not stealing and I think they just are comfortable with a certain amount of theft oh wow yeah hmm that's interesting well they probably have cameras everywhere too you know but it's um the online purchasing like that has got to put that must be putting the most as far as like the most impact on stores brick-and-mortar stores it's like the ability to purchase online it's got to be devastating for them right totally and up in Santa Barbara where I live now just riding up State Street this morning at the end of the ride you know it's like maybe a quarter the stores are closed out of business empty and you know State Street Santa Barbara this was like the happenin place to be and I and real estate friend of mine says oh well let's see that store there that's you know twenty two thousand dollars a month to lease like whoa okay so you have to you have to have a retail outlet that's really turning over the customers and there's a lot that just can't do that you can't have an antique store that's gonna do that or a little knick-knack store Santa Barbara is one of my favorite places and it's it's really interesting because it's it's a small area like I don't think there's a hundred and fifty thousand people less than area it's about ninety thousand is it Montecito included or with - you don't cluded alito Goleta is like another 30,000 or so and then but below that you have Carpinteria that's like another 20,000 or so so yeah it's that's great you get the right spot man but it's also I feel like it needs to be that close to Los Angeles yeah like you get a little bit of trickle I can zip down there 75 miles from my house to your studio here in my office in Altadena for skeptic magazine that's 105 miles so it's doable yeah yeah yeah but it's it's I think that human beings when they're living in these gigantic communities whether it's Los Angeles or New York or something like that there's just a certain amount of people become less valuable you know there's just too many of them and you you lose that sort of appreciation for people and there's like a tension around like you don't mind if a few people drop off yeah there's a balance in size my wife's from Cologne Germany which is about 1 million people and that's that's about as big as you want to get it's big enough City there's lots of action you could do all sorts of things but it's not you know 6 million or 10 million which is just like LA it's just too many have you ever seen that study that they did where they set up a camera on one end of the street and the camera on the other end of the street and they timed people walking through and in those in the the the the footage of those people walking through they were able to determine by how fast these people walked they got an average which was really accurate of how many people lived in the city yeah yeah yeah yeah scale yes yeah there's that book that physicist West Jeff GE o FF West I think is his name wrote that book and and the bigger the city the more efficient and faster things become yeah including dialogue the way people communicate talk a little faster and he had a formula showing how many restaurants per hundred thousand at gas stations per hundred thousand you'll get as you scale up you don't need as many restaurants and gas stations as populations increase because there's more efficiency in the flow of traffic and people throughout the city whereas smaller towns are less efficient that was the theory it's but it's just fascinating that human beings adjust because of all of these other human beings around them they change the way they walk they walk faster they talk faster this right here yes the university life in death in organism cities and companies yes thing too right now actually are you really yeah like coincidentally coinkidink II yeah that's that's I mean you feel it you know when I lived in Boulder for a short amount of time one of the things you know Boulder small as well I think it's a hundred thousand people when I came back here the first thing I realize is how fast everyone's driving everyone's just cutting everybody off and zoom in ahead and and people are like really in a rush everywhere they go and that has to be in some way shape or form it has to be influenced by all the other people around them and their energy right what is that's right what do you think that is though well first of all is all unconscious I think it's it's just mostly the kind of overall pace you get that pushes everybody along or slows them down I just started this book called rule makers and rule breakers it's a by a woman who is a cultural psychologist sorry I forget her name it may be because look oh so rule makers rule breakers so he talks about tight cultures versus loosey fast as a fucking Michelle Gelfand yeah so she talks about tight versus loose cultures so like again my wife from Germany it's a tighter culture that the north people are more likely to obey norms and rules and there's a little more uncomfortableness in violating them California we're a little loosey-goosey about rules and and so my wife's always giving me a hard time about my idea of traffic laws is I'll just do whatever you know I feel like pretty much if as long as it's safe and I kind of know you know I'm driving up the 101 if I stay at 79 or below I'm fine and she's like but that speed limit 65 yeah so what I know where the cops Park I know everybody else is going and the left turn into our street as a as a left arrow so of course my wife she's just like well we gotta wait it's like but it's midnight I'm just gonna go you can't go it's like yeah this is California I'm going no one here there's nowhere yeah yeah so that's a tight culture versus loose culture so she I guess she's gonna talk about how norms then affect laws and how then people change their behavior you're not even where you're doing this you're just kind of unconsciously absorbing the cultures but what do you think I mean there but there's a difference between West Coast tight culture like or large groups rather and East Coast large groups do you think that's influenced by whether it's one of things that I've been thinking about a lot so the the aggression of East Coasters is very different than the aggression of West Coasters and I always wonder it's like how much of that is because they have to deal with shit whether for five months out of the year it could be out of that I don't know and the influence of immigrants as well like because like my parents my grandparents were immigrants they all came over from England and Ireland and Italy and they were all savages there were all people that were willing to get on a boat and cross the ocean right you know there's an aggressive people they're like I'm getting out of here fuck you higher higher risk takers yes yes yes yeah yes it's not a random population that came to America nor with Australia you know you send all these convicts there it's it's not going to be a typical gene pool there yeah but meanwhile how good does that work those are the nicest ever well same thing you know Germans you know here after World War one in World War two oh these are bellicose people but they're this international character now they're the nicest people in the world they don't want to fight anybody yeah that's one generation right more than that I mean they have massive war guilt and and Mona's guilt I mean they are all raised in in taking tons of classes in school about what happened why we're never gonna do this again here's what we did at that you know they're still paying Israel reparations for that there are these little stumbling stones that are the sort of brass square cubes in all over Germany of the name and year that the person was murdered these are all Jews in front of the house where they used to live they're all over the place yeah I have a picture of them in the moral arc here I'll show you it's it's really dramatic it's and when you stand east you literally stumble across them I mean they're just there in the street you might if you google stumbling stones you can see that they're better in for color another interesting thing about Germany is they won't let Scientology and they're very sensitive about cults and cult behavior that's right well there's another reason for that and that is given the pictures now in Germany most people don't know this there's a religious or those gyms go so that's what they look so they're actually above-ground yeah so you're just walking along and you look down some of them those are not they're not like that right they're not like little bricks on the ground they're like that you just saw them in the ground yeah and they're in front of house for the east to live the date that they were departed in the date that they were murdered and where they were murdered Josh wits or a Treblinka my donek and so on yeah there you go so it's pretty moving it's and it's a it's kind of a reminder this is what we did and we're not going to do this again remember it so so that's that's changing norms how does this happen really it's you can do it through the law from the top down but really it's more culture from the bottom up you were saying that there's another reason besides that besides the Holocaust that they're sensitive to Scientology oh yeah because in Germany they have a religious withholding tax so when you get your first job they do a withholding for your religion and they give a percentage of your paycheck to your religion the religion you were born into baptized whatever it's mostly Catholic and Protestant but others want to get in on that because that's cumulative you know you can make some money doing this as a religion the humanists have Germany get a little piece of this action it's considered a religion so Scientology when they saw that they went okay free government money tax money and the Germans got no you're not a real religion and you're not getting in on this and yeah so I again when when my wife came here before she came here she quit church and you literally have to go down to the courthouse fill out a form and say I am leaving the church please don't take my money anymore out of my paycheck so you have to opt out you will be giving money to your religion unless you fill out the form and opt out Wow and and in this case is kind of a funny story they go okay so just make sure you know now if you sign this you can't get married in a Catholic Church can't get buried in Catholic to hurt you can't go to this you know the ceremonies and so on you're done as she goes yep that's the way I want it she went down there with her four horsemen t-shirt said Dawkins Dennett Harris and Hitchens and they're like anyway so they said up but now okay the moment you sign it starts effective today but there's a three-month lag for us to not take the money out of your paycheck what's my wife is like yeah like wait a minute it when a business in a business when a contract ends it ends for both parties they go no they're just gonna steal money for three months four months yeah what a weird thing that you have to opt out like that that it has to be so definitive that you have to sign papers and go someplace what a fuckin shady law it is it's no good I know that's got to change so a lot of us are trying to like talk people into opting out quit Church well it is amazing that in this country I mean I would like to know what the number is if the churches in this country had to pay taxes I mean clearly especially when you look at the televangelists that are driving Rolls Royces and flying around in private jets I mean there's a profit there's extreme amount of profit and it's discretionary income they could do whatever they want with it and you're dealing with massive massive sums of money and they don't contribute so these people are clearly personally benefiting from the contributions of these people and then they don't pay taxes on and in the case of like ministers who live in a church owned home they don't have to pay property tax you know so there's a lot of hidden benefits there it's dirty yeah it is dirty it's amazing that it's still here I mean especially when you deal with something like Scientology well you know the guy who wrote it right like this is not some ancient text that we're in this is you know the guy and the guy was a terrible writer yeah I mean he was a terrible science-fiction author he just wrote every fucking thing he wrote was a first draft just boom gone I mean it's just the most nonsensical nonsense writing and yet they don't have to pay taxes because it's considered a legitimate religion Harless Harlan Ellison the great science fiction writer died this year told me the story of what the famous story where L ron Hubbard allegedly said you know I'm gonna go start a religion yeah he said it was it's real it's a true story they were but but it was just a bunch of science fiction writers sitting around like this chatting and complaining about how poorly paid they are they have to crank out by the word you know Kenny a word kind of thing and somebody said you know we should just start a religion and make shit up like that and you know ron Hubbard yeah you know that's a good idea I think I think I might do that and then he went out and wrote Dianetics and that became the founding document of Scientology did you watch the the HBO series on it the the documentary oh yeah the going clear yeah unbelievable that's the best documentary on and of course I've seen all Leah's mmm show she's got big guts to go out I don't know if she's got the good lawyers or Andy has good lawyers or whatever maybe they've stopped suing people I don't know I think the climate has shifted and I think people are more first of all for the longest time all we thought of when you thought about Scientology thought about positive thinking and John Travolta and Tom Cruise and they're all super positive you know and they're getting things done and there's auditing and they're really taking care of their mind and you know but thinking clearly and eliminating all the negative influence but then once there's a bunch of factors I think but once the internet opened up these the the doctrines and you got a chance to read it and people got a chance to mock it and then you know South Park did that whole series on it whether this is what they actually believe and you see like when South Park did that everybody was like holy shit wait a minute is that real and then people started googling it and then looking into it and then it started to unravel slowly but surely people started leaving the church Lawrence Wright wrote the book all these things are happening and now Leah's coming in and Leah was you know I knew her but I mean I'm friends with Kevin James from the king and queen so I've known Leah for 20-plus years and when I first met her she was just like this hard-ass beautiful woman who's just like driven and like like she's a Scientologist get the fuck out of her way you know it was like that she's just like super active and just getting things done and just being productive I mean that's what you thought about when you thought about Scientology but now what you think about it is like nonsense and it's a foolishness and and once going clear aired and you got to see l ron Hubbard and listen to him talk and you you see the captain's outfit he had on with the medals that he gave himself like who would buy this it's so dumb it's just it's amazing that it it's so effective and so financially successful yeah I think their membership roles are pretty low but their property holdings I think our personal offensive yeah I mean they're the second biggest real estate owner in Los Angeles is that right yeah Wow at least they were there's some Japanese folks that were number one and then it was number two was Scientology maybe that's not true anymore might be oil barons now yeah well back in the 90s when the internet first got cranked up we were doing issue articles on Scientology is when some of these ex members started posting the secret doctrines the Z news story and then going clear you know at level 8 or whatever when you find out the the inside story and they got raided I mean the Scientologists went to court to court to judges and said this is copyrighted material and it's like wait you're a religion how can you copyright the religious well and they somehow got around that I mean this would be like the Catholic Church not telling you about Jesus in the resurrection until level eight after you've paid a hundred thousand dollars or something like that it's just insane well what's amazing is that the IRS caved internal I believe when that happened I remember when that happened I thought oh my god I don't want to fuck with these guys I mean they beat the IRS I'm a nobody how am I gonna defend myself but maybe they've stopped suing people maybe they're not going after Li la la real estate here goes mmm portfolio properties reported at four hundred million dollars in Hollywood alone paid for in cash no less the Church of Scientology is undeniably a formidable player in the real estate game yeah that's what you got they have some beautiful properties too yeah it's just really amazing it's amazing so you know my my skipping friends you know they're gonna go out of business anytime soon it's like I don't know I think they could have practically no members and still they have all this real estate here's the thing even though it's nonsense just so is most religion let's just be honest I mean I want to talk about guys coming back from the dead after being birthday three days or Adam and Eve being the only two people and they have kids and their kids just start having sex with each other and that makes all the people in the world or Moses parting the Red Sea and Jesus walking on water I mean you're looking at horse shit everywhere it's just older horse shit it's you know whether or not it's based on some real events or some real people who knows who knows you know but it's all nonsense if you've heard Julia Sweeney's monologue letting go of God no do you know Julia from Saturday Night Live I know who she is I do not know her yeah she just moved back to LA so you should have her on the show she's love to so she was born and raised Catholic love being a Catholic the whole culture and you know that was great and then she started reading Dawkins and me and Harris and so on and then kind of let all that go and then she wrote a monologue it's very moving so the monologue opens she's in her house in Hollywood and the Mormon boys come by and she invites them in and they want to you know tell the story and she's thinking this is like a Hollywood pitch story you're gonna pitch the story and I'll get back to you later till you know how I like it no no they want to do you know that actually you know press to see if she could join right then and there you know they're on their two-year mission that they do you know so that you make sure these two 18 year olds with their white starched shirts and their bicycles and so Julia starts pressing him a little bit so what's the story here well see this guy Joseph Smith he he found these gold plates in his backyard and he translated them from ancient hieroglyphics into English and with these magic stones and they're going on and then Jesus came to America and there was the good Indians and the bad Indians and Jill he's like I just want to tell him I don't start with this story this is a bad bitch story even the Scientologists know don't tell him about Xenu until way down the line yeah that but then she says reflecting on it you know if if I told somebody my Catholic story who never heard of it it would sound just as wacky yeah because it's virgin and the resurrection what yeah all of its wacky a hundred percent I mean it's like we were talking about early when you die what's going to happen is you don't know you don't know and the reality is it look maybe there's an afterlife maybe when we stop living something happens and our essential energy goes into another dimension it's possible but you don't know look being alive is so titanically bizarre just being a human being looking through eyeballs at each other across from this wooden table that was cut down from living organisms that turn into hard surfaces you sand them and Psalm and then you put it in a building and it's got electricities rolling through the walls and if you stuck a fork in there you die all of it is crazy the fact that we're in a planet I mean the fact that the universe is at least as far as we can tell infinite all that stuff is crazy the idea that your essential energy doesn't transfer into some other state why not yeah the whole thing's crazy but you don't know that's right no one is you don't know to you know whenever you say something that you're not sure of and you say this is what's going to happen but you don't really know you're a huckster that's right yeah absolutely no one knows no one knows and that's the conclusion of heavens on earth I don't know and you don't either I saw a bumper sticker that said militant agnostic I don't know you don't either so I mean we have to okay so here's my bottom line on this yeah I don't know you don't no one knows for sure I'm happy to wake up in some great place and there's my friends they'll be awesome unless unless it odd was math you didn't follow the rules well that that's right Christopher Hitchens called the Christian heaven celestial North Korea it's like Christmas dictator that knows everything you do and controls everything forever celestial North Korea but he doesn't tell you anymore I told you already I told you 2,000 years ago this dude wrote it down pay attention to that but then it's not even that right it's like one guy might have write it down a long time ago but then a bunch of other dudes got together and how to revise it they're like a new draft and the new draft they get to decide people got to decide what goes in and what doesn't go in and some of the stories are based on write accounts from hundreds of years after Jesus's death like the Bible is a wiki it's like a wig yeah the people contributed to over the years and so on Hitchens at a great analogy with when he was dying he wrote a series of essays for Vanity Fair his column which you can get as a book now I think it's called mortality or something like that anyway one of them was people think dying is like you're at a party and someone taps you on the shoulder and says you have to leave now and worse the party's gonna go on without you oh no he goes okay so let's play this out you're at the party and you get tapped on the shoulder and said you can never leave the party you have to stay here forever with these people like when at Julia's funny lines is the the Mormon boys were telling or like in heaven it's going to be great you you get your maid hold again like the blind shall see and the Deaf shall hear again and the crippled shall be hold again she said well I had uterine cancer and I had my uterus taken out do I get my uterus back and they're like you can imagine these 18 year old again and they're like yeah you get your uterus back she goes I don't want it back and then she said what if you had a nose job and you liked it do I have to have my old nose back in him and that's a good point yeah so and then they said and you get to spend the rest of with your family and she went huh no that would not be good in my case maybe they'll be cured though they'll realize the errors of their way so you'll be all enlightened well here's the problem so this is called a problem of identity who are you and you know you know that Theseus is ship you know the Greek Minotaur Slayer Theseus comes back and is a hero and they and they preserve his ship in the museum forever but the wood rots and they replace the ship and over the centuries there's no wood left from the original but it's still cherished as if I call this schirmer's Mustang because my first car was a 66 Ford Mustang classic and I had that for 19 years of those cars it's a it was a great car but I banged it up so much I replaced this and that you know ever pretty much by the time I sold it as a classic and made it a nice little chunk of change on it there was very little of the original left right but it's the pattern not the material moonbounce so this whole debate about when you're resurrected in heaven with Jesus what's up there is it your physical body if because some Christian sects say yeah it's like okay how old are you when you're in heaven 30 this is the year they came up with because that's the year age Jesus was when he was crucified okay but if Johanna held 40-something 51 you're 51 okay so if if you're resurrected at 30 year old joe rogan what happened to the last 21 years of Joel Rogen's body memories I want to go back to that dude you don't know you're happy where you are and yes for sure yeah yeah yeah well that means you a well live life so what's up there with Jesus or I wouldn't we're having that body 30 year old body of like less problems your injuries yes yeah I've been beating on it for 21 years since then right it's like when I was 30s when I got hardcore into jujitsu so that's 20 years of getting choked but of course the Christian would say well God makes you whole again you'll have no injuries but that's not really part of you part of you is your injuries yes what I was gonna say those but all those did all the stuff that I did that hurt me I also learn from that's right make me stronger well not just that like learned the story I think through incremental struggle whether it's like rigorous exercise or learning something or I think everything that I do that's difficult makes me just a little bit more aware a little bit better at other things just a little bit a little bit better to talk to a little bit easier to deal with a little more friendly and all those things I think I wouldn't give up for anything I think that's more important than whatever injuries I've got with I think you know I wonder how you're gonna feel when you're 81 if you feel like that like there's got to be a point of diminishing returns like look I'd rather be stupid in 40 than to be enlightened and can't get out of bed very well my older Atlantic friends tell me it's about mid 80s when things drop off fairly quickly they could stay pretty fit into their 70s maybe still racing bike racing at 80 but 85 or so things drop off pretty quick that's where you got to go to a hormone replacement or whatever yeah or the ice plunges or the yeah the the young person's blood or something okay so I deal with it you know there's no break through miracles yet but again I'm not against any of these things happening you know when when someone like Jeff Bezos puts a hundred million dollars into an aging company I hope he's successful does he have one hundred million dollars in an aging company he and Peter Thiel and the Google guys through calico and a few others have invested many hundreds of millions of dollars into cut like calico for example these are companies that are trying to their big goal is to defeat aging through re-engineering cells something and that that's the sort of philosophical goal behind it is we have to defeat aging so people can live for centuries or forever to which I say let's not worry about living 500 years let's let's worry about like get prostate cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer's and dementia and so just a little incremental medical problem quality of life things what are the things that take people out young yeah right so that you can live a longer higher-quality life but don't imagine Michael Shermer at 300 years old no I keep this body if you can keep the body that you have now you're moving around great everything's well you look really healthy how smart would you be how much how much more enlightened more wise maybe is the wise I'm not against that I'm happy to live as long as I possibly can there what if they're people they go that's not right it's not natural it's like okay what's natural there's surveys on this people and people's answer is whatever the current average lifespan is so well 80 seems about right okay fast-forward to your the day before your 80th birthday tomorrow you're gonna go you want another week yeah I'll take another week okay then fast-forward six days would you like another month I'll take another month thank you and and that would never end so of course if you're healthy and happy and you don't want to off yourself or whatever it is you're super super depressed or something like that yes you're just gonna want to keep going nothing wrong with that if we can do that but what if you die and it's way better what if you die and you really do you leave your physical body there's no need for emotions and all the entanglements of human existence and you go to this beautiful place of bliss in life yeah love and it's just pure love without a body yeah unembodied yeah unhindered I don't know would that be fun I don't know what's is that what we're here for we're here for fun we're not just doing a shitty job to the channel going crazy right now we should be in a party van on the way to Vegas I had a college professor when I was in my Christian days who asked me when I was pitching him the Christian story he says are there golf courses and tennis courts in heaven because I like physical challenges you want to get out there and push myself right I don't know yeah so I mean would happen be no challenges no working out no physical you know tensions is true right yeah and if you don't need it and so you'd have to remove that part of humanity that we'd no longer want challenges and to be pushed to better ourselves do they play chess in heaven yeah that's right right right you to win in heaven or is everybody a winner everybody gets a gold medal and a Nobel Prize and whatever that's that is a problems but the things that we're attracted to the things we enjoy accomplishments and achievements and all these things that they exist only inside of the civilization inside of this this realm that we've created the significance of them is entirely based on our own agreements that you know it's important when you the king it's it's important when the ball goes into the net these we've agreed you know when someone shoots a three-pointer it's really not that big a deal you're just throwing a ball into a hole nothing really significant happens but because we've attached all this meaning to that then it's something that we really want to see and everybody score the goal went in the puck went in the net yes it becomes a giant thing if they just have no good answer for this when you say well what's heaven like well the psychics will tell you it's a bliss and lover but what does that mean it sounds again back to hitch it sounds boring yeah I have to stay at this party forever that sounds boring did you ever see the guy who took a photo of himself in heaven no he used the samsung galaxy phone yeah to take to take a picture of himself in heaven or there what clouds or just white is him like smiling it is one of the funniest fucking photos you're ever gonna find in the internet just because the context of it and it's fun yeah I believe he was an African gentleman who was either he's telling the truth or he's you know hilariously full shit I mean imagine if he really did go to heaven and took a picture and we're just mocking him maybe we should be going to him for advice that's right so what does it really found it you see the picture I find the mocking the memes of making fun of them afterwards there's no actual picture I'm trying to find the original just googled man takes I did that's what they so overwhelmingly mocking it's so good oh that's gotta be playing a large part yet it everyone yeah but no it was all white it wasn't like that it wasn't that it was just like it was that picture of him holding his hand up like that but it was just the background wasn't rainbows and shit like that you could find it man I have a faith in you I found it the other day it's a you know it's just hilarious that someone would be so confident to put that picture online knowing full well that the world is gonna see that picture and start rubbing a guy who sold his soul on eBay I forget what he got for it but and then a lot of religious people are offended by this you can't sell your soul Wow you sold your soul to your religion did he get a good price I don't know I think it was a few bucks or something yes and I forget he want it go to dinner with that yeah that's right but my concern about all of this obsession with the afterlife that's not it this is from his page it says woke up this morning and saw this had to take a picture oh okay that's not the actual photo the photo of him in heaven is with hilarious it's that picture with him that far left far left that's it that's it that's the photo that is him that is the photo went to heaven and that's it that's the exact photo he took I don't know who took the portal he's like hey angel do me a solid yes not a selfie no his one hand is down so he's not is not taking with that hand the other hand is up lets him in heaven love it the Internet is so good for mocking things though it's so good it's one of the best things ever in terms of like there's so many people that are paying attention and so many people that are funny that aren't comedians per se they just might work in an office somewhere and they've got a little bit of free time and they'll make a hilarious meme about something and then everybody runs with it and things just get mocked mercilessly remember the video of the guy he was having an interview and his kid started walking in behind him and he's trying to talk about foreign relations in Poland or something and the little kid is back here and then somebody the wife rushes in and so yeah anyway there's a bunch of funny spoof videos on that where it says that some woman is sitting there talking about nuclear strategy or whatever and then the kid comes in she's ironing the shirt and then she diffuses a bomb and then she cleans up the socks or whatever it's funny yeah there's it's just we we were always all of our information was distributed to us through these very controlled networks rather it's CBS or NBC or ABC and everything was very cut and dry and very professional in the way people talk the way information was presented but now it's just it's open and like as soon as I find out about something happened in the world I google it I go what is it what happened what happened I google it then I'll go to Twitter and when I go to Twitter it's all pictures and memes and and it's the dude with the question marks you know that guys like you know there's like so many memes that people will throw up when anything crazy happens in the world it becomes so interesting to hear the news and hear commentary in the news from this just gigantic mass of humans and it's what's most funny or most interesting or most succinct or poignant that rises to the top yep yeah there's endless content to entertain also just high-quality yeah content I mean I'm a Content producer I write and so on and but I am a huge consumer I go most of the people I follow on Twitter post articles most of them I want to read and so in the course of a couple hours my little window pop-ups you know just spread across the top of the screen I want to read all of these articles and I plow through as many as I can they're pretty much like the Atlantic or Vanity Fair time whatever they're pretty high quality well-written articles the problem is is a Content producer myself is that the half-life of these articles is so short like when I post one of my Scientific American columns metallo dove work into it and then you know like a couple hours later or maybe a day later god no one's talking about done yeah well I put a lot of work into that yeah but it out of the equation like the New York Times did that huge New York Times Sunday magazine article on Trump's business going all the way back to the 70s right right they spent like a year working on this like ten journalists this would have been a Pulitzer Prize winning piece this would have done in anybody else but Trump right I mean they had his old you know business contracts and lawsuits and you know all the shady stuff going on and and this got huge media attention for about a day and a half and by two you know Sunday morning by Tuesday no one's talking about this anymore it's like these guys spent a year working on this I mean what did it take to get that lawsuit paperwork from the courthouse you know and they had hundreds of things like that is like gun like whoa well it Trump in particular there's so many scandals that I think we've all become numb yeah there is that - yeah there's so many that you do you get numb to it and it doesn't doesn't affect you you just like her we paid off a woman whatever yeah those are the tiny ones the big ones are the lawsuits the businesses you know the construction businesses where he didn't pay small companies who didn't pay him like what sue me and then these companies went under like there's a lot of those right there's a lot of the the the unethical business practice that's all in that article yeah again anybody else would be done in by something like that any politician except him it's just amazing well it's also what he represents to those people it doesn't necessarily have to be what he really is it's what he represents what he represents is like the American flag and eagles and like they have this like really juvenile sense some folks do of what he is and what he represents right you know this despite all the evidence to the contrary they have him in this category that he's gonna drain the swamp and these liberals are just gonna cry and he's gonna make America better right you know and that's just that's that's the side that they're on they're on the make America better yeah yeah do you think it's also people don't have the time to really look into this stuff who could fact-check these things it's not just that it's like if you work eight hours a day and you have children and hobbies and how much time you really paying attention to Trump's ethics are you really really looking into it no I really considering it before you vote are you really taking into consideration what kind of a person he is and what what ripple effect it would have with any of these policies take place I think you're right people vote by their team this is my team I'm sticking okay so he won the primary all right that's my that's our guy we're shipping with him no matter what I think there's a huge element of that for sure yeah there's also people love to argue online too and as soon as they find someone who's opposed to something that they believe in they stick to their guns and they just hold strong despite all and I mean it would take so much for people to turn on Trump the real hardcore Trump believers it would take so much for them to decide enough is enough yeah well be interesting to see if members of his own party do something in 2020 probably not doesn't it seem like with Fox that Fox is slowly starting to shift their their coverage a little bit by criticizing him a little bit they're pushing back a little bit Shepard Smith is pretty good on that he's always been that way yeah yeah he's always been great at you'll probably last to go he's never going he's never come he's not if they had the same fucking lawyer yeah that's right I mean the fact that that didn't st. Canidae right you know that he had Michael Cohen was his lawyer like Oh yep yeah the only thing we count on the media is that there's lots of sources and you just have to just cross-check as many as you can don't take on any one channel well I wish there was a really truly objective service like it would be wonderful if there was people that were dedicated to no editorial slant whatsoever just 100% fact this is how we know the facts regardless left right no ideological curve to it at all wouldn't that be fair that there's got to be a market to that yeah of course they all say that that's what they do PolitiFact is pretty good they they're the fact-checking organization that I mean they're not purporting news at reporting on politics and the facts said by politicians yes so that's useful and I think there's a market competition amongst those people to get more hits yeah like we're fact-checking more than the other guys are fact checking although there is two different there was aim accuracy in media and then there was another one I forget the name and one was left-leaning and one was right leaning it's like can I have one without a wing you know you don't know right wing no left wing yeah it seems like that I mean I'm reading Jonathan hates book the the two books that I've been reading recently one of them we discussed on the podcast we did on Monday but the other one is the cobbling of the American I'm into that now and it's it's fantastic and he goes he covers this quite a bit yeah yeah you know Jonathan is onto something good there with the heterodox Academy which I'm a member professor at Chapman University and so I was the first member there and our university is pretty centrist we don't get a lot of these protests and microaggressions and safe space stuff it's it's pretty quiet and Jonathan's point is that it's more of a sort of East Coast West Coast public university thing or maybe Harvard that kind of thing middle of the country you don't see as much of that but the you know the polarization thing has got where she can see the poll since like 1990 to 2018 of you know yes people have how evil are the Democrats or Republicans and you know you know you used to be you know tiny little differences and they've you know they diverge like that now where the other side is not just wrong but they're immoral they are people I do think talk radio and television feeds into that you know if you just or now social media hmm in the bubble there so but on the other hand they get in the heterodox Academy has like 2,000 members now professors that said yep I'm gonna stand up against this censorship on college campuses you you were talking to Jonathan about people go Xion you had peed on and I've known Pete for many years before the hoax papers and I think they've had it in for him the long before the hoax papers well let's explain that to people so this could be standalone Pete Bogosian James Lindsay and what is the long island pluck rose and she wasn't on the podcast so I didn't get to meet her but they she's in England I believe right they published a bunch of preposterous papers like really ridiculous like on you know homo what is it the dog park one yeah agriculture and car park and the in the retranslation of a chapter from mine comp replacing femme it was males with Jews yeah eliminate the males they can yeah so they did one before they actually Pete and James Lindsay did one two years ago on the conceptual penis it was called and that the penis is a concept it's not it's not a real thing you know it's just you know it's a hilarious paper and the same month that came out it was published in a kind of a third-tier feminist studies journals so they got criticized like that's not one of the big ones so you didn't really Oaks anything but the same week that came out there was another paper published on feminist Glaciology and I thought oh someone beat peak to the hoax oh my god this is totally and I read it I thought this is what's hotter boat is at Lacey ology you know the study of glaciers oh yeah and that you know glaciers are very hard and and and erect and you so masculine and yeah anyway so I called the university that was affiliated with the lead author and I said this is a hoax right come on just before I say anything I don't wanna be embarrassed this is a hoax right no no this is real it's like I can't tell the difference between the conceptual penis paper which I know is a hoax cuz Pete wrote it and the feminist glaciology paper that's the problem well let's explain what's happening to Pete now because Pete was brought before Portland State University they there would examine him with with with faking data fraudulent data fraudulent research faking data that he didn't go through the institutional research board which approves experiments that professors want to run like for example you cannot do Milgram shock experiments where you hook people up and tell them they're you're gonna give electric shocks to somebody they may wouldn't approve that or or Phil Zimbardo fake jail where you randomly assign students to be prisoners or guards and they end up beating each other and they would never approve that okay so since that those sort of guerrilla theater experiments of the sixties the universities have tightened up the kind of researcher allowed to do even like the kinds of questions you would ask in a survey they have to approve all of that so of course Pete and James and Helen didn't do that because the first person well you know James was the primary director of this thing he's not affiliated with the University he doesn't have to answer to anybody right Pete was affiliated with it so they're getting him on that and that he didn't go through the IRB and get approval of course if you're gonna tell people if you're gonna fake something you can't tell him ahead of time and then we're get a fake of course as it's gonna get out and then the gig is that the analogy I made the other day was in 1971 a Stanford psychologist named david rosenhan clinical psychologist sent a bunch of his graduate students into mental hospitals all over the country and said just tell him you're feeling kind of blue and that you're you kind of hear this inner voice and that it's just you just kind of don't feel right and you need some help so they did they all got themselves checked in and then from there on out they acted perfectly normal and and then the goal was let's see how long it takes you to get out and so it was a study and how mental hospitals treat people who are completely sane so the title of his famous paper is called being sane in insane places so first of all the grad students report it's incredibly boring so one of them would sit there and write essays and take notes and and so in the psychiatrist evaluation of this patient is you know patient exhibits excessive writing behavior this is clearly an example of his erupting bidonville libidinal impulses from his childhood blah blah blah another one was a painter so she's doing paintings with landscapes and so on oh patient you can see in the paintings the erupting emotions and the conflicts in her personality they're just acting normal right so the point of this hoax was that there's something wrong with our mental institutions that they can't tell the difference between a sane and an insane person what are they doing so of course the industry got pretty upset about being hoaxed so rosenhan came back and said okay then the next year I'm gonna send in some more let's see if you can find him and he didn't send anybody oh wow so they're like okay we think this guy is fake again they couldn't tell the difference in their own patients and no one was even thinking so in a way this is kind of what Pete and James and Helen did it's like if they're sending these papers out if you can't tell then what are you doing in this field well people are for whatever reason people are some people I should say are drawn to these nonsense ideas and one of the papers the dog park paper got it got lauded for its excellent scholarship yeah and it got praised right it's it's one of the weirder ones that they hoaxed I mean because it's so obviously preposterous when you're reading it you look at that I think it was the fat body building one that good I think it won an award just the best paper we've ever had yeah and really Payton and James and Helen they are like professional scholars in the grievant studies yeah because it's if you read those things it's hard to write like that I mean it takes it took them a lot of practice to get the jargon and the style down well what do you think is the what are the options for someone like Pete because if he does get fired from the University what what could he possibly do I mean what Jordan has done is pretty extraordinary he's essentially left teaching at because of the controversies that he went through he became famous he became famous for doing podcasts and writing things and and then his YouTube videos are they're so insightful and and wonderful that people just got drawn to him and then they go to see him speak live like they've made him into a monster but by censoring him by attacking him they've essentially turned him into a global international star that's right this is the bit one of the best arguments against censorship is it's gonna have the opposite effect you wanted to if someone is of the quality of Jordan right Peter says it's pretty rare it's pretty rare I've talked to Pete about this as well as Brett Weinstein because he suffered the same thing at Evergreen and he's out at least he and his wife Heather got a payout so they have a little cushion but this model like you know say I'm on patreon or Dave Rubin especially Jordan Peterson very rare it's very rare to be able to make a living as a public intellectual on your own most public intellectuals that are not in academia there with a think tank you know the Cato Institute or Reason magazine or you know any of these there's left wing right wing they're all over the board you know it's possible they could get jobs there where you actually have a paycheck and those groups are usually funded by wealthy supporters that just we like the cause and here's a pile of money not through patreon it's possible that Pete and say it Bret could do this but it's a tough row to hoe I mean Jordan is very rare I've you know watched this through my whole life and you know this idea of making $10,000 a talk $50,000 to talk $100,000 a talked almost nobody gets that kind of money right you know maybe Neil deGrasse Tyson Richard Dawkins maybe Carl Sagan back in the day whatever the equivalent of that would have been in the 80s but that's pretty much it you know and there's thousands of scientists that would love to like yeah I want to go that well they're not entertaining the thing about Jordan is he's very engaging yeah like he's in his words are its it's not just they're wise it's not just he's very articulate there's something engaging about the style and which he presents these things it's it's very captivating it's very charismatic I agree you know people discount that or you know I know a lot of scientists who were kind of jealous of Neil deGrasse Tyson or say Bill Nye it's like oh I could do that no I doubt that you can I mean Neil and Bill are really entertaining they are funny they are engaging you can't take your eyes off them they're so much fun to watch well perfect most people are not like that Sean Carroll's brilliant he's really brilliant and I'm glad that he's doing a podcast now and do but when you listen to him talk and you listen a Neil talk Neil just has this booming presence and this sense of drama and energy and entertainment he knows how to be he he knows how to deliver it in a way that just catches you it's fun to listen to yeah that's a lot you and I did a public event in Australia and Melbourne area Sydney and I unfortunately I went before him and maybe that's actually good and I'm a pretty good public speaker I have a sense of you know my value as a public speaker I'm pretty good but and I never seen him speak and and I did my talk like might it's pretty much like my TED talk you can watch online it's pretty entertaining okay so I get up and I'm done I get a nice applause I'm feeling pretty good and then Neil gets up and he starts I'm like oh crap this guy is fucking good you don't want to know I'm so glad I already went you've got so much energy yeah and yeah but he also has I don't know that sort of charisma connection with the audience yeah it captures them and yeah I could tell afterwards you know throngs of people around him and yeah it's it's there and not very many people have that and I don't think it's something you can just learn I think it's a temperament you know you can hone it and refine it but you can't just sort of naturally be funny and engaging I think it's personality that comes out you I think you can certainly improve but I think you're right I think whatever personality you have like he has that kind of engaging fun personality and it's it translates very well to doing those public speeches since I was here a year ago I saw Jordans event at in Thousand Oaks at the Cavalier they're 2,000 seats sold out standing room only and it was good he was like different than neal of course but just as engaging yeah wasn't political a lot of people there I you know recognized me and I could see you know these aren't like right-wing nuts these aren't young mailed angry mails this isn't like this at all and his message was you know pretty straightforward get your life in order you know this is the way life is it's hard and he kind of went through his thing and it's like alright that makes sense and people loved it very almost no politics in it and Dave Rubin tells me he doesn't really get political on stage so that's not the motive and I think you know life is hard enough for most people that they like back to the self-help thing it's nice to be reminded here are a few simple things you could do ya get your life in order it's like yeah yeah I kind of knew that I'm gonna go back out and do that again well his principles are very effective - they're very straightforward less you said but with a guy like people goes you know to bring it back to that what what could he do if he does get fired it's gonna be very difficult for him to get a job at another university right he's obviously got roots in Portland he lives there now it's the whole thing is he's pretty liberal it's not like he's a closeted conservative now in there after him he's definitely more liberal than me and I could tell even years ago that they're gonna they're gonna go after him I can tell mainly because he's so he puts truth and free speech ahead of political positions you might say I'm a liberal and these are my political decisions but more important to me is the truth yes okay well that's know as Jonathan make point and points out and in his book universities are now at this divide between are we here for social justice or are we here for truth and they're having to make a decision and too many of them are going for it we're here for social justice well then just be honest about it because that's not you can't bury it well not just that I don't think that's an effective way to pursue so social justice if you're ignoring the truth you'd undermine your message because then it's it's not like it's hidden somewhere it's not like people can't read into it and see exactly what you've said and how you supported certain causes and denied the the reality of others right but the the Google memo thing yeah the Google memo thing was a gigantic disaster yeah because ideologically people jumped on a side and argued and I heard the the CEO of YouTube talk about how damaging it was to women and like what are you talking about like what are you saying like What did he say he's just talking about preferences that are described by tests this is this has all been steered studied papers on the differences between the Preferences of males versus females it's not it's not like a value assessment at all in fact not only that he put into his paper a page and a half of recommendations of how to get certain women interested in tech and perhaps you could recruit certain women make it more palatable or exciting to them and that's not a it's not a sexist screen at all no no no there's a online there's a really good debate with Steve Steven Pinker and in a feminist scholar at Harvard and Steve has all his slides up there and he just goes all through all the different things that are in that Google memo this is before the Google memo maybe James Moore got some of that from Pinker's lecture but it's it's it's pretty solid stuff there was nothing in in inflammatory about the debate this is kind of normal scientific debates you know here's a study that shows this well but there's this other study and then they go at it mm-hmm okay and a story we're not saying women are better men writer that doesn't have it well unfortunately they could so here if I was Pete's boss here's what I would do because a lot of us have written letters in support of Pete and you could kind of see what's about to happen let's just drop this whole thing let him keep his job keep our mouth shut because this is gonna backfire on us big time like it did with evergreens to university yeah yeah or with the Google memo said yes that's what backfire in the Google memo I mean we realize that they've got a preposterous ideology over there now we know that maybe their stock price hasn't kind no I don't think it affected them very much and and many more people support it many more people who it's it's one of those things where you hear one version of it and that version sticks you know it's like you know this is the the version is he's a sexist you know the sexist Google memo and then that's all I need the Google memo is very sexist it's very anti female and the being there's many many people who support the idea that something that was sexist was removed from Google they've made it a safer environment for women right yep but did they I don't you know I don't know what this doesn't seem like they did it seems like they made it an environment where you have to be careful about facts right again it's not a value assessment of women if women choose to go into the medical fields more women or physicians more women there's many fields that like disproportionately attract women that's not a negative value assessment that's just people are different well you know I don't I don't want to do with certain people do because I'm different than them I know I'm not attracted to those fields right it's fascinating to find out why people are attracted and when you see that there's actually there's just actual statistics in terms of what fields men are more attracted to or what fields women are more attracted to now on the other hand if there's a reason why women aren't attracted those fields because they get harassed when they go into them well that should be demonstrated and that's a obviously a bad thing and that should be addressed yeah absolutely that's not what he's talking about no and James d'amour is like a very kind soft-spoken you had one he's great yeah he's a nice guy he's very introverted he's a kind guy and he's on the spectrum somewhere there was no way you'd look at James the more I go there's the patriarchy yeah he's a nice guy and they said to him if you have any input on these things and feel like you can help please contribute and he's like okay so he's that's what he is he's a he's a fucking software engineer right he's right he sat down and looked at all the data and compiled it and he's saying well actually it seems like this is the reason why women are more attracted to other jobs and this is the reason why men are more attracted to the fields and like sexist he's like no no these are the studies this is what you're asking me to do that the concern that if the science doesn't come out a certain way then people won't be treated equally is a bad idea because then you're gonna force the science to be distorted if it doesn't match your political ideology and that's so whether trans is natural or how whatever percentages or how old you have to be before you get trans surgery and the hormones or whatever oh that that's a raging debate right now but under under underline that debate is like we have to make it come out in a way that trans people are treated equally it's like no no they should be treated equally anyway yeah heartless of what the science says right but that that's that's a problem now now the problem for people I peed and Brett like joining a think tank is almost all these think tanks are politically affiliated left or right you have to that and therefore you have to kind of tow the political line this is our ideology in this think tank and you're gonna write white papers and op-eds and send them out with our kind of slant the problem with that is well but what if I disagree with this and this and this here well then you can't work here something like that so that's the problem with those right but is not the only option today when you see that I mean I know he's not Jordan and you know there's there's very few people like Jordan but Sam Harris is also able to do these speed he's very compelling as well he's doing a lot of public speeches and doing these big big events there's more opportunity to do alternative things now than have ever been before and I would hope that that becomes available to look I hope Pete just keeps his job but if he can't keep his job at Portland State I would hope that some other Avenue some other some other path is possible yep it might be you know you never know but you know you put a date on the calendar and you tell the world did they come do they pay ten bucks a ticket fifty bucks a ticket hundred dollars a ticket not many people can fill a 3 thousand seat auditorium or a 500-seat Ram well I think he could do is do a lecture series on the grievant studies and have the three of them on stage talk about how silly these things were if they could put that together as a presentation yeah it'd really be funny because there's some hilarious subjects total over the others have read with George Lindsay inand Bogosian we're in here and we were talking about these things we were crying laughing yeah it was really really funny stuff yeah that's actually probably the best path for him yeah is to put together some sort of a public show they should do a book and then have a book a show yeah and then maybe even a TV documentary matter what they have somebody's making the document that's a good start yeah when I was in college at Pepperdine G gordon liddy and Timothy Leary did a stage show Wow and they were and they were touring the country doing this yeah it was at UCLA so I drove down and saw it and it was so entertaining I mean gee gordon liddy you know he's the g-man there with his three-piece suit and he's got his gun and Timothy Leary comes out in his boat shoes and his flower shirt and and but they had it kind of scripted but it was well scripted in a way that seemed kind of spontaneous but it was really funny and educational about how the government works and freedom versus security and rights and I thought that was brilliant and I think they did I don't like a 50 City tour of that G gordon Liddy was on fear factor he was yeah oh I didn't know that's an interesting guy he all his hand above a flame no he didn't but we did hang him by his ankles and slam him into a pool like over and over and over again who's I forget what the stunt was but I was like Jesus this guy's old to be doing this but he did some physical challenges I remember thinking like this guy is more fit and more active than most young people and he was deep into his 60s at the time yeah when we had him on Fear Factory the only thing that screwed him up was in the end the final stunt was a driving stunt and it was at night and unfortunately his eyes are not that good and he just couldn't see well without glasses so as he was driving the car he slammed into something or something it was what he got him there no it's all right but chance to talk to him for a few days he did hang out with them very interesting guy yeah yeah strong mind yep that's right he had a talk show back in the 90s I was on when my first book came out white people believe or think and I talk about conspiracies there and so he asked me well tell me about conspiracies well you tell me about conspiracy you know more than I do he doesn't a real one yeah that is my number one beef with conspiracy theories is that when you you know some of them that are so preposterous like whether it's Flat Earth or what were the really dumb ones there's a base on the opposite side of the Moon and NASA knows about all the aliens are living in New Mexico lizard people the problem with those is they undermine actual conspiracies when you when you hear about preposterous things and they they get fault they get categorized as conspiracy theories then when someone says well there's a conspiracy about this well it's already a tainted idea because the word conspiracy is connected to nonsense right because there's so many nonsense conspiracy theories it's hard to recognize Oh something like Enron that really did happen yeah I think there is the Northwoods Papers there's a bunch of like legitimate conspiracies you like Wow you know you found about the gulf of tonkin you like well they they really did that yeah that's right yeah I'm writing a paper now and why people believe conspiracies and so I go through the whole list of all the psychological things but I and what the whole second half is because a lot of them are true and yeah and there are reasons we should be suspicious yeah just think of the the WikiLeaks or the Panama papers you know like the Panama papers here's all these billionaires opening these shell corporations keeping their money they're not paying tax that's a conspiracy you know by definition two or more people meeting in secret to conspire to benefit themselves that arms the public good or other people this happens a lot in the US government in corporations yeah there's a reason we should be suspicious there is but what is it about people that want to look for a conspiracy in everything even if it's you know that they want to see they want to see contrails behind jets as evidence of the government spraying things in the sky to control our minds right so the sort of baloney detection tools are not too finely tuned the problem is is that we're the tendency is to look for some global simple explanation for complex systems so while we all kind of recognize yes we know corporations cheat and stock traders trade with inside information but that's kind of small and mundane it's not very interesting global domination of the world you know this is who's doing that you know then it becomes like a Dan Brown novel it's more compelling as a narrative story about how the world works is super simple there's these twelve guys in London called the Illuminati and they're calling the shots and they're they're you know they're controlled Hilda burger the Bilderbergers the Rockefellers the Rothschilds the naughty CFR a new world order yeah George Soros is doing it he's a part of it Oh totally it's right here he's number 13 in the Illuminati there's so many different competing theories too so it's a couple of criteria the more people that have to be involved the less likely it is to be true it was gordon Liddy that told me this that you know it was it three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead you know people can't keep their mouths shut and also he would know because he worked in government most people are pretty incompetent so the idea that you could orchestrate a thousand people to and each of them is gonna go out and do this one thing at nine o'clock Tuesday and it's all gonna come together just perfect impossible yeah and he should know I mean they couldn't even break into the watergate hotel room to get these papers what's also who is getting into government the first place are they the geniuses of the world the heads of their field or are they people that just like decided to get into a job you know and this is this is a good percentage of the people that are involved in government if those people know as well these unexceptional folks that are just like uninspired and they were also there like the do they its they that's right that's the air quotes they they they really have the kind of wherewithal to control the whole world mind control that's my favorite right my control psyops I mean this idea that you know operatives went into the World Trade Center buildings both of them two of the most tightly controlled and secure buildings in the world and under the pretense of working on the elevators managed to get into a break through the drywall to get into the main beams to wrap them up in explosive devices this thermite and stuff and this would do you know we know how long it takes to demolish a stadium or a big building you know that they work they're there for week for months preparing all the explosive devices somehow they did this in the World Trade Center building without anyone noticing not to mention all the people that worked on this they never told their spouses or friends or buddies or you know what they were doing or they didn't mention it to anybody they don't want to go on CNN or 60 minutes ago I saw something in here's what happened nobody well anytime you have a gigantic catastrophe like that just a gigantic horrific event there's so many emotions there's so much chaos there's so much going on that you're gonna get a bunch of really wacky eyewitness accounts because people just aren't good at remembering things when when they're under extreme duress and it's just a fact they hear things they remember explosions they see things that might aren't necessarily what was really in front of them this is the human memory is one of the most flawed ways of gathering information right it's terrible we have terrible memories right and everything once something happens then you back up and look for all the sort of pregnant moments leading up to it that otherwise would have been unnoticeable like with the JFK assassination there's a famous story about the umbrella man yes okay so it's a clear sunny day why does he have an umbrella and for decades there you can go online you can see these like examples of how the umbrella could have been turned into a rifle and then he shot like that and and anyway somebody finally tracked this guy down decades later and he said I was out there protesting Kennedy the umbrella was a protest and that stems back to Neville Chamberlain coming back after meeting with Hitler before Hitler annexed I think it was a sedating land and he came back and said you know holding his umbrella here I had you know here Hitler signed this paper and promised he wouldn't do anything more bad and so the umbrella became a symbol of you know sort of caving in to evil people or you know what's the word for it you know appeasement how convoluted do you think people gonna get that and I don't know he's out so this what he said I had my umbrella too because I didn't like what Kennedy was doing with Castro and the Cubans okay so in other words the umbrella meant nothing terms of the assassination right and this is true so like 9/11 oh there was this little puff of smoke or somebody found this passport over here this little thing all those little things really it's just randomness well the other thing is the the people that want to think that the windows blowing out are indicative of some sort of expose old demolition or the building's caving in if the floor pan cam it pushes the air out yeah yeah well it's there's never been a controlled demolition that went from the top down either like the way they did it the Prince tram they all go from the bottom up right yeah it's the one that looks crazy is building seven Tower seven that one looks crazy it does but it burned for like eight hours or something and yeah that one's just slightly fuzzier but explosive experts tell me that it's fully explicable by burning all day well also when you see the images of it collapsing what you don't see is the interior structure had collapsed previously and there's video of that when you watch the interior cave-in and that as this fire was burning because apparently there was obviously I don't know what really what happened but there was diesel tanks apparently in the basement and the diesel fuel would burn incredibly hot and the whole inside of it all the structure had been completely weakened and and then as it collapsed it just all gave out it just happened to be a shit design if I was a guy who owned that building I would sue everybody I mean that's the I mean he got his money back I guess because there's some insurance money but that what a terrible design there was some issue with the legal insurance payout to the owner of the World Trade Center buildings whether this was like one event or two events or one building or two you know what is it it was what the difference was between like 8 billion and 16 billion dollar payout or something Wow how do they get people to get into that new building I'd be like fuck you I'm not I'm not renting an office in this building this building they blew it up in 93 they blew it up again in 2001 hey get out of here with this shit I'm not taking a chance of this new ass building what is it the Freedom Tower something yeah this is a big old bullseye yeah yeah I haven't been in it yet I've been around it but something even that big well it's I think it's just I think it's taller than the it's not it's not it's not any big as the original Towers right I think it is his tall is it yeah I think I think so yeah I thought it was shorter it's definitely not as big as they want to do by the Dubai ones like a half a mile right isn't something crazy like that I don't know how tall is the tallest building it is I just went to there oh the One World Trade Center leasing page it says at 1776 feet One World Trade Center is the tallest L AED Gold certified building in the Western Hemisphere that's not good no whatever down America we need to be number one number one we need to go straight to the moon in the solar system yeah we need to take an elevator right to the fucking moon right outside of space is that possible can they build a building that's so high that it goes into space one I don't think so because structurally it wouldn't hold went up to make it the shape of a pyramid well it's like why aren't trees you know a thousand feet tall because the material would just collapse no no no I don't think you could have it strong it'd have to be so fat oh that's right Japan was gonna build that space elevator oh look at you got jack with the pop-ups Japan takes tiny first steps towards space elevator yeah you could fuck off I'm not getting in that thing I would take a few years before I'm willing to climb into that sucker but so the other problem with conspiracies just get back there for a moment is the problem of anomalies what do you do with anomalies this is true in all science no theory explains every single thing that's out there that we want to study there's always going to be some like quirky thing that the main theory here that explains all these things here it doesn't account for that mm-hmm okay what did we do with that well my joke is you assign it to a grad student they let them figure it out but what what Outsiders mistake is that well my theory explains this little anomaly so therefore it should replace this theory and so people like Neil and Sean Carroll Lawrence Krauss Michio Kaku has like two web pages one he has a link on his web page if you have an alternative theory of physics go to this page so they go there and as your theory has to explain all of these things over here that our theory currently explains and your whatever your said anomaly is and of course they can't so it's not that scientists are dogmatically closed-minded to the anomalies it's that we can't explain everything and you don't have to do anything with that just just leave it there maybe eventually they'll pile up and there'll be a new theory like with Einstein's relativity okay there's enough anomalies here like the orbit of mercury and a few other things and so we have to modify Newtonian physics a little bit okay that happens but for the most part like and so conspiracies are filled with these things like the moment something big happens you go back and okay but there's this weird thing here how do you explain that I don't know we don't have to explain everything do you know that there's a growing movement that think that the the space is fake space is fake no I this is he different than the Flat Earth rules little hash tag space is fake hash tag space is faith it's people that are so fucking stupid the flat earthers kicked him out oh my god for real flat earthers kicked out the spacious fake people space is fake is their the the most skeptical so what would be the upper atmosphere would be the edge it's all bullshit it's all fake and it's tied in some weird way to religion which is really interesting because even the Flat Earth people there's a tremendous amount of them that are extremely religious and they they talk about the firmament and the Bible Bowl in the Bible and that this is this is what's really going on is that they're trying to keep us from the knowledge that God has created this place is a very special place right and so by pretending that it's round they somehow or another are controlling us we're thinking that we're not exceptional we're not lucky space is fake they're using a video from Ryan Gosling's movie he just made about in the Armstrong the first man in the moon yes be like this is look look here's proof take everything they're making a movie because literally the way they made the movie is that's evidence that it's fake because he's wearing it I don't know if maybe this person doesn't recognize that as being Ryan Gosling right there mmm it's got a NASA suit on maybe it's just a troll account this is how NASA makes everything this is the video I was talking about guys now you know it's all a big act Flattr has to click on spaces fake though I'm on I'm on the hole yeah but I can click on it because there's a bunch of other no I'm on that thread there's a tremendous amount of people that literally believe that space is not real Google video of how Buzz Aldrin and how he deals with the no Muniz that we never went to the moon there's a video Buzz Aldrin punching a guy yeah you see that that guy I I had dinner with that guy you did the guy he punched yeah I was a firm believer that we never went to the moon yeah you know this is what happened I watched that Fox documentary yeah the moon conspiracy theory did we go and I was like holy shit because it was on television I was and this was 96 97 I remember I went to work and I told everybody you got to see this documentary it's crazy we never went to the moon and I watched that one and I watched this guy's what is his name bart sibrel so I had dinner with him he absolutely believes that we never went to the moon 100% believes it I don't know if he still believes it I think he's like a cab driver or something now he got he was involved in the news or there's no local television or something like that back where he's from then he released a documentary called the fun a funny thing happened on the way to the moon and in his documentary one of the things he did have is some really interesting footage of the lunar module where it looks like they're faking a shot of them being really far out but then when they remove this cover the covers from all the windows that were inside the the lunar not the lunar module what is the one that the orbiter it really looks like they're in low-earth orbit and this is like the the main thing pointing to that like they couldn't get out of low Earth orbit mm-hmm then there was also the fact that they lost all of the telemetry data which was the binary you know the ones and zeroes it showed the position of the lunar module at every stage there was a bunch of different things the fact that no one wanted especially Neil Armstrong he became a recluse never wanted to talk about it you go and watch the press conference the press conference they look very shady look earth it completely if it lessens like that wellhe's Devery buddy he was a drunk for a long time though he was he was very depressed and had when became an alcoholic after the moon landing and the idea is that the in conspiracy circles from talking as them the idea is that he got over it after a while needed to make a living now it talks about it constantly but Neil Armstrong never did the thing that's compelling is that there was there were some there's some faking going on if you look at Gemini was a Gemini 15 Michael Collins there's an image of Michael Collins when they were testing some of the space walking stuff and some of the some of the things they would do to to to walk outside of a spaceship they had them all strapped up with cables and they're just experimenting with these things they took that photograph and then blacked out the background probably some overzealous PR agent hmm and we wondered like in the cool is it right here so what it is is like so the the first one is clearly he's you know in a studio and they're working on things and just trying to understand how all this stuff works and the second one they took the exact same photo and just reversed it and blacked out the background and they but it's just that doesn't mean that they didn't go to the moon that just means that someone got a hold of some photographs and faked it and it's way more likely that there was more of that going on then that people didn't actually go to the moon right yeah yeah yeah the thing about going to the moon that's really interesting is if they can go again and they do go again and they find all that stuff they're you know then everybody has to do oh yeah I guess we're wrong this stuff is I mean there is there's instruments on there that we still monitor that the Apollo astronauts left there well no modern necessarily monitor we shoot a laser up their head bounces off yeah but you know a laser will also bounce off the surface of the moon yeah but I don't think like they're not as precise right right yeah but the Russians did that too with Lanka hood one and two I believe they left solar or or laser reflectors up there as well with an unmanned mr. Japan has video footage as Vlasov like last week yeah first out of the dark silence that's all fake too because well space is fake dude there's no space of course the moon's not even what is the moon if space is fake how the hell explain that the images what's interesting is the images of the Dark Side of the Moon look exactly like even like the landing and the whole setup looks very similar to the Apollo missions so they would have to either be in cahoots or have worked together with now sound studio yeah to figure that use the old stuff yeah look at it I mean this is the footage I mean goddamn that looks eerily similar to what you saw when the Apollo astronauts were there I think it is entirely possible that some of the some of the practice film footage of them you know on the surface or doing things turned out to be pushed off as actual footage of moon landings I think there was no television well back then there was no internet there was no VCRs there was no ability to review things and watch them over again they projected something on television one time and that was it so when they've released pressed releases and videos it's entirely possible that some of those videos that got through were actually just tests it's entirely possible that there was just like the Michael Collins photos that there was some fuckery going on you're dealing with so many human beings right you're dealing with so many people yeah see the an estimated 530 million people watched Armstrong's televised image and heard his voice described okay what is that it was broadcasted live like six hours that day yes yeah it was actually broadcasted live on a projection screen what they did it was if they didn't get a straight feed they were filming the the footage that was on a projection screen that's how they did it and there's some wonky shit that looks like they fall down and then they get pulled back up by wires when they're on the surface of the Moon but again I think how much of that is how much of that is actual footage of them being on the moon and how much that is just test footage I mean I don't know I don't know I'm not sure about that but I think also I don't know jack-shit about space travel right I don't know anything about astrophysics I don't know anything about like what it takes to land on the moon and come back and whether or not that and most of the people that talk about this don't know that but Mythbusters did a nice episode on did you know did we fake going to the moon and they showed a bunch of little things for example on the moon with its gravity when you go something like that into the dust you know the particles come up and they are back down in a certain way that would be different than if you're on earth so the gravity's different causes the dust to settle reverently there was a bunch of things like that that proves we were there well it certainly proved that what took place took place in a vacuum yet not yet and a gravitational pull the same as the moon right you know only you've probably seen the feather and the hammer drum yeah but you know you can do that here well yes in a vacuum yes that's right yeah but but even a feather in a hammer even if it's a depends upon what kind of feather it is but a feather and a hammer even if you just held them here and dropped him on the ground they probably would land at a very similar pace there's a spoof video about that we never went to the movie that a couple British comedians that that pshew brick thing is that with a Kubrick one no peel what's their name I forget key and key and peele yeah so the three of them are talking and you know okay we're gonna fake this whole thing and and and then they're Troubleshooters she's like well now you know people are gonna ask well how did we go to the moon and we're gonna have to you know build a big rocket so we can say well we went in that big rocket and they're like well how much would it cost to build that big rocket well it would be really expensive I mean we might as well just go to the moon and then they'd start talking about the expenses well we only have to feed three of them if we go to the moon but if we shoot it as a shoot here in the studio we have to have catering for everybody to be super expensive and it kind of goes on like that it's very funny that is funny but the conspiracy theorists would say well they couldn't send someone to the moon so they had to fake it that's why they haven't been back they went from 1969 to 1973 so what it was six successful missions seven attempts Apollo 13 being the one that didn't make it it's a it's a fun theory and what happened with me is I got way better at spotting bullshit and learning critical thinking skills and then paying attention to all sides I mean the real issue with something like that is if someone could prove definitively beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only is it impossible that no one ever went to the moon absolutely prove it that would be giant yeah you mean really would be yeah I mean it would be a huge story but Ken is it even possible to do that you know what the other analogy I use like with the WikiLeaks is there of all those tens of hundreds of thousands of memos and papers and letters and government documents there's not one mention anywhere of 9/11 as an inside job you know and we had to allocate these funds to go to this construction company who was then seen working at the World Trade Center but nothing like that so that in this case the absence of evidence is evidence of absence it didn't happen not an inside job and this 9/11 one yeah and something like that would be true for the moon-landing I mean all those people that worked on that not one of them saw anything and wanted to write a book on 60 minutes the idea would be that there was compartmentalised and that everyone like say if you're working on the o-rings you don't have access to the people are working on the thrusters if you have access to this you don't have access to that and that there was only a very small group of people that controlled everything also 1969 was very different environment in terms of like what you get away with and not get away with what you could say it's just it was really fun it was really fun to believe that that fake going to the moon I spent an inordinate amount of time looking at it but I completely dropped it I completely dropped it after I just I paid attention to what I actually know so but now you can kind of empathize with those who do believe yeah oh yeah but you want to hear a dumber one yeah here's a dumber one for the longest time like months I believed in the thing called rods do you know the little insects this yeah well they would it this guy put out this duck that there was these things flying so fast we couldn't see them with the naked eye and that they were like jellyfish-like creatures that lived amongst us and they had all this video footage of the especially these people that were jumping they were skydiving into this enormous cave in Mexico and as their skydiving into this cave you see those things flying back and forth and I was hook line and sinker I was like oh my god these things were around us all the time I was like going outside and looking up trying to spot them like imagine these beings that are flying so fast we can't we can't see them the only way you captured was on camera and then a show called Monster quest cracked the riddle right they show that it's a video artifact and then if you have really high speed camera you just see the insect right but if you have low speed standard definition video cameras it creates this artifact as these things pass by very close to the lens at a high rate of speed it along gates their video signal and it makes them look like like this jellyfish type of thing right but it's really just a video artifact yeah again it's a good example of anomalies you know here's this weird video anomaly what is it about just say I don't know well if you don't know anything about video it's it's way easier to say oh that's the absence right yeah you know take a camera put it outside you will capture these things I'm amazing right yeah that's right the other aspect with conspiracy theories is cognitive dissonance that is we want the size of the event to be matched by a cause that's equally of that size so the analogy I use is you know the Holocaust the worst genocide in human history caused by the Nazis the worst regime political regime in human history there's a match there right but if you say something like you know JFK the leader of the free world brought down by who Lee Harvey Oswald just some nobody you know there's this mismatch or 9/11 this huge thing by 19 guys with box cutters do you think that doesn't Harvey Oswald acted alone yeah do usually what makes you think that all of the evidence and none of the evidence against anybody else and all of the evidence against particularly him Gerald Posner book case closed and then the attorney what's his name that was the men yeah he he has a massive book where he lines up every single one of the arguments by the conspiracy for example conspiracists make a big deal about as well it got a job at the Book Depository building which just happened to be where the parade just happened to be where the parade route was going so you could have a clear shot so it was Posner that tracked down when the White House determined even when Kennedy was going to Dallas let alone what the parade route would be and Oswell already had the job there that's just chance so he knew in advance bro he knew that you knew that do you think it's possible that Oswald was in cahoots no no no why do you think that what about the Magic Bullet theory well that's been settled by the fact that the way it showed in the videos is that the two seats are like this and that the bullet has to do this well in fact the seats were like that and that Connally was well you have this in audio form just when you're saying oh yeah so it's like stadium seating right ones elevated above the other that's right so the bullet actually does when it passes through the neck through Kennedy's neck and then hits Connolly's shoulder it is already moving down I think it hit his wrist infraction interesting right um the this has been tested and tested and tested well sort of here's here's my issue with it there's a couple it's just one on the pro side the idea that bullets will take a straight path is ridiculous I've talked to hunters that have shot animals in the front and had a bullet come out the same side they shot it it ricocheted off bones and and came out like the front of the animal like bullets take weird paths when they hit things in particular so two arrows they take and as a person who's well-versed in firearms and shot the animals and hunted you don't sometimes the bullet goes straight through and sometimes it hits bones and wacky things happen things deflect but on the negative side they always distort bullets always distort particularly when they hit bone what bothered me was that they found that bullet in Connolly's gurney when they brought him to the hospital they just conveniently found this bullet AHA we have it this is the bullet it matches the the same rifle yeah and but it wasn't pristine it was flattened barely if you look at that bullet that bullet it's nothing like a bullet that's it when bullets hit bone they they mushroom they balloon they Bend they distort wildly they don't come out looking like that they come out looking like that when you shoot him into water or when you shoot them into like feathers they don't come out looking like that under normal circumstances when they shatter the bone of two different people well do you know that for sure no I do not know that for sure but I'm one thing I do know a lot about is ID I know quite a bit about what bullets look like when they hit things I've looked into this pretty extensively and I've talked to a lot of people in law enforcement military hunters and none of them believe that that bullet hit bones shattered bones and came out looking like that is it possible that that bullet was the only bullet ever in the history of the world that did do that yeah it might be okay so we're getting kind of caught up in the weeds of the anomalies what about this just a bullet Oswald himself had attempted to assassinate a general named Walker six months before with his rifle and a handgun and he went over to the house he took a shot through the guy's when he saw him at the desk took a shot missed him he told his wife about it he's I'm a revolutionary I'm trying to start so don't get me don't get me wrong I'm not saying that Oswald was innocent I'm not I mean and I think it's very possible that Oswald did shoot at the president you might have even hit the president it's also very possibly that some other people were involved as well who I don't know say this is the problem but wait a minute why is it a problem if you guys they are just because you don't know who they are doesn't mean well they'd say but why do we need to postulate extra people because of all the gun shots that happen in the short amount of time the fact that the reason why they came up with the theory of the magic bullet in the first place because they had to account for a bullet that hit a curb underneath the overpass do you know that right yeah okay there's three there's there's okay if you know why they came out with them yeah I've been there do you know why they came up with short I mean it's right there you could first not miss the point well it's not that's that's sort of true yeah it's not a far shot and he was a pretty good marksman a posner track down is we're not talking about that we're talking about the reason why they came up with the magic bullet here in the first place do you know why well I thought it was because of the alignment of the seats no because they had to attribute three shots they had and one of the they were they were thinking well the all these wounds came from three bullets but then they found a bullet that had hit the curb on the underside the guy checked into a hospital because he was hit with a ricochet so there's a curb that they proved was hit with a bullet there was a bullet hole in the the granite or whatever the fuck the curbs made out of it hit this guy he went to the hospital so he was hit with a ricochet so they knew that one bullet had not hit the president and so they had to attribute all of these wounds to one bullet now they had one bullet that landed into his neck another bullet that hit him in the head right and what's a war how do these three bullets cause a wound nicely as well then they came up with the map there's a there's the bullet look at that but you have to look at this at the end it's flattened if you look at it from the end no it's not look at this under no circumstances do I feel that this bullet could hit a wrist and still not be deformed we proved that by experiments as a chief consultant in wound ballistics for the US Army who supervised tests for the Warren Commission here's the thing I don't I don't necessarily think that there was some grand conspiracy but I do think it's entirely possible that someone took that posthumously took that rifle and wanted to pin it on Lee Harvey Oswald definitively like there's people that do things when they know someone's guilty and they plant evidence mark Fuhrman did that with OJ Simpson they found his glove they planted evidence and there was one of the reasons why o J got off because there was some sort of conspiring to make it look like he was you know it was the evidence is a clear path they could have just taken that rifle and look could have been that our Oswald did it alone it's possible but also could have been that some other people were shooting at him too it could have been that they had decided to have Oswald be a part of this and when Jack Ruby ran in and shot him that doesn't look a little suspicious that some guy with ties to the mob gets right up to this guy who just shot the president and shoots him like why he's never shot every before do it publicly Posner talks about Ruby's character and who he was major Kennedy supporter running with some bad dudes some bad hombres there in Texas and he was a gun owner security wasn't anything like it is now he really could just walk right in right like he did it spots but it's also possible that that guy owed something to the mob and this is what they told him to do he gonna get rid of that guy no one's gonna care they're gonna be happy fuck that guy just shot the president it seems so it seems like people want it to be one way or the other and they want they want this case closed obviously that way I mean Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy and that was evident pretty quickly afterwards right and they rounded him up you know World War one was launched by a conspiracy with the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian group of called the black hand a group of nationalists well your Vietnam or to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that's a false flag so these things do happen there are no flags there are conspiracies to assassinate foreign leaders you know hit wrote this book on Kissinger as a war criminal that you know all the shenanigans we were doing in South America with dictators there we're back in this dictator because he's the son of a bitch but he's our son of a bitch versus this guy and we're gonna you know sassanid Castro all the stuff that came out that Johnson tried to cover up that came out in the Pentagon Papers about Kennedy plotting to have Castro assassinated that's the kind of conspiracies yeah this absolutely this does happen the question is did it happen in that particular case or this one or a year and the evidence in my opinion after reading particularly Gerald depositors booked case closed its there's a funny internet meme that went around last week of a guy who dies goes to heaven and God says you you've been such a good fellow your whole life I'll grant you one wish he can ask me anything he said all right who killed Kennedy mm-hmm and God said it was Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone using his own Carcano rifle and the guy goes this goes higher up than I thought that's funny man did you ever read David Lifton's novel oh yeah best evidence that best evidence I didn't read the whole book you know when I was researching this back in the 90s when after the Oliver Stone film came out because after yeah when that came out I thought man if only half of this or 10% of this is true it's definitely a conspiracy but then their websites dedicated to everything he got wrong and well he made people up like the general donald sutherland carry that guy doesn't even exist he just used him as a theatrical tool yeah very distorting film and pipit film is such a powerful medium yeah it's hard to overcome that well that movie in particular me you got Kevin Costner who's the good guy everybody's in yeah I mean that is a cat Lemmon and Walter Matthau too crazy movie yeah and it really has you believing that there's some sort of a connection to the lab back into the left people but here's the thing about that though well I've looked at that over and over again yes it is back into the left but the spray kind of comes out the front yeah it is yeah yeah it kind of comes out the front and one thing that does happen when people or things get shot is you have nerves and nerves react and things things do weird you know those weird results in your body when if you get hit by something it doesn't mean well I get first hands come up oh he's grabbing his neck apparently that was the other thing was there was a difference in the autopsy results from Bethesda Maryland versus in Dallas Texas Dallas Texas they attributed the throat wound to a frontal shot that something hit him in the front and then the Bethesda Maryland they said that it was a trach wound they they opened him up to clear his breathing pathway and then the conspiracy theorist would say why would you clear the breathing pathway of a guy who doesn't have a brain it's brain was shot out of his head there's a lot of I just don't like when people say they know one way or another yeah Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone huh fuck could you know there was a bunch of a boat there was also bullet fragments and Connolly's wrists that weren't missing from the the bullet itself the bullet itself whether you think it's pristine or not it's still it's not missing a lot of fragments and there's fragments in Connolly's body that they you could detect on x-ray there's x-rays and his wrists you could see the little pieces now I don't know what the explanation for exactly that's not that I don't know I'm not the world's expert on this stuff people want to clean it up that's what I don't like they want to clean it up or they want to muddy it up instead of like looking at it a hundred percent objectively they want one thing or another I think it's entirely possible that Lee Harvey Oswald it's either to me they want to say this is the these are the two narratives Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy he had nothing to do with the government set him up or he acted alone but why what couldn't he have been evolved in it you know he obviously was involved in some shady characters the guy spent a ton of time in Russia came back over here very easily even though the Cold War was going on there's a lot of weird stuff he might have very well been some sort of a government informant or working in cahoots with the government if that's the case and he did shoot Kennedy or shoot at Kennedy who's to say that he wasn't with other people and they killed him because this guy was gonna go to jail and he's gonna start talking when they arrested him he said I'm a patsy I'm just a patsy and then blam he's dead nope we got him and that's it wrap it up tight it wasn't until there's a pruder film that people really started a question and I think that was to invite about ten years later right we've talked about this you know the whole history there's a pruder film how it was released yeah well the Rivera show right not crazy right Dick Gregory comedian brought the film footage to the Geraldo Rivera show and showed it on television magazine bought the rights today Life magazine had the rights and didn't do anything with it they they kept it for more than a decade and Dick Gregory got a hold of the actual film footage and premiered it on the Geraldo Rivera show I want to say it was like 1971 or 72 or something like that so it was way way after the assassination that the American what was it 75 is 12 years oh that's crazy 75 so all those years later and then people got a chance to see the footage and they were like wow this is not how it was described to us at all and it made people skeptical there's a good Nova show on ballistics in the head and testing the rifle and could you shoot that many times and that many seconds and so on and it's pretty good to me it's pretty convincing the problem with me is I know too much about what happens when bullets hit bones I don't buy that that was the bullet I do look I think they could have just dropped that bullet off doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't do it the thing about that boat though is it like there might be some fucker involved and the David liftin book was that was the book that got me into conspiracies that fucking but goddammit if I could go back and not read it I bombed on stage because of that book you did yeah well it's my fault but I've read that book the day I was performing and I was freaking out because I was like 24 or something like that I was like oh this is crazy they killed the president you know I was so naive and I was like really bummed out when I went on stage and then I realized like oh you can't like I didn't know any better I've only been doing comedy for three years he can't call onstage bummed out you got to get your head together you can't just say that jokes and not have some emotional attachment to him but that book highlights what it was was lifting was a bookkeeper and or an accountant I believe and he was hired to do something with the Warren Commission report and in because he found some contradictions and he went over the entire Warren Commission report which is an enormous enormous publication and he found all of these problems all of these problems in the Warren Commission report and all these contradictions and it was his determination after reading everything and writing his book he thought that the conclusion they made they made before the fact and that they wrote all this stuff to sort of there to back up their conclusion that it wasn't based entirely on an objective version of the facts and of the event itself and his his take was there was a conspiracy mmm-hmm well it's launched a mini industry of books and films man think about all the money that's made off of the Kennedy assassination go down the rabbit hole with this stuff Jesse Ventura version of it he believes is the best I was on his conspiracy show well yeah he's out there oh yeah he believed it yeah he was like no one could have made that shot they definitely could have made that yeah it's a rifle it's not that far and just because someone gets lucky doesn't mean they can't get lucky like people get lucky all the time people flip a coin and it lands on heads a mile away I mean you know you could throw a coin you could you could throw a coin out of a helicopter you know you could say this is gonna be heads when it lands and it can be heads you can it really is possible well this assassination of Franz Ferdinand that triggered the first world war this yes okay they they messed up I mean they had like seven of them and they met in secret and they got their weapons that morning and so on it's a couple of them chickened out somebody else got lost this is like three of them there somebody threw a hand-grenade mist rolled into the car behind Franz Ferdinand and they got hurt and went to the hospital and he's like oh like this not giving my speech let's go to the hospital and visit and see how he's doing so they doubled back like half an hour later they double back and come back down the same route and the guy who admits he was just sitting there on the curb is like oh fuck here they are BAM yeah pure luck pure luck yeah yeah that does happen yeah yeah I mean I think that history turns more on that kind of thing than on carefully orchestrated perfectly executed plot sure it certainly can but you know the idea that I've always found a defense of the idea that there's no way Oswald could have hit him like that people say that like there's no way there's no way like you're out of your you never shot anything right that's crazy I could make that shot 100% yeah I look if you have a rifle with a scope and a guy is a hundred yards away you tell him you can't shoot him right that's crazy time that's crazy talk or the rifle was out of luck that was the other thing they said this the scope wasn't lined up correctly here's the thing folks if you have a rifle okay and this has happened to me before and you drop the rifle the scope gets damaged it gets moved it's it's a very sensitive thing like when you're talking about something that goes any faster than the speed of sound a bullet boom firing out of a rifle you have that that is going incredibly fast and to be able to get that reticle exactly on where you think that bullets gonna hit requires a lot of adjustments when you go to the range they set up a lead sled you put your rifle down on this sled so you're not holding the rifle and by the way your oz ball wasn't holding it either the idea was that he had it rested right which makes it much more steady and much more easier to make an accurate shot so you set up this rifle on the lead sled and it's usually a hundred yards or two hundred yards where however far the distances to the target you squeeze squeeze squeeze boom the trigger goes and you see that the bullet is low and to the left by a couple inches you make an adjustment on the scope if you drop that rifle that scope gets knocked the adjustments out the window already so the idea that there's like a perfect chain of command between Lee Harvey Oswald pulling that trigger and that scope never got rattled at all no but the conspiracy theorists want you to think there's no way who could have made that shot that scope wasn't even lined up good how the fuck do you know how do you know you don't know like anybody who knows anything about rifles knows there's no way you could know because if all you'd have to do is whack it here I'm gonna bring you the rifle and just bump it with your elbow funny knock it into a wall when you're handing it to someone and that scopes gonna be off right so then you take it to a range we're gonna prove definitively that he could have never made this shot cuz this scope is off boom look it's six inches to the left Wow case closed right no it's it's there's no way people know whether or not that scope was on when he was pulling that trigger there's no way you know when I went to Dealey Plaza it's so big in our public imagination it's not it's not you go there's like this is it it's tiny it's so small and then you go up to the museum and you're on the sixth floor deposit the Book Depository you look down they have an X the two x's in the street and you think that's just right there dude I can shoot that with an arrow I bet you could I can yeah I guarantee if you give me some time you give me some time you put a target right where that thing was Yeah right where that Lincoln was yeah and and you put me in that window I guarantee you I hit that target with a bow right with the idea that you couldn't I'm holding it not no rest right the idea that you couldn't do that with a with a rifle right you turned certainly could Lee Harvey Oswald certainly could have done it he certainly could have shot at Kennedy he was a crazy fuck Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in a lot of shady shit it wasn't like he was just some dentist somewhere we had and he scored the second running depositor he scored the second highest marksmanship there it is right here to here dude that's so small that's such a short distance then the other question I had when you come in up Houston Street and going left I always wondered why he didn't shoot him there when Kent the cars coming right at him what was the outer window he was in the window on the left-hand side he was over there no no no no it's uh it's over here yeah it's right there that's where you shot him from that window yeah yeah so I always wondered why you didn't shoot him when the car was coming right at him that would have been a cleaner shot it seems to me head-on you mean yeah yeah maybe want to shoot him in the back of the head does it have like a sniper hit maybe a panic it's that upper right yeah Wow yeah when we drove through it when a last time I was not last time I was in Dallas a couple times ago but when we drove through it it's like it's eerie Wow yeah it all happened right here I've been twice there and there's always conspiracy people walking around there looking for tips I gave this guy 10 bucks ago all right give me the whole story and it was very entertaining here's the grassy knoll the pickety fans yeah and another one about this mate he took the manhole cover off because there was somebody down here in the mantle Oh lobbed up BAM shot him went back down the middle favorite dumb conspiracy is they believe that the driver turn around shocked right that's the best right yeah those are the fates paces fake people you're always gonna get a bunch of really wacky conspiracies whenever anything happens in the news whatever it is you know anything and every particular ly if it's big and famous again back to this cognitive dissonance like princess die you know at cause of death drunk driving speeding no seatbelt you know tens of thousands of people died I was drunk he was drunk yep the driver of her car was true you know that well drunk he was partially drunk he was tipsy drunk I didn't know yeah that's right so drunk driving speeding and she wasn't wearing a seat belt why wasn't she wearing a seat belt so I mean that's yeah but but it doesn't feel like prints someone like Princess Di's should die the way tens of thousands of Americans died in automobiles every year it seems like there should be you know the mi5 and the royal family and the Arabs and the Palestinians uh everybody was involved well here's an example of an absolute conspiracy that we know is was a conspiracy Jamal Khashoggi yes right yeah a good example this kind of stuff does happen this is a real conspiracy yeah that guy was murdered he went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey they had him set up they flew in 15 people including a guy who was a he was a forensics expert and he was an expert in forensic forensics evidence and they think that he was there to make sure that there was nothing left behind they this is the the official story is they strangled him caught him up yeah and the there's even recordings apparent that goes all the way to listen to the top yeah yeah what is this Jamie that's the last video I've seen him throw the body double video and the Tim walking in and then this last time he was seen yeah he he entered into there and there was 15 different dudes that were waiting for him they killed him chopped him up and there's videos of the those guys leaving with suitcases and they say that the suitcases had his body in him yeah chopped up yeah it's it's real but that's also you know Saudi Arabia they can get away with some pretty sketchy shit and it seems like nothing's gonna happen right like people few people got fired well I have to say on this that was Michael Moore's film on 9/11 he made the point I was the first I'd seen make the point that the Saudi Arabia family got out of the United States on 9/12 when all flights were cancelled yes and that Bush let them you know and now here we see that you know Trump doesn't want to condemn the Saudis because they're our allies okay so there's a bunch of shit in there it goes all the way back to 9/11 you know and and we know the Saudis support a bankrolled most of the 19 hijackers yeah so that's the kind of conspiracy that we should be paying attention yes not that Bush was involved and made it happen in the secret you know this is the kind of shit that really happens in politics yeah you know people are are banking each other so we have to be nice to each other and you know overlook it you know like when Trump said you know Putin uh you know you know Putin murders people oh well everybody does it yeah what yeah well we do some terrible things too yeah yeah and the end that's true well it is true in in you know I guess he's got a point but the yeah it's it's just so much there's so much money there's so much money involved with Saudi Arabia and this article I was writing a sited criminologists Manuel Eisner in a study of 1500 monarchs in 45 monarchies across Europe between AD six hundred and eighteen hundred found that about 15% of them 227 were assassinated of course it's planning to homicide rate of about a thousand per hundred thousand ruler years ten times the background rate so in other words assassinations in history are pretty common this is how power often changes hands before liberal democracy spread and after 1970s this was not uncommon you know so we shouldn't be surprised that people believe this kind of stuff because you know there's some truth to that the Kishori thing is unsettling to folks because what he was killed for they think well there's there's two different versions of it right they're just kidding film he was killed for criticizing the Saudi Arabian government but he was also there's also that he was criticized because he was aware or he was killed rather because he was aware of some spy software that's being utilized and that if he wrote a story about this by software being utilized by the Saudi Arabian government that it would be a huge disaster hmm could be yeah yeah I mean there's probably more we I'm sure there's a lot we don't know so here's my my concession to conspiracy theories when you get elected president they take you in the back room they go okay here's what's actually going on right oh shit I can't close Gitmo I can't close Gitmo because no one will take those bad dudes okay but but I'm gonna pull the troops out of Afghanistan pull the troops out of Afghanistan if we do that here's what happens oh shit but we don't know this we know this and I think that something like that does go on maybe not quite so secretly but just that you know you and I don't need to know these things well I need to know basis and and the President does when they're candidates they say oh whatever they say to get elected and then they get in there and go okay I didn't realize that the Saudis are doing this and this and this and we need them for these six reasons over here okay they did this bad thing and if we condemn them then they're not going to do these things over here so I better lay off the condemnation that kind of stuff I suspect does happen oh yeah I think you're correct I think I suspect the same thing no but what's fascinating to me about Trump is that he doesn't seem to care at all about violating protocol or about releasing information that he probably should I mean he's already accidentally released top-secret information I would just feel like if he knew for sure some stuff like he would be the last guy you would want to trust with that right I know but you know this thing about him wanting to pull the troops out of Syria there's got to be another story behind there like you know Putin maybe said look we got to take care of our business here in Syria we're gonna take care of Americans over here and you get your Trump Tower and Red Square when when I'm gone whatever you know there's some kind that kind of stuff is the sort of thing that will come out in a equivalent of a WikiLeaks in 20 years we'll go oh like the Gulf of Tonkin oh okay that's what happens what do you think in conspiracy theory that says that Trump has there's some video of Trump getting peed on or that was published and like some serious newspapers yeah yeah there's so much of the stuff Atticus can't keep track of it I mean don't you think with him no to there like more than willing to put stuff like that out there because they don't like him so they'll pull that trigger a little bit quicker maybe yeah but you know during the Bush administration people hated george w bush you think they hate Trump no I think now they're going oh we would love to have george w bush back yeah i feel like they just thought he was incompetent directly putin does not deny possessing compromising material on trump yeah but but what did he actually say no no yes this is about the p tape says Matthew was a Iglesias box what is it from follow it's Vox that doesn't mean anything you probably didn't understand what they're saying speaks Russian right I don't know do you find it odd that the these conspiracies not only the it seems like it's a part of our our mind the way our brains work our collective mindset is that we tend to be attracted to conspiracies and we tend to hope that those are true more than we hope a simple explanation exists yeah it well it depends it depends on who your group is and do they have power or not so we know from studies that people that are out of power tend to concoct conspiracy theories about those in power yes the moment they get empowered they drop the conspiracy theories and the ones that are out so you're gonna get more conspiracy theories about Republicans when the Democrats are out of power from left-leaning people and vice versa you know it blacks are more likely to think that the CIA planted crack cocaine in the inner cities and and those sorts of things conservatives are more likely to fear big government conspiracies liberals are more likely to fear big corporate conspiracies there may be elements of truth and all of these things but the ones you're latch on to have to do with how much power you perceive the other guy has that you don't have and therefore they must be doing something to get that that I can't do I'm on the outside and so we tend to miss perceive how much control and power people really have in positions of power CEOs politicians and so on usually they don't have as much control and power as we think they do and people that get in there they go oh I can't I can't I don't have this kind of control or power I thought I would when I got here but obviously I don't it's too many things that have to check some balances that are in place so oh you can't do these things on your own you really need a group of people to conspire along with you so you mean to have these frank discussions with some sort of an understanding that you have to keep this a secret right more yeah in other words like twelve guys in London are going to control the world's economy how are they going to do that I mean who do you call the start a war and cause inflation or whatever more likely it's like in the Cuban Missile Crisis where you have jockeying back and forth back and forth back and forth okay look we're gonna give you the missiles in Turkey if you take the missiles out of Cuba and it just ends up being some boring little thing that dissolves the tension that could have been world war three it's like wow just this little thing yeah so much of history turns on those little so in a way we got lucky there but not just look I mean Kennedy and Khrushchev both wanted to untie the knot you know Khrushchev sent a memo to Kennedy saying you know you have pulled on this rope and I have pulled on this rope and I don't know if either of us can untie it but here's an idea that's when he floated that you take the missiles out of Turkey and and I was just watching this Netflix documentary on this and there was a thing about Castro santé memo to Khrushchev saying light them up you know comrade we are ready to die for the cause you can just nuke all of Cuba and nuke America I don't care we're ready to die and Khrushchev yeah a crucifix was like holy fuck this guy's a madman we're not gonna do that and so that Castro he's ready to nuke Cuba yeah Jesus where's that memo they they talked about this in this duct no is it yeah anyway this was during the times of Operation Northwoods when they were gonna blow up a drone jetliner and blame it on the Cubans they armed Cuban friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay and use it as a motivation to get us into war the Castro was a fascinating case because that guy kept that place 90 miles away from Miami he kept that place running on his own until he died it was crazy it really is crazy that he was able to pull that off well he had a lot of support economic support from Russia otherwise and they would not have succeeded but still it's so nuts that he was so close he was running a military dictatorship essentially a boat ride away yeah I was just in Moscow a few months ago for a conference since I went to visit their World War two museum what we would call the world to museum its massive building they and they call it the Great Patriotic War Museum uh and the whole thing is kind of a tribute to Russia liberated Europe from the Nazis watts yep this is current oh yeah yeah I mean this is their from their perspective they lost 27 million people you Americans you know 500,000 nothing right and from their perspective you've go to Berlin right next to the victory Museum look at that yeah it's called the victory music well there it is the museum of the great patriotic war is a History Museum located in Moscow yeah and they have this room with these chains hanging down with little crystal balls at the end of them that represent the 27 million people and it's it's it's very moving go back to that that right there it's good look how beautiful no place yes it's quite stunning and each of those rooms that you go into it's like a diorama of some battle that they fought Wow you know so yeah we I think you know it's good for us to know this to recognize from their perspective they they they won the war not the British marentina French we did a little bit from their perspective but the fact that they lost so many people 27 million what's going on with that picture yeah I don't stop looking at members represent that's a weird picture I I mean they have a point in terms of their contribution in terms of the loss of lives yeah that's I mean every country has its perspectives in that regard which is why it's good to know some history so you know what other people are thinking and what they went through well it's again though it's what very similar to what we were talking about earlier in terms of the distribution of the news it would be very nice if there was one yeah absolute news source you can trust with no slant on it whatsoever when it comes to the distribution of history it's of course always written in a way that favors the people that are writing it yeah I was just talking to Rachel Kleinfeld you know I have a podcast now this a few months about six months now science salon podcast yeah well it's it's sort of an extension of our old couch lecture series but instead of lectures we're now doing dialogue without also people can cite science salon science salon yep so just kept it calm it's okay so I'm interviewing a dialoguing with Rachel Kleinfeld she has a new book called a savage order and it's about failed States and what happens to them and why corruption spreads so quickly and then how to basically squelch that so like after the Soviet Union fell apart you know all these mobs basically took over and it's like the Russian mafia Republic of Georgia fell apart fairly quickly and then you know so one of the reasons people apparently like Putin is he kind of came in and squelched all that and and maybe one of his points of popularity is that at least we have one bad guy who's kind of keeping order instead of all these little mafioso type gangs and and I said so if he actually held an election he might win it's like hard to say because we don't have a good source of what the Russian people really like right we have the Russian media saying the Russian people love Putin okay yeah right did we know that's an accurate survey it is pretty astonishing what kind of a control he has over that country that oh yeah it's it's powerful I went to visit I saw Lenin's tomb and the mausoleum there he's still still he's looking pretty waxy to me oh that's right you can actually see his body well what's left see his body yeah yeah what's left of it yet another Netflix series I just binge watched Trotsky it's called Trotsky and this is a Russian made film it's a drama and it's really good and it really shows it's interesting because he Trotsky was on the outs all the way until this recently you know because Stalin had him assassinated and then Stalin had him literally airbrushed out of photographs because for a while it was Lana and Stalin and and and Trotsky is the big three and then when Lenin had a stroke it was like okay so Stalin and Trotsky who's going to take over when the boss is gone and so they kind of showed how that happened and again conspiracy it's all conspiracy no one knows what you know really going on here you've been in this business this debunking can spits conspiracies and the skeptic business for quite a long time you feel like there is any improvement in the critical thinking skills of people and their ability to recognize the policies and the the flaws and the way they're approaching these things hard to say confirmation bias they're less of that now than before I like to think we're having an influence there is some studies that show you know fewer people believe in these pseudo Sciences and quackery and paranormal but it's not the declines are not that dramatic over say the last few decades there are deprogramming bias deprogramming studies and programs in which you can teach people about the confirmation bias in the nine side bodies and so on the problem with those is they work really well to teach people how to spot the biases and other people they're really good at that but then you say well what about you oh you know fortunately I'm above all that so there's a Blinds that's called the blind spot bias you can't see your own bias but you can see it in other people so the reason these studies are done is because like we have a problem with climate change we have climate deniers how do we get people who don't know anything about it to shift from I'm a skeptic too I'm a believer and it show it turns out just piling on facts isn't gonna do it no people's identity are trapped in their initial their initial statements if they think that 9/11 was a conspiracy their their identity is somehow inexorably connected to this conspiracy being a fact yeah and then you argue it as if you're arguing your own value it's it's a really weird thing that happens when people start talking about ideas if the you you you've very rarely find people that are disconnected from their ideas to the point where you could point out that something's incorrect and they go up thank you I didn't know that like most people aren't that confident no or aren't they just look it at the wrong it feels like a personal attack on them also as if it's a belief or claim or theory or whatever affiliated with a political or moral or religious value the people autocorrect in their brains when they hear global warming they hear liberalism ISM and capitalism control of the market big government and I'm against those things so that global warming thing's gotta be faults yeah that is one of the weirder aspects of tribal thinking right the pink pink makes the point that Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth was a terrible thing for the environmental movement because it associated global climate change with liberalism the Democrats and all that it's like okay I see what's going on it's that Al Gore left liberal stuff yeah that's right yeah well in in a sense he's right and then in another sense it was also the amount of profit that Al Gore made both from that and from some other endeavors that he has like they said that he's one of the first green billionaires right so God Jesus what's his carbon footprint around a private jet everywhere he's talking about the world yeah it's like it's screwy yeah it's but that's you know there's everything's messy people are messy right so we're very tribal we commit to political parties or religious beliefs and we stick by them pretty closely pretty tightly you know and the facts get filtered through those understandably you know what to do about it you know that's that's under debate it's the same thing with the atheist debating how do we get people to leave religion well there's a hundred ways you know Leah Remini doing her show on Scientology anyone watching that would think okay I'm not joining this church and and so if you had a thousand of those four bad beliefs hopefully we see that shift I would love it if there was some sort of a secular option a community-driven ethics driven morality driven friendship driven thing where people could go and instead worship maybe just appreciate life and sort of confirmed some of the best aspects of community and culture and who we are and do it in a place where it makes you really conscious of it so because I think there's there's some some real benefit to people going to church and everyone in the community dresses up nice and you sort of agreeing hey we're committed to being civil into being kind into worshiping and that this belief in a higher power or if it it empowers people to think this way and it gives people a motivation to be kind and it would be nice if there was a secular option like that that is decentralized it's not run by one person winds up banging everybody's wife and taking all the money because that's what happens there always happens you can set your clock like these guys it's unbelievable well Joe the humanist movement is something like that what is this I'm not aware the secular humanists are just humanists there's groups all over the world have churches well they have meeting places kind of Kelton churches more broadly the kind of Universalist Unitarian Church is a church and it's a religion but they're pretty secular they're like secular Jews you know they believe in the culture and the and the ceremony and the rituals I've been to a number of these humanist and Universalist Unitarian churches ceremonies they like candles they sing hymns to Newton they have testimonials about how I lost my religion and to me I didn't really like it that much because I was never crazy about Church in the first place but a lot of people clearly get value out of this idiots and humanists that don't believe in God the gathering together once a week and being with fellow like-minded people that has a lot of psychological value it connects people that's one of the great things about community centers in neighborhoods you know it just connects people and like hey we're all in this together alright Bob see you tomorrow bye Mary you know the social capital there's something there's something great about that was Church that mean I was having this conversation with Bill burr about this recently we were talking about it and he's like I don't I don't really want to go to church but I think there's some there's something to that to go into a place and and putting your faith in you know all the people around you and the the the higher values and morals and ethics that you're all agreeing that's right yep you know it's back to the self-help thing it's sort of a reminder every week be a good person don't forget to donate to charity here's some local charities here yeah these are our causes be a good you know be good be nice to your spouse and your children is on and so people kind of leave a little charged up for the week on Sunday back to Monday and that's probably a draw big Tony Robbins things too all right there's a community of us together we're all trying to do better we're all trying to better ourselves and optimize our lives that's right there's nothing wrong with the same thing back to Jordan Peterson that's the threat he's given a message people like to hear that yeah and okay so what what why is that bad that's not bad yeah now of course people like Richard Dawkins will point out yeah but but can we decouple all the supernatural nonsense yeah from the social community yes we can't okay but don't you think that there's less there's less of an acceptance to the supernatural nonsense than there was yeah app and it seems to be a trend those numbers are getting better secularism yeah the number of the percentage of nuns people took the box for no religious affiliation that used to be in the single digits it's now 25% of all Americans 33% of Millennials those born after 1991 and it looks like probably with i Jenner's can be closer to 50% people born after 1995 now they're not necessarily atheist agnostic skeptics but they don't affiliate with any religion and that's good because in the sense that you know it's it's religious behavior that causes some of these social problems that we encounter II now with Islam for example you know so if somebody privately believes in God or whatever and they don't act on it okay I guess I don't care in that sense it's the acting on your beliefs that causes the problem well when you enforce those beliefs on other people and that's right so when it spills over to politics education science education particularly well that's one of the real problems they're having in Europe when they're dealing with people that are coming over from other countries where they have a different set of values and they're seeing women in skirts and they're calling them whores and England right right different set of rules over here you know in California you won't believe it and they think that God has you know God has dictated these rules in their eyes they're seeing some horrible sin they're seeing the the decay of the moral fiber the moral fiber of their environment these are primitive beliefs having to do with men wanting to control women's reproductive rights there's evolutionary reasons for this yet Brett and Heather on here and they guess playing that beautifully but we have to overcome that because it's an evolved tendency for men to want to control women's reproduction it doesn't mean we should do that it's the opposite yeah and so I make the case in one of my scientific American columns that on abortion that you know if you if our mutual goal between pro-lifers and pro-choicers is to reduce the amount of abortions we we know the formula educate women empower women birth control birth control access to birth control and so on it just happens out automatically the pregnancy rates go down there for abortion rates are gonna go down we know how this to do this but still people the pro-lifers you know just glom on but it's a moral issue okay take the moral out of it I understand it's a human life or potential human or whatever you want to argue I get on that take that out let's just work to the common goal of reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies my favorite one that still exists is abstinence the idea that they're trying to push this on these essentially when you especially be talking about really young people that are just getting horny for the first time yeah I mean they're on drugs they're on a horse they know what yeah why are you talking about you take the average 17 18 year-old kids and you try to they get them together and no one's in the room and they're raging yeah raging with hormones and they're both supposed to keep their clothes on like look man it's not going to happen it's not going to happen you got to let that go and this idea that you're gonna tell them that God wants them to be abstinent like are you sure why did he give us these goddamn hormones what's happening here there's Studies on how effective abstinence only programs or chastity pledges and these sorts of things how effective not only are they not effective they're worse because then people go into like a date or something unprepared and then the hormones kick in you know and they start going at it and then they don't have protection well there's also the thing where Catholic schools like when I was a kid we always knew and like this is we're talking about in the 80s everyone knew that girls who went to all-girls Catholic schools were freaks because they were never around boys for because they were all in just a school with girls what they and their ever suppression suppression suppress suppress they just can't wait they get out there like they find a boy and they go crazy like everybody knew it I mean this is not something that I knew as a comedian or as a person who studies culture there's something I knew is a 14 year old right everyone knew that girls who went to all school all-girl Catholic schools were freaks right it's just as the opposite intended effect there was a study a British study I found that found some small print it was like one and a half percent or whatever of ten thousand women who said they got pregnant without having sex oh that's right that's hilarious yeah or they do everything but or they have anal or whatever and say well we didn't actually have sex right like Clinton you know well what do you mean by sex and right have and sexual relations yeah I did not have sexual relations to that woman visual land yeah sex is intercourse penis vagina that's it yeah everything else is just hanging out right yep well it's the the need for belief systems is it's so I mean it helps people to have belief systems if they're positive and they're objective and they're well reasoned and they're you know these are you know backed by facts and knowledge it helps but the need for belief systems is so strong that we'll take a belief system that's wonky it's because we have a desire yep you have the brain abhors a vacuum of belief it's the way I put it in and something's going to be in there so let's try to put in those brains rational science-based values and we have those I mean humanist values that you know the humanist movement is now about a cent almost a century old you know universal human rights the the universal human rights declaration just celebrated its fiftieth anniversary you can get diverse people to agree you don't have to have the correct philosophical arguments to get there but you know just everybody should be treated equally under the law can we at least agree on that yes okay I mean if you start off with Pinker makes this point now if you start off with Jesus died for our sins that's the most important value value to me you're not gonna get agreement a room full of you know you end diversity you got to start with something super basic in general everybody's is deserves equal rights okay yeah and then you start to build from there and we could do that do you find you've been in this for a long time and you've done some really valuable work it's been it's it's so nice that there's someone like you that really has dedicated their life to really illuminating truth exposing all the flaws and people's thinking do you feel like the reception of this is you you're it's easier now or it's there's momentum behind this kind of thinking I do yeah for sure it's it's more open part of my I have a distorted view I'm from California a group of Southern California we're pretty liberal society here so I'm empathetic to people to write me from Oklahoma Arkansas and I'm in this little town everybody the only question is which Christian church do you go to you know the Baptist or the Presbyterians and you know everyone in his family everyone at work is a believer and he's an atheist okay so I haven't faced anything like that you know and I'm a middle-aged white guy you know I don't I do have white privileges I know and so I am sympathetic to others but I do think across the board things are more tolerant you know we know this from Studies on interracial marriage for example that's not even an issue anymore the gay rights thing has changed very rapidly I mean that was stunning how quickly social attitudes changed after the well we have to remember in 2013 Hillary Clinton was still saying that she didn't believe in gay marriage because that was a political position that's right now Obama in 2011 although you never know when a politician says something of course but now so I predict you know like the gay marriage thing this no one will be talking about in another year or two yeah change so quickly and so across the board the acceptance that now of atheists humanists secular agnostics whatever has become much much better in most places there's still certain course of Islamic countries where not only would they burn me and you they burned Catholics because they picked the wrong religion so there's still that but wonder if there's some improvement there in those countries because the internet with younger people when they're being exposed to these new ideas yeah maybe I'm not sure on that data last time I saw a big poll was on how supportive you would be of Sharia law and these were pretty scary like a third to a half of Muslims living in Muslim countries said they would support Sharia law and if you look at Sharia law as you know it's it's pretty scary very anti-democratic illiberal attitudes about rights and women and things like that so there I think the prediction would be yes Millennials and I Jenners when they get into power then maybe they not just political power but like controlling talk shows radio shows TV show scripts things like that most I think most moral change happens in people's minds from inculcating it from culture pop culture of just how you talk about other people like if you Dawkins makes this point that you can tell pretty much down to the decade when a book was written by the way they talk about when like a novel talk about women or blacks or whatever going back say a century you could say well that was 1930s the way they're talking about Jews you know and that's the kind of thing that shifts very slowly you hardly notice it but from people like you comedians you tell certain jokes or you say certain things and it becomes more acceptable scripts for television shows and films and all of us kind of watch it and absorb it and just think yeah you know you we shouldn't be saying those kinds of things about women and Jews and blacks or whatever you stop doing that not consciously you just kind of soak it in so I think you still need laws we have to sometimes change the law and just say okay it's now illegal to discriminate against Jews or whatever you can't do that now people may still want to do that how do we change their thinking well if that's the bottom of thing that takes course of decades or maybe a century and it takes generations sometimes because the new young kids have to see the flaws and the way their parents are thinking and and and have access to this information and form their own opinions on these things hopefully baek's based on objective reasoning and reality and and all the awesome stuff that's available now my stepdad was in the Pacific War and the way he talked about Japanese you know when I was a kid in the sixties like oh and by the time I became an adult I'm like dad you don't don't say the stuff don't say it out loud we think about 1947 to 1960 that's a tiny period of time it's so short yeah I mean that's really like you know we're talking about the early 2000s right the magic world war two happened during the early 2000 right yeah yeah so it's hard to remember it's it's hard to put it into perspective I think pop culture the media social media and so on is is going to accelerate moral progress it'll happen faster like it happened faster for women than it did for blacks it happened faster for gays and it did for women you know maybe whatever's next animal rights or you know something like this will accelerate even more maybe trans rights or somebody think about the pushback against this idea that we are living in the safest time ever and that there is an absolute trend like Pinker gets criticized about this where people say no the world is still not safe for these people for this for this group for that group and for you saying that the world it just shows your white privilege and that you this white male perspective and I'm on board with Steve across the board on these things he's got the data it depends on the question you're asking you know it's like if you say yeah but my life is not better okay we're not talking about your life the question is is society getting better okay of course there's ups and downs in this group is doing better than that group and yes there's still some racial discrimination and yes there's still clearly anti-semites as we've seen recently but across the board if you take like the last 200 years which direction of the trend lines going they're all going in the right direction so again it's scale the question is what's the scale we're talking about so it's it's a little unfair to Pinker to say well you're blind to that thing over he's not talking about that one thing there he's talking about just across the board yeah I agree listen man thanks for everything thanks for everything you do you want to know your articles and books and thanks for coming on here and please let people know your podcast once again is called skeptics along yeah science signs along sorry science along you just go to skeptic comm and it's posted there and yeah so skeptic is still and social media at Michael Shermer is my twitter feed you have Instagram as well I don't I don't do that how dare you that's Michael Shermer one Oh do you have an idea I do I'm gonna start posting as of today okay oh yeah take a photo I always click on yours because you always have interesting photographs from wherever you're at
