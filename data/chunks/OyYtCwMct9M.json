hello freak bitches did you hear about all those people dying from heroin overdoses because there was a bad batch of heroin in like Ohio or something and like 41 people I've overdosed and like the same heroin err I did hear about that I did hear about that No did you hear about that wouldn't how do you say that stuff chrome how do you say cretonne KR ato em how do you say it say your chrome Odom kratom crowd um maybe crowd them I don't know how to say it I've never said it but I've read about her a lot and it's a plant that helps people overcome opiate addiction apparently and the FDA just moved it to schedule one or they're going to move it to schedule one or the DEA I should say I guess it's the DEA right but it's a plant and apparently helps a lot of people that have heroin addiction problems and opiate addiction problems and even some people said it helps with marrow not marijuana but alcohol withdrawals when people are alcoholics they try to break free and get sober this stuff can help with that too I don't know enough about it you know I'm gonna I'm gonna have someone on to talk about it but it's just there's no need to make anything else illegal like this this thing where they're doing like what they're doing is they're behaving like an archaic society they're not behaving like America 2016 they're behaving like the people who enacted the very first sweeping psychedelic laws of 1970 they're behaving like they behaved if you've got this plant this kratom or how have you say it and it doesn't have any history of people like dropping dead from it it's not like some threat to the communities it's not like this terror that's sweeping the streets and it's ruining lives you know hearing that all I'm hearing is it helps people with heroin addiction we all know how many people are addicted to heroin so the fact that they just want to step in and immediately not just make this like a schedule 2 or a schedule 3 or have some scientists come in and testify about it and have some sort of public hearings where they discuss the merits of keeping this drug legal and should this be regulated should it be described by doctors like reasonable adults would do if they actually gave a fuck about each other but instead they have these fucking ridiculous amounts of power where they could just step in and just make things illegal they have a ridiculous amount of power when it comes to legislating what we can and can't do with our bodies this is not something anybody's voting on this kratom stuff right so for the DEA to just step in and make that Schedule one its blasphemy like what they're doing is a Matt it's a it's such an abuse of the function of the office the idea of the office is you're supposed to be protecting people protect people from meth protect people from bad shit don't don't let people come home to find their children that have overdosed because someone gave them bath salts right that's that's what everybody wants from something like the DEA but they're so far reaching with their efforts that they step into all these areas where we know you're full of shit now you step in these areas like marijuana are you gonna save people from pot congratulations you fuckin cock blocker what are you gonna do you gonna say people from giggling or eating yummy food or having a good time with their friends what do you guys what do you stop in these are this is not anything that we should ever not not anything we should ever ask for from armed leaders and quotes and definitely not anything we should ever tolerate for no reason whatsoever there's no reason whatsoever why they would keep marijuana illegal there's no reason whatsoever the weather would make this kratom stuff Schedule one there's no fucking reason it's money it is it's a sure sign that's a corrupt system and if it if the kratom stuff helps with alcohol withdrawals then you got to know that these big you know companies would why wouldn't they pitch them some money to be like hey let's you know what I'm drinkin even if they didn't do it blatantly even if they didn't do it blatantly if they're entangled with each other you can best believe that if you are entangled with some sort of an alcohol company you're gonna do your best to maximize the profits of that alcohol company all right it's just the way it is if you're entangled with some donor to some political campaign or some some you know like foundation that you run and they give millions like you guys having a little agreement going on there you don't have to even say it you don't have to have it written down you don't have to be stupid about it but it's pretty obvious if someone gives you millions of bucks they're you know you guys are how you guys are doing business something's happening here you know you're gonna do nice things for each other now and that's that's where a lot of this shit comes from like the the fact that we the people the people that are supposed to be represented by these clowns can sit back and just be frustrated and not do anything we could vote for it when it comes up in our state's but federally it's a giant issue federally federally is the real problem because there's a bunch of states now that made it legal including Washington fucking DC it's a bunch of states that have made pot legal they're like look it's ridiculous doesn't the science doesn't fit P and then they start taxing it and then they make unbelievable amounts of money and then they have massive resurgence is in their economy like you're seeing in Colorado and now you're seeing in Seattle and Washington State as well what they're doing is they're they're being tyrannical like these these aren't this is not like reasonable people acting in a reasonable way now that they're locking people up from a long time oh my god there was this fucking thing the other day where they were comparing that kid who raped the girl and what university was that who's got a ridiculously short amount of time what's that you don't have a mic on Stanford Stanford is that what it is that guy so they compared that guy to some poor bastard that oh my god I think he got 30 years for growing pot yeah did you see that picture mm-hmm did you see it dude it was even longer than 30 years man it might have been it may have been like 30 to life or something but it's just the idea that you would lock that guy away for that long for something so fucking innocuous won't break the wall well it'll break the law it's real simple we got a law and you don't want to break it okay you take your consequences we're adults here we're all adults these laws are stupid we're being handicapped by these ancient systems these ancient systems of control they're not they're not valid anymore you can't just lock me out for pot it's stupid here it is Lee Carol Brooker a 75 year old veteran serving a life sentence in prison without parole for being caught growing three dozen marijuana plants behind my son's house Wow oh my god and it says hi I'm Brock Turner 20 year old who raped a woman on campus I just got six months in prison I'm also promised that with good behavior that would be cut down to three months Jesus Christ Wow he's already out there's like armed protesters outside of his house oh my god oh my god rape before joints guys yeah that's just crazy if you're gonna rape a girl don't do it on a pile of marijuana plants plus three months [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
