three-two-one well you tell a lot about a man whether or not he's one of those dudes that has one of wallet phone cases Rashad Evans you're a wallet phone case guy you pack it all into one package you know what I wasn't always a wallet phone case guy that's kind of something that just you know I kind of evolved into I was one that was carrying around the man purse man personal well and and after a while I kind of transitioned to just the though the wallet case that's a lot of work they look how thick that sucker is it's like a Costanza I know in there thing giant every single time I clean it out I tell myself I'm not gonna put any more cards in there except for the ones I need but it just attracts the card yeah that's a problem I have one of those Ridge wallets you know what those are yeah those are the shit because you can't really get much in there I get like a credit card or two in my license see that's what I need I need to have that yeah there's nothing else to carry but what I have to and it's got a little money clip on it so I'll shove a couple bills in there and that's it that's it I go out like that that's what I need that's what you need front pocket huh all this nonsense that's so thick it's thick you might as well go back to the man purse but you know what I might as well get a backpack any one of these I just sent two too steep a Miocic those look alright though but it dope right yeah my own company makes well do don't make them we buy them from brutes and we put our stamp on it Yeah right you might want to go on for you yeah yeah you're a bold man you can wear fanny pack ya know I was rocking I was rocking the man purse before anybody else is wearing it now out in America out of Europe they were doing a long time ago but America was like one of the Oz a trailblazer I like to say Liesl among my friends it's a weird thing right like guys are not supposed to wear bags but women have flight right fucking all these different brands of bags they carry around Fendi and Gucci in this man makes you look like you're special because you got some fancy bag and carrying a bag actually helped me be more prepared than ever because I mean I would always be can't one of those dudes can't carry enough stuff and I always would come things wishing I had things that I didn't have and I'm you know what the bag work but why is it that we're afraid to carry a bag like a guy can carry a backpack backpacks fine I guess you got a got shit to do you got a backpack you fucking serious all right it's got two straps here but one strap like man what's wrong with you I think it's because you had to to do that the the feminine hold at times with the ones the one strap yeah and I can but dudes do all that shoulder so you don't have to do that then you're like it's a sickness man then it's manly then it's very strange right how a bag became manly or not manly based on the amount of straps to sit in line yeah and then for women it's like it's like a status symbol nobody gives a fuck what kind of backpack you have right feet if a dude has a nice backpack no one's like bro yeah I mean you got a nice fannypack fannypack sort of not really it doesn't get the respect it deserves it sticks out the people like okay he's got enough balls to carry fanny pack yes there's a little bit of that a little bit of that you know a little bit I don't give a fuck I seen a fanny pack carried where it's across the shoulder that looks concrete but weak people like with their cowards cowards their fashion cowards they don't want anybody calling them out I'm wearing a fanny pack so another new new shoulder bag it's not a shoulder back there it's a fat man's fanny pack shoulders that's what it is that we're in a way you're not supposed to wear it it's like if you wore a backpack around your waist like people would be like what the fuck are you doing it's not a backpack when it's around its wrapped around your waist what do you what I mean you'd think that Karen here you have everything you want like right here yeah I guess I'm just trying to I guess John's just where it's like say it how I think I would wear that one one you got you kind of convincing me Joe that maybe the front the front carry might be there it's the way to go the only issue is girls won't fuck you some girls some girls like you wear a fanny pack you up that's it see I'm married anyway so I'm good perfect yeah I'm good every married man like myself that managed to have a fucking fanny packs deterrent put sometimes it's a little bit of that but it's also fuck you right there keep my shit right there hilarious yeah keep it together keep it together and then you also have this crazy green drink that you were telling me about yeah yeah yeah so this right here is uh spirulina ever since I changed my diet up I need to have a couple of these every single day and it makes me feel good you know yeah I don't I don't eat meat anymore so I know you're a big meat-eater yeah do you fish or any of that no nothing more vegan all vegan when did you become vegan ah probably about man I want to say probably almost two years now really yeah over almost two years now it's like it I love it really has changed my life man it's been it's been one of the things I can honestly say that's just revolutionized my my complete everything it's it's it's it's been everything that lately that has you know changed me from a mental standpoint physical standpoint and even a spiritual standpoint I definitely think it changes the mind because this all meat diet that I've been on that changes your mind the other way it makes you more expressive yeah too much so yeah I have to work out extra to keep the keep the demons at bay blood it is it's that it's also like if you think about it if you if your body thinks okay I have to eat animals all the time because all this motherfucker eats his animals right if your body thinks that your body is going to sort of take on the characteristics of something that's a predator mmm right you would become more I mean this is obviously like some bullshit bro psychology some moron but I would say your body is gonna think I'm more aggressive oh I have to chase shit down and kill it yeah that's that's you have to be more predatory but your body has to think that way I can get with that it may it makes sense though it makes sense did you do it right after you retired you know I kind of not right after I retired it was kind of something that uh that kind of just happened like I ever since I like cuz I do mushrooms right oh yeah yeah so it was it was when I did a like when I had a really really deep trip that just caused me to have one of those ego deaths and when I had the ego death I was like in a state where this knowingness was coming to me and it was like you know I was like it was all days I did a mushroom ceremony mmm and it was all day and I was just out in the Sun and just you know in my own mind and then I'll smelling real bad and then I smelled myself yeah you know you catch a smell yourself who knows like oh my god I stink and then the annoyingness said like you stink because you eat dead rotting flesh and they said if you want to eat if you want life then you eat life that's what this knowing that said to me and then I think that's a strange thought to just come into my mind like hmm and then after that no kiddin like I just lost my taste for meat it just and I used to eat all kinds of meat I eat I would eat pork and I was you know big into pork and big into like all kinds of meat and I was never one of those diet guys at all but after that happened to me other had experience it was just like one of those things that that I just couldn't help but go into like I just lost it taste for me one trip yeah I mean well it was well it was it kind of started when I'm like about eight months before that I did the toad mmm and then a toad was one that that really was the catalyst for everything there's a lot of people listen you know what the fuck is he saying you did the toad yeah yeah so five Meo DMT which is the toad and the toad was one that was I guess the catalyst of busting that gate open and that's a crazy psychedelic that's a very underrated psychedelic oh my god it that that will yeah that's the first really but I had done mushrooms before but I did a fairly small dose I mean fairly small on that I could walk around I was pretty whacked out but I could walk around with a couple grams but the five Meo DMT was the first one where I just ceased to exist I just stopped and it made me really aware of ego really aware of like even the way I suppress myself the way I would frame sentences and say things I was just I was trying to sound cool yeah I was trying to portray something in a way like not just trying to portray the information but trying to impress people and it made me like feel real gross yeah well that's the thing like when I had my father you know experience it was a man I just never I never thought that consciousness could be so vast and so big you know when I when you have that experience with the five MBO it just like it made this consciousness make look as if like it was a drop in a bucket you know just like a little drop and I got to experience the ocean of consciousness and that right there was it was the most humbling experience I ever had you know just to feel my ego who I thought I was what I thought I was completely just annihilated and to feel what I actually was you know it was it was crazy yeah I feel like regular consciousness that most of us exist in most of the time is a veneer it's a very thin veneer and through some things you get a taste of what's under the surface through meditation and yoga and all these different methods that people use holotropic breathing you get a taste of what's underneath the surface Kundalini Yoga apparently couldn't lead a younger paranoid never really done it but some people say you could really trip out if you do it in a certain way for long periods of time people have like very intense psychedelic experiences akin to DMT yeah I had like a um like a Kundalini and kind of experience like an O awakening where it was like a I just had felt like the top of my head just completely was gone and it was it was like I was just open to all like the information it was it was a crazy it was like I had no no no no head like it was just I was just information was just pouring in to know no roof was this from Kundalini no it was uh it was from mushrooms but it was similar but I felt but I felt that that that Kundalini experience where you see the light it was like this really intense light that that happens and in my head and it was just boom you see you see the universe you know well you know that that thing about the center of your head that's what the there's there's a lot of speculation what the Egyptians were trying to draw when they were drawing certain images but there's certain temples that seem to mimic certain certain shapes and these temples that seem to mimic the pineal gland like even the eye that there's that famous Egyptian eye that has that sort of dip down yeah in that weird sort of Egyptian shape there's been a bunch of different scholars that have tried to figure out what exactly that man and one one of the theories is that that's a cross-section of the pineal gland and they think that what they were emphasizing was that that is the area where the brain produces all the psychedelic chemicals and they they speculated this for a long time but dr. Rick Strassman he's the guy that wrote that book DMT the spirit molecule and there was actually a documentary on it that I hosted and he he's done a bunch of work with this Cottonwood Research Foundation where they've shown now that it exists in live rats and that it that it is actually produced by that gland that DMT is actually produced in these animals by this one particular gland that they a sous associated with spiritual awakening a third eye so it actually is a real thing that feeling that you get and the thing about mushrooms it's really interesting it's mushrooms actually mimic natural human neural chemistry there's five Meo DMT there's N and DMT and then what mushrooms the it's processed to the weight the way it your body process it becomes something called forfox floral oxy and n dimethyltryptamine so it's really it's a real close so I might have butchered that technical description but that's it so it's real close to human neural chemistry so your body absorbs it very easily your body takes it in knows what it is your body knows that doing it see when I was on I like mushrooms because of mushroom so the five amigo was so powerful that you you can't really get a handle on what happened like I came back from being away for like 17 minutes I'm just like whoa that was intense you know I felt as if like I was everything all at the same time and it was you know so many different things that was just happening but you really can't unpack it because it's it's it's incomprehensible to an extent for the larger extent because you're you're dealing with you know concepts that the human mind can't even grasp because there's no vocabulary to to speak about it you know when I did the mushrooms and mushrooms were kind of like the rivers and the lakes that leads to the ocean and it helps me understand how I am part of something so big and something so grand so when I when I did my much when I have a mushroom experiences they were all different in some in some respect you know like um like whenever I do go deep because I like to go deep I don't I don't I don't play around with a curtain yeah Mike I mean I do micros and sometimes but I like to get in there with like five grams made you know mmm ten you know what's up yeah those big ones the big doses where you you get kind of scared what she ate it you know you got like 40 minutes for your like whole boy turning back now you in that that's the thing about it when you face that yeah fear mm-hmm I've just going deep in and has helped me out so much because you know towards the end of my career like I just didn't I didn't finish the way I wanted to you know and I felt like you know after I came back from my injuries I just wasn't the same for our fighter anymore I just were you not the same physically or was it mentally it was physical but it also it became mental because it was because physically I just didn't feel the same you know I didn't feel like I ever regained the power back in my legs and for the most part my legs were everything you know the injuries I had to ACL surgeries on my mama right and that completely just uh it changed everything for me because you know being a smaller light heavyweight all of my power was all in my legs you know and whatever couldn't make up for in the size department up top I was usually able to make up for with the power of my legs you know is that related to the injury that you got when you were at Jacksons and Diego Sanchez crashed into you know that was so that was a different injury so that was a MCL but it wasn't my left knee so the right knee was got I always drove me crazy because I'm like why the fuck is a guy training for a world title fight or in a regular class where everybody knows people collide into people at regular classes all the time with millions of dollars on the line I know I see that all the time though in top gyms and but that see that's enough that's that's where that the training has gone like like before we would train like maniacs we would try and crazy as hell and put ourselves in some crazy situations and you and you try to put yourself in a situation because you like you know I did it before and I've done it so many times and nothing has happened but when you start to move up and there's more on the line then you always have to take every single precaution because you can't afford to take a step back right and for me once I have my knee injuries though I just mentally was not the same person and when I competed I wasn't the same person and then it affected me because then I'm like you know I'm not the same person did you lose the ability to explode with your knees did you have meniscus damage as well um I had meniscus damage I lost the ability to explode and I lost it would get tired my leg I get tired you know and it didn't have the same bounce the same rhythm and he kinda felt kind of felt heavy and I couldn't really feel it in the front you know the front part of my knee I couldn't really feel it I had a little did you have a patellar tendon graft I had a patellar tendon so they cut the front open and then they take the piece of the bone they take a slice of the patellar tendon a piece of the bone on the bottom and they replace your ACL with that correct yeah I did that too it takes a long time to get that feeling back yeah it took me more than a year before it felt right and then even then if I was on my knees it would hurt like hell see that's the thing like I still to this day I still have dead spots where I can't feel in my knee well it's numb you know and I think it had to do it a lot because I had two of the knee surgeries back to back like when I was only healing up for my first one then it ruptured again so then I would go back in and get it done you know the first time it was with the cadaver mm-hmm and then the cadaver tissue didn't take but it I know that too like almost a year later and then it slept out just training normally fuck yeah so AC ELLs are brutal oh my gosh it was this is the worst man it's the worst and I admire guys who can come back and look phenomenal and in and do it you know still because when you mess up your knee you know for me it just kind of mentally just it messed me up a bit how much physical rehab did you have to do for that man I did a lot I did years worth of it just you know the first time I I didn't do it as well as I could have because I'm like ah you know I bounced by pretty easy and I did like I felt like I was bouncing back pretty easy but when it went the second time then it was harder because not only was I healing from the ACL but then my knee was healing in general just from you know the previous surgery and then plus this surgery and then I had something different because in the first surgery it wasn't it wasn't too invasive because I wasn't using my own my own tissue that today everyone is nice it's right easy it's easy if it works if your body takes it how long did it take before it blew out again man I was almost a year I was training for another fight thinking I could get back in shape and fight again and then when I was training for that fight it blew out again hmm yeah I was scheduled to fight gussets in and then AJ end up taking that fight instead mmm but it was um it was it was one that that just you know it was like first of all when I was out for two years healing from injury you know I got to see what it was like to when all the cameras stopped flashing when people stopped caring to get your pictures when you know that whole feeling the whole feeling that just that happens when you admit that when you when you hit that transitional point and stop becoming that guy and it was difficult transition at first because you know even though I always told myself I never you know put myself in the mindset of being just that fighter sooner or later you become just that fighter and that's what happened to me so when I had to meaning that you weren't the best well not not just the best were an elite right yeah just world-class was an elite world-class fighter like I used to be I was right on that level anymore you know and that that was something for me that was like damn you know your use of your legs was so pivotal so it was so huge for you like when they're in that rampage fight I remember that opening sequence when you just darted after him and blast him on the right hand it was so fast like yeah he didn't even know what the fuck was happening as soon as the bell rang you were on him and he cracked him quick and it was like that is some serious explosion and that and that was even in that fight I could even wrestle like the last four weeks hit that fight because I had to I pulled my hamstring in a fight so I was just really just drilling up until that fight of the last four weeks so and when I came out like that I was like I was little insecure and I was like you know what I'm just gonna see what happened if I go and it worked I was like okay I still got some spring work perfect yeah so um yeah so so we're not when I was into my career and just kind of getting you know kind of trying to figure out like what what's next for me you know it was hard you know it was just a hard place because you know I really have anybody to talk to I didn't really know what I was gonna do next in my life you know and then when I started fighting again I still was in that place where I just wasn't you know totally back to fighting my mentality because fighting is is something mentally that it takes it takes a certain mentality for you know and and for me fighting was something that I did to exorcise some demons a bit you know but having some time away from the sport it allowed me to figure out other ways to exercise so demon demons and you know figure out some things around them you know the things that made me mad at things that were my fuel before I kind of made peace with them hmm and then making peace with a lot of the things that I was using for my fuel it just changed the way I fought in a way I've seen fighting so coming back to fight I just wasn't that same fighter anymore and then when I got to the point where I was like man I can't keep myself like I was like man I'm not fighting the way I want to fight and you know there's I mean what's the point if I can't go and compete the way I want to I'm only torching myself so then I decided to retire but then when I retired I'll still was in a space where I was like man there's still something missing so then when I did the five Meo DMT that kind of put things in perspective you know in a whole different way you know in it and it just it changed me it changed me a lot has changed the way that you know I said the way I think the way I eat everything everything about it you know so it was a it was soaked with Arctic and so many so many since it'll word you know do you think that something like that would be really beneficial for fighters that are in the twilight of their career I think I think it could be I think I think every fighter gets to a point where you fight enough then fighting it kind of it kind of you kind of get in a weird space about it and you know I've seen fighters go through that period where they just kind of like figuring out that why am I still doing this you know they've had great moments inside the cage but then they have those down moments and those down moments are the moments where it's harder to come back from and I think those are the times where you you know a psychedelic or something like that could put things in perspective and and allow the fighter to see the why behind the reason they're doing it and maybe create a new Y you know you're so different it's funny you know I've noticed that about you over the last few years of just I don't get to see you that often and when I get to see you over the last few years like wow something has changed in Rashaad like you're you're more I mean I hate to use the word spiritual but you seem like a more spiritual more peaceful guy I'd noticed that so that's why I was really interested to have this conversation see what your journey was yeah it's been it's been one hell of a journey man you know I'm you know I just I teamed up with some people in Denver one of my good friends Dale jolly out in Denver you know he's the one who told me about the medicine about the medicine the told medicine and after that we just kind of continue to always link up and we do you know a bunch of ceremonies together we do ayahuasca and just just make sure we always have that connection but it was through working with him you know I I became you know part of this group unlimited sciences and unlimited sciences what we're doing is um you know we've been able to we want to make psilocybin usage because del jolly was one of the guys who who got who's on the committee who got it approved for Denver decriminalizing he was one of the guys who made that possible you know how it works so are you allowed to possess a certain amount of psilocybin in Denver is that how it works I'm not really too sure exactly how it all works with that but I think that they're still working out the details of how it's going to be which you can possess on the on the legal side but with unlimited sciences you know we've you know we've been able to take that we want to take the psilocybin experience where it's one that people can go to for healing and help and get consistent consistent information consistent data on you know the full spectrum on how you can use it in a way that's use so we've teamed up and this has never been done before we teamed up with John Hopkins University and we're gonna be part of their study and we're gonna do like the first real world world study where we go out and and you know take information from people you know people from 18 and up who can speak in English can sign up for our our study and you know what you do is you go in you fill out a questionnaire and everything is is um HIPAA protected so no one has to worry about you know getting in trouble for what their their usage of civil assignment but you know John Hopson is taking all this information and we're collecting the form and you know what we want to do is we want to be able to give this back to them so that they can see on which way they want to direct their clinical research you know and what that can do is you know with with the unlimited sciences it's it comes from this group called realm of caring and realm of caring is out in Denver and Rama carrying was for medical refugees during the whole when there was a lot of refugees for cannabis who couldn't use in their state came to Denver where they were able to use it but when they first came that it wasn't there wasn't you know any information on how much you to use because Heather Jackson and this other girl started numerous page they started the realm of caring and it was just them they were treating their child and their children they had seizures and epilepsy and stuff like that so they wanted they tried everything in a medical field to help them but they couldn't could not help him with that so then he went to cannabis and there was only two of them doing it so they don't really have much information to go back from so then they would share information amongst each other and then he would ask other people and then through networking they create this huge community of people with data and then they started to come with more and more data and then they started working with John Hopkins University and made a protocol and everything else now Rommel caring helped thousands of families all over the world just with the information and data they may have been able to collect that's awesome John Hopkins has been involved until a Simon research for a while right they had some thing that they did on near-death patients yeah people that are close to death and alleviating the the fear of passing yeah and that's all and that and that's and that's one thing that they've they're they're very interested in diving into that the mind aspect and everything and I think that the real-world study would be good because what it does is it allows you know it allows them to put their money and their resources into where people are actually using it in the things that are interesting to the people you know so I mean it's one thing to have it in a clinic clinical setting but it's another thing to do it on your own and you get the results from it so hopefully just studying with John Hopkins University it it definitely changes games and puts things on a level where people can get the heal from the mushrooms have you read any McKenna stuff a little bit I follow McKenna a bit you know I listen to him quite a bit yeah fascinating guy looks weird weird voice right Rhea weird voice like but he not at all most yeah you can't I mean I list the hours of McKenna and just his understanding a breakdown of of mushrooms I'm friends with his brother and his brothers of another genius really fascinating characters also an outspoken psychedelic proponent and he lives up in British Columbia now and he's he's a big proponent of one of them Terrence had a theory that Dennis subscribes to called the stoned ape theory do you know this theory huh yeah and this is a really controversial theater theory but fascinating that they believe that at least Terrance Terrance had this idea that one of the catalysts for human evolution that changed us from lower primates to human beings was the consumption of psilocybin and that animals you know these these pre pre human primates would flip over cow patties and experiment by eating grubs and bugs and things they'd find it there and they would also eat the mushrooms that would grow on the cow patties and the doubling of the human brain size over a period of two million years is gigantic mystery like they have no idea what happened I mean it's a apparently according to biologists is the biggest mystery in the fossil record that the human brain doubled and not just that any organ would double in size over a period of two million years but that's the organ responsible for the theory of evolution in the first place doubled over two million years is really interesting but it coincides with climate change and coincides with these rainfall and this is all Terrance's work I'm repeating it coincides with these rain forests receding into grasslands and then these undulates these cow cow like animals that would live on these grasslands and eat the cow and take shits and then the manure would grow or the psilocybin rather would grow in the manure and they they would follow these cows around and then eat there are mushrooms that would grow in their manure and it also coincides with the earliest earliest civilizations with all worship cattle like Choctaw Hyuk which is one of the earliest known civilizations they add these there was a real cattle worshipping sort of a monastic cult but the way their culture would operate they worship cattle and some would say well that's because they ate them and they use their milk I'm sure I'm sure that had something to do with it but like the Hindus don't even eat them they just worship them imagine that you got a billion people living in a place everyone's starving and they're not eating the cows they're not even the most delicious aren't law on the planet well it's because they grew mushrooms and the ancient Hindu scripts like soma is one of the the main sacraments that they would talk about no one really understood to this day they're not exactly sure what soma is but it's some sort of a psychedelic sacrament and it probably was a combination of many things but a big one was most likely psilocybin was a part of that and that sort of correspondent with their relationship with cows that they had this this worship of cattle though they wouldn't eat them and the reason is because God came out of there but in their eyes you know they would make the manure the mushrooms that grow in the manure and I mean there's all sorts of mushroom iconography and all their ancient religious artwork and I mean I think mushroom the know mushrooms that played a big part in our society yeah I mean in our civilization in our ancient civilization for sure I don't think has been you know properly covered the way that it could be but right it's amazing because the minute you you eat a mushroom at the right dosage you feel it you feel the fact that it's like oh this is something ancient because there there's something that happens when you go to that place where you you you lose the you lose itself mmm when you lose yourself then there's there's something that that happens that's that's just magical there really isn't a way to to explain it or dress it up with words it's just a mad something magical that happens once you reach that level yeah whenever I have these conversations of people there's two types of people there's people like you that have the experiences that go mm-hmm and then there's people that have no experience at all that look-alikes yeah it's mushrooms but I feel bad for those projects too because I know how I used to think and I would have dismissed it the same way I would have said this is the foolish notions of frivolous spiritual people that are just being ridiculous and they think oh it's all about the mushrooms man and but it is if you do it you'll realize like oh if you do any real potent breakthrough psychedelic any real breakthrough psychedelic experience is gonna make you humble it's gonna make you realize like oh there's more to this than everyday consciousness yeah is more to this experience as existence there's something way bigger and you only can tap into it through a variety of different methods whether it's you know which would you know name your psychedelic or name your trance-like state that people can go into there's a lot of different ways to tap into it but once you do you realize like this is not this little thin thing that we're touching right now this is not everything right and that's the thing about it really just cuts through the whole materialism of everything yeah really shows that materialism is just a product of consciousness you know and sometimes we tend to think that you know our consciousness is a product of the materialism but you know at the end of the day conscience is everything and and and I when I did my Toad experience I almost felt as if like I'm not really here and I'm really somewhere else just projecting my consciousness to here and it seemed as if like when I smoked the toad the venom severed that connection and the connection wasn't able to come here on earth and I was just really right I really am that's what it felt like yeah and then when I came back to my body I remember feeling like like I didn't want to come back actually actually it was saying like please don't go please don't go then I came back well I felt like I was i dissolved and I became a part of everything I felt like like I always tend to think of life as like my own view of experience it's right here right my life is right here now right now it's in this room later on it'll be at the Comedy Store there's places I go my life is where those places are but when I had my first Mao dm5 Mao DMT experience it felt like no no no it's all together you're in the middle of this infinite soup of life and there's no one spot right that spot is your imagination it's like your own the limitations of your biology that we have kept from the time that we were small little mammals to the time that we were lower primates to the time that were human beings the limit the biological instincts to survive and to preserve our DNA and to carry that DNA on or DNA on all of those instincts are the reason why we're here but also so limiting because they keep your consciousness bottled up in the location that you're at it keeps your your feeling of life contained to wherever you're at at that moment and staying safe and then keeping people paying attention to you and making sure you got the coolest shit yeah all the things that seem so silly when you trip yeah absolutely absolutely when when it when I fall away and the feeling of falling away and not being who I who I think I am it is almost the most freeing feeling but at the same time it is one of the scariest yeah it's one of the scariest at the same time but it's um it's necessary and it is necessary in order to to reach a certain point of understanding you know when you reach a certain point of understanding of going inside then you don't need a group you don't need anyone to to drop inside our knowledge because all the knowledge and insight it's there if you go deep enough and you know how to go deep enough you know and you understand fact that you know um there's this there's there's just this knowingness and it's hard to explain like it sounds crazy to say but there's just this knowingness out there and you can tap into it yeah there's something out there for sure what's interesting to me is some people have a way better grasp of the English language and they're way better at describing things the way they're way better at sort of putting trips into perspective because everyone sucks at it even the best people suck at I'm terrible and I've described it the same way you described it there's not really words for it you know you do your best but it's so poor like you're you're you're just the ability that words have to convey the experience there there's no words that are correct there they don't even get in the neighborhood they get they wrap around it they try and even and even in a state I remember being a state where I'm where I was in one of my deepest trips and I'm in the trip and my friend looks over at me and then I rave him over because I want to tell him the secret that I found about you know about consciousness and about existence but I couldn't tell him because the annoyingness to tell me if I tell him then I'm not gonna be able to come back and live you know I had to go I had to leave this earth that's what it was telling me so I remember just sitting there just like man I want to be able to to tell him and be able to convey to him in words what I'm feeling the only thing that came out of my mouth was just go sit over there it had come to you because that's what happened to me like I was sitting like right like I was in is I was in his yard and I just went in out when and walked and as I was walking this knowingness told me like I was walking barefoot in this grass and I kept getting my feet poked and annoyingness told me it was like you know it told me the path to walk it I said I'm the reason why I'm stepping on these these getting practical stepping on live grass step on a dead spots where there's no and it just came to me just that clear and I just started doing it and I wasn't getting pricked by the grass Lamarr then it told me to sit down and then I sat down and then I just had like the most profound just realizations just hit me like it was like it was like it was coming out of the Sun it sounds crazy I was outside and I went and I was looking at the Sun and it was like the Sun transitioned to something else it was just became very deep in it had layers of it was it was very very trippy but during that experience I remember looking around and seeing everyone that I was with and laughing to myself saying like they would not believe this but I'm actually every single one of them and that that was like a thought that I remember thinking and feeling like it like I'm feeling myself right now and it bugged me out it I know is is deep is so deep do you still train all the time yeah I train all the time you train all the time you what do you feel different like even when you're hitting things yeah but not but not in a way like I feel like oh man I feel bad I don't feel like that I just feel like I'm eight ever since I was able to to kind of come back after I this whole transition happen I feel like I have a better idea on competing now like as far as like my mindset for competing it is better than it was before just because I don't my ego is not so attached to it as it was you know and I'm able to go out and just give my best and whatever it is it is and completely just black uh it you know it's whatever and it's easy to say now that I'm not competing where it counts for anything but for me before even in practice it felt like something if I lost in practice then it was stick with me for a couple days you know I thought I'd be upset about that but now I can just going and just train and you know and it doesn't it doesn't stay with me like it would before do you feel like though that to be an elite fighter maybe you need that burning desire to the point where mistakes burn they hurt and I know as a comedian I mean there's a there's a there's a parallel there like where when if I'm really working hard really concentrating hard anything I say that is stupid or comes off wrong or I try something doesn't work it will fuck with me for days yeah just all day long even in conversation I'm having fun with some friends and I say something stupid like that like it'll sit in my head dad wake up the middle of night to piss go why the fuck did I say that it's to worse now you you do you do need that as an athlete but at the same time particularly as a fighter right yeah cuz you you have to I mean it's so the difference between a champion you know is about it more than anybody between a champion and a good fighter so close it's such a good so close so close it is and sometimes it's that fucking fire that anger that fear that drive inside of you to be elite to be the best and sometimes that comes with every practice you have to win everything you have to do every fucking training session you have to burn it out if you don't you feel like you're less then you could be yeah I agree with that but there's also the other side of that too where there's that that that blissful ignorance and that blissful ignorance is where you just go out and do something and you do it a hundred percent great all the time just because you enjoy and there's not the pressure of oh I have to do it a certain kind of way like for instance when when um when John Jones was first competing John Jones he competed so freely because you know it was just like he was it was just in his nature like he was just so creative and fought different because of you know he fought from that place of just creativity that ignorant that ignorant bliss you know he couldn't be beat he didn't believe he can be beat and you know he will fight that way and he would do some genius stuff in there just because of that you know but then when you have those experiences where you you know you've been caught in a fight or you've you know you made some mistakes in there then you do know better but then those those those thoughts it actually slows you down a bit too because you're not fully reacting you're thinking of here would before he was just kind of like a reaction yeah I talked about his opening fight the opening sequence of his fight with Shogun I mean he's 23 years old he's fighting for the world title and he opens up with a flying knee hey who the fuck does that that's that that was that oh that that was that dumb and young that's the best way to say it but at the same time that blissful ignorance that's what made that was his blueprint for so long you know and and he's turned it into a whole fighting style just that you know letting it all hang out letting it fly and that's what worried me that's why I thought in his fight with Dominic Reyes it was gonna be a closer fight because of the fact that Dominic Reyes now had that what John used to have being of that blissful ignorance he didn't really know how much you know how better John was or didn't even care he was just kind of like oh how can what you know I'm saying he was so confident himself almost in it in an ignorant blissful way but it worked out for him you know well what's interesting about that fight is first of all it's a great argument for five-round championship fights because for the first three rounds Dominic Reyes was winning yeah the question is whether he won the third round that's the one I believe that's up for grabs most people that I've talked to think John won the last two clearly most people most people that I talked to that are experts most people if you disagree believe that Dominic grey has won the first three and the third round is the one that seems to be well Dominic scored more but it was close enough where you could see someone giving it to John particularly since John was pressing the action John was pushing forward maybe you give to John but they thought Dominic want it but they said if there's a disputable round it is that third round yeah I agree one fucking judge gave John four rounds to one that's insane yeah this is the same judge that when I believe blue Luke Thomas was talking about this I'm sorry if I'm wrong so I'm not saying the judges name because I'm not sure if I'm correct but I believe it's the same judge that Trevin Giles who fought James Krause Giles and Kraus was an amazing fight Giles won winning the decision but the first round Kraus had his back for four minutes and the referee the judge gave that round to Giles which is insane I mean for four minutes Kraus had his back was if the guy was fighting off chokes Kraus was real close to submitting him couple times during those four minutes and the judge the same judge who gave four rounds to John Jones gave that first round to Giles where there was a dude on his back for four fuckin minutes most of the round and maybe even a fucking more egregious fight was Andre Yule versus Jonathan Martinez that fight was fucking crazy that fight was crazy that was the most crazy one Martinez one half fight Martinez won that fight you will broke his arm I think you see I'm not sure if it's a broken arm but he had a significant injury to his right hand early in the fight somewhere in between either the first or the second round not sure we really couldn't throw a right hand and it was kind of hanging you could kind of see it was hanging and Martinez put in work it was an amazing performance by him and he got fucked over man real bad it was bad decision-making there was a bunch of bad fights there was a bunch of bad decisions it wasn't just one it was like four or five on a card of what 12 fights 11 12 fights I forget how many was from the opening prelims there was bad decisions just almost like people who don't know what they're seeing yeah and that's crazy too especially when we reached a point that we have in mixed martial arts you know I think that we've we've turned the corner in that meaning the fact that there's there's so many so much out there so much knowledge out there in sport and everything else like then if you're gonna be judging it you gotta at least know when somebody is is winning around I mean you know there's aspects of John's game that that was you know a score some point you know he was always moving forward with the action mm-hm but you know even when he was moving forward the action he wasn't terribly too offensive he would come with his legs but you know a lot of times he would allow he would allow Dominic to be the first one initiated and then moving off and it sometimes it seemed like he was just kind of chasing them but you know I think that it was it was that third round that third round was that that hard Ron to score mm-hmm but you know is I I think that dom had the edge but if you're gonna be the champion you gotta be the champion i don't think he did that john jones oppressed me so much with the shots that he was able to take but more or less the mindset that john had that that their mindset that john had in those championship rounds to me that that showed that this guy is you know he is a total package and when it comes to fighting just mentally speaking you know he's he's somebody who I thought that was frustrated and working through his own frustrating in the fight for his frustration in a fight is is difficult yeah and so come to his own frustration and and he just kept that pressure going it took some big shots from a heavy hitter but uh Dominic gray is a problem for anybody he's a problem he's a real problem especially now that he's got that rub he touched touch greatness with John he's the greatest ever I feel like those last two rounds should count more this is my personal opinion but John Kavanagh said something on his Twitter page I believe is John Kavanagh and it reflects exactly how I feel that if this fight was gonna go on another five rounds it's pretty fucking clear to me who's gonna win who's gonna who this is to the death john jones gonna win that fight yeah you know it's if it's to the death there's no doubt about it in my mind that john jones eventually gonna get him yeah those last two rounds Dominic Reyes was hurting you could see him looking at and taking big deep breaths and trying to move and his arms were labored and John just kept press and Kemp press and kept kicking him kept punching them kept trying for the takedown and that should mean more it should mean more towards the end of the fight at the end of the fight if you win a decision but you just got your ass kicked for the last four minutes that seems crazy to me that you won the fight yeah because I mean I know this is a dumb way to think about it but if we were in a schoolyard right we were in high school and some dude and another dude fought the dude who's getting shit beat out of them at the end of the fight is the guy who lost right when the teachers come and they pull you off that guy that's who was he wonderful that's who won and I know that you can't score of professional sport the way you look but it is the rarest of rare professional sports because it's the sport of fighting right and in fighting when you're getting your ass kicked you were you know you're supposed to you're supposed to lose if you're getting your ass kicked you lost yeah and if you're kicking the guy's ass you win sounds crazy but at the end of that fight John Jones was kicking Dominic razes ass he was he was chasing him down Dominic was taking a big deep breath he was firing back when he fired back very well in the fourth round but John absorb John has a fucking hell of a chin - oh my god hell of a chin I mean you can't he's he's something special because of everything it's not he's something special because of his physical attributes he's very tall and long is very strong it's not just his skill he's got great wrestling he's got great striking it is all in his his mind - yeah it's all those things he it's his ability to press forward its ability to break people disabilities stay on top if you have that champions mindset and to know that he's fought the majority of his career as a world champion which is fucking crazy I mean almost a decade as the greatest in the world chasing everybody that he's fought every single fighter that he's fought you look at them they're all guys like you guys like Machida world champions rampage world champions over and over and over again you go through the list of them just all these killers is this killer after killer Gustafson you know I mean you just keep going through his entire career DC twice stopped him in the second fight he's a fucking assassin and the most impressive thing about it for me is the fact that you know on a physical scale he's phenomenal but just mentally speaking to be able to go through everything he's gone through you know the ups and downs yeah what that what that does to your mind yes you know what that does to your mind and just being able to put that to a side or be able to use it in order to go out and still perform as if like he hasn't missed a beat yeah that is hard because it gets to the point you know you you get you get anything in life you get tired of monotony of it you get you get jaded by it yeah he hasn't been jaded by it and he still goes out there and performs like that why pressive I think he needed someone like Dominic to get that fear going too I think he knew Dominic grass physically is a talented guy he's a great athlete he has tremendous footwork his ability to change angles then fire back is insane it's so good you saw it in the OSP fight where he knocked him out with like a couple seconds to you know you see it and a lot as Jared cannoneer fight he gets stepped back and fire fire uppercut step back and fire that straight left his ability to change direction is amazing and I think a lot of that could be attributed to his football basketball I mean baseball like footwork movement his ability to explode all that stuff that he did in other sports I think directly translates to his ability to move really well inside the Octagon and then on top of it he's gigantic he's the same size as John which is very unusual for John to face someone that's his height and he's really fucking strong too that's what that was now that was the intangible that I think that John didn't expect he didn't expect for him to be as strong as he was but he's able to get back get up like he wasn't even on him yeah his legs are fucking huge you look at Ray as his legs Hugh yeah I mean he's got tremendous power I mean both with his punches but also with his ability to move man he was throwing great kicks he was chopping at John's legs I mean I had of any fight in John's future I want to see a rematch I really want to see what Dominic Reyes looks like now with this rub understanding how close he was and then the amount of conditioning that he's going to have to put himself through to be able to do that again five rounds and it's not like either guy got fucked up in that fight where they're gonna be severely damaged it's not like one of those crazy wars worth like Adesanya Kelvin Gastelum at the end of that fight I was like my god you know I hope Kelvin takes some time on to that one that was chaos just wildness it wasn't like that it was a grueling difficult hard fight but it wasn't a fight where there was so much damage that both John and and Dominic need to take a long time off I feel like you can make that fight in eight months absolutely and that would be the fight to make that's that is a that's a crazy rematch and the thing about it was surprisingly to see like they like their faces weren't beat up and I'm like these dudes were landing some shots is not even yes like I thought for sure John's lip would be all swollen like it was when he fought Gus is saying yeah he took he took those shots well man it's it's amazing it's amazing but I think that this is exactly what John needed in their light heavyweight weight class because you know it does it was getting kind of stagnant and I think it needed some time to mature but I think I think Dominic raised just say you better stay here for a little bit and here's another guy Corey Anderson oh yes loriann oh yeah that's the dark horse telling every person that's the dark horse way he knocked out Johnny Walker and he's angry he's angry he's angry and that's something you never seen Cory yes he's never seen that before after that fight he was like letting everybody know you fuck ever spin slippin yeah you've been sleeping on me you guys have been pretending that I don't exist yes I'm out here beating the best in the world if he fights John Jones I think that's one of John better be like all right he better be so ready yeah Cory's got he doesn't have a chip he's got logs on his shoulder I know Cory he's angry he's pissed he's pissed after that Johnnie Walker fight it was so out of character he's screaming and yelling and fucking you know he was so it was angry after he won he knocked him out in the first round and then he's bad the the years of disrespect and that's how he trained no he always trained with that that Minds head like god they don't respect me you know that's why he worked so hard yeah his endurance isn't saying his pace is insane yeah train trying to alongside those guys in Jersey was probably one of the best experience of my career training with Mark Henry was was mine you were telling me about this you and I had this long conversation about that tell me what it's like to work with that guy Mark Henry is is it yes you know what he does is he breaks down the game like no one ever trained with before so for every combination that we throw every punch it's all accounted for with a code and that code is specific to to you and to what's in important in your life in the way you value so this is talks talks to you about you know your family whatnot and then you know here make these codes up and these codes would just be like for accommodation to be I say jab cross hook you know then he'll say that isn't that's Nia that's my daughter's name and then here maybe the whole system of codes with just names and then when you're sparring he'll call off the name and you just got to know what that technique goes to there's there's a bunch of different techniques for different colors for different movement and you know he can have he just says it and it's like he's like when I watch him go afraid because Frankie has a system down the best for it's like he's controlling Frankie like a convert like a like a like a game and he's just say yeah he's just saying these commands and Frankie hears him and then he goes off and you know sometimes like if I'm going and I don't see it he'll say something I'll see it I like nodded off and then he'll say another one but if he says it then most of the time I just do it because he sees it and right you know that's crazy to have that kind of confidence in another person it's it with us that well that's that's the part of the training that that you learn and then you know you kind of the good side that is that you it makes it easier but when you just out there fighting sometimes it can be definitely difficult if you are too dependent on it and you just kind of lose the ability to create yourself you know but for the most part he does such a good job of breaking it down that it's pretty easy but it is it is a very technical system to learn and anybody who gets a chance to work with Mark Henry I suggest you do it because and here's another thing Mark Henry is one of those guys like I stayed at his house when I first went when his stay with them and he doesn't sleep he'll stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning watching film and then he'll go to sleep for a couple hours and he'll wake up at like 7:00 7:00 in the morning to go do his first pizza shop because he owns a piece of shop and he has his crazy work schedule but he he loves fighting it's so weird that a guy runs a successful pizza business and he's also one of the best trainers in the world so strange and he makes a killing down his pizza shop he kills I heard his basement gems amazing oh it is it is amazing his basement gym is where all the magic happens man he he has all the codes written out and he he taught he taught you in that basement torture you get your mind set like sharp as hell but he ahead torturing up that basement you know well it's so such a diverse group of fighters right as a beat comes down there Marlon more eyes say he had so many interesting guys Edson Barboza so many interesting guys had gone through that gym it's so crazy like when I first like I'll stand there I got to train with the beat a little bit and got the little as a beat and in the Russian the Dagestan fighters mm-hmm so it's pretty pretty cool experience because you know you kind of get to know their culture and just kind of just just get a different respect for it you know and those guys are just hard work on those outstanding guys they're so hard they they work hard they pray hard they they just are very very focused individuals and you watch them you're like okay you know even I'm like you know what maybe I need to get a little bit more serious about my think you know but that's where the the success comes from yes that's it think about how many great fighters come out of that region and it's really it's extraordinary yeah and these guys are phenomenal like I watch them after training and these guys do this this like it's like a randori type of sparring afterwards and they just do like jumping off the walls all these kind of like these acrobatic crazy moves that you don't think I ever work and you seem like oh my god where do you where do you get that from they practice it all the time and they just they just they just do all these kind of crazy moves at the inter train and at the end of training at the end of training like they're done with all the real work let's just fuck around and see if we get creative yeah they get creative and they just start just doing a kind stuff and they you know the real moves in there but they just they drill everything and the beat that do it is the beat is is probably like one of the best guys I ever seen in training just like like martial arts why this guy yeah he jumps off the cage and do all kinds of acrobats and come down doing all kinds of ground acrobats and he just he just makes it look so effortless and easy it's crazy he is really good he's he's really good with his mixture of traditional martial arts techniques you know because he has that kung fu background so he throws a lot of like round kicks and spinning kicks and all that kind of crazy shit but then he'll hit you would like some judo shit a lot of tosses and trips yeah and he's got great submissions too I mean he's got great wrestling he's got great boxing I mean he's a weird combination of a bunch of different styles and he's tall to know that the tall length is really something that helps him out - this Frankie agar when he ever he goes on he's like man I feel like I can get him down but then I look down and then his feet are still touching the ground I'll tell you what though he had a hard time in his last fight with Calvin cater that yeah that dude it's fucking dangerous caters a dog he's a dog he's a dog he's the Dark Horse at 45 in my opinion because he was beatings of beat in that last round it was and it was rough like as a beat was trying to just get the fuck away from him and he stays on them and I think he has the best boxing in that division and he's also huge for 45 yes you stand next to him you like how the fuck are you weighing 145 yeah he looks like he's a 160 yeah it doesn't look anything like 145 I know it seemed like in that fight cater who kind of realized towards the end like wait a minute I can beat this dude you know yeah and that happened sometimes when you against a guy who has like a bunch of different tricks you find yourself putting you putting yourself in his trick bag just by being aware of all the things that he can do you find yourself I hope he's gonna set that up oh he's gonna set that up and by you being too watchful of what he's doing you shutting your own game down mmm and it's thing like cater just threw caution to the wind up their arms like you know what I'm going to go out and just make it happen and then when you did that he found his opportunities I think also the first two rounds were really fast pace and I think in the third round cater was the one who's in better condition he was the one who was pressing the paste in the third round and he was also let him body shots some nasty nasty body shots that we're adding up he's he's a fascinating guy Calvin cater I'm really interested to see him he's fighting Jeremy Stephens necks which should be fucking chaos because Jeremy Stephens is another savage man he only fights one way and that's you know kill or be killed see I feel like guys like that don't even need to win they just need to go out there or just fight because like his fighting is so good you just want to see him go just fight me yeah he's had so many oh shit moments in his career like Dennis Bermudez that flying knee up against the cage Josh Emmett that the KO at Josh hammer he fucks people up man and he's got ridiculous power too and with Calvin's boxing and Jeremy's savagery the two of them together and Jeremy is ridiculous power the two of them together that's gonna be amazing and then they have as a beat the beat is now gonna fight Ortega Brian Ortega's comeback fight it's gonna be the beat and that's a tough fight to come back to Ortega's been out injured a bunch hasn't fought since he lost max he's had a bunch of like real problematic injuries that he can't get get over and then finally he's healthy now is going through training and you know tall order though to jump right back in the deep end of the pool where the guy likes a beat but you know what though like sometimes it is a tall order but sometimes like when you like when you just came from a big fight that's the kind of fight it's easier to get up for like eight feet like he just came from Thailand challenging for the title right it'll be hard for him to take us too far of a step down a competition because then it's Brian then it's gonna be hard to get himself up for it but if he's taking a step kind of like in a you know in an upward motion then it's like okay I can get up for this right and then he can train for it you know yeah cuz the beat is I don't know what the official ranking is in my book he's two or three right he's right there he's right at the top of the heap in my book I mean there's volcán offski he's the champ there's max Holloway they have to fight again they had they're gonna fight again and then after that it's basically as a beat and cater and that's that's how I look at it and then a bunch of other guys now that all doze down for 235 which is real interesting because Aldo is going to fight Triple C he's gonna fight to hoot oh that's interest yes that is another title it is interesting to be very interesting I thought although look the best that he's looked in a long time 45 yeah he looked amazing he looked like a bit like the old although - the kicks he did yes - the cakes I wonder why he doesn't throw so many kicks anymore I don't know he has injuries or something he might have an injury I think you don't want to take a chance of his knees yeah hurting something and then having to fight through it you know Ryan compromised but it's crazy because his kicks were just such a devastating weapon I mean he only need like two or three of them change the whole complexion of the fight one Rock oh when he fought Uriah yeah but imagine now imagine that that power of leg kick to the lower calf like oh my god yeah yeah maybe is a knee thing maybe he can't throw those kicks as his knees are fucked up I don't know I'd like to know because that was one of his primary weapons but still even without that I felt like he beat my eyes I felt like that was a bad decision but he's you know he's fighting more eyes who's easily one of the best 35 hours on earth my eyes is so good man that left high switch kick that he has is a thing of beauty yeah the way he whips it it's like a whip it's crazy like it's effortless it just goes to your head yeah Marlon Marlon is pretty sick man he's beautiful it's just all the throwing some kicks okay so oh okay it's practice but hmm looks normal looks normal I don't see any problems except the sounds all fucked up I see it's different though it's different when you got a Christ guy his legs you know yeah gosh it's I think that um I think honestly when when it comes to you know the state of mixed martial arts I think that you know once a lot of these fighters start to because we're speaking about it earlier like we were in a Dark Ages when it came to training in that transition of how to become more professional with your training you know do you think nowadays fighters are starting to understand that more with you know the performance Institute is helping to educate these fighters a lot more on what proper training should be yeah and what it truly could encompass you know and now there's more professionalism added to martial arts but there's still an aspect that needs to be covering and that's on the equipment side you know like um the equipment at the the company I work with Onix have you heard on yes yeah I have prepare the gloves okay excellent very very good so we have a whole line and this is the line that we have with Onix it's it's really the first MMA branded like a MMA company that's made for all the the way we move in MMA you know everything that happens in May because now the equipment that we use now we borrow it from kick boxing or boxing and there's that gap of just efficiency when it comes to manufacturing for mixed martial art because they will kick box and they don't have to worry about all the things that we have to worry about when it comes to mixed martial arts so the equipment that trevor has made is all with that in mind you know the the gloves that we we made you try the x-factor glove yeah Trevor Wittman sent him to me yeah so they said he designed them yeah he he so Trevor Trevor's a genius he's another genius oh my gosh an absolute genius so he started so what happened is when we were trained if anything happened to our equipment we'll just give the Trevor and Trevor will go in here tweak it and he'll make some adjustments so then Trevor was like man you know he's like man just the more he started to do that the more he started to realize there's a huge gap like the equipment that we're we're using is not efficient you know some gloves that should be you know 16 ounces are actually 11 ounces you know in every there's no integrity when it comes to equipment so it's Trevor's did a lot of research and he was like man it really hasn't been any improving on equipment since the thumb was put on the boxing glove you know and that's that's pretty much it so Trevor went and he learned how to sew he learned how to do everything and he was in his basement just making this equipment you know he's uh he's made expect the glove you had yeah they're young women so and he's good at like at first I didn't I didn't realize how him death it was until I went to his basement and seen the little shop that he had but it's pretty high-tech so we have the the the glove to extract the glove but we have a knee brace and we have a knee brace um they're not knee brace is the knee sleeve nice it's like it's like a nice it's a it's a shin guard but it slides into a knee brace you can slide you can slide you it's like a knee brace at the same time as well as an ankle brace it secures a whole like whole leg pretty much and it's it feels like you have nothing on and you can cake with like anything and it feels feel it doesn't feel like ah it feels amazing and he has a really really thin headgear and I want to show you these gloves I brought some gloves to show you so these gloves right here are what we're going to be doing for the competition gloves the competition and the training gloves the 7oz training gloves and huh so pretty much what these are so this one is the so is he developed a different glove for MMA for competition yeah yeah so this isn't UFC seen these because yeah what to make some adjustments yeah we're talking with the UFC but these are yes so these are the curved curved so it sets up that you're in a curved position already on because when you as you know when you get the gloves now they're like a cardboard they want to open your hand yeah there's always one open hand this allows your hand to stay in a natural fist locked position and you don't got to worry about that these are now getting on oh yeah okay so it's curved right away yeah and then when you that's way better yeah like the old pride gloves yeah yeah good padding too so it's I like them a lot these are definitely better than the ones UFC is using right now yeah so it's you know if you see the X trapping system in air that also goes in your so in that way it makes it so that your your your hand you don't get the boxing break on your hand it keeps everything all the muscles all the all the ligaments and and bones in place so that way when you punch and everything is is in form so this is it says grappling glove is wrapping in glove and fight glove so these ones were the ones at the factory and I had to hurry up and get these out just sucking I want to show you these so this one is is this one is is going to be like the training the training one but we're gonna put a different different head on the front of it what's kind of different about it it's gonna be just the top is gonna be different a little bit more so you can punch with let you can Oh hit with a side of anxiety to be it'll be a little bit like this it's got some side panic yeah but it definitely better than it'll be a side paddling like this a little bit you know so it's gonna be a bit bigger so wet that way right I can hit like that and training like casting punches those right mm-hmm I like these a lot I like these a lot yeah I mean just I mean I this but Trevor's whole thing man you know it's all about making it so that fighters can do what they enjoy doing a lot longer and be healthy about it you know and he's Trevor's Trevor's a G when it comes to adjusting and making what he needs who for the fighter so they can so they can continue to do what they want to do he's a jut like he's made he's made head gears for people too so because the one one of these fighters had a broken nose and he made a headgear and Haggar that he made with this guy it was it was sick of how does this work this is weird because it's like both sides are male I see yeah oh yeah so this this is it goes inside was on the inside huh yeah it goes on the inside I gotta see okay probably some weird shit you go talk to Trevor about the busy maybe busy this way first up I bet that's exactly I bet it goes this way first yes so you can put yeah that's it that's the guy was like that mm-hmm so you can pull this trap on it yeah and then the strap goes oh okay I say and the strap goes over the top these are great man well there's definitely room for improvement the current state of MMA gloves are the ones that UFC uses they're they're better than the original ones that they had a few years back you know they improved them maybe eight or nine years ago or whatever it was but still those are better well see I mean and that's and that's where we are at onyx you know we just want to be able to get a product out there for the athletes in it they can they can use but it protects them because a lot of a lot of the injuries like 75% of them happen in training sure you know and if we can kind of cut that number down then they can have a lot more these fighters making these dates you know and for the most part for these fighters you can actually you know for it you you can have gear that protects you and you don't got to suffer these long injuries like these ACLs right you know it helped mitigate some of those things well you were a big part of the Blackzilians getting started yeah and when you had that opportunity as a guy was a former world champion to go there and sort of get become a part of a team from the ground up what did you try to do that was different then had you had seen in other camps that you had participated in I wanted to make it just like a you know the the biggest thing back then it was it was that there was you always had to go to so many different places in order to just get that one thing so I Ward really wanted to just make us so that our guys didn't have a need to go anywhere else for anything else and that was the whole idea behind the whole Blackzilians you know we brought in all kinds of peoples from every different aspect from you know training to to nutrition almost every aspect of it and that's what we wanted to provide our athletes with just like the total the total game so they really didn't have to do anything to worry about anything except for showing up the Train and it worked for a while it worked for a while but but it's it's a hard thing to maintain because that's in a very there expensive thing you know yes well Glenn the guy who put up the cash I mean I had heard some outlandish figures that he had was in the hole for that place for by the time everything was up and running yeah yeah it was it was a pretty it was a pretty pretty hefty ticket man it was a pretty happy ticket and it was uh it was it was an expense that it did get out of hand I take it I'm sure yeah hee hee and here's the thing about it like even even his situation though he got himself in a situation where he was doing so much for people it just became a thing that people expected out of him mm-hmm and then when he wasn't able to do it anymore than it was kind of like you know people are like oh man this guy is it this and he wasn't that but right he just he just wanted to do so much and had an idea to want to do do do things on another level but at the same time you know the the finances of doing it was a massive undertaking I'm sure I mean all credit to Dan Lambert because Dan Lambert is he's in doing this from the beginning yeah that fucking guy I mean he is the reason why these super camps got started at dan lamp who put his own money and then the new ATT they built he built himself from the ground up built the whole fucking building and you know I haven't seen in person I have friends that have come to visit it but I've seen it in videos and holy Sh yeah it's phenomenal I went inside of it Dan's the man yeah it really is dan dan is a good guy man um you know after the whole thing with the black zillions you know him and I got got to have a chance to spend some time together and just and just talk you know there was so much weird animosity it was within the UFC put that show together yeah it's like I inherited beef with people that I didn't even know I didn't even say hello to a militant it's so crazy and I just inherited this beef and I was like you is silly and especially the fact that ATT is like literally right down the street from my house they would be closer to go there than anywhere else but it was weird for a while but actually talking to Dan and actually getting to know him and you know it was a it was a good it was a good thing because I you know I got I got to get a lot of respect for for him and just for what he's done what American Top Team and ATT in general know he's a he's a brilliant guy I love that guy as a person I'm a big fan of his I just love that a person like that like Dan Lambert can literally change the course of MMA by setting an example yeah and by having a gym that sets an example that's such an insanely high level so big so many world-class fighters there so much strength and conditioning everything under one roof dorms everything you wanna say I think that was that was the thing that that kind of you know that kind of pushed things in that in that position for Glen you know keep up he had to keep up all he was trying to outdo yeah cuz I trying to do Dan Lambert I always wanted to do something that Dan wasn't doing you know yeah go broke that's a good way to spend a lot of money that's how you down yeah yeah there's I mean there's a lot of super camps out there now it's interesting to see these places you have Tristar in Montreal you've you know Duke Rufus and Milwaukee of Jackson Winkeljohn and Albuquerque yet aka you know it's when you first started there was not that many places now they're worthy wasn't and and to even get what we wanted out of it you know we there's three gyms that we can go through we will go to either Jackson's in Albuquerque we'll go to Tristar in Montreal who will go to Denver and we'll work with Trevor Whitman in Denver so we had the three camps that we bounced around from and and that's what we ago to get the most working it and it worked for a while you know work for a while for the most part but just all that traveling it just became hard to do but that has to wear on you when you're in the middle of a camp and you're yeah staying in hotels and yeah it's like um like when I was in camp I really wouldn't travel too much but like when so what we do is that if if Nate Marquardt was in camp and he wanted to stay at home most of the time so we're staggering we're you know who have a tough guy and kept every single time so I'll be a couple weeks when George wasn't there or when Keith wasn't there you know and then sometimes we'll all come together but for the most part we're just all rotate in to these gyms depending on who was fighting who need the work he's a guy that I feel is underappreciated Nate Marquardt when he was at the very top of his game was a fucking assassin a Marco whoo that knockout tyron woodley in Strikeforce to this day is one of the nastiest in tight elbow combination knockouts I think I've ever like a video game knockout had seen Nate Marquardt was one of the guys I'm like ah man you'll get anxiety before training and practice because you knew it was gonna be a hard goal like my training going going growing up in the sport was just it was difficult man you know train with GSP Keith Jardine Nate Marc or Joey Villa senior Mike Van Arsdale and you know even ali abdul aziz is even up in a mix too but it was you know it was it was training with guys who like it was hard go all the time you know and and Nate was one of those guys then I'm just like oh my gosh this dude is not gonna get tired unit upside he's good everywhere he's super strong it was just like one of those one of those when I was like all right I gotta bring it in order to compete today yeah he was in that he he had this weird transition between the UFC and Strikeforce for people kind of forgot about him and then when he came back to the UFC you know he had some grilled good fights but he had already had a really long career yeah he'd already had some really tough fights and then really tough fights in training too right yeah yeah and that's the thing like back then we weren't really too too smart like Greg will kill us in training like we do some shit that you'd be like oh my gosh like one time Greg had us doing like somebody carries we're on the side of the Sandia Mountains and there's like you know it's like two or three feet and you'll fall to like your death and then we had to do like these buddy carry these wedding carriers where I'm holding Keith like this it's a fucker yeah and this you fall to your death like if you if you make a mistake you know there wasn't much room for mistake if I would have fell down then we would have we would have fell but you take and we had to rotate every 60 steps fuck that and Greg and Greg was like Greg was always on a like you know like mental like yo you gotta be ready to die you gotta be ready to face death let's let's get it seek death meanwhile he's such a sweetie in the corner I know but the corner is hey how you doing Rashad my gosh things are looking great yeah that's why he does it because he knows we do did you in training I can't imagine that but he carries a wedding carry like that and you're literally if you fall you die you die yeah and then it was like one little slip and he's like alright let's change things up go on his back and I'm like what yeah fuck out of here Greg you go on his back bitch what are you doing what are you talking about yeah it's so crazy it was crazy man but that was a that was a good time there's mental toughness training huh yeah that was a mental toughness training well you guys thought Albuquerque team was always known for having crazy endurance I mean that had to come from some of that grit had to come from those Hill workouts yeah we had a lot of grit because of those workouts that we did we did one where we do the sand dunes mmm worse and you you cry like you had to carry somebody up doing the sand dunes and then if you didn't carry them all the way up then you had to do it again until you compete as he completed it like you were like you would literally see grown-ass men crying just like that's a good way to get injured too though unfortunately yeah it's like there's this fine line between pushing really hard and fucking somebody up yeah you know yeah I think now they've kind of figured it out but just the the mental aspect it paid off big dividends like I'll talk to Dana White and Dan like bro you are so fuckin crazy back then you were so paranoid I'm like you made a white impression [Laughter] yeah they're paranoid back then I mean I mean I was a fighter man fighters are always paranoid you have to be paranoid if you're a fighter you have to think that everybody is trying to take something from you it's just it's just a mindset but he'll say I was crazy I was paranoid cuz I didn't really trust them Magnum but I'm just he's a promoter right and then and then on top of that you know you had you had great Greg Greg Jackson always telling you like you know that they wanted they want to get you out of it man you want to get you out the UFC man go ahead and just go ahead and just just quit Evans just quit right now man I know you want to give up they want to get you out of here anyways man like no no I ain't gonna quit you're not gonna quit I don't want to see it let's go Jesus Christ yeah it's a good time over there when you first started fighting how much striking training had you done before you decided to compete in MMA because you had this rest base did you have any striking training growing up did you do any oxygen boxing yeah and I did some some karate too I didn't know Inc pseudo okay I did thanks ooh if like few years from the time I was like 13 to like 16 that makes sense cuz you always had good kicks yeah yeah like that Shawn salmon knockout but you know I never I never utilized my kicks like I said over my mom will always be like every time every shot listen Joe Joe she always the same something Joe Cocker said wish I Joe Road was here you need to pass the guards a man she she's the one who told me she thought Rashad throw yo kicks like Bruce Lee and then when I be the king and the next day I talking on the phone she said Rashad that was a good kick and I was like okay she's but I don't like that dirty shit though and I was like mom would you talk about Rashad you knew he was knocked out you didn't have to hit him again I can't you can't tell you got to keep going like the referee say don't stop until I stop you and I was just in the fight and she said but still Rashad shit that's so funny yeah I was kind of surprised that you were in head kicking more people unconscious after that you know I that's the thing man I needed I needed to really really step out of my game and make sure I stepped out of my game more and more often but I just you know after I switched switched things up and went went from you know Jackson's to uh to Florida it was different because Mike Winkeljohn he was my guy like it was like me and Mike Winkeljohn had a really good relationship and he would he would work with me and we and a lot of times we would work together it was like it was like a counseling session we would just talk about life you know I'm saying in between in between stuff we talked about everything and it was a fun training session you know and and that's when you know he'll instill in me all these different things you know he'll be like oh yeah that kick is gonna work that kick is gonna work you know even with the overhand right when I'm called chocolate dough he was telling me oh yeah that's the kick that's the best punch is gonna catch them that's gonna catch him that we're not when I caught Chuck the day before I was hitting it move super nervous and I was hitting the overhand right and a left hook combination and then you say oh yeah that's that's that's gonna be the punch you know you and him with that and you cannot come out and I'm not gonna be able to get into the cage and graduate you that's what he said to me word for word and I was like no way and then it happened I looked at almost like oh that but just like you said that was like a gunshot I remember that shot I remember you land that shot the smack of your fist hitting Chuck and then seeing Chuck crumbles like a holy shit was that you a most satisfying victory yeah I think so I it definitely was just because like going into that fight job like the media sometimes can be so damn disrespectful you know what I'm saying like they were just kind of like the questioning was like you know what have you even done to fight a guy like chocolate doll like it people are asking yeah I mean pretty much in so many words like you know what am I even but he would already at that point in time had you fought for the title no that was before you for title yeah before I fought for the title and you it was the fight before the fight before right fight before yeah only got a chance to fight for the title because I beat chuckling chuckling that was impulsive fight for the title that I was to serve up to fight for the title oh yeah Wow yeah that was that was a service well the media was a little sloppy back then yeah so there's some really good guys out there now and gals that are covering MMA with a real journalist they really a real sports journalist back then it was like anybody with a camera who like fights was also a lot of people that were trying to get attention just by being douchey yeah there's a lot of douchey sports guy talk yeah I can hate that stuff that that was driving me crazy you'd be real disrespectful to fighters real dismissive of fighters so going into the fight I felt that disrespect I was like you know what ma'am alright I'm like I don't care what happens I'm like this like I got I got a leash at least give a good showing for myself you know mmm and that's and that's all I really cared about doing you know I went out I walked out to the song the board of technique is called that's my boy yeah I love that he's my friend oh yeah it's cool I love him yeah I came out to the song point of no return and that song just really solidified everything I was feeling at that moment you know like I get you know there's a verse in Eris's you know the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore and I knew after I walked out to that fight you know life would never be the same whether I wanted lost so that was the big moment that was the big moment there was no that I was not going to be the same Rashad after that fight no matter what happened immoral technique as such great lyrics he's so smart so smart I'm so politically aware and geopolitically aware he's got so much depth to his lyrics I love that dude yeah he's like one of those guys you listen to and you just kind of keep putting it back a lot of things that he says you know you going you look it up out the words like okay you know he definitely had me looking up some things I thought listen to him do you fought won the ultimate fighter is a heavyweight which is so crazy no no look at me now I'm like what do you weigh now yeah what do you weigh now what are you walking around consisting like 200 200 pounds 200 pounds Wow yeah that is like a 170 now in this day and age 200 200 pounds but I feel but I feel good though man I feel really really good and it's it's a level that I didn't expect it I didn't expect the feel that's good I didn't think that a diet can make me feel this good what is what is particularly makes you feel so good in what way my energy I have an energy level that it's really hard to to say it kind of feels a bit supernatural in a bit you know like I feel I feel energy like I feel I feel like my body's energy it feels it's kind of hard to say it's kind of not that hard to say it's kind of hard to describe without looking crazy well you're obviously by found vegan diet I'm seeing all these supplements you're taking spirulina and those different things yeah you're obviously doing it right which is you know there's a lot of people that they're they're vegan but they're eating like pasta and pizza and shit like that they're just not they're not doing it correctly in terms of taking the proper amount of nutrients right and that's and that's the thing about it like I um I read this book the mucus Liz diet and it's by dr. Arnold eret and this is like in the early 1900's he came up with this book and he had some stomach issues and it was you know not so he was fed up and it was on like you know what I'm like he was starving himself and then he realized he has some really you know it kind of changes his his stomach situation so then he started looking into diet and nutrition and then he he became a fruit hmm and this book is talking about pretty much you know the role of food in your body and what it does and what causes mucus and what doesn't cause mucus and you know through understanding the mucus has died and just the reading it it just gave me a different hold on understanding like a different understanding of why I'm doing this you know in a game it became to me deeper than just like oh I can't have this because you know the diet says I shouldn't have it it says I can't have it because you know this is gonna cause information you know I I know the deeper reason of why it's easier for me to avoid the pitfalls about food you know mmm there's also a situation with people where there's everyone that there's biological variability where some people some diets just sync up well for them like I know I know a lot of people that they don't feel good when they eat red meat when the fish they feel great yeah when the light foods you know their their body whatever for whatever it is their digestion favors certain type of diet yeah and that's what I found too because I don't I don't know if this will work for everybody it probably won't work right I mean it most likely won't work for everybody but for me it was it was something that my body just was like oh it's about time you started to start the tree just the right way you know interesting and a crazy part about it is the fact that now I train less but I can train harder like now I can do sparring sessions where like a spar for like an hour straight really yeah and I'm sparring at a pretty good pace like I'm not like what it's it's smart sparring like we're not like bashing each other in the head and shit we just we were being smart about it you know we're doing you know a little bit lighter to the head but more more heavy shots to the body you know making those ones count and just kind of like touch you know giving an a nice shot to the head but not of like imma knock you up right right what type of foods are you eating like how what does it give me a typical meal for you um typically speaking uh it all depends on the time of the day but but I don't eat in the morning a fast up until noon or until like 1 o'clock and then my first are you on like a 16 hour or 14 hour like last like 16 intermittent fast and then once I eat I usually like like I come home and I eat you know maybe like a hearty hearty shake that I make a fruit and then I'll put some you know some some mushrooms and stuff in it just like you know the cordyceps the the lion's mane and you know from this brand life cycle sure you do okay so that brand right there makes us you know really good tincture that you just drop it in there and you don't got to worry about changing the flavor of too much of your shake so I drop that in with my shakes and stuff like that and I usually take that that'd be my first meal then a second one would be a little bit more hearty it would be something with vegetables and maybe some potatoes or something so it's a little bit more hearty and then I'll have another hearty meal like a vegetable type meal vegetable based meal at nighttime and then then I usually be done for the day are you using any protein powders pea protein hemp protein anything along those lines no I don't I don't use any just vegetables raw veggies raw vegetables vegetables interesting yeah and I don't know I don't really feel like I uh like I have it like I have a need for like I feel like um my muscle mass is pretty good like I don't feel like I'm I'm too skinny or like I don't I'm not gaining any muscle I feel like I can gain muscle and you know it's just been working for me and so basically just eat to feel good like however it makes you feel good yeah alright and you've got it down now you know like what kind of foods it's a the the supplement thing gets strange with vegans you know there's a lot of folks that they're mixing a lot of different dietary yeasts and a lot of different powders and different things and blending these different things and it's some people don't like the way that feels when you're eating like that but it sounds like what you're eating is much more whole food but yeah my - his whole food base like a lot of the foods that I became actually a good cook now because of the fact that I had to learn to cook my own food my wife she was busy become a you know busier in her own doing her own thing so she wasn't able to cook for me like she was before but then I I learned myself and through learning myself it just completely just like took the shackles off of off of me you know right so nice meals yeah so now I I cook a lot of like West Indians tots type of foods because they have a really good vegetarian menu like a lot of chickpeas and things of that nature there's a really good vegetarian Indian place around here that I love Indian food yeah it's really good I haven't gone a month because I've been on this carnivore diet but this this place was fantastic really interesting weird you know vegetable dishes everything's vegetarian you know it's I guess it's with them it's a religious thing a lot of lot of Indians are vegetarians yeah and that's and I like a lot of Indian food just because of that you know and that whole food diet it just it just works for me but like um like you said Vic these supplements like this this makes me like I feel like when I drink this like spirulina and just a lot of greens and even even like the mushrooms you know the course have mushroom the stuff like they have like I just have energy to just go and go and go that lifestyle cycle tincture somebody gave me some of that yeah yes I gotta have them send you some I gotta have you sing some day they send like they have a really nice tincture set that he said now I should have bring it but it has like like has um reishi it has Turkey town lion's mane that cordyceps and and it even gives you you know a schedule on when you should take it and when it when is best for but it's um it's a really really good good mushrooms because you know they they put they infuse theirs with this is kakadu plum so kakadu plum you hear that no its funding they yeah i know as kakadu pub is from australia and it's like one of the most high high in vitamin c fruits there there is like it's way higher than vitamin C than oranges and everything else like that and they caught you lube plum yeah Duplo okay yeah ka ka do you that sounds like something that a little kid right Kakadu plan yeah what but that's I mean they um it's a really really good supplement and I don't really like to recommend supplements too much but that's one that I I take and I'm like man I feel I feel way better off do you eat a lot of beets I do I do I do beets are really beets are supposed to be really good for endurance yeah beets are really good but it's crazy like just eating greens like I've been eating greens I just don't I feel like I don't get tired like I used to like my body's just instantly recovering what was your old diet like what was it like when you're training for a fight would be typical meals be like um it was pretty clean but it was uh I would eat a lot of meat I would eat a lot of meat and and I'm all positive so he's like a lot of red meat and I felt really good when I ate red meat like it felt as if like when I eat red meat it almost felt like I can feel it like within like the next 20 30 minute like that my body brings him down really fast you know yeah so I felt I felt good eating it but I didn't feel like I had the like the endurance I didn't feel the endurance aspect like I do right now you know I'm serious man so that that's been a like the best that I ever felt was when I fought Tito Ortiz I was eating I was eating red meat but I also was coupling that up with a lot of spinach I was eating spinach like I will go and get my bar yeah get a big bag yeah that's exactly what I was doing I get a big bag of spinach and I'll just put it in a blender and just grind it up and then throw like some apples in it to make it a little bit sweeter to change the taste so it wouldn't be so so greenish like grass right and then I would just drink those all the time but it just made me feel so strong interesting interesting now did you used to work with the nutritionist all I did yeah I did I work with because when you were cutting weight like how many fights did you have an 85 to to ID was that too much of a struggle yeah it was too much of a struggle like I'm in a weird position because I'm not I'm not I'm not a very big person I'm not big enough to be a light heavyweight but I'm not small enough to be a middleweight either and I can feel like I can you know like so I was like in that weird weird space I when I cut down to 185 I felt like it felt drained drained I just didn't have the the movement in the pop you know but then at 205 I kind of felt undersized you know back then what did you walk around that back then I was walking around around like 225 230 and what was different because it was from eating the meat yeah from the enemy from me - meow I'll get that alone has got to probably increase your endurance just the loss of that much body mass yeah 20-plus pounds that your body doesn't have to pump blood through yeah about that you know yeah so that just came off naturally when you stopped eating meat yeah and another thing too like I um you know this is another reason why I cuz when I wasn't fighting that was the problem because I would get into these bad eating habits because I would always know that when I had training camp I can just cut the weight and just lose it like that but after a while it just becomes your habit anything you do over time that becomes your habit it becomes your lifestyle and I also eating a lot of sugar a lot of booze and chillin that sounds like man I need to make a change for my life for the rest of my life you know right and that's why this whole lifestyle fit so much better I mean you know do you think that would have changed your career had you eaten this way back when you're competing I think so I think it would have but at the same time I don't I don't know in which way you know to chill yeah yeah so calm now yeah I felt like I was I was what I needed to be at the time I needed to be it you know I see yeah and I feel like there are some aspects of my of my awareness because that's what it would I will call it more than anything I hate to say I'm woke now cuz I hate that whole thing but I feel real woke is great yeah but real woke but you know what it is the problem is people could take it too far and then really it's about getting other people to comply with your idea of yours well then it becomes almost like a religion yeah you just want want people to comply with your ideas about how to speak and how to talk and how to live and exactly you just become a dictator a little woke dictator the idea of like being woke me aware you're you're spiritually cognizant of your effect on people the life that you live and that's all beautiful that's great the problem is it gets abused because people want to pretend that they have virtue so they adopt this woke pattern and then they try to force it on other people and then the fucking annoying and then it pisses other people that maybe like inclined to think that maybe it's good to be kinder be good to be more of and then they hear those fucks and they're like fuck these people I'm gonna vote for Trump again yeah and that's what happened I definitely hear that I hear that because that's what that's how I would I would say it like for me it was more or less just awareness of myself and I didn't really also wear myself but I don't really have the awareness like I didn't like how I it's it's almost at a point where I'm just more cognizant of every single choice that I make you know and and and just and that's something I really didn't didn't care about I really didn't think about before you know and just that awareness right there it it brings a whole new different understanding of life but I was I was like that person when I first woke I'm just like oh man why this person woke and I want to wake up everybody it was the most frustrating thing in the world that that's why I was like you know what I just I won't do it myself that what always happens when people find something interesting like that's what happens in people start doing Crossfit it's happens and people start doing jiu-jitsu they just can't shut the fuck up about it and it happens when people take on you know a new spiritual philosophy yeah they want everybody to understand how they're doing it and that you should do it this way too when people believe in what they're doing they want to want to should want to share it but they also want other people to do it too because if I can convince you to live my way then it validates the way I live because gods woke to now why don't you be will right and there yeah you know and then you start just trying to spread it but I think that I mean everybody has their own awakening you know and if some people may not have that in this life you know they may never they may never have that that awakening but some people are burdened by their environment as well right there's too much stress and anxiety you can't even say space and that's why I even give a nod to the psychedelics in that respect when when if you don't have the ability to have that mental space there is something that can help have you had that you know the insight that somebody who was who was doing all the meditation because all you really need to do is feel it to understand why you need to do it yes and and that's why I was I'm lucky that I was able to feel it so now it's nothing for me to meditate and go to all these you know spiritual practice because I know that is something real but beforehand I was like man that shit is not real you feel an energy huh yeah I mean I used to I used to be one of those guys but until I and I went through it I'm just like you don't know how to understand it well it's hard to see the result you gotta have to trust the process it's hard to see the result before you've experienced it you kind of have to trust the process go through it then something from for me a big one is yoga I'm a big believer in yoga and not just for physical reasons for mental reasons it helps me tremendously and when I don't do it I'm good I'm good like legitimately I should do yoga twice a week because I'm really only good for about three days after yoga class like I need to just really balance out if I was doing it three times a week there's not a thing in the world I could fuck with me yeah and turn mentally I'd be like I'm fine seriously III done I've done the the Bikram yoga and as she was just so hot I didn't I really couldn't focus that's the key though I know that's it that's it wasn't where I am right now she wouldn't tell me so tell me like like when you you go to Bikram oh yeah yeah well Mike my place is not affiliated with Bikram anymore okay because he's uh yeah got arrested for some scumbag er II he's he's actually been arrested and I don't think he could come to America I think that's the thing I think he's kind of like stayin hiding it is a problem it really is a problem when any one person has that much influence over so many people particularly a male having so much influence over females that worship him especially if you're a scumbag and he there's a thing about this he did not invent those postures and he didn't even invent that sequence he brought it to America and he popularized doing it in in in very hot rooms the benefits though forget him take him out of the equation because there's so many people that practice it and they've had incredible benefits from it it's it's really unfortunate that it's connected to this very controversial individual because then people associate Bikram yoga with this guy that's been you know accused of multiple sexual assaults and rapes and all these different things but you take that away from him as a human being and the people that practice it what they get from it first of all you know exactly what you're gonna do every day there's 26 postures and two breathing exercises one breathing exercise in the beginning 26 postures one breathing exercise the end it's 90 minutes it's 90 minutes and 105 degrees and it's fucking brutal and I did it right before I got here I do it and I'd like to do in the mornings first thing in the morning I do it before I've eaten anything I go through a nine minute yoga class I really like doing it that way and then at the end of the day I have a couple different places that I do it and I'd like to mix it up but that hot yoga for me is the way to go because first of all it's I know the postures they all they're all serve a purpose in terms of like helping my body helping my balance just keeping my flexibility strengthening my joints there's so many really positive physical benefits from it and then to the meditation aspect of it because no matter what kind of bullshit I have going on in my life if I just breathe and think about the exercise and then you know my brain starts racing and I'll forget what I'm doing and I'll start thinking mother shit but I bring it back bring it back bring it back breathe just breathe you not going anywhere for 90 minutes you locked in this room literally the door's locked when the class starts so I am just breathing and going through these and I know that I can get through it because I've done a thousand times before just breathe and get through it and there's a cleansing of like all the your brain there's like residual there's residue of like shitty thoughts bouncing around inside your brain anxieties and fears and regrets and anger and frustration and all this shit that's in your head that just gets in the way of clear thinking it gets in the way of being able to see things in an objective beneficial way and be able to see things the way other people seem as well like sometimes I you know I have a issue I think a lot of people do but I don't see how other people are seeing things I see how I see I see things and then I go okay well let me let me look at it from their way let me just abandon oh well they're fucking wrong that's wrong abandon all that shit and try to look at it from other people's ways I feel like what yoga does for me is it allows me to be free it allows me to clean up all my preconceived notions and clean out all my misconceptions and just see things see things for how they are and I always feel better always say I gotta try it oh it's the best especially now that you're on this vegan diet I'm telling you you're on that path anyway Yoga is it's just so good for straighten your fucking head out man I always wanted to try to that Kundalini Yoga that's the shit that's supposed to make you trip yeah I've had a bunch of friends do it they said my friend Denny he's done it and had like Syria and he's done DMT - he's like dude it's the same goddamn thing you have full-blown visions you have full-blown psychedelic visions yeah that's the thing like it like when I like when I do like the DMT I don't have like I don't have a it's weird I don't have like those visions those visions okay that's because you're doing five methoxy dimethyltryptamine the visions come from N and I'm s a totally different thing I've done it I've done it before there you've done NN yeah then you have no visions um you know I have visions it's kind of like it's just like silly things though sometimes like I like I've seen like one time I did it I've seen like this half like it was like oh I I awakened I'm in place and I'm just with these three massive beings like tall as a building and they were like half human and they were half snake and I got a snake from the waist down and they had another human from the waist up but I had like a snake face oh yeah and that's that was one of the divisions that I had what do you think that represented I don't know but it was a weird because during that experience it was like they were all like I was all three of them were staring at me not and they were looking down and then one of them reached for me and then I started going up and then I started going around their body and then I went around the body and then as I was going around the body every once in a while I would see the face of of it and it would like open up like a Cobra and then it will close but it wasn't scary it wasn't terrifying and I went all the way over the body and it was like I was able to see from another angle like me up in the body and and then it like opened me up like a like a like a flower or something like that it was weird and then my trip went like super super fast so you definitely have had visions yeah I just can't can't quite make out like what it what's it supposed to be yeah what's this part I had a bunch of Joker's giving me the finger the last time a bunch of jesters like jesters nothing like that it was ridiculous there are like machine fuck fuck you like circling me like infinite numbers of God it basically the feeling that I got was like I took myself too seriously and these these gestures we're just going fuck you like you don't like that you don't like when someone goes fuck you know and so they were going fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you and there were like but they weren't saying the words but they were definitely giving you the finger but there was like an infinite number of gesture surrounding me come give me like this vibrating finger it was and I was like oh but but it was clear what they were saying like hey bitch she take yourself too seriously and then I was like okay you're right you're right and once I would say you're right they're like not at me like mm-hmm okay see that's what I like I like to be able to work like that's work yeah it's work right they're like you win you win and you work through something you know yes yes which I think when you work too hard at something and you're trying to achieve something like often times you think very highly of yourself like that's what you like I should you know my Netflix specials gonna be the shit I'm gonna this is going to be the best one I've ever done I'm gonna fucking show everybody how good this is and and they're like fuck fuck fuck fuck you all right yeah you're right you're right this is silly that's like I'm just alive for a certain amount of time and I shouldn't think that way I mean there's part of you that gets trapped in thinking that way because you're trying to do something but you don't have to think that way to do the thing right you know yeah so that's the thing like um like those visions and being able to it like when I did ayahuasca I didn't have any visions man I didn't have anything like I had I had a I got into a pretty pretty good space but I wasn't like I didn't have like the typical teaching lessons everybody else has when they do something that seems like you probably didn't get a strong enough dose no I know I did you did I did three large two large cups the thing is with that and I'm speaking just from people talking to me about it cuz I've only done the pure DMT I haven't done the ayahuasca ever deny Alaska people say that a lot of these people that are making it they're not make either they're not making it correctly or they're making a light dose because they're worried about Gringo's going crazy and you know and they don't want to be responsible for that shit so I know people that have gone and they've had these experiences where they've done it with someone in America or someone who's done through a more commercial sort of organization and it wasn't really that strong or profound and then they when did it with someone who was real someone who's making some fucking super high-grade you know 97 octane shit oh fuck that's what I mean because I feel I feel like after that I felt like like damn I must be I must be broke man I must be broken like I can't like I can't even feel the the damn ayahuasca but it it was it brought like it didn't it didn't give me experience I I wanted it but it gave me the experience that I needed mmm you know and that's and that's something that I I got after I was like over the disappointment of it was like you know what I didn't get what I wanted but I definitely got what I needed you know because whenever you sitting in circle in the stuff like that it's always an amazing cathartic thing where you just kind of just like shit and just go through those emotions and just watching other people just be so wrong with their emotions and just kind of feeling that you know just just through symbioses you kind of like start to feel like the work come through you you know that's that's how I felt anyways now are you working a lot with fighters now are you working with young fighters are you doing in any official capacity or you're just doing it because you're at the gym um I I just do I just train it cuz I'm at the gym but I like to I like to Train off the guys when I'm in there because I go I go I can go out to get pace and I don't I don't mind they they hate me up a little bit you know and I and I will give them a look at some of the training partners you know mm-hmm won't give them so yeah I enjoy that aspect of it but I haven't been like oh you know I'm gonna gonna come in here I haven't dedicated myself to someone's fool camp you know one of the reasons why I say there's a lot of people that are talked to that have trained with you and work with you one of the things that I really like about you is your guidance is that you're a guy that they could sit down and talk to about things and you have a very learned and wise perspective and that could be especially with you know you consider your successful career that could be like very beneficial for young fighters coming up and I just wanted to know like had you ever thought about becoming a trainer yeah I think about all time and I I work with some fighters now like I have this team out of Michigan is mercy team murciélago that Ohio coach Mike King of my Regas he's like the head guy there but him and I work together we try to bring some of the fighters out and try to get them to like the bigger shells and stuff like that but those fighters you know I work with a lot you know my godson is one of those fighters there devin Smith you know and and I work with him and trying to get him to just you know not only fight at a certain level but mentally bring himself to a certain level you know and you know he's always hated cuz he's always like man you always try to be like like my yo to try to give me a message no I'm not trying to be Yoda I'm just trying to say I just want to tell you know yeah cuz because one time he hit me up he's like he's like aw man I'm ready to come down I'm ready to Train I'm like okay you ready to come to Train I'm like all right so have you been training and he's like no and I'm like so what makes you think it's gonna be different if you come and train with me I mean you still have to Train and he's like I better get to the gym oh that's one of the weirdest conversations I've ever had with people that go you know what man if I trained I think I'd be a fuckin world champion like okay I don't even know where to start with that right I don't even know what to say there okay if I meditated I think I could see through walls I'm not gonna meditate though what does that mean I know people have weird ways of looking at themselves you know where they just decide they're special without putting in any work you know like they decide there's something about them that makes them different yeah and they want that to be the case but they don't want to work towards it it's a weird trap that you seen young people where they just convince themselves is something significant about them you know and that's a real problem with young guys that get into fighting that have a delusional perspective and they'll accept fights they shouldn't accept yeah so like I'll fight that motherfucker I think I has thirty fights you have one you're crazy you know but that I think that I see that more with with the kids and it's this next generation just because we're such a voyeuristic community I mean society now I'm gonna think now people just see somebody that oh yeah I can I can do that but not really realizing like you said all the guts that go into yeah what make them good at what they do well there's there's lessons that are out there if you just here's a great lesson Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather one guy has zero pro boxing matches one guy's the greatest of all time yeah and somehow another they sold this on this thing and we all paid money me included and we've watched this fight that was exactly how any expert would tell you it's gonna go down Floyd's gonna fuck him up there's another one there maybe even more egregious one because at least Conor McGregor was a world champion combat sports athlete you know a wicked fighter there was a lion fight where they had lured Zilla do you know Lord Zilla is oh he's a motherfucker this Thai dude he's a motherfucker and he fought this dude with zero pro Muay Thai fights I think Laird's illa has 300 more Thai fights and he fought this dude and played with him and then head kicked him into another dimension but he had kicked him off the front leg just what dude folded it's a crazy it's a crazy setup like that as I don't know I think maybe he had another opponent and that opponent got injured dropped out then this MMA fighter decided to try his hand at Muay Thai so he jumped in there in a Muay Thai fight against arguably one of the greatest more Thai fighters alive let you should watch lured zilla's highlight-reel first of all he's super elusive he's unusually elusive fighter but he hit this motherfucker with a left high kick just off the front leg just whipped it up off the front leg and caught him on the chin holding him and I was like that who ever said yes to that fight whatever Commission allowed that fight to take place you guys should have to go to trial like someone should show much should sit down with you and go how the fuck did you allow this to take place that's it that sounds crazy it's zero pro fights versus 300 I mean maybe he didn't have 300 maybe at 260 for some crazy show like that please learn Zilla I mean learn Zilla is a famous Muay Thai fighter oh you find it yeah here it is oh that's the dude after he got crumpled we go go before that go before that so you could watch I mean large zilla's just fucking him up from the beginning and credit to the dude for thinking he could take the fight and step it up but it alert Zilla basically just this fucking guy you can tell the look on his face he just playing with him yes well lured zillah's brilliant man look at that guy look at then that was one knockdown he can about today yeah he knocked him out after that he knocked my watch his front leg teep watch it smack oh my yeah Folsom there's a complete total mismatch like if that dude was doing that in sparring to that guy everyone would be mad at him everybody be like hey man this guy's not on your level don't fuck him up yeah take it light on him be nice look it steep smack oh Mike hands down not worried about shit playing with them and the whole fights like that though and learn Zilla is a beast man he's fun to watch he's ready and kick was light and fast lightning fast and then no wind up no switch just cracks them in the face with it he's brilliant that guy's brilliant but that's a crazy mismatch so a guy could say I'll fucking fight this guy someone needs to grab you go hey man no no you think you can hit the bag you think you can hit hard you think you could do all these things you're about to get in there with a master a guy who has mastered this one particularly brutal combat sport don't do that as nothing is nothing worse than when you're in a match when you feel that damn outmatched by somebody I was uh I was doing jujitsu and I think I was going with the Hodge or Gracie and I almost felt like I was doing pretty I was like I feel like I'm pretty alright and then when I went with him he was just on me and it was just like just toying with me you know like I feel like I couldn't make a right move and I'm just like man it's the worst then he got on top of me and normally if I get on somebody like I can hold him down pretty well but it was just a different level and I was like wow yeah those old-school guys like Roger Gracie salut Berra jean dre who Sean de barro those guys have that pressure top game there's something about that old-school jujitsu pressure game you know but solos a master at that you know Sean G's a master that Raphael Lovato's mastered that that smashing pressure game but Hajer is not just a master that he's also like his physical attributes he's so long no halt yeah oh that longness and he knows he's smush he's got he's got like you know with that long leverage that non strength oh yeah oh man that's right it's a different kind of strength than somebody long and tall it's wrong oh my gosh well that's a big advantage John House yes you see John use that on people yeah that long strength is the best grappling strength it's like those guys that have that I feel like that body that John Jones body is a perfect body for MMA because he's strong he's tall he's tall and thin but he's also strong as fuck like he's muscled enough but he also has that extra length yeah and his legs are perfect to this Guinea at the end he could go down and get really skinny so they're really fast - yeah I'm just watching okay so like man he's doing those legs like it's effortless you know his calves are ridiculous they don't even make sense right how are those on your body shoulders his shoulders are massive little calves like wow what's going on here and it kicks the hell out of crazy and there hasn't been many people that have been able to exploit the fact those calves are so small they have really build you would think that like with every but this trend and calf kicks Thiago Santos tried it he hit him with some good ones for sure but John figures it out eventually and then he just starts checking them he checked most of them against Dominic most of those low cal kicks he checked them how did you saw him come how do you check a little lower leg kick because that's that's turned turned out you know turned out he just made it so that he was going Shin shin uh they weren't shin a lot yeah see you know it's real hard to check though and it's really hard to check it's also real hard to just take you could take those thigh kicks if you're conditioned was a little bit and just and just like you said like he had to make a choice to take it how he wanted it yeah I still taken the shot right still on chin to chin yeah it's that much in addition but they're both feeling it that's the difference they're both feeling it when you get when you get the meaty part of that bone part that's when you get that so I had that's that's when you you shut Mike Chandler did the key had no choice his leg was I nope no two in the second fight with Mighty Mouse yeah your nerve just shuts off your foot doesn't work it's numb this is a try to stand on the shit just collapses the Chandler fight they were trying to tell him his legs broken and he's like I'm fucking fine leave me alone you know and I think that fight should not have been stopped I think you got to give but the referee should know and the doctor should know this is what happens you just give it a few minutes to recover the kid even if he can survive the onslaught during that time his leg will come back and I think in Chandler probably would have and Sahu toe it did so who don't figured out how to just sort of shuck and jive with Mighty Mouse and I don't think Mighty Mouse knew the extent that his leg was numb but it but it recovered when you get hit like that though for a second you like this motherfuckers cheating like you feel like because it hurts so bad and it's very rare to have something that hurts you immediately in MMA like there's there's not many strikes that can hurt you immediately right that's that's one of them that hurt you that nerve yeah you feel it immediately isn't it weird that that went on forever until Benson Henderson started doing it to people yeah he was the first in MMA in my opinion at a high level to start chopping at those lower legs real low real low like right above the ankle we fucked people up with that you look yogi with those but now that is like that is the move everybody's doing it now it's a stapler it's funny how MMA does it though and goes all these cycles now yeah nothing people are really starting to find a home for those those oblique kick that job yes yes that Winkeljohn camp there weird though because if you graze off it leaves you in a weird place mm-hmm because you you're kind out your foots turned outward and you can get hit with punches you you're in a weird punching range where you're not in a good stance to fire back right because your foot is sort of pronated outside it's um it's a great kick though you know who fucking throws the shit out of that lorenz larkin he throws that shit to the body when he fought Neil Magny he threw that oblique kick to the body and I was like oh my goodness that mah fucking kick though he could kick when he went okay I'm just like oh my god yeah he's so fast - oh my god yeah he I was really interested to see how he was gonna do over in Bellator you know in there but then he had that crazy war with Paul Daley you can't get in a war with Paul Daley no that dudes left hand is one of the best weapons in the sport period he got that one hitter he has that left hands ridiculous it's crazy right it's crazy this is there's certain guys that just have that like Rumble Rumble and now he's gonna come back as a heavyweight he's yeah and he's looking good he's in training he's in training now engine Rumble versus Dominic Reyes how about that how about that how about that Rumble scares the fuck out of everybody like you might beat him but you also might get knocked into another dimension because he he gets what he hits like my god like when I mean he's been my training partner for the longest time and he knows like my rumble you know don't don't help me you know I go crazy I go crazy and we train we train smart but I mean there's a couple times he hit me I'm like man I'm not your friend you fucking talk to me I told you it'd be like that when he knocked out Glover with one punch I was like holy shit to share I know that's crazy and it's the thing about his punches is like you can't really gauge how like you don't know which one is gonna be that shot because it kind of yeah they come and he likes it moves his hands around a lot - well yeah yes you don't know which one is gonna be the one to talk to you yeah and they come from all angles here he is in shape now he's been training with hoofed he looks good he looks gigantic it's so hard to believe that guy was ever 170 I am so baffled so how the fuck he made that wait so this is over at the new gym Stanford look at it man just so what is the new gym called it's called gets called Stanford this he has called Stanford him it may now okay and who's who's running that it's the same same people is is Henry Henry hoof Sandford yes Sandford no T Sandford them and they yeah and so it's all the black zillion guys yep all the bikes villian guys look at that Rory and Robbie longer training together there now yeah Rory's always been here getting some work in the last couple weeks how long is this gym been around for ah man this so this is H kickboxing okay just has a different name yeah just different name so we just now moved into the gym on a more consistent basis it looks beautiful yeah I mean they it's been a I think like a couple million on it they'd they spent some money on that gym and this is in the same place as the web Blackzilians was the same area same area yeah yeah so we had we had the black zillion gym and then we went to a gym that's that was at this dislike amusment park for kids it was like it's called extreme action Park and that's what we had a section that we we had there and then they also added this gym too so now they're gonna have they're gonna keep that gym that at extreme action Park but also keep this one South Florida man what a hotbed from martial arts right it really is so much jiu-jitsu down there man you can yeah you got cyborg street and cyborg is amazing and you know Mario Sperry not too far down what happened with Mario cuz Mario was the head coach for a while of the Blackzilians right and he was inspirational fuck I will give those speeches and I was like ooh I get goosebumps yeah Mario was the best I just think that him and um hemming Glyndon didn't work out when it came time to it and all the work in chemistry together you know because that that was that that was the hardest thing because you know having all those different coaches in and trying to not only have them get along with the fighters but then have them get along with each other and nothing try to fight for that you know who's the main coach and who's the main guy you know and that's you know coaches sometimes that bigger Eagles than the fighters right and sometimes is more deadly because they they they're they're not accomplished and a lot of times they're they're coaching because they don't feel that accomplishment you know so then coaching becomes that thing that they they want to be validated for right right and you know it's so hard to find that balance and the ones who find it they're so cherished the guys like Mark Henry the guys like Trevor Wittman you know I mean those those FRA Sahabi Duke Rufus those coaches that are like legit coaches that everybody loves man they're so Irish they are so valuable because also for a fighter like Trevor Whitman's holding pads for you like holy fuck I'm training with Trevor motherfucking Whitmer you know I mean there's something to that if you go to Montreal and you're in ferocity em you like holy shit that is for raw sahabi talking to me absolutely but there's some power is that how you start to believe it you start have anything is saying he tells you're good you're good outstanding excellent it frost you said that yeah yeah it's crazy man to see like where he's like for us I remember when he wasn't even a coach he was just a fighter like we're not like when I first started going to Montreal he wasn't the coach yet he was really still he was still fighting yeah wow I'm still fighting he's such a good coach he is phenomenal he's such a genius person when you talk to him so he's always recommending books and shed he's always recommending listen to this guy because he told me about a competitive shooter what is that guy's name lamby lamby the guy who wrote that the winning mindset anyway he were lamby I have the book at home that I've been reading lately where the fuck is it dammit I can't remember anyway point is he's always recommending me shit he's always got something something interesting that he's been paying attention to that he can relate to MMA into fighting and he's he's very very keenly aware of the mental battles that are going on and how much visualization is important and meditating Lani Bassam lamby Bassam yeah guy was a competitive target shooter and he spent more time practicing in his head and he did practicing wow more time visualizing that works that really does work does something because when I was like I said when I was hurt for the rampage fight like I was in training camp I would I would do visual eyes a lot how would you do it I would just sit there and I was just kind of like I will go through moves in my mind and I'll go through techniques and I would just kind of go over and over again the techniques in my mind I'll also do scenarios where I fight and most every single situation like I find myself you know losing and then finding a way to come back after I've been rocked you know he was trying to find out myself just mentally working through it mentally working on through it uh almost every single fight like I'll go round by round really yeah going round by round and I'll just like okay I'll set up the scenario okay I'll come on I catch them with the punch and then I'm just imagining what happens after that and then I put myself in adversity adversary' adversity every single time I can as much as I can so then that way I find myself always you know I get myself out of adversity sometimes I just find myself just smoking them but as always these different mental mental games and me just doing something executing and always just doing it right so it's almost like you were fighting without having a fight yeah you were getting the experience of fighting in your head by just visualizing would you set a certain amount of time that you would do it um nah I would just I would just I would just go with the flow you know I had my wrestling coach in college Tom Minko he was always he was always on like I was out like I get nervous I get nervous I don't know what to do with nervousness and he says well he says you nervous because you thinking too much about about about it he said just just think about executing don't think about the outcome just think about executing your technique and just only think about executing your technique and how it feels to complete the perfect execution of the technique when you hit the pad and it hits that and it sounds that you know they hear that pop you know how does that feel you know become attached to how you feel when you execute something mmm and then that's what you start to base your fight off of you know how you feel when you execute versus all the things that can happen if something goes wrong hmm yeah it's it's really interesting to see the different strategies that people employ in order to like focus the mind you know so many different fighters have different ways of doing it some fighters like to meditate some fighters like to shadowbox their way through scenarios almost like they are thinking about how the fights gonna go down while they're like slow motion doing things you

so nervous that I'll be like oh my god I just don't want to freeze out there just don't run trees you know so I would like that's that's part of the reason why I started twisting my nipples twist my nipples before the fight and that was just to kind of do something stupid and silly right but then it would allow me to just kind of relax I'm like well I'm not gonna embarrass myself any worse than that [Laughter] I remembered always wanting to ask you about yeah do that I was just doing just like you know I'm not embarrass myself worse than that George you should do that should - George would
