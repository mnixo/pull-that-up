we Shane Carwin going Shane Carwin 'he's going arisin ok yeah he couldn't take it no more this I was he's like fucking I guess he wants to have some fun while he's still Shane Carwin I salute that he could still hit harder than he did did you see that jason ellis fight do you see what crazy jason ellis did jason ellis fought Shane Carwin with one hand tied up well Shane Carwin has his right hand tied up to his body and so Jason ELLs like you don't realize how big Shane Carwin is like Jason else is not the tiniest guy you know he's probably about 200 pounds who and he's standing next to Shane Carwin it is almost comical how look at this look how big Carlin is I mean he's a giant he's a fucking giant he's got one arm tied up look at this and he looks good dude like physically he looks jacked like he hasn't fought in a while but obviously he's been working out I mean he looks better than he did the last time I saw him the last time I saw him he was recovering from some injuries and he was still in the UFC so apparently he's a free agent and I think you know he's he's fighting for rising I'm pretty sure I mean I know he put it on his Instagram page but uh he ko it a man he it's really kind of wrong look that was one that was one punch that he hit him with that wasn't even the punch that that ko time is it know that that was like at the end of a round I think see this is where Kyoto right here so that was the second one I mean that one really can I'm like he could see when he was down he was like fuck I mean that guy is so goddamn big Carlin's a gigantic human so they were talking about setting him up with fate or like fate or versus Carlin I don't know if that's gonna happen but if that does I'm in I'm in I'm paying to see that that's a dangerous fight for fader now was Russia super dangerous Raja pan it's essentially the same guy who is a charge of pride for a while yeah and I believe so and so if he goes over in fights if Carlin goes over in fights in Japan he fights phaidor that's a giant fight he's last time Fredo fought fought Fabio Maldonado and barely squawk by a fight a lot of people thought that he should have lost he got hurt Fabian Maldonado tagged him and there's no shame in that Fabio Mountain aah Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer he rocked Glover Teixeira before Glover finished him off and it's just tough as shit he's a tough tough guy they always call that poor guy in like they always yeah Fabio's like who are we gonna get go fight them who'll be this fucking wacky to fight our short notice Fabio marvel remember how he saved that fight in you know in Brazil somewhere he fought steep a and heavyweight steep a Miocic when steep a is just fucking tearing through the ranks right steep Bay's trying to get a shot at the title he fights Fabio Maldonado I just I mean steep they just ran through him it was horrific now steep a scary guy as a heavyweight and Fabio Maldonado just was not the same size just what did not belong in there with him you know just too big too strong too fast it's too hard it was a scary fight but when you think about Fabio rock and phaidor and hurt him in his last fight and you think good lord what if he gets hit by car one like car what car one takes a great shot and he hits harder than anybody in the division he's probably he's probably one of the scariest heavyweight punchers ever like literally ever when he fought Mir I remember he tied me up in a clinch and just ripped uppercuts to his chin in his face and put him down and just beat him down on the ground like Carwin could fuck and punch scary puncher man so if he's healthy like he looks like in that video it looks fucking healthy to me and he looks huge he looks he's like well over 260 yeah I don't know if they there I don't know if that's the kind of fighting to this stage of his life you know after he fought Maldonado he might be looking to fight smaller heavyweights he might be looking to fight bigger names well actually Carmen's pretty goddamn big name as far as the free market but who knows what's gonna happen man you know with one of the crazy things with all these new organizations whether it's one Fc whether it's uh you know fill in the blank Bellator rise in all these other like everyone is scrambling to pick up anybody who leaves the UFC so if people's contracts are up like they're starting to do and they start bolting over and going to these other different organizations stuff can get crazy like things can heat up and you might see like another Pride UFC type rivalry which I think would be great for everybody like if risin really does take off like if risin puts on phaidor versus Shane Carwin and then they come up with a bunch of other crazy fights for the undercard you know just there's just not right now the same level of talent available outside the UFC not right now but man it's been close a few times and it used to be you know obviously it used to be with pride I just it's hard making something like that happen you know I feel with like a Shane Carwin for example Shane Colin was a great fighter he hasn't thrown a punch in how many years he hasn't fought MMA since I want to say it's two years ago - three years in my world I don't know no I'm not the professional here but I think the UFC marketing would know if they could do something with a Shane Carwin if they they passed on maybe there's something they could do the heavyweight division is packed I don't know I don't know mmm business yeah you know I feel like when a fighter hasn't fought more than a year or two or maybe even three I think about comedy Joe Rogan and I think about if I just did into one economy over three years what would I be ready for what would you you didn't do any County for three years what would you honestly book yourself for in fucking December it's October 31st what would you book yourself one descent the garden you know you do like laughing skull in Atlanta okay a nice cool intimate little room very quiet yeah I did learn cedar you know what Shane might not have a lot of money and the Rison might have offered him a big channel understand all these parameters but I'm saying to you was you know it's like the GSP thing that was going on maybe they weren't what they were and I think even has a finer to three years shit is fucking changed yes yes and nothing changed yes and no here's the no depends on if you're still training see if you decide to take some time off because you have nagging injuries or some fighters like that Joseph Valtellina guy were talking about earlier he stepped back because of concussion syndrome because he was getting you know he had too many hits to the head and so he recognized it was having some real symptoms and he said no I have to resign so he gave up his belt and taking two or three years off if you're having any sort of real problem maybe if you got a recurring back injury which I know Shane had some training that yes so maybe taking that time off so Junior dos Santos was his last loss and that was UFC 131 and Wow 2011 so that's five fucking years ago fucking fatal I love him to death you know I caught the tail end of a dog mm-hmm you know I quite liked the two fights before he got on board right by a boy well he got armed Bart first and you saw the fights that he won before that yeah like to fight yeah he beat Brett Rogers and then I think the next fight after Brett Rogers already sure was fur dunes I didn't catch phaidor in his heyday as one tribe right so the last couple times I went it was like how people said they wanted to they went to whites Hicks at the end they got a little excited went down so and then he got submitted by for doom for Doom which you and I discussed he this could fucking be doom for him he's got a nasty guard there's another guy we're talking about yeah nasty guard yeah so then I saw a couple pieces of the the last fight that was fucking embarrassing mm-hmm that was both of them by the FOB you I love I love his fucking jaw that he takes to fight at short notice and and then he fought that Indian gentleman before that yeah so but if a toe I mean now you just wanna exploit the guy mm-hmm and that's how people get hurt I don't did afraid all wants to fight if he would he for fucking years and he killed was killing people and all of a sudden he didn't fight for a while he wants to make it come back I don't know his brother got out of jail his brother just got out of jail is that true yeah okay I did read that we could ready to fight yes you're doing Ethelbert push-ups yeah and working out in jail still come out jacked I don't new tattoos I like he wants to fight I want him to be able to fight just like I wanted him to be able to fight when he was 20 I want to deal the fight when he's 40 if he wants to why not
