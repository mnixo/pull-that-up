the Joe Rogan experience that's another thing you keep saying aim low enough have a low enough bar why do you why do you mean that well let's say you've got a kid and you want the kid to improve you don't set them a bar that's so high that it's impossible for them to attain it you take a look at the kid and you think okay this kid's got this range of skill here's a challenge we can throw at him or her that exceeds their current level of skill but gives them a reasonable probability of success and so like I'm saying it tongue-in-cheek to some degree you know it's like but if you're but I'm doing it as an aid to humility it's like well I don't know how to start improving my life someone might say that and I would say well you're not aiming low enough there's something you could do that you are regarding is trivial that that you could do that you would do that would result in an actual improvement but it's not a big enough improvement for you so you won't lower yourself enough to take the opportunity incremental steps yes and so this is also what is achieved through exercise it's one of the most important well what do you do when you go and lift weights you know going like if you haven't bench press before you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar and dropped it and drop the bar through your skull right I know you think look when I started working out when I was a kid I was I was wait about a hundred and thirty pounds and I was six foot one it's a thin kid and I smoked a lot I wasn't in good shape I wasn't in good physical shape and I went to the gym and it was bloody embarrassing you know people would come over and help me with the goddamn weights here's how you're supposed to use this you know it was humiliating and maybe I was pressing 65 pounds or something at that point you know but what am I gonna do I'm gonna lift up 150 pounds and injure myself right off the bat no I had to go in there and strip down and put my skinny goddamn self in front of the mirror and think son-of-a-bitch there's all these monsters in the gym who've been lifting weights for ten years and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off the bar tough luck for me but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't fair very long until I could lift 75 and well you know how it goes but and I never injured myself when I was late lifting and the reason for that was I never pushed myself past where I knew I could go and I pushed myself a lot you know I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about three years in university I kind of had to quit because I was eating so goddamn much I couldn't stand it so evening like six meals a day it was just taking up too much time but there's a humility in determining what it is that the wretched creature that you are can actually manage aim low and I don't mean don't aim and I don't mean don't aim up but you have to accept the fact that you can set yourself a goal that you can attain and there's not going to be much glory in it to begin with because if you're not in very good shape the goal that you could a could attain tomorrow isn't very glorious but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing and it beats the hell out of bitterness and it's way better than blaming someone else it's way less dangerous and you could do it and what's cool about it there's a statement in the New Testament that's called the Matthew principle an economist use it to describe how the economy in the world works to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken it's like what's very pessimistic in some sense because it means that as you start to fail you fail more and more rapidly but it also means that as you start to succeed you succeed more and more rapidly and so you take an incremental step and well now you can lift 55 pounds instead of 52 point 5 pounds you think well what the hell is that it's like it's one step on a very long journey and so it's it and it starts to compound on you so a small step today means puts you in a position to take a slightly bigger step for the next day and then that puts you in a position to take a slightly bigger step the next day and you do that for two or three years man you're starting to stride everyone who's fighting in these older leagues or if they if golden boy if that's just thing to do like these this Master League everyone fighting that League better pray to the MMA gods Vitor Belfort does not enter that fucking thing juice to the gills oh yes you better looks amazing fantastic that fuck out of all those old dudes at the same time dude I was against Graham the other day I was like oh my god yeah do something happens to Vitor when he fills up with super unleaded dude it's like he's butter and jelly he's a different words bro like some people don't don't don't do well with Roy to get all fried and shit he looks great his skins vibrant his tits are poppin he's all tan his teeth get wider he's doing straight testosterone he's not mean when he was on see think about this right we know for sure we all know absolutely 100% the people have cheated and taken steroids and got away with it we know that I know we know that especially in fighting especially when the the weigh-ins were the only day you had a pee yeah there was no random so they didn't just come by we know for a fact but when you watch someone who's just doing testosterone and what else he's doing with a human growth hormone and fucking gigantic now I love that I love it too but what you get there it's a different thing like for vitor like something happens with him like when you when they allowed him to take it like during the Rockhold fight and the miss pink fight dude his body ate it up but that's a it's a kind of a different thing all right first of all under control I was always a happy kid and but not really because I was always confused about the death of my father hmm so that always had a little certain happiness you know but I always had the Catholic faith I was really raised Catholic always believed he wasn't happened and he was in that box when my mom did the things so he's the pain a little bit then my mother's death was just fucking horrifying and that broke the central nervous system a belief system that broke your belief in the world how can there be a God that takes a mother away from a child when you're 16 and you wrapped that around your head there's not a good result it's not gonna be a result so how I lashed out was by robbing you that was the only weapon I had no world was to rob you Joe Rogan fucked to me this studio would get robbed and lit on fucking fire and Joe knew with me and what the posi gonna do I'm with carmine the fuck you gonna do they call the cops it's Karma who's gonna answer the phone next time don't fuck with me you'll know next time not to fuck with me when I tell you to give me that gram of coke and I'll pay on Friday you'll fucking give it to me all right cuz that's what it was it was simple shit like that right like Joe give me hundred bucks right bro Joey I don't have my hundred bucks okay then I rob your fucking house shoot him the hundred bucks you know I was lashing out at the fucking world right number two the other issue I had is I lost a child I lost a job I was not ready for that child at all I loved that little girl with all my heart but I was not ready for her at all my intentions were good but the result was not gonna be well I was not ready and because I lost that child having no contact with that child it makes me the better father than I am today this is never gonna happen to me to get it do you understand me yeah I see I see there we see the daughters of comics we've seen daughters of comics and sons of comics and they're fucking lost you know I don't want my daughter to be fucking lost and that's stupid Ian in that world you know you have to be there we have to be there dude and cocaine oh go back to that vest story man so well here's what happened so I you know I would get I would do some cocaine a thousand put on these different vests did you barn you I don't know I spent too much on him but I would probably say the priciest one I had was probably about $210 nice am yeah and so I would get fucked up and put these vests on and put on sunglasses and not let no like Buffalo Bill shit but at least partying by myself you know and one time I was making a smoothie you know cuz I you know I have I got like I knew I'm gonna what kind of blender it is but it's pretty nice and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up I'm party and you know I'm living high on the haul road to vests on maybe right and I thought I thought I heard something outside right which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going right so I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway lock myself out with the blender going more in coked up out of my brain I have to go to my landlord dude right down the hall and tell him like hey man during the more oh my god he must have hated you oh the blender shorts out and smoke happens the fire huh along starts going off in the building right as I'm at his door knocking right so now he's pissed and he's like what's going on and I didn't know what to say I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party dude it was fucking into January how old were you at the time huh two and a half years ago so he comes back to my apartment oh my god man but that's it it was fine oh my god no that was fun how long did you live there for I still live there whoa yeah we pass huh you know like I've caught him doing some things how long you been sober for two years in two weeks it'll be two years what was the big thing were you like I gotta get my shit together you doubt was going on opium Jim when hoping Jim Norton had a radio show it's serious and it was actually on it's on Ari's that show that he had this is not happening and I ended up doing coke all night driving a taxi I was in a taxi the driver is dude Luigi got me an escort I didn't want to escort we're doing cocaine in like Harlem or something north-holland the cab driver doing coke and I just had I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel and so we end up off on this other excursion next you know I'm driving the taxi he's in the back with the hooker it's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at you know 6:30 or something so I get to the radio and I can't even talk and uh and Darryl strawberry's the other guest right who's the baseball player who also had drug problem but he's like 13 years soberin so it was this weird moment where like I thought I was kind of cool but then here's a man who like I'd always in my head maybe somewhere thought oh that guy's like a cokehead looking here he is eloquent put together successful and Here I am I can't even talk and I'm with two men that I admire you know opening Jim Norton just to be honored to be on the show you know and so I was like this is um I'm not making choices like there's some there's some unevenness here you know and so what did you do after that twenty twelve step program joined 12-step program yeah and then so yeah so I've been in that then it since then it has helped me out you know [Applause]
