join my day Joe Rogan podcast my night all day like I would love to watch tyron woodley vs Demian Maia love it I would love to watch it now being dad that to me is maybe one of the most interesting fights on the horizon finish so far Demian Maia has been able to take down wrestlers exam 70 he's been able to take them all down yeah like easy and just the beautiful technique and but K do that that would leash ends you gotta go you gotta go through the storm yeah the storm of fucking meteors coming your way that would lead ROPS on you yeah cuz he's the most dangerous in that first round and when you're you're trying to take him down you're closing the distance on him and you haven't like figured out how fast he is yet he's not he doesn't just hit hard he's fucking fast I saw some just rumor I'm sure but bisman was talking about it him and Woodley agreeing to a super fight at 180 really Bisbing and Woodley really yeah when did they agree to this uh house talk to my brother smarten he's like you see Woodley and Bisbing want to do that catch weight at 180 like that's an interesting fight first of all convince me make that healthy that's what I was thinking because I feel like when fives a tough cut for him everyone used to fight 205 oh yeah when the Holmes my 205 no wow that's an interesting fight well I think what what Woodley wants is that big payday he's like look I'm not yeah I mean he's campaigning for it look at this Mike Bisbee and Thailand Woodley agreed to catchweight bout this is legit so it just happened today that's on the internet what is the name of the Young's internet low kick mm a calm interesting that's Bisbing to Instagram entry very interesting very interesting so what gangster weight as Chael Sonnen calls it yeah I like it I like it but like to your point Whitley just wants a big fight for a lucrative payday I thought he wants the biggest name possible to get paid yeah smart that's the name of the game yeah and you know Anderson back and that has been still been calling for a rematch with Bisping too cuz his fight with Bisping was so fucking close in England he feels like he beat him that was one of the craziest situations ever here he hit someone that flying knee chaos him I mean Bisping was out he went out he dropped and Anderson does a walk off Kay on they go path not so quick she was so weird that's so weird nope oh why does that make get a video of that cuz remember Bisbing takes a break because his mouthpiece falls out and he's like talking the ref and she goes yeah ah oh that's right right he was trying to get the referees attention and Anderson fly in need and wasn't ref like coming in to stop at the nation√≠s why the ref was like hold up no that doesn't look at that that's usually a very weird steering boxes fucking face/off yeah like he's saying something it's Herb Dean look he's like right there right there boom low house that was also the end of the round - right yeah oh my god Jesus look at this again is it let me get my mouth PC yeah oh do I shit oh boy so look at this boom that is such a crazy drop - the way you get hit you know thrown the knee regardless whether he looked to the side or not I think he would have thrown it regardless and it wasn't like this being put his hands down he looked over but he was still covered up here's the gravy on that I think he was a little distracted yeah sure here's the crazy thing Bisping comes back and wins that fucking fight my next faceoff house.you when that actually comes out there I think I was a third round right he comes out that fourth round and I knocked is his face off crazy like a fucking kangaroo crazy recovery that means unbelief cardio insane yeah because most people to get hit like that that's it man that's game over yes game over I mean his body shut off and he dropped no I wrapped it was a second gym and we're back Bobby partially blind in one eye completely partially yeah but he could still sore look if you see you can see enough where they let him fight hmm yeah I mean he does those die tests they have to do I test apparently what they did is they put some kind of oil in his eye and that oil like protects his retina somehow or another and that's why it looks so crazy and once he's done fighting then they'll fix it but the problem is like if he gets it fixed now and then he goes in fights again and tears it even worse and then the other thing is the more time he waits the more advanced all this stem-cell shit is getting like they were right they brought someone's vision back with stem cells same guy someone was blind and they injected stem cells in this guy's eye and brought his vision back there and that's today 2017 what's gonna be like five six seven years down the line he pissed me be retired by then I would hope you'd be retired three or four I mean I think he's 39 now right I was Michael uh yeah I might not be that old I might be I might be up in a multi-bit would say 36 you might be 30 might be six 37 37 I don't think he has three years left well he might look the guy's so fucking game you know you Michael Bisping does not have any extraordinary physical attributes not that he's not a great athlete he certainly is not he's done a very good fighter certainly as bar do but if you look at a guy like rumble extraordinary physical attributes John Whitaker extraordinary physical attributes well Michael Bisping has is just toughness just game as fuck toughness knock him out he comes back and he just keeps coming back there's no quit it isn't for any as great cardio here's no quick amazing cardio Brian parson says in the gym he said he's never seen a guy that hates getting tapped and hates losing exchanges more I've never seen anything like it even even just you know you do like your normal warmup like if you don't under hook just he's going 100 percent non-stop like how the foot slow down I'm the title man why don't I ttle know he's a healthy better and better you watch him improve fight to fight look at his boxing his boxing's ridiculous man how he lost him since Silva yeah knocked out Luke Rockhold yep Luke Rockhold little disdainful in that fight like that come on man weekend he was pissed yeah he's busy it's show up for that fuck yeah he was like disdainful that that was his challenge they got murked he got murked uh and and Bisbing was shooting xxx 19 in Toronto's like huh y'all be down there for days a deuce world champ what a great fucking story for a ten year or less door I fucking love Bisbee and then beats Dan Henderson in a close decision for this out was a fucking great fighter you forget about that fight we talk about fights of the year oh yeah that fight was so good so good and again his cardio yeah you got he he landed the h-bomb twice yeah ended it that easily Chaminade back up the starts fucking boxes it's fucking crazy got nothing but heart that day yeah my heart a Sam I had a funny feeling about Luke Rockhold unerring Luke was taking it seriously I didn't like how could you bet anything he was and I'm like this game even has been playing for fucking years all he needs is one shot but biz means I'm a knockout artist like the betting out for him to knock Luke Rocco down the first round I don't know let me tie some if my daughter catches you one of those swinging over hand punches and Clips the tip of your chin you got a problem hey Brian Brian told me he went this new boxing gym and the guys came and if that's a good goal he's gonna kill me for telling three you might have this girl jumps in there spar some rounds of brands like sure he starts to move around this bitch is dead Saracen yeah Joe shits up with the right hand Brian was like oh shit he said he's like a little wobble microf anyone catches you flush man yeah I mean for a long night I say the point of its and the way life Rockhold caught and Bisping this being swung it over the shoulder was a beautiful left hook he stepped in with it and just whipped it over the top and it was something to him in Perillo had seen in Rockhold's game Pirlo's coach of the year very good coach hands-down coccidia very easy to beat Ino teases coach yep still is always are yeah he worked with BJ he's worked with a lot of guys deejay Tito Cris cyborg and Michael bids yeah he's a quiet guy in terms of like he's not out there trying to get a lot of publicity he's not a tension horse just an excellent boxing coach really knows his shit [Music]
