hello freak bitches so I was big on surfing and in the first month or so that I was in Hawaii I went to the Apple store in Honolulu and I met one of my favorite surfers of all time ago called Kalani Rob and when I was playing Kelly Slater's pro surfer game I would always pick Kalani because he did the most radical moves you know so I'm in the Apple store he's there with his boys as I sure that's clear up and then he comes up to me he's like dude you're that girl of the Rings I was like oh shit so I was like you're Kalani Rob I was like I'm here for like nine months can you help me out surfing he was like yeah we're gonna go the North Shore now so I came with him whoa hung out and we became really tight so a huge story for Hawaii for me it was getting to know Kalani I mean he told me into waves I had no business being involved in there's a place called go island on the North Shore which is a heavy wave and you have to paddle out to an island walk across the island because then you're gonna miss the break and then paddle out past the break there's no concept of you paddling out through the break because it's so big so I was with Kalani and a few of his mates and we're all getting ready and he came over to me he was like okay this is the most hectic way of them ever gonna take you in to stay close to me if you need help let me know don't fuck around cuz it can kill you and don't go left go right no no don't go right go left because gonna peel left but if you go right you're in the braking zone and you're fucked I'm like all right cool and I'm having fun and I'm watching everyone in the lineup I'm about ten feet away from the drop zone so I'm able to like sit there on the wave and watch people like gets POW on the side on my all right cool I got this is fast I'm gonna I'm gonna take it so I paddle I paddle paddle wave picks me up it's big oh shit super-powerful drops me and I really try and go left I like cut the board and I try and go left but it's so powerful because it's breaking here on my left that it spits me to the right I'm fully aware that it's Pat me to the right so I'm like okay shit I'm just gonna wipe out take a big breath and paddle out so I wipe out I go under come up and as is usually the case with if you surf in anything above overhead when you come up that waves coming for you against what you have to do is take a huge breath go under and it's the next time you come up that you can make progress because you're out of breath you've disoriented I do that and I Joe I just come I can never catch a break so I go onto thrown around by the washing machine come up I think okay get on your board start paddling look waves right there look go under again hold my breath come up again and I'm trying to time it so that I can get it I just getting pounded pounded pound it pound it and at one point I see Kalani paddling over to me I'm like alright cool we're gonna be okay so Kalani comes over to me and he's like mad like I've never really heard him a metaphor he's like dude get on your board and go that way I'm like okay that's what I've been trying to do for like ten minutes but so now he's behind me he's paddling I'm paddling he's pushing me paddling pushing me paddling like fucking Superman and we eventually get out past the break so he's like alright you gonna stay here for twenty minutes and then when I'm done you're gonna paddle in with me safe and I was like okay fine I got it so when we come in he's like the reason why I came in together it was not only were you in the drop zone but you were like completely lacking of any color on your face and he was like people in the line it was saying dude go get your boy cuz he's in trouble and I was like I was handling it I was definitely out of breath and a little fucked up but he's a woman then he was like no eight more waves on your head like that you wouldn't have had the strength to fight past the wave and get up because yeah there's a little gasp from there oh it's so hell and here's a really good trick Kalani taught me this one he's like if you're under the water and you're rolling around and you're fucked and you need to take a breath drink the tiniest amount of sea water tiny sip just go like that tricks your body into thinking you took a breath and it'll give you an extra five seconds so cuz you've just taken an in well not an inhalation but you've you put something in your body so your lungs are like okay we can chill the panic goes for a little bit yeah a lot of the girls I grew up around they had to maintain their virginity for marriage a lot of no one took in the butt yes holla did you know is that really true that's what they were doing well the yeah the one girl that I was pretty close with she was 18 years old I was 13 and we hung out a lot we take the bus to like the beach from the valley and smoke cigarettes and yeah she took it in the butt it's one thing if you're 30 and she's 35 yeah that's totally normal sure but 15 and 18 that's a fuckin no Sharia 13 I'm sorry yeah 13 and 18 yeah that's a giant gap five years as a giant five years it sure is and I think part of that is she was so sheltered she'd grown up in such a strict Persian family then maybe mentally she was 13 you know I mean like I taught her to smoke cigarettes and stuff Wow Utah yeah she was real sheltered he had like we take the bus to the beach and she would have to stop at a payphone every hour to call her dad and check in that's how strict they were oh my god what happened what was her rationale well probably like buddies how many times you take in the ass for everything breaks down Pro lessons that you're driving off-road with a car that's not designed for it's like you got the wrong tires on that vehicle it's I don't I never you know honestly you've never been I need to know about this yeah but with reasonably good reason it's it's chocolate yeah there's a lot of wrong I mean she first of all just be a lot cleaning up involved pre and post yeah yeah but second of all this girl like what was her rationale to maintain purity and that's a very common thing and like how did she explain it though but I have to be married a virgin that my father they checked the bed sheets on your wedding night and your dad eats you out if you're that's right and then he can tell that's right Tom normal fucking christ so when she explained it to me you like at 13 you're probably wait what but in the book I mean it's like I knew it but sex was I mean I'm sad right I wasn't doing her 13 I mean I was getting my ass finger you know I was very you know an experienced I was just blown away and I Anna she was so funny I this is so some memory I have of her I was wearing a tank top and I was summertime and I remember she poked my armpit fat she goes oh girl you gotta have big titties when you grow up fatty and while she was right yeah I was armpit fat that's hilarious I thought that it was it was bizarre but she explained that it was a religious thing and this was to maintain her purity so God wants her taking the but God wants you to do anal and then you come out of it and you slowly come out of it and you were like noise cancelling headphones I'm just in a doctor's office like in a weird not even where like those like 1970s doctor's offices that you see in LA like just sort of a shitty elevator and whatever so when I came out of the first one I was like it was rough because I didn't know I was gonna trip like that and be I had been I didn't get a ton of sleep the night before and so I was and I'd flown that day I was just kind of groggy and and I felt really shitty and it took me like I was like after I was done I probably laid in the bed there for like an hour so I was like I can't do shit right now like I can't I could barely stand so the first day was rough and and that and I still felt shitty that night I was like I don't think I'm gonna do it again like that was too rough and um then I woke up Tuesday morning and felt fucking great I was like uh-oh I got to do it again felt great like I felt clear here's the one of the ways my depression manifested itself was like I felt my head felt heavy hmm and I felt like I had like I had like a lead weight on my forehead you know that's the way I felt when I did ecstasy the day after the day after yeah I felt it was felt amazing when I and that's what it is because it depletes yeah yeah all the serotonin yeah and that's basically what people with depression a lot of times are like just everyday yeah just like a headwind it's not it's just like fucking could this be a little bit easier like I'm not asking for a miracle I'm just like I'm just sick of having to walk into wind all the time right right a little bit uphill into the wind all right
