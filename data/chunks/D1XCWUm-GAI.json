we'll make bring notes know sometimes you remember things boom and we're live sometimes like you have to remember things and there's a thought that popped in my head or something I just forgot I need to write things now too many ideas to slip away yeah they slip away but one thing you said a while ago which I've tried to start using it the voice memos on my phone and I'm not very good at it you say you record straight oh yes it's really good I'm trying to make it fun I've got like an old-school Elvis microphone and like a 1950's style cord into an old recorder and I'm trying to use that a bit more because we were talking about Hunter s Thompson I like the idea recording stuff as I'm moving but it's a hobby I'm not getting into you right now but the I think recording anything like when you have an idea they go goddamnit this is a good idea like grab it mmm grab it I think it's Neal Brennan said it best that he looks at his notebook like a net for catching ideas like that I love that why am I always driving though I'm always right always okay I think when you're in the zone like you're driving there's something about like you know you know how sometimes you could be like miles away and you're like how the fuck did I get here like you're sober yeah that's your driving and you're like how did I Drive miles uh evidently changed lanes I you know I know where I'm going everything was in inside the lanes but I was I'm barely there and what is that I don't know you get in his own cuz you're so accustomed to doing it and you're tuning into everybody around you and sometimes you're probably a better driver when you're doing that because you're not being conscious you're just just just being aware and just being in the moment mm-hmm speeding the road yes being present it's very nice but my best ideas come then and yeah that's no way to record them but I think it's cuz you're in that weird mind state a lot of people also get the same thing when they walk a lot of writers what they like to do is they like to write and then they like to go on walks and think about the writing and the idea is that when you're on the walk you just get you know left right left getting a little bit of cardio and going up hills and you all you're thinking about is you're you're like breathing and you're moving and those eyes just sort of bounce around in the backyard and get washed yeah like during a washing machine like what's in there like a filtration I'm just kind of shaking them through because you know anything else other than walking right so I'm just walking and the my DEA's are just bouncing around in there yeah or running the same thing again you must find that yeah an idea pops through my head and I'm like I'm definitely gonna be remembering this yeah and next thing I'm into bowls to the wall and they're dead and it's gone it's gone forever lay yeah Mitch Hedberg had a funny joke about that he keeps a note by a notepad by his bed cuz every now and then like he'll have some sort of an idea that he needs to write down or if you don't have a notepad I have to pretend it wasn't a good idea I'm paraphrasing I did terrible job pass I couldn't remember exactly how it was worded but it's like yeah that thing like ideas are strange man I entertained for a while the idea that ideas were life forms that because we don't think of them like look there's a lot of different life forms right I mean there's squids and there's chimps and there's barracudas and there's hawks there's a lot of different life forms there's insects I mean there's a lot of different ones what if that's what ideas were and that what they're doing is just making their way and the more you nourish them the more they grow the more you pay attention to them the more they they propagate you're out your head with new ideas and and then you take action on those ideas and it creates everything the world's ever seen that humans have created all that stuff comes from ideas everything from cars to buildings to planes all that comes from ideas a hundred percent of it but yet we don't even think about what the ideas are like what the fuck is that you just get some random new way of looking at things what is happening is this is just pure calculation or are you interacting with some sneaky little influence or that wants to give you credit for it the god Dan Hardy you're so smart with these ideas you should you know what you should do should build that builder and then you're like I'm gonna build this fucking building alright Hardy right on the side of it god damn it and you do it all in gold like where is that coming from ago the ego oh you know men and the toxic masculinity and their desire for building things maybe or maybe ideas made that dude build that thing maybe maybe ideas were so ever the way they got you and talked to you like a siren pulling you into the rocks come on hardy build that fucking building I mean go and do it I'm into it are you a subscriber to the idea that ideas are collective so when you have an idea that of the ideas available to other people in the world if they're tuned in to be able to collect that idea I think it's entirely possible that a lot of people are thinking exactly the same way you think when you're thinking it I think that there's a lot of fucking people thinking right now and there's a lot of sharing information through podcasts and and Twitter and Facebook and you know YouTube videos and all the different things that people are doing and it it's not outside the realm of possibility that we share some sort of common thread psychically you know that there's some connection that we have with each other we know we'd like to be around each other right like logically I'm not talking we will people like to be around each other when you hear someone talk about oh I'm just alone or I want to be by myself like that's that fucked up person that's people I mean not for a little bit of time for a reset miss your friends yeah that's wonderful that's a good idea it's probably really healthy but those people that like them Ted Kaczynski type dudes you just want to just move to the middle of nowhere and by themselves would be a fucking Nomad like mmm why most of us don't want that most of us want to be around each other well how come well we feel good it's like a little drug we feel good around our friends and our loved ones we could we feel good like there's something happening here mm-hmm right there's an exchange of information yes but I I have to manage that because I it exhausts me you know no mean you did a to of the spot to podcast that you've done with Henry Rollins that I've listened to have just blown my he's awesome and there are so many things that he says that is that's he's my spirit animal I think there's a voice inside my head that is Henry Rollins and some of the things he says it just resonates with me and the idea of being around people a lot of the time he's just exhausting I like to be able to pull away and that's when I feel I'm at my best for like four hours a day I can give like a lot of energy ya know you definitely need a balance of it but you don't want to be completely absent of it what it is is some in some way or another we feed off of each other good and bad right and good people people that you enjoy being around you feed off them in a very positive way and it's very fulfilling and addicting and you want to do what they do and you want to help each other and you won't want to like feed off of each other you don't want to have it's a powerful community where you love each other and then there's people that are super negative too you know and you if it's all about what kind of current and what kind of circles do you travel in if you get fucked over as a child and you just get tossed into a bad circle really early on that's one of the primary causes for life sucking right you're a kid and you're born in a shit situation with abusive people abusive neighborhood danger crime fuck man right from the jump just fucked over change your perspective for life changes the way that you interact with people all the way through your life yes if you know yeah those early beliefs it's crazy that so little is done to stop that so little is done to mitigate that in terms of like how much effort is put into trying to ensure that people are educated or somehow or another we there's no real but to explain to someone what it's like to be a parent to your parent yeah you could talk about it too you're blue in the face but if you're talking to crazy people you're never gonna know how good they are at it anyway like if you take someone who's like a crazy abusive person what words could you ever say to that person to stop them from being crazy or abusive but there is there a string of words that you can say where you could convey the way you feel about it in a way that would cause them to go wow I should probably stop being a piece of shit I don't know I think it's you know it's zero to six in this those first six years is when you you know when you develop patterns they influence you for the rest of your life it's like the programming that's embedded in you and then like from that point on all of the decisions you make all of the relationships you develop they're put through that filtration system of those first through its first six years of your life you know and I mean this is where psychedelics have helped me but you know be able to go back in like unpacks that stuff and try and figure out what influenced me and like you know memories that you like you bury down that you don't you don't remember for the rest of your life they'll they'll influence decision making all the way through your life you know you know yeah the like those and there's little memories there the little pit stops like that they they exist no matter what you do you be in the middle of doing something you go back to some weird regret you have when you're 18 you do you ever have those moments now the way you there's a moment where you stop and you think that that was a significant moment like I've just experienced a significant moment in my life there's now gonna change the way that I think moving forward as you must have a lot of those conversations that you have yeah sometimes in the conversations yeah but I feel like if you if you think like that like it's nice to think like that for a second did I take that in wow that's pretty cool but ultimately it doesn't do you any good it's like recognizing that you're in this crazy moment it's like in many ways it's like paralysis by analysis like you're like oh my god this is happening and then you're just talking about it happening but now it's not happening anymore because now you're just talking and now you've fallen into this you know it's fast yeah that's the moment you got to appreciate it talk talk it through so you're all you all get it whatever it was whatever cool thing it was but yeah in terms of like the number of events that you see in your life that shape you and and impact you in a way that make you reassess where you're at like as a person like and what life is like those those are so critical if you don't have those if you just have like this flat plain of nothing happening going to the same job I think that's what makes people fucking go crazy more than almost any other aspect of this life is just monotony and boredom and no no thrills and no challenges and not to makes you scared yeah and I think it's difficult to see that when you're in it though right I think you know I think we're both fortunate enough to be in a place and I was I was with a good friend yesterday Tim Hendricks getting tattooed we were having the same the same conversation he's in a place where he's he's in control of his life you know he's living in the place that he wants to live he said he can walk his kids to school for the next ten years you know he works in the tattoo studio that he got his first professional tattooing like he's living his dream and he's got all these businesses that support what he's doing and I where we're in a similar situation as well and I can see all the people around me now there are caught in that monotony and they can't see and this it's just it is so difficult to break that do you know no mean it's so difficult so easy to talk about once you broke through it that's why concepts like the secrets such horseshit just because you've made it Desiree do you like your mind make me do you make it like there's a lot of variables men like to say that you have your finger on the pulse of all the variables that were in charge of making you successful that's so silly right you could be a life coach what do you think about life coaches they freak me out how can someone coach your life that well depending upon how much personal experience they've had that's the problem yeah dependence completely dependent upon see I'd want someone ancient if I was looking for a life coach I don't want someone that was like yeah at least 90 at least my yeah someone with like a war-torn past and wrote poetry and climbed mountains in Hills sure different lives yeah but it's just most people that are doing that this is no disrespect because I think that some of them actually provide some legitimate fuel they give people some words that could encourage them and even though they've never really accomplished anything they're not necessarily doing anything negative because they're propagating good ideas they're they're promoting healthy values and healthy ways to live life but let's be honest bitch you ain't done shit like it's weird it's weird to be giving advice when you ain't done shit and some people have done things some people are legitimate you know some people like Jocko willing you know when that guy's giving motivation no advice you know who he is you know what he's accomplished as a Navy SEAL as a martial artist he's uh he's a he's the real deal and when he talks to people and talks about discipline and you know establishing a core relationship between your squad and all the people you work with like he's you really believe it you buy it it's why David Goggins works you know that fuckin Savage is out there running right now while we're talking he's runnin the street just some people want to keep you soft he's running down the street making YouTube videos he'll be out there for fuckin five hours today just running he's an animal I tell you I'll be honest though I was in Uruguay at the weekend and like J like took me out it killed me I don't know why no man I'm pretty good i fast on the planes I don't eat anything when I'm in the air that's supposed to be a good trip yeah it works really well I start using it towards the end of my career is it something about your circadian cicle and you know you have breakfast in the the time and time zone that you're leaving and then when you arrive in the next place you have breakfast at that same time mm kind of kicks you over in it and it works but for some reason this time it killed me and I'm like I'm laying in bed and it's freezing cold South America I just assumed it was gonna be warm it was not warm it was the southernmost capital city in South Amer was freezing cold how cold I don't know I don't do temperatures it was cold my focus my face burns Christ it was so like zero like zero degrees maybe I'm being a pussy but it was cold so I decided I mean you know when there's a coastline there I always try and make the most of it because I live in the city center I live in the Midlands like I'm like you know I'm nowhere near a coast right so when I'm near a coast I want to make the most of it but I had no warm training clothes so I'm out there running and the reason I was out there running my Blum's felt like they were bleeding was because you put a Instagram Instagram post up seen something about not being lazy and he just it got me I was like I picked it up it was the first post that came up on Instagram I was still laying in bed and I was like I'm a CEO next week I'm gonna be I'm gonna be inspired in this moment so thank you I quote I'm my pleasure I'm very thankful for you and I'm thankful for all those people that there's gentlemen people that make posts like that that are fuel their mental fuel you know when Goggins makes a post or when Jocko makes a post or my friend cam Haines makes a post I've read those posts and I fucking want to get going I want to get going because I know they're getting after it it's it sounds so like for people who are not in the exercise for people to think that we're macho assholes this is like an excellent place where you would criticize like god it's so cliche what are you gonna go get after it I'm telling you there is great value spiritually in doing something hard there is there's something about it it makes it makes you a better person sounds ridiculous but all my favorite people can fucking push themselves all my favorite people workout hard because when they do it it breaks down bullshit better than anything else you can do just breaks down bullshit you know who you are when you're done mmm you know when you bitched out you know when you've started coasting the last 30 seconds of around you know you know all that man can't lie to yourself yeah it's the grand exposure of who you are and it only comes during like extreme duress it only comes when you're doing something that's hard it's fuck whether it's rolling jiu-jitsu or running hills or doing yoga it comes in those moments where you want to fucking quit yeah it's been a while since I've been in California and I was actually reminiscing on some of those late-night legend sessions by Green I even took a drive past the place and I just it's empty there's nothing there now but I took a drive past it and I remember like we were in there too like 10:30 11 o'clock at night that's window steamed up and yeah they were good nights just that grind I'm trying to bring that back so I've just opened my own Jim Hardy wallet it's my dream I'm not I want I swear it's in the Midlands in Colville it there Leicestershire like young website Hardy wallet mm a coder you spell all that out because you don't bro har d yw8 double-l h EA d MMA so you two guys down there myself and Jimmy wallet nice my longtime friend training partner so we've open he's a famous UK MMA fighter he's a thug he's a beast he's beautifu yeah so that's great that's that's those old legend days man it's one of those places where I'll drive by again in histology I can wait hi man we had fun in that place yeah crazy wars it was just such a great place to Train and such a great environment a great gym that would they set it up perfectly such a bummer when that went away I was like wow they were good nice yeah my joy still clicks from your psyche control pressure I ever always asked me like what so what was Jose what's Jose grappling like is it like loads of 10th planet stuff I might not really know he's like fuckin irons people out into the canvas with these air these shoulders and he's like people don't get you strong top game and I always think back to it sorry dude I'm gonna click it your that's not for me well no no that was Scarlett fight that was from Evita you got a feet toward ya you sparred with Vitor yeah quite a basketball why didn't you call me call me before you think about it something like cat what you fucking let me play you a highlight reel yeah fuck away from that guy of course he did he's terrifying yeah when was this that was a Xtreme Couture so when I was living here are you live out too I used to stitch the shawn tompkins house was he fighting 2 or 5 then or 85 oh this was he was fighting an affliction I was I was helping him train for the it was very martini for an affliction no was it yes it was I think I think it was he only had one fighting affliction right man affliction what affliction had some wild shit they did Phaedra money of that which spit when Pharaoh foot tim sylvia holy shit yeah holy shit that was wild when fader knocked our laughs key holy shit thought bottles reflection fights they were they were yeah they book of cards but it was yeah it was extreme Couture and it was in the boxing ring that was right in the door and it was fight week so there were fans in the gym people taking photos and we were on the elevator platform it's Vitor Belfort with some dudes that no one's ever seen it's got a mohawk so everyone's like this guy's gonna get fucked up by Vitor Belfort so everyone's watching and I'm like I'm like moving I'm like trying to stay away from him using my footwork and my jab and like he was just trying to March me down and I caught it with a couple of a couple of jabs and a cheeky left hook and he stepped in and blasted me with this clean uppercut whoa I was eating soup for a week yeah man don't do that yeah he was so fast he's ridiculously fast yeah you don't need that in your life not anymore - yeah Vitor is big and fast he was like the first guy that burst onto the scene that had like real boxing hands speeding combinations remember when he fought tre telligman and people thought he was jutsu guy because he was only 19 but he came out with his hands wrapped with MMA gloves on and was throwing dishes yep wrestling shoes it was certain he had wrestling shoes when he fought Vanderley - you know for right so cuffs oh yeah but you know what's really interesting about Vito is people think of him as a kicker but he really didn't start kicking until later in his career you know it's kind of crazy when you think that he knocked out Dan Henderson with a kick Luke Rockhold with the kick Michael Bisping with a kick he knocked these guys out with head kicks spanning yeah well some of them yeah but he did with Bisping was it just a lead round catch right wasn't it left round kid yeah at the rock Obama yes yes well kids the second wheel kicked probably ever threw in a fight and turned straight back to stanziano didn't spin all the way through he's a fucking serious athlete man that's like the kind of kicking technique that you would get if you were a black belt at Taekwondo in your teens you know what I'm saying for him to pick that up deep into his 30s because he'd never threw kicks like that right he would throw he would throw crazy hands and mostly he would throw like some low kicks or things like that but he started throwing wild head kicks and shit and it I think also it was something might had to do with the fact that he broke his hands many times like many many times like I think he had something like seven or eight hand operations really oh yeah something I've never had a problem with crazy got lucky many good things in structure I think it's because cuz I was a video the other day me hitting the the maze bag with no gloves on mm-hm I do that quite a bit and I've always done it and I think for the first sort of you know five years of my training everything we did was with no gloves you must have done the same thing would take one though right yeah and like I always think now boxers go straight into a gym and they wrap hands before they do anything so they never get that structure of their hands no man I think there definitely is some benefit to doing some hand strengthening for sure there's no attraction it's no the detriment doing it's got to be good for you and you're doing something where you're that's your weapon that's two of your biggest weapons the ones that land the most or these two hands and if you could make it more strong it only makes sense that that would be good make them and also if you made a more muscular all right if you just did a lot of fun you would actually make them heavier you know like you really dumb not much you know how much more meat you got in your hands if you have like a thick hand versus a thin hand it's probably a couple of ounces like quite small hands and that's the other thing if you punch as hard as Vitor you better have some fucking George Foreman hands to go with that speed and power you know so maybe that's like there's a lot of great boxers even with those big gloves like Floyd Mayweather broke his hands multiple times yeah just hit people really hard hit him hard on the forehead your fucking hand breaks yeah what about some Chris Leben he never broke his hands didn't guys made out of metal exactly if you could take his hands off and put him on Beto Beaufort it's a lethal weapon he fires bombs at people bare knuckle it's it's crazy to see him did you see his last fight though again Dakota Cochrane we got this giant gash in his forehead one of the worst cuts I've ever seen it didn't makes me rethink my support of fuck because I was saying that MMA should be bare-knuckle I remember we had this conversation like in the back in the Middle East a long time ago yeah something have that same repetitive conversation forever yeah because I doesn't make sense to me that we have this unrealistic advantage of having your wrist wrapped and having knuckle protections on it seems like why can't I how come someone can elbow you in the face but they can't hit you with a bare knuckle they can Shin you in the face I think about as hard as some people kick and then shinning you in the face like oh that's okay but then you got to think I mean what MMA would look like if we took the gloves off we'd look like a real fight it would this the thing is like the gloves it doesn't help anyone other than the person who's throwing their punches because it protects your hand but it may gives you an unrealistic expectation what you with your hands cuz we're all padded up yeah but I still think people you know the people that are fighting binnacle right now have got an unrealistic perspective of what boxing is with no gloves mmm like if you look back to the any of the old photos or drawings of the old bare-knuckle boxes their stance was so much different leaning back their knuckles were cold in and they were hitting with the front two knuckles with a back fist like I think if if being local boxing had to started around you know around the same time as the UFC started it would develop and it would look very different right now everybody's standing like boxers like I'm gone 14 ounce gloves on when there's boring and they're throwing punches like they've got like they've got gloves on these no you know they're not made that adjustment yet to lean back and start using that lead hand better so do you think that you're gonna see that in this bare-knuckle boxing guys they're gonna develop like that old timey style and start jabbing with those strong for folks who don't know the the strong two knuckles are the ones that are right next to your index finger and your fuck you finger those are those are the two strong ones and if you look at my friend John Lee who is a national Taekwondo champion and one of my mentors taught me a lot when I was in Boston used to punch bricks so often that he didn't have two knuckles he had one solid knuckle it was so crazy it was this on his right hand it was like what a knuckle where a knuckle would be and another knuckle would they all of it was covered by this like thick callous have you ever seen like when dudes have those knuckles from breaking boards and bricks and shit I've seen I've seen the callous knuckles but and I've never seen one one combined you see if you can find a photo of this because it's I've seen it on other martial artists before but you have to be one hardcore motherfucker to turn your hand into a hammer one of our teach in one of my party tricks is my shins though oh really I've got conditioned Chin's from Thai boxing there's still like none of the nerves have come back no that's amazing and they're like it's it all calcified and sure it sounds like the table but it's like like the bone collapses down on itself and then you get like this thick chunk of bone right at the front of this chair of the shin so it's a different kind of bone like a calcified by the way it was explained to me is that the if you if you take take a cross-section of the bone it looks like ladders stacked up with next to each other and what you do is you collapse the rungs on the front set of ladders and that collapses down itself and those two pieces calcify and then that becomes a thicker outer wall and then you do the same thing so you collapsed the like we used to do bottles and draw in rolling pins and all kinds of stuff to like try and condition the shins like what's the best way because everybody has a whole day there I've got a big old sandy heavy bag in my gym and I just kicked that all day Kevin Ross said he would make me one he's gonna make me a sandwich and that you just kick with your shins nice you know that's what he told me he does I'm like Jesus Christ yeah you got to put some rags in there with the Sun just to give it a bit of movement no no if Kevin Ross is going start I'm gonna take it like a man I'm gonna just fuck my shins up it's the same thing apparently is the process that happens with cauliflower ear is calcification because when you get internal bleeding as expen explained to me remember I am a moron and I'm definitely not a doctor but it's explained to me that when you have blood inside the tissue that that blood can calcify and that's why your your ears when they get cauliflower they're so fucking hard cuz literally it's like a rock in there damn I used to just get it out I used to stuff some insulin needles good for you right that's good for you and I just yeah good for you there's a lot of people that want that that nonsense with their ears let's sit it listen no disrespect to people who have it because many of them are my heroes you know because it's it's part of the game for jiu-jitsu but if you have the option right now not if you already have the cauliflower god bless but if you got the option right now you really should drain your fucking ear because that that's how the reason why your ear hears a certain way like all that like sound comes through there you can hear it I have like little tiny peices chunks of little hard stuff you know places where I had like a little bit of cauliflower but I always weren't your guards yeah yeah you did you always fuck you man I'm gonna hear because it crazy bare-knuckle boxing legend Big Joe Joyce dipped hands in petrol a head of brutal brutal fights was this that Irish guy gentleman hardest own hands hardest own rock-hard let me hear this fella called and we hear and talk he's a this is a traveler why is it why isn't it okay to say gypsy anymore what happened I don't know is that not acceptable anymore that's where I heard most advantageous because bands just killed a coach and I hear the Pope demanding I'll do not him okay just stop right there because we don't understand saying I was I wouldn't refer to him as a gypsy I would refer to him as a pikey that's it hike it yeah well they call themselves travelers as well right it's a it's this weird distinctions you know that's how fully offended a bunch of people there which I'm I didn't mean to do the absolute bunch of tough motherfuckers my official yeah really tough motherfuckers Nicky Holt skin' isn't he from that that I'm sure I think yes he's very pretty Tyson Fury for sure Tyson Fury is for sure to train in the same box in a gym as him like he used to have the ring the hour before me and I remember watching him he was just like his big hulking monster walking around dude he's so improved dick closely tall ridiculous he's so tall and long and he moves so good for a big heavyweight nice dude god damn he's a great guy he's a sweetheart of a guy and he really genuinely cares to reach out to people and tell them that if you are going through depression if you're dealing with and suffering from mental illness talk about it and get help because I almost killed myself and now here I am champ of the world feeling great yeah I'm done same again Sonia Ruiz I would love to see that to you'll see that I think we'll see all these fights Andy Ruiz is not looking forward to fighting in Saudi Arabia apparently I do not look again one more time I'm a moron I'm not a fight promoter I don't know what the fuck goes on behind the scenes with lawyers and I don't know what what the contract said that he had but what I had heard was that he had to fight in England like that was in the contract that's what I had heard but that could be horseshit yeah I'm have no idea maybe maybe it says in the contract that they have the right to tell him I said even said that I heard that because I don't remember who told to me but the point is there's a story that just came out that he does not want this fight to be in Saudi I think he wants to fight in New York again he he said he doesn't trust it over there yeah like he doesn't trust it in England either he doesn't trust to fight Joshua names like none I get it I mean he's the champ now we can call this yeah yeah he's the champ man neutral super nice guy have you met him no no I have not man he's great he was awesome on your podcast he's great listen to that it's a good dude man genuine his fuck and boy does he have like fluidity and efficiency in his punches no wasted movie yes yeah and the other thing I was I was talking to Tim Hendricks about we were discussing box and he actually trains at the Ruka gym with Jada Jason Perillo he's a couple of fights I'm a huge jason profound yeah he's very very good coach man very good in the corner she's great I guess advice is gray and you see like the advancement of his pupils so he's got that deep voice and he doesn't to his own horn ever no not you know that guy just stays under the radar and just kicks ass I'd like to see a couple of young fighters go to his gym cuz he's like like the old guard to kind of lean in there like Bisbing and cyborg I'm not sure where she what she's gonna do now like well I think people are gonna you know up-and-coming people that are in that area for sure gonna go it's it's one of those things where it's like there's so many great trainers now that for fighters it's like where do you want to live do you want to live in San Diego do you want to live in LA do you want to live in Vegas like where do you want to live but you just have to figure out where you want to live and then find someone who's gonna match up with your style yeah assuming you're realistically at the level that you could benefit from such a move you know yeah kinda spoiled for choice really yeah I was at American Top Team the other week spent some time with Karen and Sylvia and I mean thank you better than a place he's a wizard he's a wizard in in so is Dean Dean Thomas has one of the best Instagram pages with advice advice for young fighters and he had a great one today that I text him um so this is genius advice telling them that one of the biggest things that inhibits their progress is not looking at themselves honestly not looking at their what they're strong at what their but they're weak at I think it helps have a good sense of humor though as a fighter I think you know with him with him I've been such a good sense of humor it can be create about himself and not take it to heart yeah and I think there are a lot of fighters that are you know that they're too delicate to be to be honest with themselves like how many fighters they get knocked out and they don't watch the fight a lot like I don't one experience it they don't want to see it you know that's that's crazy to me that seems to be like an essential part of the learning process maybe in their mind they they know what happened and they don't want to experience the bad feeling again and what they're gonna do is just get through this learn and improve that they don't need to see themselves getting left hook they know it happens that their hand it's like burying it deep down inside you never remember exactly how it played out as well you know I'm sure but they unless it's final right like if you if you wake up and you got flatlined and you look up and you see the highlight of you getting hit and then you barely remember it yeah and I mean how much of that is gonna help you to watch that right like I don't know like how much is it gonna help Ben Askren to see Jorge Mouse we'd all land that knee on him yeah I mean well the thing is with that that was I'm not saying it was it was a less technical circumstance but it was one of those kind of wild circumstances which right I mean the only thing that he could have learned from it is the fact that Maz Videla probably figured out ladies shoots with his head to that side I mean so which is why I'm as Fidel did the circle to make him force you know put his head on that side so it was in the right place dude it was genius it was it was beautiful it was checkmate with one move yeah that's because it was one move there was no there was no build-up there was no sense um so like a fight that lasts a couple of minutes I think there's a lot to be learned from that and like the process in which you know you went through to Obi opened up for the knockout yeah like a condom fight for me I've watched that thousands of times I used to walk through casinos in Vegas and it was playing on a highlight reel on the TV I'm like here we go again you know but like I know exactly what went wrong you know I learned so much from that and I remember opening my eyes and thinking I just feeling different don't you feel though like I mean now at this stage of your career you know you've become this celebrated commentator as well and you can look back and you have so many highlights like there were so many great moments of your career like you could acknowledge that the bad there but they can't sting like the use of sting know that they don't I mean I I've always had a good sense of humor I've always you know I always have yeah I've always been I mean you know I got punched in the face I get reminded of that lion after the Condit fight all the time when you interviewed me its first thing I thought to myself I mean it's you've got was gotta be able to laugh at yourself but yeah you're exposed you're very very vulnerable you're in front of millions of people putting your basically your health on the line you know yeah so I think having a sense of humors always helped and I think also now being able to look back from where I am now and look at my career and go well I had 10 fights in the UFC I went for up title fight for down and then I pulled it back for two and that's where it kind of ended so I had I had a bit of everything I had a taste of everything I had the quick rise I was in a coma main event in my second fight you know Oh to arena in London 69 second knockout on top of the world Marcus Davis after that was just ridiculous because of the build-up to it then Mike Swick I'm fighting for a world title holy shit what's happening here next thing I'm facing off against Jewish symp here and then I had like a like a four month process after that of looking back at it with everybody saying oh you just need a bit of takedown defense you just need some takedown defense and I've started to believe that in my own head and thought I was really really fucking good I did I mean it went like you were really fucking yeah I thought you were better than I were absolutely I did yeah and then I looked at Condit and this is where my ego took over and I looked at him and I thought to myself he's gonna do anything to me like it's awkward he's slow he's striking sucks he's very predictable he's not gonna be punching power he won't be able to take me down like this was the whole conversation I was having in my head going into the fight I was I was just there was no way he was gonna he was gonna beat me Wow you know and that's where that was a good turning point for me because that put me back on the track where I should have been and I'd already started to veer off after the GSP fire because the rise have been so quick for meit's so I because I experienced that is nice for me to be able to and I try not to talk about it but to relate my experiences when I'm watching other fighters coming up you know I can actually put myself in their shoes because I probably something of where they're at for sure a high or a low no no so I look back and I think maybe my career prepared me for where I'm at right now oh for sure I think the best commentators for sure or former fighters I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in there man oh you so high oh please come on it's uh it's a great job for me it's a lot of fun but I think it's best expressed by former fighters because there's if they could do everything that I can do which most of them can the big thing that's missing with me is not having fought in the UFC where they can relay that and it's very important I've seen a lot of it I can understand what's going on but there's an additional perspective that some like you can provide Michael Bisping who I think it's also excellent Anna of course DC it's my probably my all-time favorite guy to work with mmm Dominick Cruz is excellent Anna - as is Paul Felder it's like there's something unique about the perspective before you know I used to be really fucking good at it Frank Mir Frank Mays it was great dude give him a job so would he give him a fucking job yeah but then I would say the same thing about Jimmy's method yeah yes I know you know I think the UFC had decided that they wanted to use their former fighters more yeah sort of give them a career option after fighting which you know we look like Rashad Evans he's really flourishing there tyron woodley is already kind of established himself as being a you know big-time commentator while he was the champ after he was a champ he's doing more of that those the more guys do that the more they're gonna see like oh well there is a life in sports after competition I can make a great living still be involved in the sport that I love that has given me so much and I've given so much too and it's all a cool thing that's like you get and I think I encouraged more of them to do podcasts like Shaab you know like shoppes kind of carved the path in terms of like x-fighters becoming successful at podcasts and so many people go to him for you know what's your take on Canelo vs triple G what do you think is gonna happen with this is Deontay Wilder ever gonna fight Tyson Fury again like those those like coming from a former fighter man people really dig that it's a unique perspective he and any if you can get good at fighting you can get good at talking true to learn it that way around get the fight in learn first and then figure out yeah tell people about it I often think you know when I'm talking to people though they like Anthony Smith when I when I speak to him I always think to myself as soon as he's done fighting he can get cross straight over into inter broadcaster speaks so well and yes every time I find a fighter and I feel that about them I always make sure I tell them yeah because although you don't want to think about it when you're a fighter because you always want to think we of course you're gonna become the world champion of course you're gonna be massively successful and I have to worry about it because that's the only mindset that you should have as a fighter of course but there is life after fighting and you know what I've realized is that if I'd have had other options like planned when I was fighting I would have had a lot less pressure when I was fighting this is my advice that I would say I would say for sure if you're the type of person that needs to concentrate on one thing at a time and that one thing is fighting just fight but if you're interested in doing it in any way you don't have to think like this is my way out you could just say this is another cool thing I do yeah so don't fuck with your head don't fuck with your head and say hey maybe when I retire this would be my career like me you stay in the game but you can just get good at stuff too and just be Zen about it yeah the more you put pressure on like maybe it's time for me to move on maybe it's time for me to really cut guys can head fuck themselves you don't want to fight when you're head fucked we've all seen guys fight when they're head fucked and you're like what happened to him oh you broke up with this girl oh this happened or that happened or someone in the family died and like II mm yeah that's why pole fell to fights like it's always his last fight because he knows he's got a good common tree cake when he when he retires he is a lunatic he's great you know he's a theater major mm-hmm yeah it's like super well spoken guy yeah he's a quite a gentleman with a brain is they bring him in for the European ones we worked on Moscow together and a few of them he's very him and Barboza too it's gonna be chaos that's a crazy faz long as that motherfucker laughs that's gonna be Craig that's gonna be crazy yeah barbosa's been in some fucking wars he is amazing holy shit it is the fastest which kick I've ever seen in my life oh for sure and any any it's the placement as well as the time lace meant of it it's stunning how fast it is though man it's stunning like when you see in real life you just like Jesus I've seen a fucking thousand people throw switch kicks probably yeah but there's one that stands out its Barboza Lord Jesus ridiculous like a world champion tie mm-hmm that's what it looks like he was down at American Top Team I was there a few weeks ago and just watching him hit pads and moving around and stuff it's dude there's no he's the best kicker in the sport and Mike for my money like is like he's the first guy to stop two guys with leg kicks mm-hmm Raphael de Oliveira and a wrestler it was just like he he's a fucking lethal kicker man first guy to ever stop somebody with the wheel kick Terry Adam you know how many times have we seen that fuck man ass on everything fuck why remember thinking like Terry's got to take some chances here but if you take chances he could get knocked out so I was literally saying that when he got hit with the wheel kick he's he's a fighter that I think would benefit from that weight class between 155 and 170 Milo Mike lullo's the other guy he stopped okay leg kicks remember remember remember that Josie Aldo you're right failure what's that wasn't in UFC sorry what was another one a fight right before that he would Marcelo go outside the UFC stop dude he's fucking lethal yeah his leg kicks are horrific the only one is close was Aldo in his prime oh man against Urijah Faber oh I did that I did a show with the Faber the week after and he came in on crutches his old leg was like you know the the eggplant emoji that's basically what he's legless are ridiculous people understand you're a grave risk of infection when you have that kind of bruising all throughout you're like me that is a that could go terribly wrong but that was a terrible leg injury that shows you how fucking tough Uriah Faber it was ridiculous - he's back it's not just that - how about the fight when we fought Mike Brown and he broke both his hands yeah broke both his fucking hands so he's throwing elbows and kicks and he's trying to keep this guy off him yeah dude and he's back as well thanks but I want to see him again Sudha do it I won't see you too I mean it came close it seemed like this is almost something that really could happen because like when he knocked out Ricky Simone and everybody was like what yeah quick what this is crazy your eye comes back he's starching people and good fighters knocks out a good fighter a young up-and-coming talented kid just catches him perfect and like damn ear I have favors in the hunt yeah and then everybody loves him and so he starts talking shit to who don't so who dose starts talking shit to him me like wow yeah but first who dough has to fight Valentina Shevchenko and Amanda Nunez apparently she's new shirt is an inter-gender champion shirt yes yes goat is this really love oh I love it Henri I'm in your corner you keep this out come on rabbit no more cake he's got people excited about flyweight man yeah but dude I love it as well be pro wrestling look at this everybody's in on it let me see it look at that into gender world champion it's all in gold on a black shirt god bless you Henry cejudo god bless you that's terrible he's fucking and cough me in his way he's arguably if he's not the most accomplished MMA fighter in history he's the most accomplished combat sports athlete that's that's undeniable yo that's undeniable Olympic medalist and two division world champion he can do whatever the fuck you want let him wear that shirt let him go crazy you let him do whatever he wants that's Henry cejudo he does with everyone I think the girls are all in on it and I think it helps everybody because everybody's getting pumped up about it it's a joke a man in núñez thinks it's a joke she posed with them Valentina Shevchenko both fights in though they would both fuck him up - no I'm just kidding they yeah you know you really don't want to see 135 pound man ever fight Amanda Nunez you know you don't want to see it you don't want to see it but I'll see Amanda Nunez fight anybody else and I'll see Valentina Shevchenko fighting anybody else I mean it would be it would be horrible if you saw a commands world champion fight of women's world champion and he fucked her up that would be terrible beautiful I would never ever want to see that I was offered a fight against you main to random e1 she's hot in a scary way she's scary Valentin in a scary way yeah you don't mean I mean that with all due confidence or all due respect rather I'm a giant fan of her so I think she's mean I had a conversation with dream killer bolaños you know Gaston Bolanos from Muay Thai and now he fights yep he's finding a belt or we were talking about her and he he said I think she has the best fight IQ of anybody like maybe better than anybody in the sport man or woman and I was like I can't argue it no well I mean you watched that last fight against his Carmouche and I know a lot of people complained that it was a you know it was a slow fight but and this is something I realized actually during that fight sometimes you need to see the whole octagon to really appreciate what's going on you know sometimes you need to see like an elevated shot of the whole space because her ability to control that space with the the threat of doing something and their ability to cut people off what is she doing here super well she's breaking down a Superman oh yeah she's hot in a scary way in a Bond villain condom yeah yeah well you like please she throws her spinning backfist differently as well which I think there's a good reason for because most people are throwing that's been in backfist with their arms straight and then breaking the forearm right was when she throws is she's throwing it with her elbow down which means that if she hits with the forearm he's hitting both bones interesting yes best that that's the reason she does it you might be right I mean it makes sense the it is harder to break the bone that way right and I would think so is it though let me think just think if that makes sense you've got to think hitting one bone is gonna be wicked but if you block it you want to block it with the edge you never want to block it like that I'll give you blocking a kick you don't want to take it like that that's how your arm snaps one block a kick I would take it a month if you have to block a kick what if you get stuck here what do you do if you get stuck here yeah but if you kick is coming over I'm tucking up I'm taking it on the bit unlike the meat of my arm wherever that wherever that I'm calling for it hopefully if it hits your forearm wouldn't you rather rather take your forearm than a face for sure for sure for sure but wouldn't you rather have it a hit here than here it seems like here's gonna folks who listening we're describing the outside blade of the bone which would be like the edge of a 2x4 versus the flat part of a 2x4 I think if you kick the flat part it would break whereas if you kick the edge it probably is a little bit more durable you think I think so so the lesson is yeah I think the problem is actually catching it flat like you're it's one of those things where it's it's not the bone the size difference is so huge that that little bone is gonna break like if someone's a really good kicker but you're Francis and Ghana kicks your arm some big giant dude with power if this parts gonna break it's not his shin the shins not gonna break dude when Anthony Johnson kicked me I felt like someone hit me with a tree see that's what they look like wow they look weird they don't look like you what you would think they would look like we're looking at the bones of the forearm right now you have a delusional idea what your bones look like yeah I thought they were core it's weird that that's our shape right that's what keeps us together just kind of all floatin together this weird fucking hard stuff hard stuff that allows us to articulate as we move through earth but then you see other animals like octopus no hard stuff at all nothing scares the shit out of me they're weird you see that little clip going around the snail that had a parasite in it that this the parasite took over and it's like pulsing in its eyes and the body dude you haven't seen no oh you know when I think I saw that a long time ago something really similar to that no now that you're saying it I love these goddamn things I love those grasshoppers that get infected with that water worm that makes them commit suicide Oh Jude dude I have seen this all my god this is amazing so this thing is inside its eye like a goddamn amusement park ride it's time for the bird to eat it because it'll repopulate inside the bird and take so it's kind of trick a bird yeah cuz it's the snails already dead I think it's gone oh nature you fucking skinny bitch we've got it pretty good in comparison oh my god we do Animal Kingdom what a tricky weird way to propagate Hey look at me come on no you'll never eat me come on how many terrifying so this aquatic worm it climbs inside the grasshoppers body and then when it's ready to be born it makes the grasshopper commit suicide so it can like get in the water and swim away literally stalks the grass I'll be like come on bitch you're going over here like it hijacks its physical motion makes it jump into water and drown and then the worm fucking comes out of it looks the one with Stephen King movie the fly that lands on this spider and guess inside the spider they eat it from the inside and yeah what is now my god a tarantula hawk or something that does that I'm somewhat across a similar that's talking about cordyceps which we talked about before yes they grow on the cicadas have domesticated that fungus is and they use it yeah what cicadas have repeatedly turned the infamous cordyceps fungi into indispensable allies what they grow it on their body is that what he's doing that looks like an ant but that is a man is that a cicada says the relative of the zombie ant has been domesticated by cicadas oh just like running the show well there was one thing that I saw in the quarter SEPs mushroom I don't know if it's exactly I think there's like many different strains of cordyceps mushroom but one some particular fungi might not have even been cordyceps but I think it was Jesus somebody gets a story it infects an ant and the other ants take it away from the colony because they know that it's going to get to a certain point then it's going to explode so the ants will literally fill up with these spores and then explode and then the spores get into the sky and land on the other ants and they all get infected and they figured that out so they take it yeah from the nest somehow another they know that this fucking creepy ant is like a bomb it's like a dead bomb and inside of it the cordyceps mushroom exploding ant rips itself apart to protects us protect its own what is that this is a different one down at this um dude Google worm infested by fungus well yeah Google that try that not worm ant ant ant infested by fungus but um this is so there's no way anything that certifying ins could write we just don't think it's terrifying cuz they're little that's all it is like if they get too big we kill them there's not nothing there's no chicken sized spiders running around my yard the fuck out of here you're dead I'm not gonna call scientists I'm gonna shoot you first but then you kind of gotta put yeah but then you kind of gotta put yourself in that circumstance like imagine that happening to you on that scale do or put yourself on that scale ah dude if there was cockroaches and and fucking giant bugs the size of dogs running around we would have real problems real problem real problems they go right through your fucking walls your house eat everything in there they might eat your baby dude why you putting these pins and fucking spiders and black widows house if black widows were giant you'd be so fucked black widows the size of giraffes yeah just running around jacking people it would change everything about the way we lived yeah if we didn't have weapons guess what all that shit would be real but all waves look at that so here it is so one of them gets infected and the other ones are gonna carry this dude away because if they don't he starts growing shit on his head it's like this this fungus somehow or another gets into his body and it starts sprouting this mushroom out of the top of his head and we're looking at a slow motion version of this we're seeing this thing sprout out of this dead ants head if this took three weeks to film this yeah dude this is like a science fiction movie it's just they're operating on the different time scale but if that happened as quickly as you're watching it in this video you freak the fuck out we're gonna say explode growing so quick is it gonna explode is that the grand finale I don't know I think that's the idea though yeah that's yeah it explodes out of its head is what they're sort of somatic but I think it does blow spores I think some of them yeah see some of them like fill up and then spores blow out of them and those spores can infect other ends that's why they were removed from the colony if you're biologists i strong sincerely apologize butchering all science that's how I spent my summer across there are exploding ants though well they literally explode no no it's it's like a hole they explode but their nests lived to see another day their abdomen are up sir oh the whole fungi well did you ever see what they do with leaf cutter ants uh-uh so ruthless the women are so monstrous they chop off the man's arm fuck him to death they they chop off his arms and then they carry him away yeah they find the male there must be a reason for bringing they find the male they say up well you're not going anywhere bitch and they cut his arms off and then they bring him somewhere to fuck them make sure this is true I'm pretty sure it's true I watched this old documentary I remember they were snipping off the arms and legs of the amp and then they carried him away imagine that's fucking terrifying dude they're like this is how we know how to do it like this is how we do it we cut off your arms and legs then we fuck you to death imagine how that changes life-coaching dude if that was the reality the fear of dude right because sitting around waiting for a horde of angry egg carrying women come charging through your door remove your limbs they're terrifying enough women oh we don't need to make them any more terrifying women humans are awesome but women bugs that's a weird thing like there's no there's no love in the bug world no I just making honey and getting something beautiful about although it's like it's like pure you know it just keeps rolling over it's just you know it's fine it's rhythm we're the ones that make it complicated with all the other shit that we add on to it well we've made ourselves so safe and so removed from the whole cycle of life and that's amazing that we've done that or that somebody other than us has done that and then we reap the benefits but because of that we look at real the real suffering of the natural world almost like is if it's preventable or if it's bad or if it's you know something we should be sad about you know but there's some really horrific things that take place especially in the insect world on a daily basis that make you just go what like have you ever seen those Hornets that fly into the honey bee nests and yeah head everyone I have seen that that's terrifying but it's like a Japanese Hornet right and they fly in and just a few of them and there are good sizes oh I in my name you won't want any bigger hedge cutters for a face and they just come in and chop the heads off of these fucking and these these other honeybees and it's crazy to watch man because the honeybees can't do jack shit there's hundreds of them and it's just getting slaughtered just thousands of them but then they figured out the way to kill these things is to get on top of them and bat their wings to heat up so they heat up to the point where it overheats the bee and kills it or the Hornet and kills it how did they figure that out how did they figure that out but that's their strategy now their strategy is they swarm all over the Hornet and they just keep flapping their wings until they overheat that motherfucker that's the argument for collective consciousness cuz like someone figured that out one of those one of those honey bees figured that out and then the rest of them around the world probably started using that same tactic probably yeah well that's the Rupert Sheldrake thought is that the sweet potatoes in there well he's uh he's he had this theory called morphic resonance and he one of the things that he was saying was he was talking about studies they did with rats and mazes and then if they did a study with a rat in a maze like on the East Coast rats on the west coast if they went through the same maze would get through a quicker hmm so it's like they were learning from each other how to get through it's almost like they were sharing yeah some sort of an understanding I mean we want to think that all genetics are the same in terms of like you know you have a child and your child shares your wife's genetics and your genetics and this is this is how it works and this is this is the way people learn things and that might be the way we learn most things but it also might be that we're getting some information from each other in some weird way and go to be and we but we might be a little too detached from it whereas rats or out there fucking scratch and claw and they don't have a language they might be completely tuned into it might be the sacrifice that language but that we made when we went with language where we lost our ability to read each other the way we used to order to read thoughts and ideas where we used to we rely instead on this other thing so it's sort of like when you wear shoes all the time your feet get soft for sure we've done a lot of things to detach ourselves from all of that stuff yeah and I mean like and I think you know people that like wim HOF and Tim shieff and people like that that kind of go back to as far as clothes back to nature as they can they must be tuning back into something that we're lacking I always feel that like that I want to get closer to that resonance and I do feel like this is the study with the the monkeys on the islands the archipelago and they drop sweet potatoes in the sand have you have you heard this I think so but good so they drop sweet potatoes in I mean I'm this is just a a gathering of why I remember from reading the study but there was a series of islands all with the same species of monkey on the islands they dropped sweet potatoes into the sand on one Island and the monkeys went over and bit into them and because they were covered in sand they spat them out and left them some of the younger monkeys realized that if they took them into the sea they could wash the sand off and then they cleave the sweet potatoes and then when they dropped the sweet potatoes onto the successive islands they'd already knew to wash them in the sea oh right so that's very similar the Rupert Sheldrake thing that's really interesting yeah yeah I really wonder I mean I really wonder how much like the human race benefits from the collective knowledge of everyone involved not just through the internet in books and in universities but maybe even just through consciousness like maybe there's some element of it that's being relayed through consciousness see I'm invested in it because if I have an idea I automatically think that that idea is now available to everybody else so I need to jump on that ship pretty quick so I use it as like oh yeah we have motivated myself yeah for sure right and if you you know if you have an idea do you ever wonder where it's coming from mmm where is that oh this is that I've but I've had experience I've to work mushrooms all the time and to work with him mushrooms yeah same laissez-moi yeah same office you know they're called puzzles over a colleague's you know and I will mushrooms I worked with him I always felt like I was downloading stuff I always felt like it was being poured into my head yeah from somewhere else very similar a lot of people have very similar experiences so I always feel like I'm receiving it from someone else and I think that's it's a good way of kind of detaching myself from it ownership of it yeah Steven Pressfield wrote about that in a really unique way in the war of art because you talked about how just showing up and counting on the muse like thinking about the muses a real thing you know the muse has always been like some the idea is like something's coming to you with these ideas something like something magical right and so I think his idea is to treat it like it is magical and respect it and it show up every day at work at the same time and and summon the muse and then if you did just do that with discipline and you act as a professional all this stuff comes to you where does it come from well let's just say it comes from the muse it might not let's just say it does treat it like it does and it works out like that's it's one of those weird ones whereas if you pretend it's magic it kind of works like magic mm-hmm but if you just analyze it loser drips neurons firing in my brain the collective work of all these other people of ever experiencing movies and literature they're all feeling through me so let's not get carried away about the pretentiousness of creativity might be pretentious my people attentions think that way but you might be open to the idea that let's just pretend that's magic let's just pretend just trick yourself into thinking that it's magic and then operate like it's magic but then give it the respect as if it's like you know if you piss off a wizard because you show up late right show up on time do it current treat it like you respect it yeah it keeps you humble it keeps you active yeah I would say so I like that there it's not bad theory but it's got a lot of holes in it I'm sure a smarter person that has write down what do you um you I know I know know how much you've talked about this but you and I have talked about it that you've been thinking about fighting again mm-hmm where are you at with that right um right now I'm what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get back in the you sada testing pool I have to be in the pool for four months and then once I'm in the pool for four months then I have the option to fight if I choose to I haven't be the first guy they test for mushrooms for sure a new mushroom test an abscess ring to you I'll be a happy test pilot for that I don't mind that at all ya know I mean I've got to do four months because I never officially retired and so the the whole thing show up at 6:00 in the morning you gotta pee in a cup blood yeah the problem is I'm on the road all the time and this is a conversation I've had with Jeff Novitzky is because like I can't give them flat I don't know exactly how it works but as far as I know you have to you have give them like three addresses that these are the places that you're most likely gonna be at mm-hm and if you're not at any of those places you have to let them know where you are and so like what if you're leaving your hotel to go to a pub you have to tell them where you have to if you're within an hour of the place they give you like an hour or two to get back to one of those addresses I know I mean well if you're in the hardest of all hard dates Jesus Christ you sada the vets you cock-blocking asshole I'm out here trying to get my freak on with this wonderful lady try to check my pee at 4:00 in the morning I don't know fuck out of here I don't mind that I don't mind that but I'm I kind of rageous and then you know my legs are open it would be really nice if there was a way where they could I'm talking crazy really I should shut the fuck up because now I'm thinking it's creepy because I'm thinking like transhumanist shit I'm like maybe they just have a chip in you like all the time and just upload every day they know Hey look at that damn heart he hasn't done anything everything's good vitamin B's a little high but that's water-soluble that's pretty much that's a bit much I know I paid a lot more a hundred percent it's a stupid idea what's on that imagine if there was no price and if you had to get a new chip if he fought for a ballot or then there was problems turning off your old chip cuz it was like like if you get an iPhone you try to switch to Android good fucking luck okay they're gonna ruin you with those iMessages you you're not gonna get half your messages you're all gonna be all fucked up so you're gonna have to figure out a way to switch it over so what if one you move over to Bellator you get one of those Bellator chips the UFC's chip cancels out the ballot or chip everybody gets mad one see chip would definitely be way different to the one I've seen ship steroids shoots him right into you right chip in there they'll keep switching on every now and then well Katyn all bullshit aside but what if there was like we know that testosterone levels just in natural human beings it's not fair right they're not fair they're not evenly distributed there's some people that are high-dose dosterone and there's some people that are lower testosterone and it doesn't necessarily correlate with success but it's pretty high and it's probably pretty high correlation with success there's something there right what if there was a way where they would put everybody at the same level electronically they just put this little just chip innately what's going on is your adrenal glands and your endocrine system are not firing cleric correctly so what will do is give your DNA the signal to ramp up its production of testosterone by 170 percent I don't like it so you crank it up so it makes your body do it makes your body crank up your growth hormone your thyroid everything is perfect so everyone fights like a perfect level everyone fights at whatever the number is but then but that's that's natural selection playing out in MMA like I like that natural variance yeah that's what like some people have got naturally heavy hands yes they're naturally stronger than others some people have got more testosterone than others you know it's just it's a natural advantage which I like to see play out and I do too much my idea sucks it's a terrible idea but how long before we see like some sort of like physical equality weed after one it differently implemented but after ever differently yeah you know I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so opposed to the idea that everyone is the same you know that there's something good about everyone being the same like we're clearly not the same at all and some people when you run into like certain dudes like Alistair Overeem you're like okay you're from another planet please fucking size you how strong that do it is especially when he's like when he fought Brock Lesnar you're like okay what fucking planet are you from man cuz you know from Planet where I'm from you're so like ridiculously powerful you know and there's there's other people that just they're not you know they're marathon runners they weigh 130 pounds are never gonna be any bigger than that there's not even there's not even you know some people are Tyson Fury some people are me yeah you know some people are Brock Lesnar some people you it's like fucking it's not even it's just weird like people are we're a weird conglomeration of shapes but then the thing is if it was if it was completely even across the board then there would be the opportunity for one person to be completely superior to everybody else oh yeah where's with the natural selection like you've got you're never gonna get Brock Lesnar winning marathons so you can always appreciate a marathon yes and what they can do you know true that's true keeps everyone humble well it's it definitely shows you that there's merits to all those sorts of different shapes and sizes like particularly marathon runners right if you want to be able to go somewhere and stay alive you know you have to keep moving it's one of the benefits like one of the things that I think inherently we respect about marathon runners is they can keep running and we know we can't keep running so why do you run your run to get away from things or to chase things well what have you chasing something and you get tired what if you're running away from something you get tired they don't get tired that's admirable like it locks into our it's like it's a part of your psyche yeah I've always felt like the optimal like fight condition for like a like a lifelong martial artist is to find that balance between all of those things so you've got you know an equal balance of everything you're not you don't excel at one particular thing you know like you get these martial artists that are just you know these juiced up monsters right right like I can see a glaring weakness in your in your technique already because I know it's got its finite I know it's gonna run out and then I look at somebody else who's they focused entirely on technique and they've got no muscle mass and no finality to them and I'm like well I can see the glaring weakness in your technique because you're gonna struggle to apply it yeah no I mean yeah it's like yes like finding that that Goldilocks zone that beautiful balance in the middle yeah where is that zone I don't know I've been searching for it for my eyelid for my whole life it's different with different styles but here's one thing I can tell you other than a hundred and forty five pounds and a hundred and eighty five pounds every single weight class is dominated by a wrestler mmm stop and think about that but at Henry cejudo 125 and 135 then at 145 max Holloway that's one weight class then you go 255 cubby motherfucking nurmagomedov who's one of the scariest grapplers in the sport you go up to 70 Camaro Oman and Kobe Covington to fucking beast grapplers yeah you go up to 85 you got the exception that's Robert Whittaker but guess what I thought he lost against you over Mero in the second fight I thought Romero blew three rounds I thought Romero beat him I mean and Robert Whittaker I'm a giant fan of his I think he's fucking amazing and he epitomizes to me like the best of all well-rounded capabilities his takedown defense is excellent he's a great striker he's accurate he's got knockout power he's got everything I just felt like in that second fight it just seemed to me that you all had done enough to win mm-hmm but I'm open to an argument against that it was not it was what not egregious like an awful decision where he disgusted by it it was like who think that I want I'd have to go and watch it again but I think you would make a real good argument that yeah well was the only one that heard him and he heard him a couple of times particularly in the second fight yeah I think I had the last three rounds here in that fight he's always a starter people always think that he's you know people always have got this perspective um that he's this really really fast starter he's very explosive and stuff but he's he doesn't he just kind of lulls you in with that slow smile sneeze on you and then explode and go and he's so scary that you don't know what to do when he's lolling because it was long you want to attack him because he's so fucking fast you know that guy when he landed that flying knee on Chris Bob and I was like Jesus Christ he's such a freak athlete man so okay that's 85 Robert Whittaker let's call him that one of two exceptions too I find our weight classes well what's gonna just let's get the mail first because the females are different animals right 205 Jon Jones yep heavy weight Daniel Cormier I mean that is fucking crazy there's not a gut if you wanted to ask someone hey my kids thinking about becoming a mixed martial arts fighter what what discipline do you think you'd start with first it's either like a traditional martial arts where you learn how to kick when you look real little and just learn a lot of flashy kicks cuz you'll carry that with you and you develop leg dexterity but then wrestling hmm for sure wrestling yeah if you're a dominant wrestler that advantage is if you have your real similar into everything else but your dominant in wrestling you're gonna be able to control the clinch you're gonna be able to get the guy down you're gonna be able to do things to them and it just you see it it might not be the most glamorous way to win fights you know sometimes people get upset that someone takes someone down and just kind of hits them while they're down but guess what they're hitting them and they're doing something to that person that person doesn't want to be done and maybe it's not the most exciting thing for you to watch but as someone who respects what the sport is supposed to be all about the like what can this guy do to that guy well that guy can take you down and punch you in the fucking face and you can't do anything about it and even if you get up you say I'm not hurt okay well you never got up though yeah that's this is a viable legitimate way to win fights and the guys who can smash from the top they're the most scary proposition because you can't get up you take it up and khabib zhan they're talking shit to you going come on talk now boom talk now boom terrifying right can't get him off you but that's see it for me I've kind of started to change my perspective because everybody each speaks who kind of divides my MMA into you know the grappling arts the ground arts jujitsu wrestling and then the striking ours like loosely into three categories but I don't I don't see wrestling as a part of that I see resin as like luster Foundation and the glue that holds everything together yeah I think you know I think like when you watch a fight where someone is winning with just wrestling and very little else that's a boring fight because it's not a fight that's a wrestling match right the wrestling is the thing that enables you to utilize the submissions or the striking and like there's something instinctively about is like whenever whenever there's a fight where they're just wrestling or this someone just dominate in the top position and not using it at all the fans get restless they start to boo because they like they feel like they're being robbed of what what they came to see and that's my own it my only criticism when it comes to wrestling is to use just wrestling like you you've got to understand that that is the foundation that's the glue that you bolt everything else onto so that's why it could be so good because he uses wrestling to put people in a position where he can beat them up or I mean Chuck Liddell he used his wrestling to keep people in a position where it could not come out but wrestling's the that's that's the glue that's you know and what he's heard about so who does he's and he instead of having a method of wrestling he has principles of wrestle and he understands that to break a body down and that's like I understand that from a strike in perspective it's taken me years to start to see that from a grappling perspective as well mm-hmm you know like training with the old ten planet guys and stuff like they had quite a quite a what's the best way of puttin it an instinctive understanding of how to break down and control the human body based on the techniques that Eddie had developed and it took me ages to kind of start to figure out that it's not like I'm not trying to learn techniques to do that I've got to understand the principle of it to break it down and to watch the who don't things together against the Demetrius Johnson you know go for the inside reap and then Demetrius Johnson steps out so we ankle picks him in the same process like the principal instead of the method is a beautiful thing to watch there's also the mental toughness aspect of wrestling that I think is undeniable Shore teaches you how to be super uncomfortable at an early age and there's something about that uncomfortable grind that if you can get through that and make that normal for you you could get through almost anything and these guys you see them like perfect examples to who doe versus Marlin mirai's Marlin Rises lighting him on fire in that first round it looked terrifying it looked like Henry's in real danger of being ko'd by a far superior striker I mean Marlin looked huge he look like a beast he's hitting with these horrific leg kicks but that motherfucker never skipped a beat he just fired back up for the second round here we go bitch from right in your face yeah it was crazy watch out the off he is yeah this is the second him come back and start dominating Mariah's in the second round was almost like what has happened has someone put something Marlins drink it's like no so Hooda was just so goddamn tough he discourages you yeah he freaks people out I think a lot of people can't steam out the second fight against Demetrius Johnson the COFF kicks like well when he ko'd wilson hayes I was like wait a minute like now he looks like a karate master like what the fuck is this like he was fighting like a karate guy and lighting Wilson up and I was like this is crazy and I was like okay this like when we're talking about Vitor learning kicks late in his career this is just a super athlete this is what it is and maybe the best super athlete we've we had in the sport arguably when we think about his physical accomplishments of going from Olympic gold medalist in in wrestling then he went golden gloves boxing email that whole story about him living in the gym after he won the gold medal really won two gold medal in the Olympics is from will Harris well Harris told me this and I think there's a video about it from will Harris productions but he he won the fucking gold medal in the Olympics and then immersed himself in boxing and was living in a fucking boxing gym and sleeping in a boxing gym after winning the gold medal in Olympics just drive if that motherfuckers got blinders on and he's just going flipping out some demons there's some demons in whatever it is driving him keep working them out I love it I love watching these extreme outliers like guys who can do things like that and you know you know Luke Thomas was right Luke Thomas has really had a really interesting take on it that I really appreciate it and agreed with said you got to remember that sowho toe early in his career was it wasn't consistent he was missing weight you know it didn't have the best performances wasn't the same he didn't have the same focus and then reinvents himself after the Demetrius Johnson loss and becomes a fucking demon in the gym and works with all these what are those people that came here is in neuro force what is the the company that works with them that works on yeah find the name of those folks so ridiculously scientifically monitored testing of everything he does his workload is neuro Force one neuro Force one so like these there's fuckin scientists working with him so scientists and elite trainers and wrestling coaches and kickboxing coaches and then all sudden he emerges as this murderer right like you see when he blasted away TJ Dillashaw you're like holy shit mmm like this said this Henry cejudo is a different person than what you saw at the beginning of his career like he's he's adaptable you know he's so adaptable it's amazing man I mean that's the that's the thing that's beautiful about it as well he's the I mean he's not only adapted from one spot to another but you can see how his Styles adapt yeah as a martial artist as well he's still getting better I mean I guarantee you getting lit up by Marlon mirai's in the first round is going to turn him into a better kickboxer for sure cuz he knows what would someone did him you know he knows like wow Jesus Christ this guy if guys this guy could keep this up you know but he wilted under that pressure fucking psycho wrestler pressure you know that's real shit man yeah that's kabhi pressure that's Henry cejudo pressure those psycho wrestlers and you can only get that from grind you can only get that from like like forcing yourself through those hours on the mat yeah I'm build that any other way and if any of you stop and you take some time off that muscle weakens you need to start building that spend back over your calcifying you felt your feelings just becoming a psychopath okay the best ones when they're in there might as well be a wolf they just just plow override your feelings yeah I like it there's like a primal breakthrough that you could see in some great fights where it's almost like they're down to just the animal and technique just animal and technique no more person it's just savagery just wild exchanges and savagery and one guy trying to finish the other guy and they're both getting rocked and like holy fuck this could go anyway and even as even as people that appreciate the technique there's still something instinctive about that as we watch it with like that primal feeling yeah racing but thanks everybody so excited when you see a fucking wild crazy war everybody gets fired up or they're like gripping like Adesanya like Adesanya cadet Kevin Kelvin Gastelum holy shit that is the epitome of one of those fights yeah that's Mike Perry yes dude that's another one it's Jesus Christ yeah plates my fucking nose was like a broken fire hydrant just spraying blood all over the back and he still didn't tap yeah and some people think he's still won the fight yeah how'd ya what do you think just have to go watch it again and try to score it I think when whenever is a close fight there's like sometimes I like the way a certain type of fighter the way they like I prefer someone who's doing damage versus someone to take someone down it doesn't do anything right and sometimes you'll have a kickboxer who's lighting a guy up for like the first minute and a half of the round but then the wrestler take them down maybe stay on top of them for three or four minutes but don't do anything and they'll give it to the wrestler yes which I'm like okay maybe but it's I think it's debatable especially if it's 50/50 like two and a half minutes down two and a half minutes up well what happened in those two and a half minutes downs yes you held position but did you get it back from what that guy was doing to you in the first two and a half minutes when he was chopping at your legs and kicking you in the body like I don't know where to score that and I think it's not really it's not really clear it's too subjective no it's over opinion based really yeah you know and it's down to the interpretation of the person watching and this is how your own personal life experiences come into play if you're a sport jiu-jitsu guy you're gonna see it different to a you know a boxing coach or something like that and the other thing as well when it comes to like the stats and you look at the total strikes landed significant strikes landed I always argue some strikes are far more significant than others sure like if you land fifty significant strikes in a round sorry and in a fight and someone lands ten significant strikes but those 10 significant strikes blow your blow your eye out break your nose knock you down one time it doesn't matter what the other significant strikes did if they weren't as significant and I think like with the Mike Perry Vicente Luque fight I would say that that knee was probably the most significant strike of the fight so I'm gonna weigh that so much heavier than then it areas the other significant strikes it's you know means yeah 100% agree with you I think we're living in this compromise of the 10-point must system that we don't have to be what about the way that pride used to do where they would score the person finishing stronger as a heavier because that's another argument that comes in if you look at Mike Perry at the end of that third round you go fourth round fifth round he's got nothing left like that nose is a mess hmm so then I think instinctively I do that and I try not to I do try and score it per round but I think instinctively if somebody finishes stronger which again you're Romero against Robert Whittaker and things I'm around he finished stronger than Whitaker by you know quite obviously yeah and I think that people naturally lean towards the person that is they've overcome the hump but start the fight it's almost like you've you've got a round or two to you can kind of forgive the person and they before they take over well here's perfect example the first round with Liz Carmouche and Valentina Shevchenko that was a fairly uneventful round in terms of significant strikes landed in terms of anybody establishing any dominance you just got to see Valentina dealing with the movement and advancing and landing a little bit more than Liz but that's it not much right but that's a 10-9 round but show how could it Brown where they're scrapping and they're going at each other but no one gets knocked down but fucking wild chaotic crazy round how can that also be a 10-9 round yeah right yeah I hear you but then but that's see that's where that's where people's perspective of fights can can sometimes you know lean one way because if somebody has a really really big last round but they've lost the first two mm-hmm people are not seeing it as in as three sections of a fight to be scored if one person to two rounds ahead sometimes like it like a psycho saying instinctively if someone has a strong round you score towards that person because it was more impactful what they did to their opponent yes so if you take someone down and control them and hold them even if you do that for four minutes of around but for one minute of that round you get lit up against the fence I'm always gonna go towards the person that was doing the light and up but yes that was more significant and more impactful on me as a viewer if I'm choosing a tribal leader I'm going for the guy that had the one minute of success on the feet as opposed to the guy that was holding him down for four yeah unless the guy who holds him down eventually mountain's him like from Game of Thrones and crushes his fucking head with his thumb through his eyeballs girl I was terrifying that was terrifying yeah I see your point I guess but I think for sure that there should be another category of of impactful strikes instead of just significant strikes and total strikes there should probably be rocked like he got rocked like he got like your legs go and you know and you're covering up but then he's a knockdown ultimately a 10-8 round no I don't think ten eight is right I don't think ten is right I think we should have a comprehensive system that recognizes the fact that there's near submissions there's a leg kick that barely touches and there's a leg kick that cripples your leg there they should be scored differently we should have like actual numbers that are attributed to these things we want to have an accumulation of things and how much should we count total strikes how much should we count submission attempts how much should we count near submission attempts what about submission attempts we you're literally Saved by the Bell which does happen right you're literally like locked up ready to fucking tap and that like um Jen's Pulver Vijay pen that's the first one that's a good one that's a good one that comes to my was gonna go with Dylan Danis his first MMA fight okay didn't what wasn't the first one didn't lock up a Darce and the guy got out of it and then he caught him with the darts in the second round is that what happened or my thing am i misconstruing him with somebody else I don't remember but it's that what I'm going with is there's moments where you go this guy's fucked and then the buzzer rings and you're like girl he survived but let's see what happens if he comes back and want to say it's telling dance but no I'm questioning myself I've seen too many fights yeah so what what about if they're knocked and rocked right at the end of the fight like Frankie Edgar against Greymane hard first round that's interesting too how much is that worth right what imagine if the colon had an opportunity to add an extra minute to the round extra minute go Oh God well how about with k1 or glory when they get to three rounds if it's a draw they go one more round nobody goes fuck over gonna sit back and rest right and then pushes the fighters to be more decisive time in the first three rounds yes is it did Dylan Dennis win his first fight in the first round of second round okay so I'm dumb so the first one was a leglock yes so it wasn't him it was somebody that landed a fucking Darce like a sick Darce at the end of the first round and I want to say it wasn't in Bellator now that thing about was in the UFC that was a leglock Dylan dannis who's a top of the food chain jiu-jitsu practitioner he's he's there's so many guys that if you're gonna go to the ground with a guy like that you're in some deep shit for sure he's fucking dangerous yeah he's out in New York at the moment the my YouTube guys were out there videoing with him he's in a real good place no he's interview was fascinating and he's he's a lot more people see the bravado always be until now he's great I think he's you know he's a down-to-earth guy and I think he's uh he's just honest on the journey in taste I think he's with me our brothers at the moment oh it's Montel Jackson no I thinks that's first-round Darce I don't think that's it because god dammit now that it wasn't I know it wasn't Dillon dance I'm trying to see what fucking jiu-jitsu guy was it that slapped on a Darce and then finished it the next round finished it with the dars maybe it's Ferguson it's not gonna Evie this is not gonna work I'm never gonna remember now because it's fairly recent but there's you know that when when someone's locked up but we've gotten way off track but my point was if someone's locked up into submission and the buzzer ends you know that guy was fucked he was fucked he's turning purple and then the buzzer rings and you guys to let go and you're like oh he's not attending that should be worth a lot ten seven I don't know man it's like you're a couple seconds away from death yeah that seems like it should be worth a lot to find it for me um who is it says what they dropped it till score second round dark no no that was one of the most like obvious Darce choke she'll ever see Woodley just smushed him yeah he smushed him but he's so goddamn strong like you could see that darts coming a mile away and he's not stopping it he just ran that fucking arm through and clamped it on his bicep and crushed him I mean he didn't try to be sneaky with it he was just dominant with it it was a that's a great example of like the top of the foods that Dennis for me it is it means perfect life in their own darts I do not see Phoenix how long ago is this what year is February um could be this is UFC Phoenix anyway doesn't matter the point being if you do if you do get caught like that if you do get caught like that and the buzzer saves your life that should be worth it what's got to be worth a lot not for sure not the same as like how is that ten nine like how do you get a ten nine out of that that sounds crazy if there's a 10-9 just like Carmouche and Valentina Shevchenko in the first round where it's fairly uneventful yep you know and then you've got then you've got one round where the fights and nearly gets finished and Saved by the Bell and then their opponent can edge out the next two rounds by stuffing takedowns and fighting defensively yeah they win on decision yeah I really think that there's the there's room for growth there's room for improvement and I think that if someone developed some sort of a more comprehensive system like what is a takedown actually worth why do we have to stick to this ten nine stuff it's like I guess it's like oh I'm going this way or I'm going that way let's see your work like what are you deciding it on are you deciding on okay I have takedowns versus submission attempt and with the accumulation of leg strikes I feel like an advantage was gained and even though much wasn't done with the takedown it did defensively stop the the attack that he was getting on his feet and he was able to impose his will upon him so I'm gonna give him ten nine we go yeah talk about this and experts can sit around and try to figure out what what what makes sense to people who have been studying martial arts their whole life what do you think is worth more who do you think won that round I forget about the ten nine if you had a score it and the Dan Hardy system who do you think won that round and if we did something like that I think we'd get at least an idea what the territory is but were confined by ten nine or ten eight or ten seven it's like who decides who decide why is it ten seven this one isn't and that one is well show me show me what it is show me what happened but then we could have complicates it I see the benefit in the ten nine thing is it makes it more of an instinctive thing like for me like a takedown should be its own reward like if you take someone down you've put them in a position where you want them that's like achtung and control to me so like controlling the center should be scored just as highly as a takedown the takedowns gotta lead to something oh I disagree because I think it's easier to take control the center than it is to get a takedown I don't agree honestly how long what footwork in MMA is is almost primitive really I mean we've like there are certain people that stand out they've got really good footwork but for the most part there's so many so much bad decision-making by people not understanding how to corral someone against the fence this is example why don't agree Tyron Woodley versus Wonder Boy right hiren Woodley let wonderboy control the center for most of the fight but that's like playing God to me if you if you choose to be backed against the fence and choose to counter-strike you're losing until you win a lot of the time but not as much as being taken down because tyrant wind up doing what he wanted to do which is catch wonderboy in between these movements and land a big shot and he did it in both fights and he heard him in both fights but both fights were a similar strategy of waiting for wonderboy to fuck up and not a whole lot of volume and definitely don't charge at that guy ya know save counters takedowns are definitely worth more than control accenture I'm not a dummy not to be misunderstood what I'm saying is that the the goal is the same thing if you control the center you'll be putting someone in a position where you can strike them if you take someone down you're putting them in a position where you can hit them or submit them yeah by their so removed because when you're controlling the center you could still get fucked up like you're not controlling the guy like if you're moving forward and you control in the center it mean you're definitely forcing the action but people get knocked out that way all the time I mean do you remember when Jeremy horn or Jeremy Stephens was it Dennis permeate as he caught with that flying knee remember that yeah well he was getting pressed up against the cage and then boom he explodes out of nowhere flying that shit happens for sure but then let Robbie man huff you know yes mens rolling oh it's one of the great ones like yes but like so we can't it can't be is worth as much but the thing is like say if you say if you're playing God right if you if you've got somebody in your guard and you're you play 50 minutes of throwing submissions up and nothing comes off and the other person sits in your guard and lands a few punches the personally on the tops probably going to win the fight because they were sitting in your guard defending submissions and that you know the defense part is its own rewards sure they were in the top position so for me I always kind of think that like playing God he's very similar to Counter Strike and I was a counter strike her all the way through my career pretty much so my feeling was that I was losing the fight until I landed the strikes to win it mm-hmm and and the idea of control in the Octagon doesn't necessarily mean you've controlled in the center it means you controlling your opponent so you had this mindset that's an interesting mindset for a counter strike you're probably very productive right because you put yourself like the point where you have to get it back already amazing I'm a deficit because I'm giving ground-up the benefit that I'm getting and giving ground is that I'm making them walk into the places that I want him to step hmm right yeah so so like if I if I'm backing up straight and I'm just being pushed against a fence I'm not controlling this into the Octagon but if I'm backing up and pivoting off and catching them with the left hook I'm walking them onto that shot right I would just say that as a Counter Strike or I would have to be more significant in my output just like if you were a god player you would have to be more significant in your output than you would if you were in the top position that makes sense and it's it certainly makes sense that there's a benefit for getting someone to fight your kind of fight mm-hmm you know it's there's there's so many variables they're really in play and some of them are dependent upon maybe you don't really understand what their game plan was maybe the game plan was fight a really unpredictable fight something you would never expect from someone with their style or maybe someone has like maybe some hidden skill that we didn't realize they were that good at it's like remember when Nick Diaz fought Robbie Lawler everybody thought Nick Diaz is jujitsu guy right no it's not with a job like him with kind of like a weird right hook right yeah but it was he was beating his ass before that that was what was different about our expectations our expectations were Nick Diaz was is really well respected jiu-jitsu player who was real tough and young and had had some real good fights I think he started she's heard WEC is that where he started starting some smaller organizations that fight we probably Lola was early though like very 37 or very early like that I'll never forget that fight man he came out he was like Stockton motherfucker and Robbie law was like what what happened here he was like what the fuck is going on but he out boxed him that was the thing that was exciting about it it's like wow like we thought this guy was just a jujitsu guy and meanwhile what he's doing is he's coming out talking mad shit to Robbie Lawler talking shit to him while he's punched him in the face like that was something that I loved about the Diaz brothers though and that's like they've never really had to implement the game too much because there's pressure and the Moxon to force people to shoot on them both have wicked guards wicked they both have wicked wicked you just see wicked guards you know Nick Diaz super respected jiu-jitsu blackbelt as is nate Nick in the jiu-jitsu community they're like you know they're recognized as being really high level so they'll just keep punching you in the face so you decide to go to the ground and let's tap into some of that knowledge get that perspectives on the on the sport and the score and you know the main well I like the fact that they're picking their fights now like Nate take some time off and takes a big fight you know does whatever he wants like I like that I like that he can do that you can just I'm very excited about this fight this fight what Pettis is fascinating because first of all Nate Diaz he's acting like a maniac he's smoking weed during the open workouts he's smoking weed during open workouts I mean his brother was suspended for like a fucking year for smoking weed back in the dark ages wasn't he it was yeah it's like a long time he didn't fight for ages because he wouldn't pay the fine - exactly it's so stupid and meanwhile the Diaz brothers are right so he seen Nate Diaz work out just yeah just CBD bro it's just health it's just that he's getting high as fuck that's what he's doing you can do that you can do that now as long as you're not high the day of the fight your levels will be fine I used to stop four weeks before my fights it was awful I had to back then right yeah but he's he's getting so high it might stay with him for a couple months yeah it might fail the time what was it I imagine when when Nick fought to go me and yet like six times the amount in this system he said he had to be high when he fought a hot brownie in the back or something before he walked out dude that was an amazing fight it caught him with a gogoplata oh let's realize how goddamn good Nick Diaz at everything yeah submissions you know fucking remember when he when he fought cyborg just covered the ground submitted him I stood with him for a little bit and said okay that's enough yeah and the poll daily fight that's the one that I juggle I never would have thought that Nick doubts are gonna not pull out he took him into the John he took him into the deepest water he just said let's just go to war let's go to a crazy war people don't do that with Paul days oh wow he's terrified tenderize the side of my head dude I can't imagine getting hit by that guy that guy his left hand is preposterous huge hands as well yeah we talked about having structure I mean massive hands I couldn't imagine him not having massive hands he has big feet - yeah why tank of a man yeah but that left hand is just one of the best weapons in the sport yeah that's one of those game-changer weapons eclipse people and you see him like whoa I remember being in his corner one time he was fighting Xavier Fupa Park come on cage rage and we'd had a late night the night before as we usually did with Paul Daly's fight nights because he's a bit wild so we've been up to like 4:00 a.m. Friday night Saturday we got over to the fights and he was just it wasn't focused on the fights at all he'd had some kind of noodle pop for breakfast and nothing else and he was just like he's his head just wasn't there he's just you know he was one of those kind of guys that sometimes he would just show up to fight at the moment that it was required and Professor X he was like a 6-foot - Thai boxer I remembered I remember him yeah yeah real long rangy guy very thoughtful dude yeah yeah this yeah it was yeah and he got Paul Clinton he was nearing him and he was hitting with all kinds of stuff and out of nowhere just this left hook just came creeping over the top of him oh he just felt like a plank he knew he could do that to be able to and knows he can when he hit lorenz larkin with that punch I was like Jesus cuz lorenz is a very high-level striker like you remember going Lorenz ran over near Magni yeah and you're like holy shit he throws that oblique kick to the body like a sidekick and you're like whoa this guy is hitting him with some shit and he's swift on the feet man like Lorenz is like he's got a very unusual style of footwork and movement it's like a lot of guys you see them trying to decipher it as he's coming at you and then BOOM yeah the shots are coming so to see him get clipped by Paul and get really hurt and stopped you realize like wow that's how hard fucking Paul Daley hits yeah and you underestimate how long his arms as well he's got a unique buildings wastes like this big he's like he's built like a Dorito he's got really wide shoulders and really long arm turn that power is coming from that leverage were you shocked by his fight with Michael venom page um no not really you know I think Paul can be you know Paul can play the game when he needs to play the game he knows when he's taking risks and when he's not and it was a lot on the line for that and know for sure but that's the one thing that he always complained about yeah was when guys took him down ego can never say in these things sometimes though you know and I think a loss as over a bad performances is much worse for Paul when it comes to MVP you would have never heard the last of it we occupied the same small bit of land you know it's you can't go very far in and out you know without hearing about that kind of stuff he just wanted to get the win yeah I wonder if yeah I see what you're saying and I'd like that he fought that way I like that anybody fights in a way that they can win because if someone can't defend that I want to know and it's not because I want one person win over the other person even if it's a bad fight I like when Styles Clash and you figure out oh look at this if that guy just does that - guess what now people know that they could do that to you and other people who are better at doing that are gonna try to do that to you yeah interesting it makes the sport fascinating for sure but I would say that Paul didn't get into the fight with the intention of fighting like that the only thing I think the takedowns were were a part of his game plan but I think he planned on doing a lot more damage on the ground that guy is so fucking slippery standing up Michael venom page he's so slippery that movement is so crazy to deal with that karate point fighting background they are so good at blitz don't feel I can get close to him it feels like he's so far away and if you try to move into the danger zone they can get to you before you can get to them especially Michael Page who has those long arms and legs and he's so good at keeping his hands down so you don't know where shit's coming from - it's all everything's coming from weird angles and the confidence plays in his yes because he's so confident in what he's capable of he fights loose which makes him faster he hasn't fought since Alima fight right yeah that was bad Leamas Omar he might be one of the scariest guys in the hundred seventy pound division across the board and one Fc UFC Leamas one of the scariest guys for sure he's boom boom I'll kill the lights motherfucker he puts people to sleep no he does he's fucked when he knocked out korish Croft I was like Jesus he knocks out everybody man yeah and his rematch with Rory is gonna be very interesting I just always worried about Rory's nose you know yeah it's always on my mind when he's fighting because that they just don't heal they just never heal properly I want Michael parries I don't know that's gonna be a long time off he was on my flight on the way home and I mean his eyes was like swollen shut and stuff he was having having a rough time but yeah he but didn't he get surgery while he was in Uruguay yeah they fixed it while they were there oh so you left after he had gotten surgery I stayed for a day after ticket Oh get some rest jet like what to kill him with good for you yeah how is Uruguay was it interesting yeah it was it was cool I mean the fans were great you know the they had we had one fighter on the card from Uruguay Guerra Gori Eduardo Guerra gory who was I mean he just marched forward and just tried to you know tried to bring the fight to his opponent he was fighting banned and I it was backing up trying to counter-strike but the fans loved it in other word they were rowdy they were quiet when the fights were going on which was kind of weird because the only the only fans that I've experienced that do that are the Japanese fans you know then when you know when the fights going on they sit quietly they watch they applaud when there's a position change and you know there was some good fights on the card as well the the the Hallion pavani as well from was his opponents name bond Turin I'd manager a bond Turin coin with a clean knee and opened him up a lot of stitches I saw that yeah yeah and the jiu-jitsu guy that uh the middleweight guy oh yeah Adolfo Viera yes Christ yeah probably a belt is good I'm surprised that I'm surprised that he didn't press forward more to be honest I was expecting to be more aggressive because like Viera is good but he's like five six fights into his career you can still you can still bully him a little bit because he might be unsure of himself in the striking a little bit but he did land a hard jab early in the first round I think that like woke him up a little bit and he's got heavy hands but the thing is his squeeze is fucking outrageous his squeeze is so outrageous when he wrapped up that head and arm trying I was like no one's getting out of that like there's some dudes that do that head and arm choke like that where you see their back look like a fucking some alien creature what all the striations like oh my god no one's getting out of that like you're going to sleep he's kind of cut your head off that's horrific those guys that have that incredible jujitsu with incredible physical strength like the jock arrays Paul Harris yeah those guys who have that crazy jujitsu but also ridiculous strength as well are always as scariest yeah look at the size of golden Ryan now in comparison keep Jeff Novitzky but that is the thing about jujitsu is like some of these things have testing and people do have tested positive it's been like a huge disgrace but the ones that don't have testing these dudes it's the Wild West out there they're running rampant remember Jeff Monson remember that monster walking around likely just been chiseled out yeah he was a goddamn Fantastic Four character that came to life yeah when Monson was in there he is right there jacked for the kids jacked yeah I watched him on that the Beast what was it a quintet out in Vegas and he wrote through three guys on that is hilarious as well he's done Polaris a few times over in the UK he's just a monster well it all comes out of that John Danaher hens Oh Gracie school what a witty coming John Danaher all those guys Gary tonin Nicky Ryan Gordon Ryan those are that's some of the cream of the crop of young jujitsu players these guys are all savages and I'm really excited that toning is now in MMA you know because he's doing really well in MMA he's undefeated and he's he's fucking people up standing up to he's getting better at standing up when it goes to the ground good fucking luck right good luck and I think people would underestimate John Danaher as an MMA coach as well you know the experience that he's had like his knowledge of MMA is outstanding I spent some time talking to him when I was up in Montreal a Tristar and I though the way he you know unpacks thing breaks things down and and not only not only breaks them down for himself to understand but for him to be able to communicate that easily to other people for them to understand he's like I mean that it takes a special kind of coach to be able to do that well he's a he's a really really interesting human like if you just sit down talk to him he's a one of the most well thought-out people I think I've ever had the pleasure of having a conversation with he just thinks things through and irons out all his points before he ever expresses him so when he expresses something to you is like let me ask you this there's an edge to him for sure I'll never forget him sitting in a club in Montreal like GSP is there and all of his mates and they're all like dressed sharp and stuff and they like talking to the girls yeah rash guard on of course he did a rash guard paddy pack and a pair of shorts and he was just sitting in the club just now people don't understand John Danaher his famous were wearing a rash guard to a wedding but he's a Savannah special individual you know he's this he's on a different frequency if you never wore a rash guard to a wedding my apologies but I wouldn't put it past you yeah no I said no he did I'm sure I'm sure he Joe that's a true story I mean he is a savant he's um what he is is I think he's singing really focused on like transitions and attacks and patterns in jujitsu and how to improve upon various athletes success and games and he's created these pathways and these guys that believe in them also happen to be super dedicated and very talented and then you have that entire hens Oh Gracie team which is just one of the best lineages of jiu-jitsu in all of martial arts and if you look at what came out of that hens Oh Gracie you know you have Matt Serra came out of there there's just been so many high-level competitors and a million different martial arts organizations hens Oh was like old school Gracie I mean he's from the root I mean that's the purest jujitsu you're gonna find in the world so he's got it's just that's an amazing pool of talent on top having a wizard like Danaher and they're fucking with things and fixing things and finding finding new pathways and how to how to counter things and how to how to switch things around on people and they have a bunch of systems like back taking systems leg locking systems and it's super super effective and the way he describes it is he's able to cut years out of the learning curve of these guys by addressing problems that come up before they come up I mean he's proven that though you know the speed in which Gordon Ryan and Nikki Ryan as well know Cummings and Gary tonin and and for sure they all learned from each other for sure I mean Eddie is also a big innovator yeah in leg locking and and understanding these systems and innovating and coming up with new entries and new transitions all those guys are it's like everyone has their own little piece of ingredient that they're putting into the stew but the result is really exceptional in terms of success rates like they stood out in a world where everyone's trying to kill everybody with jokes and armbars and everybody knows chokes and armbars and they stood out like significantly yeah but was you know that the thing with Danaher as well is to be able to sit on the mat and watch all of those high-level guys work against each other like he's seeing the patterns across the mat yes no this this is I wish I'd had done this earlier on in my career like I watched fights as a fan but then the further into my career the more I was specific about who I watched mmm how only wanted to watch the fighters that I felt like I was gonna benefit from interesting whereas now because I watch everything I like I see the patterns and I can imagine because Danner's danaher's on the mat all the time watching all of these guys every day seeing the patterns in jiu-jitsu all the time the same positions that get exchanged over and over again and you know the different outcomes for each one and he just seems to have one of those kind of brains that just absorbs everything adds it into his filtration system and then figures out the more high percentage stuff and then focuses that as he's as his syllabus and what's really interesting is if he wasn't injured as badly as he is I mean he probably would have gone on to compete and maybe not been as good of a coach yes that's one of the more amazing pieces to that puzzle he was a rugby player fucked his knee up early they fixed it but they didn't fix it right and it was always a problem and he was always like kind of leaning on it in a weird way and it fucked his hip up so how to get a hip replacement and I was gonna get a knee replacement and he's a guy known for teaching people how to rip people's legs apart it's kind of crazy yeah but he's it mean he's a unique individual though you know and I think that is the way that his brain works is it's perfect for jujitsu that's why you know that's why it is British brain is fed so much by jujitsu yeah and you sit and what you see him on the side of the mat you know he's sitting there coaching these guys and it's just it's so calm and it's so well delivered and he always has their full name as well notice which I quite like it but it stands out yeah yeah it's I think it's so important to have these unique characters for us our hobbies another one to have these unique intellectual characters that are involved in the pursuit of people beating the fuck out of each other yeah it's very interesting because we've not even seen the crossover the fighters that are gonna become those people yet either I mean you know Duane Ludwig is a good example and one of the first to really make that crossover yeah like you look at the way that look fought and the way that he coaches his fighters is so very different yeah he jokes around about it but I like that because that shows the evolution you know if I when I'm coaching my fighters I wouldn't coast them the same way that I used to fight you know I it's got to vary a little bit right depending upon body size and style and what strengths you come into especially in MMA but what Wayne what Dwayne is doing is sort of like learning what he learned from everybody watching everybody but not what he did yes crazy yeah he's obviously teaching you stuff that he knows how to do and stuff that he did do but that style of footwork and switching stances and movement that you see like TJ employ and a lot of his other students employ like Dwayne's got that like written out mm he's one of those guys that has a real system like if you look at his book you're like oh my god there's a crazy person it's just like it's been a great way and a great way it's all like he's got everything written out like all the combinations and all the movements and all that this is not like free-for-all and just do what feels good like no he's got like patterns he's following and he puts those patterns on you and you see the success rate from his students learning this thing he was he had a big effect on team alpha-male for the brief amount of time that he was there he saw some good results for some of those guys he's just uniquely obsessed with teaching people how to strike correctly and that's where that's where I think there's a very fine line between like programming a fighter and being a computer programmer you know you get all those systems in place and then that's what like for Azov you just mention it and GSP they had such a good relationship because it always felt to me like four hours was like sitting in the corner with his with his control pad just kind of playing the game and because he because he'd programmed his fighter so well it was just a it was pure it was a responsive thing same with Matt humor and DJ yes and like obviously this is some level of freedom and creativity for the fighter but they've always got that backup that person in the corner that can tell them something and they know exactly what they mean and they just apply it and it works you know and like those those systems come into play and all the codes that are coming in now is it's interesting it's an interesting development I think I think that those kind of fighters will always fall short to the likes of the Adesanya Zandi and there's this Anderson Silver's that can play the game inside the Octagon mmm like the thing Anderson Silva I think the most underestimated knockout of his and it was a great knockout but still people don't really fully appreciate it was the Vitor Belfort front kick to the face because Vito was expecting the low kick and he brings his shin up to block the low kick as he gets kicked in the face and if you watch it from the opposite angle over Vito's shoulder you can see Anderson's look in his Lee leg like that that is so underappreciated because you don't see those cells from the replays you don't see the glances and the looks and the shifts are the body weight and you know so the nuances of the fight that when sometimes I watch these replays 10-15 times from different angles and all of a sudden I'll see something and it's like a light bulb moment I love those moments but yeah Anderson had many of those moments in his career where you recognized that he had seen a pattern and then he just struck on that pattern and hit paydirt any like Jesus Christ yeah it's like max Holloway does it now that first round he's like he's down load round yeah I know he gathers he gathers information he studies their patterns and that's why if you look at max Holloway stats he's first round he's percentage of success he's loved and his output slow but then as these success rate increases so does his output he's ridiculous like I don't know any other fighter that does that no he's brilliant in that in his output is preposterous this outfit is just so outrageous but not as outrageous as Kolbe Covington's kobe covington resume might have the most outrageous output in the sport yes outrageous what about him in the Eastman line do you think boasts outrageous so it's all who's the better wrestler yes who's the better wrestler and who has more power and who can keep that up for the longest because Kobe can keep that shit up for five rounds he's done an amazing job of getting people to dismiss him because they think he's a piece of shit with his Maggie had and all the trash that he does it's fucking brilliant man because what he's done is just insult everybody and anybody get a lot of people talking about him and then fuck people up so it's like whoa this is a crazy combination because it fucks with their head they don't want to lose to this guy they don't want to hear him talk shit after he beats your ass he's gonna still talk shit and fuck there's a slight I don't know depending upon the person but it at least slight burden and experiencing that from a person it might be a big burden maybe you're one of those people that has a hard time getting fucked with and you can't is keeps you up at night and then it's like a maybe maybe it diminishes your performance 20% maybe 30% yeah and Colby doesn't get tired he keeps coming it's terrifying Robbie Lawler just kept bobbing and weaving and hoping for these openings that were never there uh-huh didn't you call me just on you he was punching some ridiculous amount like one every 2.4 seconds or some crazy shit he broke the work rate right yeah yeah something like that against Robbie Lawler no but Robbie just you know it like that first round in particular when he's up against the fence and he wasn't even hand fight in the chokes like that it looked like he was kind of coasting for a couple of rounds with the intention of getting started later hmm but then I just I just think the the intensity of Colby has burned him out faster than he expected I think when you're an explosive guy like Robbie is where he fires fucking hurricane speed bombs at you just and when he does that he's going 100% 100% Colby never goes on a percent if you watch him he's punching like 70% 60% 70% 60% and he stays on you stays on you very Nick Diaz like India's his early days like when Diaz fought Frank Shamrock perfect example look he just puts that pace on you keeps talking shit and puts that pace on you and he's hitting you a lot so you're always tight like you're always tightening up tightening up and it's just draining your battery yeah and you don't want to lose to this guy because he's talked so much shit and you're like well he's talked so much shit when I get a hold of them and guess what when you get a hold of him he's great that's the problem the problem is all those things that fuck with you plus he's a great fighter so the meanness the shit talking all the the magus tough the strippers the cringe you're like oh my god right and then on top of it the fucking output inside the Octagon you're like shit he's doing all that n he's fucking me up he might have fucked me up even if he didn't do all that but he does all that and I don't want to lose to him and he's fucking me up it's like damn do you think there's a point where Kobe thinks you know any point during his training camp like Sherriff stack the odds against myself here I had that moment before Marcus Davis where I thought to myself if I lose here I'm gonna like it I'm gonna look really fucking stupid I think that Kobe is doing a brilliant job of playing a bad guy like pro wrestling style and I think he didn't used to do that early in his career he was a hard-working guy who just went out there and fought his ass off but people didn't give a shit and they weren't giving him the credit that he deserves and so he turned heel and from that he's become the interim welterweight champion he's one of the most talked about guys in the sport he took on a character that's what I think and I think that character is super successful if fucking with people you know I mean and he can fucking fight man yeah you can't underestimate that that kind of car do the cardio is crazy to be able do that for five rounds that's bananas that that pace is insane yeah I'm Robbie Lola stand strong as well he's such a difficult person to hold down I wonder whether I wonder whether Robbie Lola left some of his training camp you know whether he left some of his effort in the gym I would imagine Robbie Lowell is the kind of guy that still trains like he's in his twenties like he's like on it every day well maybe or maybe they train together and when they trained together Kobe was getting the best of it I mean I think they did train together at American Top Team you know maybe Kobe knew that he get out wrestling he knew if he just stayed on him he would break him and out wrestle him I mean when someone has an arresting advantage it goes back to this one more time someone has a wrestling advantage that is a big deal when you start getting tired and this guy has better technique than you and he's not as tired as you are because he's fighting more efficiently and then he gets ahold of you and then fuck him on my back and then you like goddammit and then you try to get back up but you can't and the bells over and you get back on you are got to keep this guy from taking me down then boom he takes you down to Dan again he keeps punching you on the feet it keeps hitting you and making you move backwards and you're just looking to land this big bomb but there's never an opening for it you think he's gonna slow down but he never does so Colby against could be but a catch wait what do you reckon who outpaces the other one dude they could get Ted Nugent to sing enough fuck yeah I think that's an amazing fight if the khabib ever did want to fight at 170 i think him versus Usman would also be an amazing fight I want to see Colby and Usman I mean that's the fight right I mean and I also think if you're going to have an interim champion you should treat that fighter like it's a champion like you can't just take their fight you can't take their belt away if they don't want to fight right now because they're injured or because they need surgery I think we have to respect the championship title otherwise people are going to look at interim championships like it doesn't mean anything it should mean as much as a championship like we're saying you have to fight for the title next so to say that they don't have to fight for the title next and we're just gonna take that thing away from you you just take it away like but you still fight the person still fight it so there's still the champion they didn't lose you just take it away because what is there a mandatory contender that WBA the WBC the IBF no it's just the UFC the FC decides like who fights and who fights when I'm happy that they have interim interim Championships cuz I think there's times and places for that but you've got to treat it like it's a championship and Kobe never lost the championship yeah he won that interim title against RDA and incredible performance and then they just take it away from I don't think you need to like the problem is sometimes you've got the champion defending their belt against another contender and there's an interim champion that's not available to fight but that doesn't mean you have to strip the title from the interim champion that's true that's still it's almost like it it's not a placeholder it's like a guarantee that they've got a title shot in their next fight they're not injured yeah yeah I agree so what 12 months like a normal like a normal champion I just think you know in this day and age like there's this attitude that the fighters need to step up and fight even if they're injured that's that is not good for anybody that's not good for the ultimate the eventual fight itself the ultimate product that you're selling the fans it's definitely not good for the athletes this is hard enough as it is I think the solution to all this and I'm a fucking I'm beating a dead horse more weight classes I love more weight classes more weight class champions and I keep saying this with these no need to move the 170 weight class we can't move that there's too much history there 55 65 70 no no no I want to I want to go I want to use the old pride weight class so we do 55 60 to 62 is right in the middle who are you 62 63 that weird no I'm telling you man that's the weight class to make light welterweight it's right in the middle of the to think of the fighters that we get in that weight class massive adèle could have stopped off there on his way up cowboy RDA we've got guys that could move down I would say Covington Mike Perry could probably make that weight class and then you know the next weight class after that's 177 that's halfway between the two weight classes you're talking madness I'm making up these crazy numbers these are these are the weight class I'm telling you and then gasoline stops off they're on the way up like we were talking about Hidalgo Vieira the the guy that fought the weekend in Uruguay yes I would say he's not big enough for middleweight but I would say is too big for welterweight and I would say the same about his opponent he was light heavyweight in the beginning of his career yeah but even if you stood him next to another middleweight you would be prize well he was interviewing this Bank benefiting was interviewing him I was like wow Bisping is quite a bit larger than him yeah he's just filled with muscle he's a tank but you know so was Pro Harris right yeah he was pretty fucking effective with that style yeah I I loved the idea of more weight classes I think it's easy to sell fives mm-hmm I know but you know yes I mean come on we can have we could have numbers that I don't know about you some people are idiots I just I don't like the idea of moving welterweight it would just be such a shame to lose that weight class oh that's so silly you know the usual the in the early days it was $1.99 for light heavyweight yeah remember those when Tito Ortiz first made his debut was 199 yeah what was pride was that 190 I don't remember it's nine Henderson was like either side of the law yeah he went both right yeah Dan Anderson that people forgot what a fucking savage he wasn't pride whoa a monster have to took a shot better than anybody that's ever lived goddamn here it goes okay so middle weight was 205 pounds welterweight was 183 pounds interesting lightweight 161 hmm yeah so those are close that's interesting I fought it 161 now floats at 160 twice what do you walk around out right now I'm light now I'm like 82 Wow yeah but we're not like I was I would I always start a training camp over two in Japan's when I was at find a welterweight if you fightin you what you would want to fight welterweight again right I bet I'd be open yeah welterweight I could probably make light weight if you want to yeah I'd give it a go yeah there go how much body fat do you think you would try to lose first you would try to lose a lot of body fat first yeah get down in the 70s yeah I could probably I've got about at least six pounds I could lose without you know without it we're looking unhealthy do you eat clean yes even though you know not not this week I'm not good salad for Nia in an L burger we in an out burger last night yeah I'm having a few like um you know I'm walking overall grand and having a good you know some memories because I went to the 101 cafe I used to go there after the Thai boxing fights and so yeah is awesome old school I love it but yeah generally yes I do generally aside and I tend to eat I tend to eat in a small window of time so like sort of six or eight hours and that tends to start later in the day because I'm on a weird sleep cycle because I mean I'm living in the UK most of the fights are you know the main card starting at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday and I'm not you know so I stay up to watch the fights and sometimes then I'll work through into Sunday and doing like radio shows and that kind of you stay awake yeah pretty much my whole week kind of kicks over so I'm usually getting to put about noon and then starting my starting eating at about 6:00 or 7:00 in the in the evening and I eat for a few hours and then stop train late at night as well and why are you in town right now why are you in LA well I'm here for the fights predominantly I've got my my team in town my YouTube guys the Raptors the tills gentlemen they're gentlemen the other surprised me there yeah yeah so we started a YouTube channel about three months ago and hit 20,000 subscribers recently beautiful what does it tell people so basically we're doing we've got a few different series the one I'm working on at the moment is the war room which is my breakdowns of the fight so I do inside the Octagon for the UFC but because I only do the main events and the European cards I get so many messages for the fight so like for this week everybody wanted a Diaz Pettis breakdown and a Romero cost of breakdown so I've done both of them and they're up and this is are you independently correct that's just beautiful yeah now d are you allowed to use footage yes the us here allow me to use very much thank you thanking for that thank reshape that's excellent it was intense well the race is the thing I'm a US ambassador in Europe so like my job is to promote the US here to support I've just I've just taken a job as the head of MMA for UFC gym in Europe was in the UK as well Oh excellent so we've got a load of gyms opening up and my own gym obviously has opened up and then like the YouTube channel was really my main focus because it's my ability my way to communicate directly to the fans because they're constantly asking for breakdowns so I can do that and the Raptors are now doing all the media stuff so they're creating vlogs and but I mean today I actually feel today I was saying this on the drive over because they wanted to come over and meet your big fans of the podcast and everything so I brought the brought them to your show in Vegas as well which they blew their mind but they were supposed to be at media day today interviewing the fighters as part of their job this week so I said I feel like a like a parent taking them out of school for the day they're taken to the mouths drive-thru and then up to Malibu and champs from California Oh given the views yeah show them the tour yeah that's excellent man I think you do a fantastic job of breaking down fight so I was like your analysis of how things are gonna go and one of the one of the reasons I was really excited about you being today is because this weekend there's there's it's a great fight card like the steep ADCC rematches an amazing car amazing fight for that card I love the card in general but the Paulo Costa Yoel Romero fight that's the one that perplexes me like how does that go down what happens when these tool fucking Brahma Bulls smash heads in the middle of the Octagon first of all it's all-time best body fight ever right yes oh for sure absolutely how do you they both like the chairs without rockets they look like statues of gods both of them if you going through options for bodies if you could choose like it's flip a coin these guys robbed either way Costa Romero might have an advantage because he's so freakish he's so freakishly built that I mean you can't imagine someone having a better body yeah you just have a different body it's just it's either two of them there look at yeah well look at y'all and right there when he's posing he doesn't even look what Jesus Christ he's such a tank the thing the difference in the in this in this fight between the two is that I think well we know Romero can fight for five rounds and he will take his time early but Costa comes out throwing gun strengths dangerous man wild cross is very very very dangerous he's got outstanding striking he's got real power and he's fast he's fast and powerful the thing is though is he as fast and powerful as you well and you know he's beating really good guys like Uriah Hall but this is the cream of the crop I mean he's in there against the motherfucker of all motherfuckers at 185 you talk about a dude who just can explode on you and send you flying through the air yeah he ragdolls people he does people to shoot to people when he's wrestling them you just go what the fuck he jumps at them with shots when he knocked out Luke Rockhold with that left hand you like what the fuck not shotgun too many steps in boom and then kisses him get the fuck out of here man as he's as David Goggin say stole souls yeah he stole our souls is a ridiculous athlete I'm ridiculous l is that Paulo Kostas undefeated mentality might play into plaintiff Romero's hands a bit because the cost is gonna come crashing forward and Romero will just take his time maybe and Costa has gassed I mean the guest on The Ultimate Fighter so if he fights hard for a couple of rounds and Romero's you know still strong in the third I think he's a different guy now I really do yeah I mean I think I think Paul Costa is at the top of the heap for a real reason now and a lot of it is dedication well lead Ishmael 9 I was a lunatic I love that guy he's training he's awesome yeah and right Dave Paulo Costa is working with them and talked to me about him and you know how crazy will eat is he's like he measures his food that's it he kept saying he measures his food like that dude has like everything portioned out he's just like a hundred percent eyes on the prize he goes that's all he does his trained he goes this guy doesn't party doesn't fuck around he's just concentrating on measuring his food and training so what about the money that Romero has come into recently crazy jizz mentality oh here's the thing man I don't know if it's real I don't know if they're ever gonna give him that money really but that's the guy not to tangle do security Steve Reed on the right Steve's a bad motherfucker he's got eyes yeah the dudes eyes like yeah fuckers up he saved a couple of shows in Europe that could have gone very good agon South I'm sure I have a little story for you from the the Gdansk show so I'm standing on stage at the Wayne's I'm announcing the fighters as they come out and we have a fight on the card we have a Polish fighter against Anthony Hamilton and I had the voice come through in my ear saying that that fight wasn't gonna be walking so just to drop it off the schedule like during the weigh-ins are going and immediately I'm thinking that's kind of kind of strange and I'm not sure where that obviously you know some areas of Poland there's a racial undertone I wasn't sure whether it's because Anthony Hamilton was gonna get some heat if he walked out on stage the next thing I've got quite a unique perspective because I can see down the two tunnels where the fans walk into the floor and I saw this whole bunch of like skinheads with like bomber jackets and boots just come marching in and they filled the floor space and then they went oh and sat down in one of the blocks and just sat there waiting for him and it was because he was from a rival football firm whoa yeah oh I heard about that yeah that's right I heard about that and that's why they canceled the fight yeah they moved it over to Australia like they came around security they came through the glass in the arena just and if it wasn't for Steve that that whole thing would have gone south like he's the yeah dude you imagine if there was a fucking hooligan brawl in the middle of the UFC I'll be awful terrible for the sport yeah yeah no Steve is uh he's a wise man studies everything how do you feel like Romero and castor plays out if you had a bank on it if I gave you a hundred bucks what do you see I see this play out I think Koster starts fast and I think he pushes Romero back up against the fence Romero defends it do you know covers and covers throws a couple of shots to push Koster back and then I think the second round comes and Koster comes crashing forward and Romero catches him with something right hook over the top something like that the technique I'm watching out for for Kosta which he's gonna be useful for Romero he throws a great body kick it's a left hook and Romero has got this bad habit and you can see all the way through the Whitaker fights every time someone throws a kick he does this like overdramatized scoop with his arm to like parry it out of the way if he's parrying out out the way that body kick is and you wide open for the left hook so that's something I'm watching out for with Kosta I just feel like he's overconfidence he's willingness to take risks and the fact that Romero's patient can take his time he's never in a rush to get the knockout because he knows he can get it at any point in the fight I feel like his patience might play off and cost him I might walk on to something hmm imagine if he Kayo's Kosta and we play this over that it's gonna be completely opposite I know buddy likewise he got a job with the UFC is an analyst every now and then you're so wrong like when Derrick Lewis fought Francis in Ghana I was like holy shit don't go for popcorn this is gonna be fucking chaos this is gonna be fucking chaos I was nervous before that fight start I was like holy shit here we go I'm like Francis and Dawn was gonna be gunning for the title again he's gonna come out guns blazing Derrick Lewis goes to war every single goddamn time they're both enormous like fuck here we go nothing nothing nothing nothing but were you working with crews on that night somebody else who you were working with and they said the words that you never say during a heavyweight fight as soon as it's about to start they go there's no way this is going the distance ooh yeah that's a rough thing so he straight away and I remember this they like I was so excited and they went there's no way this is going the distance I'm like oh would you put yeah that was a that was a rough one man but it's it's interesting how Francis is bounced back Francis just nuking everybody now it's just that mental home yeah he had a con right he had to go through that one fight you know the thing is sometimes we get these fighters coming into the UFC and they're you know they're so talented that they they're in the UFC fairly early in their career before they've had any real lessons especially if they've just starched a bunch of guys like they come in at you know 10 fights into their career and have knocked everyone out in the first round there's no real learning process there because they've not found anyone to challenge them so then they get into the USC and then we get to see them go through that process in the UFC and I think that's what we've seen within garni you know it took him get into a world title for someone to really show him something in his game that made him feel vulnerable mm-hmm yeah then you know we've watched him go through that process it like in the moment it's really annoying because we want to see a mad fight but in hindsight you can kind of look at it and go well I appreciate that as part of his journey now and you know I understand where he was that you gotta give steep it credit for taking fucking bombs in that fight I mean he took bombs in that fight especially in that first round like fuck Francis is always in it when he's standing in front of you when you stand in front of you he's always in it and with steep a managed just slide away from most of them the ones he got hit with he went with them rolled with them the ones who got hit clean with he just absorbed and kept going and ground him out so here's a question for you then do you think you take punches better if you expect the person to punch hard probably because I would say that he took bigger punches from in Ghana in that fight than that than the punch from DC and I would say he's probably more vulnerable to the punch from DC because he probably wasn't expecting DC to knock him out could be could be wouldn't expect to get caught like that in a clinch either there was a really perfect utilization of the clinch work combined with that crazy big overhand right I mean he really set him up perfectly for that and there was something that obviously was a part of his repertoire it was not something that was just oh it was just happened to be there for the moment he set him up for that and that that was just the perfect right hand and he caught him when he was looking I mean he just didn't didn't know that punch was coming clipped him dropped him put him away the real question is what's it going to be like now that he knows that DC could knock him out I mean is he gonna fight from the outside try to land big shots he's gonna avoid the clinch at any cost now and I've got a big height and reach advantage can he keep DC off of him yeah and then also when a fighter has had a lot of wars like him with Junior dos Santos the first fight there was a war right I mean he's had some Wars in his career street fighting Ghana fights true fight was a war he's got stopped in that fight you know how many the mark hunt fight right mmm that was a war yeah yes he'd be dominated right from top position as well and even the Alistair Overeem fight I mean that first round was chaos it was chaos until he wound up stopping him how many of those can a fighter have how many of those can a fighter have before we see them start to fade in front of our eyes and I'm not suggesting that we saw that with him because he was able to withstand the scariest fucking heavyweight striker in the sport and I think the DC punch was just a punch he didn't see and it was perfect yeah and it just put him away yeah I'll be surprised if it happens again first round I'll be surprised if it happens again because I think he's he is gonna be far more respectful of the fact that DC's got power now for sure lighting you're 100% right and like you go back to his UFC debut and like he did fight long like he used to used a real good long jab and a low kick and like recently he's kind of crowded his work a lot he steps in very close with that right hand which often you know offered the clinch to DC he's just ko and so many people that I think that he's like fuck it you know I'm just gonna get in there and just bombs away with these people I mean he makes it exciting it's I think he is the least appreciated successful heavyweight champion ever and I don't understand it I don't understand it he's got everything he's a you know he's a firefighter an active duty firefighter he's a knockout fighter you mean he knocked out Verdoux moving backwards with a perfectly placed right hand he's a fucking animal I mean he fights super exciting he's been smashing everybody he stopped he won more heavyweight title fights than anyone in history he defended the title four fucking times no one's been able to do that that's how crazy that division is yeah and still does not get the respect he deserves and he seems pissed off this week as well good light like a fighter man has an animal yeah he seems annoyed I just I wonder whether that's gonna play into the fight because I got the impression from him that he'd not watched the the previous fight I got the impression that he'd not watched the first DC for me only yeah so that could see that concerns because then the idea of what happened in his head might be very different to what actually happened hmm well God do you really think they would let him not what does that I don't know I don't know I mean there are some fighters that do it just blows my mind and the way he was talking in the interview was like like he's you know and the other thing the thing that concerns me more is that he was talking about how he was winning that that first round you know he felt like he was controlling the fight he was did a lot of good things until DC caught him so if he starts banking on that B and you know just one of those punches that he got caught with he might not you know give DC the credit for you know opening that vulnerability up yeah I think for sure he must have heard all the different people discuss tactics though it doesn't make any sense to me that he insulates himself that well and surest coaches over its strong style they've definitely oh they've watched it yeah they understand what so maybe he realized and his coaches and their guidance of him during training and for sure he knows the DC knocked around so what he's gonna do is go in there and fight like he's trying to get it back the question is is he gonna be able to use that long reach in that height and that power on the outside and keep DC the fuck away from him cuz he's got a considerable height and reach advantage can he stuff those takedowns can he keep DC from getting on top of him can you know yeah if he can do all those things he can get very interesting and if DC you know he's undefeated at heavyweight man I mean I think that's really where he shines you look at what he did to Josh Barnett fucking throws him through the air like a ragdoll when he was in the Strikeforce Grand Prix did he was a monster at heavyweight you know and the wrestling is unparalleled yeah so do we get Jones at heavyweight then I hope so I do I really do I think he wants to do it at light heavyweight though I think he wants to prove a point what DC wants yeah yes lose that weight again do they what I had heard was that he wanted to fight at light heavyweight if he fights John for a third time that's what I had heard and I think I might have heard it from him and he but I would incur if I was in his camp let's say fuck all this dieting bro what do you know when you have a belly you fuck people up you know and he doesn't worry about food you doesn't worry about cutting weight he and he's fast for a heavyweight much like Andy Ruiz you know I think there's a benefit in that there's I mean obviously people there's people that knew that Andy Ruiz was a really talented boxer coming in but there's other people that looked at his body and dismissed him but when you see the efficiency of those punches like and the fact that he's able to uncork so many punches in close whereas Anthony Joshua with his giant arms his long length gets a little bit smothered by that closer distance closer distance and Andy's just dropping bombs on him over the top and big power to him to men and yeah perfect perfect mechanics like so fluid everything is just smooth and fluid who fucking knows man maybe DC's the best heavyweight of all time yeah well I mean quite possibly and there's something to be said for that physique as well there's an efficiency that comes with that you know like you look at Anthony Joshua and ya mean he looks like a physical specimen but the drawbacks would be obvious over rounds where is Antony no Andi Ruiz DC they can just yeah they just keep flowing and it's you know those punches are more about the momentum you know you need a certain amount of muscle mass to get the movement started and then you maintain it with good technique you know like an additional amount of muscle was not gonna make up for a heavier punch really right and he's talked openly about being far stronger in training as a heavyweight than he was as a light heavyweight he just felt better yeah I think it's a sweet class I really do I think is you know look he beat the greatest of all time I mean the greatest on paper of all time at least at least on paper I feel like performance wise there was moments where Cain Velasquez was in his prime where I said like that's the motherfucker that to me I mean I know it doesn't play out on paper because he was injured multiple times of gang surgeries but when he was in his prime man he was terrifying he just didn't stop he didn't stay he had welterweight colby covington style endurance as a fucking heavyweight yet he didn't make any sense and he's slightly bigger than DC everywhere is until i reach him yeah i never attends yeah yeah and you know and he could fuck you up on the feet too may need to do everything he was so efficient and smooth and just relentless relentless yeah no one more relentless than Cain Velasquez in his prime for him it was almost like his body couldn't handle the strength of his brain like his mental toughness was so incredible his buddy just couldn't keep what was it his mind just press forward go go go you know his in his cardio was just preposterous do you make sense yeah DC looks in good shape for the open workouts just yeah I think he's expecting a harder fight this weekend you know where we really got robbed that we never saw phaidor versus Kane in their prime man we were robbed we were really robbed because who the fuck knows more than fire that would who the fuck knows maybe fader would have caught him in an armbar who the fuck knows maybe Kane would have beat the shit out of him who the fuck knows we will never know man we'll never know and now they're both fighting but it's too late you know it's like you won't be authentic and be authentic now yeah I never forget that suplex Kevin Randleman ladle and you like his face just didn't even change can't Cain Velasquez is doing pro wrestling and he looked good he did a lot of wild shit like it wasn't just like you would go out there and fuck around he had they had some serious choreographed shit like he he did some crazy flips and look at this Cain Velasquez this is a fucking heavyweight wrestler Tony James cliff right now screaming in his pants like yes this is better than fighting so does that mean that most of his injuries came from training camp then a man who knows I think a lot of them must have come from fights too it's just the mind that he had that that fucking berserker mindset that just juggernaut mindset just bomb who'd look he was dead behind the eyes man he just was coming forward like a fucking shark he would see him like we was overwhelming Ben Rothwell you see that look in their face like it's very similar to the look in the face you see if a lot of khabib x' victims they're like motherfucker this is never gonna end what kind of animal is this yes yes certain people where it's never gonna end rahman decas was another guy I remember meeting him once and he's same just like his eyes were just like Jamie loves this move that that he did should watch this here's the move he jumps up flips and throws in my back so how can the guy with a bad back fight it seems like she's called what a hurricanrana a hurricanrana or a teaser on ice I don't know that's the name of the move yeah well you jump up and like Oh get your knees around their head and it's pretty water over look at it see tiny focus and do that soon you know who's trying to jump them like that Daron Cruickshank go to Darren Cruikshank's what does Derek wills every rising now he doesn't say yes what is his Instagram page I don't remember he's like the second coming up dumb fry but he's practicing this really weird takedown defense the other day and I was wondering if he's actually gonna try to use it where someone's diving on him and he's drilling this where someone's going a leg and he's diving onto their back and rolling over the top of their back he's going like back to back with them and then rolling over the front and I was like wow man Jaffe pulls this off like you I think nobody would expect that I mean maybe they would now these put it on fucking Instagram but look at that armbar that DJ did yes yes I'm surprised we've not seen a few more people attempting like anybody else can do it here it is this is it the sushi roll yeah watch I mean he's drilling it like unsuccessfully sometimes watch this I mean he's going over the top he's pushing it he's doing it with a woman too whenever this is why for something like that cuz he's uh he's being rough on her boom boom I wouldn't want this big asshole over my back I don't hurt your lower back man oh there see now he's got it smooth this is interesting so it does kind of look like he's actually practicing this if he ever pulls that off in a fight that would be fucking crazy yeah but he's a really interesting fighter and that he's got a great blend of traditional martial arts wrestling and like like he's got boxing style but he also has karate style visit Kukushkin was that what he starts it with he's he's got those hips that kind of come up at the side trying to remember I'm trying to remember what his original style was but I know he has a wrestling base too but I think it was some branch of karate I don't remember it was kioku shin though one of them yeah Shotokan kioku shin there's a lot of good stuff in the readout and was apparent started with Taekwondo so oh yeah so that kind of martial art traditional martial arts style but with also like good boxing and shit he's doing really well over and risin hmm yeah I like that promotion I ordered some of the gloves how do you watch it though you have to watch it online yeah what's your online yeah the good thing with Rison is that usually it's starting when the u.s. is just finished so I'll have been up all night so the prelims will have started at 11 o'clock main cards at 3 a.m. then why 6 I'm waiting the press conference usually with them rising starting so I switch over to rising double espresso stay away keep going write it out keep going did you I mean that's where Kron Gracie started to write yeah yeah very interesting seeing him in the EOC and he fascinating he is a fascinating individual just you know just - he's just got a unique energy about him which you would expect from you know from Higson son of Klaus yeah dude he's lineage they're on a different vibration they are I never forget choke I used to watch that that all the time denali breathing that used yeah yeah dude that's like one of the most legendary martial arts documentaries of all time yeah remember you remember the one day of Zen Mario Sperry yes that was like I do that was like it was it was a day it was a day in the life of Mario Sperry this decided to put one of each of his training sessions from the whole week into the same day they were like five different training sessions the last two he was just fucking exhausted like it was quite cleared they tried to fit so much into that one day right that was fascinating and he was using one of those vibrating platforms remember that was he really stuck out in my mind it was yeah it was the one it was like a vibrating platform and he had a medicine ball on it and he was like holding the medicine ball on this vibrating platform and then like changing positions like scarf hold and like one of them would really help you yeah yeah I don't know and then Hickson had the the elastic around the head don't you remember that remember when Mario Sperry started coaching over Blackzilians No yeah Mario Sperry like became like one of the head coaches at Blackzilians for a short period of time and put on these crazy motivational speeches where everybody got fired up really it's like goddamn yeah and it didn't work out I don't know why I didn't work out but it was a really exciting development cuz I know we're shot Evans was really excited about having him over there and they were all I mean I don't know what happened behind the scenes but I remember when Mario Sperry was like coaching the classes and like getting everybody fired up like damn I mean he's old school yep Carlson Gracie Legend when I was a white belt I was training at Carlson Gracie's in on Hawthorne and Mario Sperry when he would teach you a class he would teach you a class and you I knew who he was I had watched him fight on television and I knew who he was I mean I I was like this is Mario fucking spare him I really lose to Mont would be there and Paquito number all these guys yeah yeah Sergio : was there all these beasts from the carlson gracie hit squad and the guy who teach you and then after he teach you we said thank you and he's like no my friend thank you for the pleasure teaching you thank you and he really meant like shake everybody's hand the most gracious down-to-earth guy ever but it was hilarious he was talking about how we practice his triangle on his girlfriend he's like it was just repetition repetition boom boom boom my girlfriend like no I want you to do is I shut up keep going keep going it's like talking about like practicing on friends like get friends to like let you triangle them over and over again yeah this is when he had white hair at the time so this is UFC 220 he's training would Vulcan owes Damir I wonder where he's at now because he was really good at it man he was really good at like like hyping people up and you know obviously his jujitsu knowledge is top of the food chain yeah he was in a bunch of they all at the corners in the early u.s. he didn't like Vito's corner and that kind of thing I don't remember I don't remember but he's a true legend you know two of those guys I know some things yeah well it's one of those guys from the early days of martial arts that was a real jujitsu master you know I mean he was a real master yeah and they lived in the gym as well but I mean it was like everything about their life revolved around the gym yo like yeah trying to trying to find that kind of that kind of environment now I mean danaher's is we were talking about hens Oh Gracie's I might imagine that's got a very similar vibe you know in a basement in New York mm-hm everyone's showing up every day and grindin doing the same thing but it's such a rare environment to find yourself in do you remember when Mario Sperry got tapped out by that badass Russian dude it was the badass Russian do the Russian dude was the same guy that Frank Shamrock Kayode with a slam trying to remember I'm all Sulu EV who Mario Sperry I look like he opened up a couple of gyms called Hard Knocks 365 yeah that's where he was originally to Google Frank shamrocks mixed martial arts record it's Frank Shamrock slammed this dude in K Odom and this guy was famous for having beaten Mario Sperry hmm and the old school what was it called battle battle Kaede I'm the Rick Street fight it's extreme fighting that's what it was extreme fighting battle Kaede that was where Eddie's organization that was Waco non-full my Maurice Smith so here it is go where are we at here go back a little low hold on sup sup sup sup sup Igor's inovio that's what was it remember Igor's East yes dangerous guy well Igor had cut Mario Sperry open he big-ass gash in his forehead and Mario went up tapping the Igor zenovia was look I think it was a sambar guy yeah I remember that guy tough motherfucker yeah there was some scary dudes that pass through the USA a while back I remember there were two they were from the Red Devils there was Andre semenov in a mosque Sulu EV whoa wait a minute wait was he was in Nova was Jeffrey Epstein security guard no fucking way that's right oh my God look at his face that's him that's crazy dude that is crazy former MMA guy gives alarmingly cagey interview about working for Jeffrey Epstein click on that we've got all this shit to the farm for it alarmingly cagey interview who is this that's saying this MMA - guy Odette's benefit oh so um scroll down a little bit let me see what the fuck he has to say here so that's crazy that we're talking about this guy just randomly Wow he said one thing you told me for instance ok one thing you told me is he got a heads up when the authorities were going to come to his house the night before he said and he says listen what you say is between you and me ok let's leave this alone but anyway feel free to Google ladies and gentlemen that's crazy I was just bringing him up and it turns out he was Jeffrey Epstein security guard that's crazy he was a real veteran I mean that guy was uh on the early early days of the John Peretti promotion he was a beast man I'm getting those video cassettes from yes Virgin Megastore in town UFC two and three man I remember when you first started fighting in the UFC I remember those days yeah it's crazy it seems like it was a long time ago but not really like it still seems like it makes sense 89 I was in double figures Wow 80 99 and that's the only time I've ever been cut believe it or not I've only ever had five stitches you have someone looks at you you're a beautiful man they would never imagine you get hit in the face for a living single as well now whoa look at my face yeah only ever had five stitches that's incredible yeah right and that was that was the third month my USC debut Akihiro gonna hit me with an open palm and it was the seam on the inside the mm yeah yeah going back to the whole idea of why people fight bare-knuckle I've since amended my thoughts on it just too many cuts and I walk because of really because of Chris leoben's last cut from Dakota Cochrane he had a giant gap have you seen it I don't think I have no it's a rough one yeah I already watched the banner go dirty mind Chris leoben's Instagram page I'm looking forward to it developing because I think it will I have no problem with it I think people should be allowed to do whatever they want fight under whatever rules they want but at the moment it it just it just looks like they're boxing with no gloves on yeah as opposed to bare-knuckle boxing which I think it looks very different mmm is there any video at all people bare-knuckle boxing from the olden days look at that picture dude that's horrific armen when he fought Michael Bisping remember his face after that fine he was sat next made the press conference like a bus at him yeah too tough for his own good Anderson Silva's UFC debut ding-ding-ding-ding yeah yeah I know I remember when he knocked out Wanderlei oh yeah yeah he lured Vandelay into a fucking war Harry Monson as well yeah that was a back-and-forth one he could KO you man and if you wanted to stand in front of Chris and you wanted to swing wild punches he'd shot your fucking lights out all day and when he did that to vandal like wha yeah but it's like two different to entire different styles of fighting until like the Chris Leben style of fight in which we all live in the Anderson Silva fight system yes which is like witchcraft I remember I was a bender yeah I was case I when he knocks out tiny frickin without oh yeah you were there I was there and when he fought leemarie I mean people don't talk about that fight mm but like he just dismantled Liam oh yeah he did Murray was a talent that we lost earlier I mean you know made different decisions that led him down a different unfortunate choices all right but but yeah and he's dismantled them in their fight yeah what do you got here right that's me yeah that was the card that he was on but if you can find a photo of him in the press conference afterwards it'll add the Elephant Man I was bad picture here oh this is yeah this was yeah UFC days losing sight yeah you know there it is like Bisping just $18 faunal yeah yeah that was so 15-minute fights as well main events only a 15-minute fight yeah isn't that interesting like the fight what do you think about the five round main event you like that yeah I don't mind it even if it's not a championship fight yeah I don't mind it I just ate gee it changes this boy it changes the way that fighters approach the sport I think it changes that their output don't like there are some fighters that will go okay you want 25 minutes I'll just spread out my same workload over 25 instead of 15 the thing I like about it is that you can be far more tactical and the one thing that I enjoy about boxing is the fact that you can you can implement a narrative in the first round that can play out in the later rounds and you can you can allow it to breathe a bit because you've got 12 segments that are being scored separately you can gamble a few and you can play that game where is in MMA you you lose one round you've got to win to you know we're so the five rounds you can lose one you can even lose two if you feed him very brave and then win the last three mm-hmm so I don't mind it too much I don't mind it too much yeah I think it definitely changes the way you fight right I mean if all boxing matches were like glorified so it glorified three rounds for the non-title fights and there were no three-minute rounds those guys go to war yeah I mean it's one of reasons why so exciting because there's such a high output high volume because they know there's only three rounds hmm yeah it's interesting because tactics do get adjusted hmm you just have to start faster you have to you know you have to do your first two rounds in the dressing room before you walk out what do you think about Pettis versus Diaz this weekend dun dun da I honestly I think and I took some stick for this on on the YouTube but took stick stick stick that's a british ism is it shit I took a shit oh yeah stick sounds like dick no one says that I took some dick yeah I won't say that again I'll just did you know what he's saying I never heard that before I'm try not to nitpick I'm learning I'm still learning no what did you think I think Pettis has got the skills to beat Diaz everywhere really yes I do I think he's I think he's a he's a better striker all round I think he's got a higher fight IQ at least what he shows us he makes better decisions than Diaz does I think the as realized far too much on his toughness and he's and his ego and his ability to walk through stuff and it works sometimes it worked against Michael Johnson you know he got his front leg battered in that fight and just kept marching him down and eventually forced him into a boxing match and that could happen against Pettis there's no doubt about it my feeling is that Pettis has got the skills to start setting Diaz up because Diaz is very predictable you know you can kind of you can make him walk the directions that you want you can make him lean in the ways that you want to lean if you've got the ability to you know to land the strikes that man that matter then then you can put him out and you know same thing with cost to having the body kick to the left hook I feel like Pettis has got well he used it against Tony Ferguson he used it against michael Chiesa it's a right body kick to a straight right and because Diaz is southpaw and he leans so heavy on that lead leg blocking the body kick and eating the straight right might be something that Pettis is gonna be looking for but I just I feel like Diaz is there to be hit and I think he uses that to his advantage because he kind of Homer Simpson's people like you wear yourself out hitting me and then I'll start to push my my game on you but when you think about him against talented strikers like you brought up Michael Johnson who chopped at his leg but he want to beaten him up but the Conor McGregor fight the taunt Connor is a very skillful striker and in both fights he wasn't really able to do much with Nate he clipped him a couple times in the second fight and dropped him and you know there's speculation like did he drop because he got knocked down or did he drop cuz he felt like it was a good enough punch to lay down and have Connor come and meet him and wrap him up and catch him in something which he easily could you know you don't know I mean he part of his strategy might have been trying to lure Connor into following him to the ground for sure the doom tried to do that against Mark Hunt sometimes you know it takes an overhand yeah he did to fade or yeah yeah I mean I do feel like Connor caught him at least a couple times clean and wrong he's definitely dead he definitely did but then Nate came back and it was a really close fight at the end we're really close fight an excellent fight but Connor McGregor is a fucking skillful striker and I don't know who would win Conor McGregor vs. Pettis but Conor McGregor has proven when the Dustin Poirier fight in the jaws a Aldo fight he's proven in the Eddie Alvarez fight he fucking shuts people's lights out was not able to do that to Nate Diaz so on I think you I mean in my perspective you might be under estimating Nate Diaz yeah this is a lot slicker than he appears and he's harder to hit he he knows how to use his jab in his long left hand he's not like the best kicker in the world but he's never really had that as a part of his arsenal but his ground game is super super high level he's tough as shit his endurance is ridiculous and I don't like about it sold underestimate any of that one thing I will say though is that the difference in the way that the fighters absorb punches is different so all the people that you mentioned that not that got knocked out by McGregor they were all leaning heavy on their lead leg so to me that is like hitting the punch bag that's hanging from the ceiling hitting Nate Diaz is like hitting a punch bag that's standing on the floor because he's weight is so spread over his base that when you hit him you know that like those inflatable stand-up punch bags if you blast that thing in the top it just rocks away and comes back right now it's like it's like a reed in the wind that's that's how he was able to absorb those shots from McGregor because as they were coming at him he was already moving away and he was able to ride the power and then McGregor was overextending you know and I mean there's no doubt is a durable individual I'm just saying that he leans on that sometimes too much yeah it's also we've seen Pettis now at 45 55 and now 70 it's really wild to see and you go by that wonderboy Thompson knockout it's like man maybe this is weight class look if he can do that to wonder boy maybe this is his weight class maybe I mean maybe this guy's been just torturing himself dehydrating himself and not fighting like he's capable of cuz his body's always weakened like his number one complaint was when he went down to 45 he was a dead man yeah you can tell he looked terrible his body just couldn't do it so he goes back up to 55 and like discouraged and then on this wild whim takes his fight at 70 against Wonder Boy and fucking Superman punches him in the mug UK owes him like seeing Wonder Boy alcohol for the first time of the UFC fight and seeing it happen because of Pettis and I mean he's gets tagged again why is that he's totally stiffed like Wow yeah he's definitely got powered like no doubt about it Tyron Woodley couldn't stop him nobody else has stopped Wonder Boy have they no no just a few times but not stopped smiles Vidal wasn't able to stop him yeah and then you know maybe you underestimated maybe he wasn't expecting Pettis to have the power to knock him out I'm starting to feel that's a thing I'm starting to feel like if you're expecting of the power you're more you're more brace to you know I mean sure you shock absorbers on your ready to ready to absorb that it's a good argument so they were like the other thing the other thing to keep in mind is that you know Pettis at 170 is the same human that he was at 145 but without all the suffering mm-hmm you know so it is it's finding that right amount of suffering and I think a little bit of suffering for a weight cut is good I liked it I always thought about it I always likened it to the march to battle you know like if I'm if I'm you know the Peloponnesian wars and picking my sword and shield up I'm not stepping out of my house onto the battlefield I'm stepping out and walking miles and miles so that process that was the that was the weight cut for me you know the the walk into the battlefield and I enjoyed that and I think that we saw McGregor at 170 didn't have that you see McGregor on the scales at 155 145 and he is feral white he's wild you saw him on the scales at 117 he's smiling he's rubbing his belly he's not march to the battlefield hmm you know and I should think there's something in that psychology as well I like it even if it's a small weight cut and I've done I've done everything from 3 pounds to 16 pounds and I know how I felt across the board how did you feel best about eight Nate was good for me because I heard a little bit back on you feel strong and big for the weight class but you not depleted mmm i well I mean usually I would be back up to like 184 186 when I was fighting at 170 mm-hmm that was my that was my good way around 184 was comfortable because I didn't feel too bloated and too slow I've been up closer to 190 before and it just didn't suit the way therefore so there's a point of diminishing returns for sure you know and did you use IVs during those days one time I used it only one time and never never ready it was old for me it was always a it was quite an internal process because I always cut weight on my own and I always found it strange yeah I always do don't have anybody rubbing shoulders no no me with a room card yeah I've seen that it was always a personal thing for me mmm so like you know running through the streets of Tokyo with trash bags on or oh sitting in the corner of the sauna in my own head who's the most ridiculous weight cutter you ever saw terms of volume oh man Anthony Johnson for sure oh yeah that's right like well when I fell so when I fought him in Seattle he could wait that Tuesday Wednesday Thursday night to weigh in on the Friday and and I don't know for sure this but I from what I understand he was 214 on the night when he rehydrated he looked like a different human being oh my god and I remember from 170 214 yeah it was ridiculous he was massive and like my whole game plan because it this for me that and this was this was a good lesson for me I cuz he punked me in this one I put all my eggs in one basket that's a phrase that everyone yes yes so I thought if I can trash talk him in to make him wait I'll make sure that I can get him tied in the fight and then I'll start to wear on him in the in the later rounds with my footwork and my movement and I just come off a knockout lost two collar conned it and then I get caught up and I've got Anthony Johnson who's never not not to anybody out at welterweight so immediately I'm thinking to myself well first of all somebody at the USC hates me and and second of all I've got to deal with this monster in some way so I thought I thought it's gonna be a rough fight he's gonna throw power at me so if I can at least get him to throw and fatigue himself then my window of opportunity will come later in the fight and the the original main event was Tito against Phil Tito against nagira and Tito pulled out the fight injured so they put Phil Davis in and immediately I got a message on Twitter from Anthony Johnson DM on Twitter and he was like I can't believe that even bumpers up to the main event we need to steal the show we need to you know like and we we were friends we used to do signings that tap out with tap out and stuff all the time so we were going back and forth throughout training camp this is gonna be great we're gonna have a wild fight we're gonna you know just kind of basically kind of psyching each other up for the fight me coming off a knockout I'm thinking to myself there's no way he's not gonna try and knock me out right right so I went into the fight with the full intention that we were just gonna like I was gonna have to move around and cover and you know try and counter him until he got tired then I was gonna take advantage of that he hit me with a head kick like early on in the fight and I blocked it it didn't knock me out and knock me down he knocked me over it was just a heavy leg just like being hit with a tree trunk bang I hit the deck then I think there was a scramble back to the feet and then he took me down and I dislocated my thumb on that first takedown and you can see in the fight I actually reach over it because I was in a I had him and my guard I reached over and put my thumb back in oh and that's still crooked look it's still not still not quite right but then like he just drowned me with wrestling and I I had just not I'd not prepared for that I put all my eggs in one basket it was gonna be a counter strike in match and I was gonna defend these strikes and I didn't expect him to try and take me down at all dude I think that weight class when you when he was cutting down from way above 200 to get to 170 I think it tired him so badly that we didn't see the real Anthony Johnson til he went up to light heavyweight which is so crazy remember he missed weight at 85 and Vitor beat him up is it 197 he weighed in something crazy like that but I think he's next fight after me was a Andre Arlovski heavyweight look at what he looked like at 170 Skeletor yeah and then look at him at 230 crazy as a light heavyweight he was the scariest because his power was fucking immense but he's another guy he fought at heavyweight in the PFL and fucked up Andrei Arlovski and now he's a million pounds now he said they he's so big when you know I saw him in the in the lobby of the hotel in Stockholm Africa for AL exec Alexander Gustafsson after he not gustafson out when I walked into the lobby of the hotel he was there taking a few photos and stuff and I walked up to him and I said I'm glad you didn't do that to me and he shook my hand he went I liked you though he won he's a perfect example of a guy that when he wasn't depleting his body we got to see what he could really do and like the Nogueira fight Oh My Jesus yeah he want his feet with an open is extraordinary when he knocked out clover with one punch yeah like god damn this guy's extraordinary but it was really interesting when I talked to him when he retired he retired in the Octagon he said I'm an athlete because I'm not a fighter because I don't like doing this I'm just good at it like wow how crazy that probably the most dangerous knockout artist in the history of the light heavyweight division well I would say that yeah I would say who fucks more dangerous than Anthony Rumble Johnson yeah if he connects on you the only person that absorbed it was DC DC absord that head kick he's absord a big right hand the first fight that sent him scrambling mm-hmm yeah ridiculous puncher ridiculous especially especially he's you know he's a comfortable wait for it dude the Glover fight was stunning we never saw a girl get knocked down and it also had boom one punch Bank how cold yeah remember the yeah the knockout that I always remember is the Shane Carwin Gonzaga fight mm-hmm cuz that was like a six inch punch oh yeah Gonzaga just folded on the spot didn't he ko Jamie man or two oh he did yeah yes he did he fucks everybody up yeah except DC DC just had that number takes those shots oh well he takes those shots oh well his wrestling's are so overwhelming yeah and in that fight you know just wasn't like physically prepared to do that and twat any it's that same game plan twice nice I've caught him calling it the grind cycle you know he just you get she trapped in that cycle you know he push you against the fence he takes you down he beats you up to you give his back strangles you you know he's it's a it's a beautiful thing to watch she's very very it is I'm so curious as to whether or not he's gonna be able to do that again this weekend well what he's gonna be able to do this weekend a steep a and what what steep a has for him what he has what he has planned and how he approaches the fight no he's got to know that this is it was hard to get this rematch and DC's on his way out DC's publicly saying this might be his last fight he doesn't know and then Dana White is saying reluctantly I'll let you guys fight at light heavyweight if you fight John Jones the remaster still they're talking about another fight other than this fight which I hate I never like that yeah and he's what a year past he's past the date he said he was gonna retire as well right DC I think he said at forty right did he say forty yeah so it's at the end of 2018 you know what don't keep bringing that around it yeah I'm talking about getting back in there one more but you seem to want it for it seems to be more than just for money for you it seems to be something you want to challenge yourself one more time and and for people don't know your career was taken from you in a way that you feel like didn't medically make sense they told you to stop fighting because explain the whole heart condition thing what it was it was individual my boy I am part wolf yes yes I won't tell you which part yeah I was it was in the build as the Mike Brown fight at the Mike Brown matte Brown fight and because it's California they required a bunch of different tests and it just it showed up as an irregular heartbeat it's like I have a second heart heartbeat so it's another bunch of cells in the heart that produce an electrical current and it can confuse the heart cause cardiac arrest it can cause you know electrical issues with the heart I've never had any problems never had any symptoms as side effects or anything like that so basically what they told me is that if I wanted to continue fighting I had to have an ablation so they had to go into my heart and there to burn there deep the cells that were produced in the second electrical car arc I've never had anything wrong with me at all healthy I've pushed myself to whatever limits I think I've got and I'm you know I'm hoping to find some more but I pushed myself I know what my heart's capable of and I just I've never doubted it I've never felt we were known for having good cardio yeah I always pushed I always push the pace and so I I just didn't want have anything done they said and then literally said to me you can have it done and still fight on the same day this was five weeks before the final gone so it just to have it have its own five weeks so how much recovery time Oh practically not they look whate to me going into the the carotid artery and the femoral artery and they go into the heart but Lorenzo sent me out to California what what are they going in there I don't know some cables being goes wrong yeah exactly in the nine the iron man I mean yeah come out with powers but Lorenzo sent me out to a to Beverly Hills to a specialist out there to have more checks done and they couldn't find anything of any any anomalies with my heart no like additional growth or anything like that so I just said I'm not having anything done I went back to the UK and then I was busy for a few years doing the commentary but I did go and see a specialist a cardiac specialist for athletes and he put me through all the same tests and he pointed out what they'd seen and he said that it could have been accentuated because I was in I was weight cut and I was in training camp I was tired he said but ultimately these there's nothing in these records that show that you can't fight and you're not safe to fight so I have the paperwork now so performance and you saw the test important I've just got my I just got the option to step back in there I would like one more because I never felt like I showed what I'm fully capable of well as boring oh I spoke I spar regularly I drop in the gym because I've got I've got guys that are training for fights so we've had Terry brazier fighting recently Alabama singer Dean Truman for recently so I've been in there moving around with those guys and I never really gotten out of training training you've always trained martial arts yeah this whole time right yeah and I've always stayed healthy I never gained any I actually lost weight after I stopped fighting because you know my my diet changed I didn't feel the need to be constantly eating all the time so I just I allowed my body just to kind of figure out where it wants to be naturally 180 to 184 is perfect for me so my plan is just kind of get to about 85% condition and just sit there and then like I mean this weekend is a great example if like you know Pettus or Diaz fell out and there's no one else around that's the kind of place I'll just throw my name in the Hat and just to be available and one of those fights will be perfect for me just uh you know one of the veterans of the game someone that's like not too concerned with the rankings or anything like that drop in there have a great fight and then step back out again and just how you'd like to approach it you want to immediately jump back in find someone with a big name oh for sure I wouldn't I won't want to because I'm having one more fight I want so much one more that's it I want someone that everyone knows but if you love it though well I don't know I will love it but I feel very sick I feel very selfish thinking about fighting again anyway because it's not what I've realized since I've been fighting it's not just me coming out of retirement it's my whole family well I was I was there I was there when Till got knocked out in London I was there when Gunnar Nelson got knocked out in in Glasgow I see the reactions of their family I know what I put my family through and because I've had time to kind of step back and like allow them some time to you know that the souls aren't as calcified to the idea of me fighting anymore you know so it's a serious conversation to have but I mean the reality is like and and you know the sports very different now everything's change like when I was fighting GSP the conversations I was having with the media was you know what we are and aren't allowed to do you know what's legal what's illegal so it wasn't really about about why I was doing it was about I was basically being an ambassador for the sport while I was in training camp so now it would it would be far more of a an internal journey I'd be able to to really embrace it a lot more and focus on myself you know and now I've got you know my camera guys I'd like to document the process I'd like to be able to speak quite candidly to the camera and just bank a load of stuff so after the fight I've got all this all this footage that I can put into something to kind of give some insight into the the mentality of the fighter and the ups and downs of training camp because you know the days you show up to media day to the press conference and you're like you know you you're confident in the stage and you shit talk in your opponent and you smile and stuff like you might get back to your dressing room and you might be exhausted you might feel like shit you might you might have been playing the game for a particular reason and Lisak there's a good reason you're playing that game and I think that a lot of those narratives go untold because the sport moves so quickly and I think I might be able to give like a nice little insight into that so if we are going to expect this how much time do you think you need to fully prepare where yeah right now I always work on percentages I would say physically and can I would say I'm about about 58 percent conditioned 58 that's an interesting number yes choose that well because I'm working through a couple of injuries so I've not been doing a lot of hands-on stuff I've been doing a lot of training on my own I'm starting to build my aerobic base again but the one thing I've noticed is and like I'm I smoked most days like my conditioning like always is good like I can just get out and run ten miles and feel comfortable with it and that's never changed so all I want I need to do is just kind of just kind of test that that the toughness in that condition now and push it you know to the points where I feel uncomfortable how old you know 37 done but I'm you know I'm healthy I'm not I you know I'm not drank in 20 years I had a ibuprofen since 2009 you know I just I have nothing and you have been out of competition for how many years now it's been seven years yeah I told you I work in cycles yes I do this is my this seven-year cycle this is a man I hope you do it I hope you fulfill your Vision Quest like Matthew Modine in that movie thanks miles fucking do it it'd be beautiful to see and we got to do this more often man yeah I really enjoyed this thanks - always good so can see it's just you know I live so far away now and I'm in the UK any time you're here any time we're around I bring a mobile thing we'll figure it out on the road okay if you're ever at UFC events okay thank you brother really appreciate your Manito can see Dan already ladies and gentlemen goodbye [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
