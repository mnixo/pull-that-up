a thing Oh nobody switchblade Wow we just collect knives and we're just well you know I'm such a country boy and when I did Idol every night when I walked out on stage and went biddy biddy biddy biddy biddy and i'm walking next to JLo and Randy my knife was right my pocket in case of just one thing no open my fan mail oh okay yeah switchblade to open fit it's it's fun it's a cool thing is fun I don't often carry it but I I thought because I think you're so fucking cool that I would bring a couple of cool things from my house you know I'm just like that oh thank you I'm one of those guys who want to leave the house I go say go buy a house remember I got a son and three daughters right so and I know after watching what was the what was your last triggered that you got a bunch of kids - mm-hmm and it starts wearing off on you sadly it's a beautiful thing I think it's a beautiful thing to hear three girls yeah wife and two girls I have three girls three daughters oh wait it will happen to you I do - oh yeah you're a legit eccentric like there's some people that pretend to be eccentric mmm you're like a legit one I am and I love it in fact I love me it's good to love more than that I love us I love us - I love us I say they're all super happy about this I'm so fucking excited okay seriously I gotta ask you what the fuck do you eat for breakfast how did you get so fucking smart oh I just remember things okay because that's the difference there's a difference between being smart and just remembering a lot okay you everything yeah I'm not that smart well remembering things is huge it helps certainly helps yeah but what is smart right smart is like can you solve equations can you figure things out that other people can't figure out do you know things other people don't know no I just remember shit that smart people have already figured out but you accumulate situations Jimi Hendrix same experience yeah experiential so if you remember those things over and over you're gonna become a wizard your wisdom is so good thank you that's you're so like that's why I watched your show and I watched the beginning right before you walked out on stage the triggered and I saw two things that was it came to my attention was one you were talking with your producer whoever they said there's your chair and by the way your bottle of waters right there we need those guys right oh for sure and the other thing is you were sitting on the couch alone reading your notes yeah yeah and you showed that yeah it's a beautiful thing I can't live without my notes I can't I fly at such a speed such an altitude that I can't remember what I did yesterday but then I have long-term where I go yeah that was a three months ago but I just thought I would read you a timeline okay as I saw you reading your notes okay yeah April 15th lunch were the kids in Venice my daughter lives in Venice hi Chelsea that's a long time ago drove to San Diego yeah you know a month because I don't have good memory right all right drove to San Diego that night so you write things down like after you did them just to solidify them in your head no I just came from a whirlwind of press and by Steven Tyler Day and released a documentary the KC tebow did and all this shit happened and we played the the Jazz Fest in New Orleans and that happened in the last two weeks and I just said to Amy what have we been doing in the last where have we been right so I wrote it down drove to San Diego after Venice I did a private show flew to Orlando that night right okay private gig with David Foster Katy Perry pier from Idol this girl was so sweet rehearse with the band and during the break from the band I was in Disney World I rolled my I rode my roller coaster and I just got back from Disney World and I rode your roller coaster yesterday so you know you've made it win right see one day before yesterday so I'm going through this list I won't blame it we want and it was just you know rode the roller coaster then Ryan / coaster the motion tracking rollercoaster he's great right two times it goes up like that and it goes backwards yeah zero to 60 in two point eight seconds pretty dope yeah sick electromagnetic propulsion dude dude what are we doing here what are we doing here so then I want to order the animal kingdom to visit some of my old girlfriends no I went to a you know shit I fucking the holy shit is that avatar right intense the the one when you get on the bike yeah like you're flying on the dragon in virtual reality that's the greatest ride of all time the greatest I think it's called flights of passage involved in my beats like that Navi oh yeah I just got I went to just to break here for a second I went to Betty Ford eight years ago because I got fucked up with my foot stuff and just stuff with your foot stuff I had an operation on my foot you know and I kept the meds right by the bed you say would you get done with my girlfriend so they were right there and I thought when five minutes ago when I take another one that's what yeah that happens to a lot of people with those pain pills and so I checked myself a debate forward but if I know while I was there they let me out a couple of times I saw avatar eight times did you get avatar depression know what that is no no I became her right I joined some one movie oh no not Sigourney Weaver the other one right yeah the girl and not the guy became her but watched her moves in she's pretty dull I cannot wait for that to come out yeah it's gonna come out soon okay then we back in we flew right to New York City after the show yeah okay went to see Bruce Springsteen's one-off on Broadway that night how was that sick sick he's so good now I gotta tell you I'm not the biggest Bruce Springsteen fan but I respect him I love his music I know we became a phenomenon like 72 like when we did and sitting there and watching him be honest and talk to this this crowd and sing songs and play the piano and talk his truth and then he said something like um he goes you know this New Jersey thing or the pregnant pregnant pause he goes I invented that and that was it he won my heart because when someone says that it was so real and so true but Sinatra was from Hoboken yeah and I'm from Yonkers okay or the brother or the Bronx I was born New Jersey - were you yeah NORC Wow faster Newark New Jersey trivia and right where you were born they put an airport I think was already there hmm so you lived in the high-end neighborhood really okay so that night flew flew right to New York City after the show went to see Bruce Springsteen I said that redundancy and you loved it I loved it I loved it then I did the next morning woke up did a Harper's Bazaar shoot for the cover with my daughter Liv Keith Richards daughters were there all that stuff after I hung out with Lenny Kravitz had a nice couple slices with Lenny my bro flew to Muscle Shoals right after that and recorded a song with Nuno Bettencourt sick as fuck so good so good that was that was three days of this this is a hell of a timeline you got going on here yeah and it was the next day I went right to Rick halls place who passed away like three months ago and his son Rodney Hall works the place it's called Fame studios mm-hm and and I sat in a room he took me all over the place and I walked in to like the demo room where you could smell the oxides off the tape Wow with like Percy Sledge demo wait a man loves a woman you know that first shit the first stuff Wilson Pickett and I'm sitting in the room with him and I'm telling you man I started to cry I cry I welled up three times it Wow just to be in the room I'm standing doing the vocals - brown sugar right we're Little Richard's hang right where he sang I see a picture on the wall of him standing right there and this is all in Muscle Shoals yeah muscle shows did you see that documentary I did i watch the documentary first of all i said i'm in what is it about that place I got out of that place okay here's what it is it's the vibes if your intervals if you're into living if you're into feeling live you can always feel sad when your mom dies but you gotta amp that up you got to feel good when bad things are going on you gotta thank God when bad things are going on you got to be into crystals love you to love your girlfriend try to be happy - I find the positivity in negativity and then when you listen to music and your very favorite thing in you close your eyes that's vibes that's something you can't even talk about really it's how you feel personally whatever you've been through in your life those vibes of those songs Wilson Pickett Little Richard I mean the Allman Brothers right started there Brian so when you listen to the Allman Brothers you're in the room where Gregg said to his brother let's do this song so do you think it is because all those talented people perform there and they like let it soak into the building this is that what it is because there's this places that do have like a magic to them I always talk about the Comedy Store like that mmm the Comedy Store isn't magic to it when you're there there's something about that place that like it feels like great things have happened in that place before you feel it in the wood you feel it in the carpet it's just it's in the air if you feel like that was Muscle Shoals is it this is it because all those great artists have performed there and like almost like the room has a memory of it I think so because there's some scientists that think that things have memories it's it's a weird impossible to prove idea okay well when you die did you know that you that you're on the table you die and if the table is you're being weighed as you dial it goes down a num 20 syndromes no huh that's not real it's not true no it's one of the things that people would say sure yeah there's no way of really measuring it's one of those it's one of those hippy things that people love to see sure pretty sure Jamie much google it I'm pretty sure this anyway I believe in that I do too so I've walked in the room and like check this out so if one of my favorite Hendrix songs well are you and are you experienced right not necessarily stone but beautiful me well you walk on stage and go fuck me these edibles I walk in here and go fuck me I didn't do my nails but you Y and these edibles know I used to do all kinds of crazy shit what do you mean draw drug was well you fuck yeah of course well yeah well well you were being born I was walking on York City with John Belushi Oh knocking on your door to get some blow I mean we were good good friends we it's what you did back then I believe that in the spirit of music was think of it this way why do you think they call booze spirits and when you listen to your favorite songs you want to fuck your wife hmm I think that spirits you know wherever it takes you whatever feeling it is whatever when I went to Muscle Shoals I put my hand on the wood I felt the room because I knew Little Richard's stood right and fuck in front of me right all I gotta do is close my eyes and go back in time for a second if I you know what I did a song with roots rock reggae play the funky music and it was shit see I don't have a long term memory who did that song come on help me play that funky music white boy no roots rock reggae um roots rock reggae who's up who's the best reggae artist of all to Bob Marley okay son calls me up and goes you got to do the song I go in they put in they put on the two-inch tape the oxide the old-fashioned two-inch tape and I'm in there ready to sing right and I'm they start rolling and I'm listening I got I got everything turning up and I hear Bob walk into the studio I hear the drummer sit down on the drumset and his stool squeaks any farts no but as you can hear him pick up sticks you hear hear the bass player fucking around with his bass and talking to Bob man what you fucking will do feet how are you feeling today Mon and I'm in the room with Bob Marley so what is spirit if that's not it I made them play that back again for me because I just write close my eyes and you're in the room with Bob mono but there's certainly something right when you hear a song a great song from the past and you get goosebumps and just feel it inside of you you get moved but what does it have to do with booze I think booze is called spirits because it puts you in that place right foni releases mission releases ambition socials great truth serum isn't it it is but is it false or is it just that it just gets abused I think it's not false exactly it makes you say things you wish you didn't then you go I was lying I'm not a fucking around well you could be in love for a moment bitch you know fuck you fucking fuck nice tell me you never done blow I've never done blow ever known for don't drink either I drink okay cool yeah I when I was growing up my friend's cousins so blow and I saw disastrous results and I was scared off of it when I was very young Wow then I had some friends that as I grew older had blow problems so I never touched it see you're one of them as Joran or me nor me in some ways but I've done a lot of differently me like you said in that in your last that last documentary just joking you are farthest from the Normie well we smart this in some people it's smart that you thought not to do that yeah it just seems like one that I would like too much yeah and there's one of the reasons why I never fucked with speed either I'm gonna feel like I'd be like now I can get things done but you drink coffee don't you yeah but smiled the confident really jack is fuckin mile this man is just mild he orders it Kemp chameleon which changes your fucking skin into another color this is a cold brew coffee just coffee not that it's not coffee it's called Lucky Jack nitro cold brew coffee you might as well just stick this in your arm I don't think so really yeah I mean I don't know because I've never stuck anything like that in my arms neither if I I'm just sayin that it's not that it's it's pretty strong actually it's probably not like what I make in the morning is like colder coffee I love Kona cross and I fill that fucker to the top it's so dark that when you port you can't see through the stream yeah that's when you know you're going on Joe Rogan and gonna spew some shit some real shit oh fuck some hot lava hot lava serve I'm Kona so then so we did that so we did brunch over me and Nuno Bettencourt and we got all the players from way back then the horn sections got curls to sing it it's just gonna be Bobby Womack sat in that room and he did you know I used to love you but it's all over now songs alright that was that date Marvin Gaye I'm in this room with all his tapes so if you're a musician you feel the vibes right if you're comedic and you go to the comedy store you feel like you're walking around in placenta Loretta yeah there's not a recording spot for comedians you know you guys have a bunch of performing spots but you also have recording spots we only really have performing spots yeah we record in those performance buttons but I'm performing yeah I mean I go into mmm I just had these on last night fixing the lyrics and when you have them on you listening to the track it's just it's something you can't explain nobody understands that and it's akin to tripping on acid it's akin to being drunk and sucking face with a girl making out with her it's akin to watching your kids be born it's an elevated experience it's way elevated and if you if you buy it and you push the top floor like I do way past the penthouse boom well I know you do it hmm that's why I'm reading this off okay this is a day this is a day this is what it was a month well whatever it is it's you and also you've been doing this a long time this is like a life what I mean the reason why you don't have any memory it's because you probably filled all your hard drive space with crazy experiences well said you know I have forgotten more than most people could ever remember how could you not how the fuck could you remember everything you've ever done go talk to a farmer about some shit that happened in the 50s overall that was the day that Carroll wouldn't give us milk they remember it's two things going on here I'm surrounded by people that always remind me that's good too you got a good team yeah and sometimes I gotta be on like live on The Tonight Show write this thing I did was it with a beautiful blonde Entertainment Tonight yeah it was I just watched it back I thought it that's the best interview I think I've ever done because she looked me square in the eye she was beautiful she asked just right questions and was just perfect and you got to be on in those moments yes that's all that's what I'm saying that me to do you do you miss being not sober sometimes yeah yeah I am I miss will a pros and cons that that if I do I'll wind up doing too much for sure for sure I can't control it it's just the way you are just the way I am and I don't want to I don't want to push it again because when I get that way my kids don't talk to me I get a divorce I'm thrown out of my own band right right what else I lose everything I mean it's happened enough times for me to finally realize you know what it's not worth it right you know I get it you say no say yeah and I got a lot of beautiful friends I got a beautiful bunch of friends to keep me in line you know I got two sponsors one of the West Coast one of the East Coast better call up all the time ago I want to get so fucked up right how does that work when you call them out what do they do it Stephen no no they say fuck dude I do too you might keep it together exactly I'll just say what else is new do you guys ever talk about it the way like fat people talk about food they used to eat no cuz we don't do that what is it called looking back and taking them to the dinosaur shit no no but you do if you go to like an a a meeting they do get up and tell awesome stories oh fuck getting fucked up right see when you get sober if you don't if you don't have continued aftercare by going to a couple meetings every now and then you're gonna wind up using again really especially someone like me who watched Janis Joplin up there okay 1968 I'm in high school she's got bangles and beads like this shit on she's she's drinking Southern Comfort and she's spitting and using the f-word smoking cigarettes nobody did that she was a power watching her and she's fucking the power in song that's why I covered that on my country album yeah yeah to this day I listen to that song like at least once every couple months put that in the headphone so you see how snus what songs can do for you yeah well when you when you grew up in the 60s and what we did was we experimented you know I mean if you think about what they tell us Christopher Columbus discovered America know the bow of his boat was full of booze and he fucked Queen Elizabeth or whoever she goes go good boy you know and she sent him on his way with some money and said bring them back some countries you think and by the way he wasn't the first person here that's what America wants us to believe it anyway so so Christopher Columbus he's got that in his head to go to go check shit out right he's drinking he's going by the stars at night it's kind of like that it's like you never took LSD I've taken acid okay you know it's you you look out we used to take acid in high school and we would we go to these ski slopes in the summertime right beautiful green hills going up and we'd ride the chairlift stoned as fuck and we got our stuff from San Francisco from Owsley I would call him up and go dude more colors more colors right to balance gonna kill me but that's it so you understand that that's just it's it's like you know is it fucked up in it's drugs yeah but you're also it's like I'd love to do ayahuasca okay yeah maybe my bucket list and that's what I'll talk to my sponsor about hey I got this I'm in Maui maybe I've been here too long but um over in Hana they go in ayahuasca I saw that you were at ROM Dawson's place cuz you were there with my friend Duncan Trussell hell yeah yeah yeah Duncan sent me a picture you guys together do you know I went back they had a silent auction and I you know I know Ram Dass he's you know he's beautiful Jewish kid from Long Island Long Island and he became what he did talk about spirituality so I'm at the silent auction and I bought this and that and this and and one of these Mellotron type thing that you squeeze box you squeeze with your fingers and play it yeah and when I left there guy comes over and says you just bought the first edition of his book in his own handwriting you just bought his I forgot what the hell those things called not an accordion right it's an accordion tight is it accordion and and I got to listen to - Ram Dass talked and sat right in front of me what a trip yeah he's a trip I need to meet him before he leaves this earth yeah Duncan raves bottom yeah so what were you doing there obviously have an interest in psychedelic experiences but you are wary about attempting them at this stage after your sobriety hmm what I loved a trip again yeah yeah do you think you could do it and you know maybe it's just like you just don't maybe it's getting fucked up that's the bad thing like just getting fucked up just getting drunk and coked up and maybe that's the problem maybe no no it's kind of shamanic ceremony maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all well here's the deal it's all one thing getting fucked up shamanic whatever if you're taking drugs and you're fucked up you're fucked up doesn't matter if it's shamanic or not if you if you get high and that's net tweaks that little thing in my brain that goes um here I go remember in your brain I got high for thirty years right I'm from the sixties right with the best of them I got right and it took them down some of them most of them you came through it remarkably unscathed if you think about it yeah thank you God it's pretty amazing thank you God thank you God mmm think about that one yeah think about that we could talk for two hours about times I did shit and almost died so sure you know and then I could also tell you how many times I took shit and wrote things like you know I'm listening to this guitar lick the Joe's playing he did an interview here with you yeah but he didn't tell you how it is fucking sleepy would play these riffs and I come down the hallway because you know as I see it of course not as they see it but as I see it we were up in New England and he was playing at a place and I mowed the lawn my mind my parents place and I quit my last band and I was fucking Allah who saw her I was crying I was in no more bands the dream was over he drives up in an mg we go and he's playing that night I swear to god this happened and so we decided to move down to Boston but all in an apartment because I thought I knew why those bands didn't make it but I knew in my heart did if I had a bro in a band like I'm making a Keith like The Kinks David David you know ray any of those bands they had that you know have it was two guys that were really tight that feed off each other they fed off each other exactly so we moved down there I got really tight with Joe I hear him he'd get weak it's so sweat we so stoned on booze Boone's Farm you know we I mean it's fucking her living there I said what do you say what do you say anyway but he would play these licks that was so fucking for every song you've ever heard sweet emotion every one of those licks walked this way there's 20 that got lost in the ether right 20 that got lost ether so I went out and bought a little thing called tape recorder back then remember this was 71 you know shit wasn't a real phone no cell phones so I would record that shit and so anyway where we're going with this that's that's what that's where these songs came from and stuff would come out of my head while I was like sweet emotion well fuck get me paper and pen I write that shit down suddenly whoops on the radio see so I use that place what you get you go to when you need edibles do you ever write some of your routines on yours yeah well there you go know for sure well and also check this out the best part of it is when I got sober I started writing even even better shit I'd go in a room with four guys and say we're going in the right ahead we're gonna stay in this fucking room until we do or until we can't stay each other smell and we would leave in seven hours with a fucking song and a good one and one that would live way past all of us check that shooter what did it feel like when you when you did have these drunken stoned moments when you came up with a song like sweet emotion or a riff or and then all of a sudden you're listening to it on the radio how how fuckin surreal is that what is that like I remember we used to go up to UM first of all most of our first stuff was recorded down in Hell's Kitchen in New York or the record plant you know John Lennon our studio upstairs and we were down in Studio A with Jack Douglas and them so we went from there for the 70s and then into the 70s I had done every drug on the planet that I could because I thought it was cool and if I didn't I wouldn't be cool and those are the kind of people I hung out with you can't do that dude you ain't fucking shit man so and you get early 80s totally full bar 84 85 86 what was eighties coke uh a lot of the hard stuff yeah seventies or sixties and seventies was 60s was weed right drinkin getting jiggy with the foot you know with the stuff that was happening with the English invasion listen to Elvis and checking shit out right you know then what about the 70s 70s finally it's well 65-64 I started I was a drummer in a band at school you know the school drama right then I bought a set of drums because I wasn't getting looked at and get made fun of and called you know lip oh and lip away Nia and to beat up after school and I thought hey if we get a little band together play at lunch that'd be really cool we work all the maniacs so he played a lunch and I went holy shit Marcy Marcia Resnick is talking to me now holy shit whatever isn't it funny there's always one girl high school Jill Ellsworth that was her and she looked at me and no one did before and what's no different than you know human so thence 65 66 67 chain-reaction 68 The Strangers 69 was would suck I went early and left three days later I still have a coca-cola cooler when the day it was over okay we tried to start off the car and too much water got in the gas we couldn't couldn't get lost and everybody left and all their tents and all the sleeping bags were just left there hundreds of acres of tents there's no pictures of it I walked around I thought yes I stole a coke cooler and I still have that today you still have it oh yeah yeah yeah but I was late from coca-cola like it was a coca-cola brought your shit in no just just you know right with a opener on the side you but I remember walking down this path that was called groovy way and I stole I stole this banner off the trees which we used for that for Aerosmith in the beginning I had these girls duplicated so it was two guys looking at each other you know smoking a joint and if that was the Erasmus thing in the beginning but when I was at Woodstock I'm walking down groovy way and it was where Ken Kesey and the magic the pranksters they had all their buses so I'm tripping on acid and these helicopters are coming by with 500 pounds of hotdogs and they're dropping them they're dropping the how to feel near this and I show you not and then another giant pile of pots and pans to cook the hot dogs I mean it was a disaster area whoa Chuck you know this right yeah anyway so I grabbed the pots and pans I started it was somewhere the guy walks over he's going another guy comes over and he starts doing this by the time I was done an hour later there was 50 people banging on every pocket listen that was a moment and then when I got up from that tripping my ass off I walked down a path and walking towards me was one guy and it was Joey Kraemer my tremor who I knew from high school but that I met there later on to become I was a drummer for Aerosmith in the beginning so move forward now six s-70 all the bands that broke up I went up to Santa Fe I was mowing along a place called trail Rico my family place that I did my whole life it's what I do is I'm a country boy 360 acres that my Italian family bought that came over from Calabria in 1918 95 brothers there were musicians so they worked in New York City they made a little money so for four grand they bought 300 acres so every year of my life when I was born in fucking 1948 I mean a second what house you know I know I was 70 a couple months ago but I feel like I just when people would say that it was like what my daughter my daughter Chelsea would say it's the big one dad you gotta say here we gotta celebrate it and I I kids know I have no concept of time I feel like on one hand I've lived 300 lives already on the other I feel like it's just that how does that what's that number right that's a fuck of a big number does it feel like it just happened oh it definitely like you look back and think of like Aerosmith's first gigs and feel like God that just feels like a couple of years ago a couple years ago a couple years ago well that's the thing about Aerosmith okay so we went up inside Abbey he drove buying his mg and his glasses with white tape in the middle like fucking telling him in hair down to here come on man come here my band so I went and heard him it was a kill Perry project you know it was a the jam band Jill berry jam band and they were they only had one song it was good I won't get any because they couldn't you know they weren't in tune and shit but they played rattlesnake shake you know by Mick Fleetwood you know fluid Mack and when I heard that I said i sat there and i went life flashed all the bands that I was in the I broke up I know why and I knew that if I take all check that I know and put it into that try to carve that shit out if we can live together smoke weed together fuck girls together in the same apartment we'll have it and all I want to do is get my fucking toe in the door that's all I ever wanted to do if I could just fuck yeah yeah so we moved to Boston and I'm the drummer and one day rates of an or a guitar player at the time walks in and goes hey I got a friend of yours because I didn't really want to play the drums here behind everybody you know you get pissed off your wife wonders why you're not on the cover or something right I want to be the lead singer cuz I want to get laid well what do you want to do well Tommy Lee was the drummer oh well he had a fucking 12-inch cock that helped okay that helps it's good-looking guy - hi my name is Tommy Lee right what that helps but they have to see it first to know and believe me they showed it we said we were up in Vancouver doing our best records and Nikki Sixx dear friend of mine he was in Maui with me and I said you know what man we gotta climb to the top of that hill you gotta stop smoking and we did we climb to the very top of the hill right above nude beach little beach in big Beach anyway it's farts like this he was like and quit smoking and he got sober we went to a meeting that night and everything I got up to Vancouver and there in Studio B we're in a studio a he's with Bob Rock they're producing this album called what they asked me to sing on it and mmm dr. feelgood right mmm and the fucking record it was one of the first times musicians when you get your shit put on Pro Tools and it gets fixed and at you anymore right see I'm from the old school where if you practice and get good you're good right so what you did at the Comedy Store the first time you could do in your basement in front of your kids be just as good so don't you think yeah so Pro Tools musicians it's like it makes you yeah it can it can take your your vocal and fix it right it can take your drums and push it and fix it to a grid is that right what do you do better but it does make the music sound better but you ever listen to Charlie Watts right right he drags so beautifully in Keith Richards but that wasn't my point like is it is there there's something missing from that right yeah it's the souls gone yeah because now it's computerized and even though it's really good it's still not the same as listening to James Brown just think about this yeah they got a new song each right right but yeah if they're all using Pro Tools and fixing shit yeah it's the same sound coming out right now maybe a different singer but Society lling right and you by the way you can do it really professionally in my eyes some of my dear friends Marty Frederick's are nuno bettencourt these fuckers get behind it and ready for your vocal yeah yeah I will come up with hey Jay did you got your mama's style but you yesterday child to me done recorded they move it there and they move it there and they move it there they got the drums they go listen you think we got a song and I go you think that that's how easy it is right that's how easy and I've done that many times do you miss the raw no changing no adjusting no one witnessing I done that many times of course I've taken like what did I do that on pink I'm down in Florida I'm at the Marlin hotel I'm living in a room I'm sober as can be when I say that that means like when the Sun went down I turned the light on that's not ready pink there's no you know you're my new lips obsession pink ain't even no question pink oh my lips are your lover pink what you was discover and I think it's just it's not went right so I did that for until the Sun came up I turned the light off so I used that time period at night for the whole album that whole album was I wrote everything at night when I was I would get so tired I feel stoned and I would write and then I would take the lyrics of pink and I wrote seven verses which only need three but I wrote seven Aerosmith's biggest secret wrote twenty-one songs only put fourteen on an album hello pick the best after 21 right you're gonna have a good album right that's like you going somewhere for three months writing your new fucking skit you're a new skit and you get you hit on you'd be doing your edibles or whatever gets you off you hit on three fucking incredible things yeah you write them through you come back and if you want to you can do all three if you want to on your worst day the worst one is great because you're Joe Rogan you already know what good is you know what funny is you know how to make that you know how to weave something together all right so I put this would be for ProTools your thing called a dad's and so the guy we're working with says sing that chorus sing that verse and so we already had the course I sang that verse he just put that verse in in all we're all the verses go and I listened back and I went fuck we got such a great song here that's how I use Pro Tools I don't use it to manipulate I'll never I'll never fix my vocal but your vocals there's something about your vocals that you wouldn't enhance them if you fixed them like you have a raw soulful quality to your voice that if you fucked with that digitized it you'd lose all of it I mean I'm sure they can do some things of the real artists with Pro Tools and and move things around they'll still sound amazing but there's no errors in your singing you know I'm saying any crackle or pop it's just gonna be better yeah we're just learning that I feel that as an adult as a person who doesn't look for perfection you just look for beauty mm-hmm you know perfection is not beauty whoo I mean it's it's an unattainable thing chase it and you can get excellence and what's wrong with America right now is everybody's trying to look for that perfection and stuff fat in their ass yeah yeah yeah but there is no perfection in fact this in imperfection I'm a community another function so I flew the first album some of my first songs it comes once a day I'm Shay my window boo shit fuck her and fucking Little Richard then when the Beatles are just you know Paul's Paul's daughter cook you know texts me all the time you know and she's beautiful fucking line or close beyond belief and um just goes dad's having drinks come on over oh so this is three nights ago God smoke spliff all day here with ten bags of coca I'll watch it I just don't do it I understand I got that strength you know saying thank you lord I thank you guys I appreciate it so walk in and doesn't mean I want to do it while I'm watching this one in that one do it I get it I'm gonna crawl up her ass my friend Doug stand up says he's waiting to do heroin right before he dies oh it's fun I heard it's amazing to think about it when do they give you morphine right before you die no no that's that's I don't know what that drug is yeah they gave you something like that right done that too when do they give you morphine when you're in pain exactly yeah and who what human isn't in pain or all the fucking time a lot of people are a very long time those that can't get their shit together and night they go home and they they jerk off and then they drink a beer and they smoke you know what I mean right it's a little hard for people they don't make enough money they you know vote for Trump whatever the fuck's going on in America right now I can't figure it out but a lot of people like I was when I was younger aren't they yeah girlfriends leave you here in pain that white picket fence in that and the one and the wife 18 years she leaves you your two kids I'm in fucking pain I'm in pain so what's the best thing to do is that the best thing to do though no it's not but that's what I basically do it what is the best thing to do when you're in pain well we have to be a little bit elevated as humans to know what to do in that case you listen to people like Marianne Williamson I don't know she is you know she's fucking brilliant did you know she is Jamie here's baby think she is fucking when she's essential you know she's just a spiritual person no she's spiritual when I got sober I started listening to her tapes I get on the treadmill in the morning you know cuz I I can't even I don't even feel alive unless I'm out of breath that's what I get for being a musician I lose a pound a night on stage sweating with Aerosmith right I'm up there with standing next to fucking Joe Perry really the last of the real rock stars you stood across from him it's a bad motherfucker I don't know if he was stoned in the way of you but he's when I get text messages from him like holy shit I fucking hit text and I saw him in the beginning and I knew he was that like he's something special I knew he was that he's got a he's got a recognizable there's like certain people that have a sound you know and Joe has he absolutely has a sound you know as a sound Gary Clark jr. mmm like you hear Gary Clark jr. play guitar you go okay that's a Gary Clark jr. if you know there's certain people that have a sound Joe most certainly has a sound it's like he's expressing himself through that guitar in a very recognizable way you know two together man what a fucking combination that was with his guitar and your voice and and here's the trip you know in the beginning you know the first album people have said who sing on the second album cuz I'm the second now my god sang you know I kind of like that pee-wee Herman Oh chocolates because I want to sound black oh fuck I'm not stupid I get it I wanted to put some fucking soul soul in my voice I knew I had it and I'd enforce it out no no no what I learned was you know like from Nat King Cole it's the kind of music I listen to as a kid when I met Natalie I walked up behind her and I went chemo kymo stare stare behind mewho my mistake a pumpernickel soup bang nipple gas Parliament's cameo I love you my dad passed obviously way before but that's those are the records I listened to that was NAT singing session and I'm so I want to say well here's what I wanted to sound I want to sound more like Joe Perry was playing and singing really sweet and nice isn't a dream on is sweet nice I kind of kind of went there when we wrote a song on a waterbed Joel Perry and I were sitting around smoking a big fatty and we knew baby now man we didn't anything I'm looking at me and that was the sentence he spoke to me right and I said we all live on the edge of town where we all live in a song people stopped coming I would do just a grin said we gotta move out alcohol's City moving in some same toy you spoke to me and you I answer translated oh yeah well I would listen to the bit we would sit around and we would jam that's what we did the back and we would create this music and I would put the headphones on later because I'm the lyricist and I've written the melody I see when I heard Joe's band I thought I'm gonna take my dad victaulic oh who went to Julliard in New York and a group in the Bronx 56:10 Netherland ever u6g department and I grew up under the piano and I listened to my dad would practice every day on a Steinway so who lived between the notes Joe you were insane hmm I love you name's Joe I just love Joe's fucking love jumper fucking love he know he's my bro you late y'all what the fuck man it's always been that so but anyway so I took my melody you know what I hear when I listen to him playing whoa shit so what you guys did your second album and you did that little sort of affect ation is that how you would call it a voice mm-hmm did you after you heard it and you listened to like people talking about it did you decide to change it for the next album wow that's really I did just go away for a minute didn't I yeah I love it when I do that yeah the the melodies I learned from my dad and then listening to the music we listened to you know Dorsey and Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole and and then Janis Joplin and the village Fugs who are the first ones that put on the back of their album lunatic vagina that's whom so cool say sang the song it's 61 the mothers of invention these fucking bands and I went what so I thought singing really like my dad taught me in the notes and right on and you know cdefg a baby you don't ever fuck wrong wrong wrong you got it not only that but if you don't put inflections into it there ain't no feeling and there ain't no meaning I got to love you like I do last time baby [Music] whoops right you know where you say it but you have to feel it can't be something you're trying to feel it's got to be something you actually feel does that mean yes oh yeah but I think you know Jo hats off to him man the way he played his guitar practice at night he'd fucking not out he'd be sitting his chair and the fucking chair the couch caught on fire I walked in with a pot of water and he's laying there roots on a smoke I want y'all what the fuck man yet he's playing this riff and we turned it into a song this kind of stuff happens so much and he did it awake you mean fucking he obviously you know Tom Hamilton doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo sweet emotion that's how band comes together you know and I can't tell you any other way than that magic and every inch of the way the reason it doesn't feel like I'm 70 and I don't feel the time and it feels like yesterday we just started is because every time I'm on stage I'm singing those same fucking songs again the same way same feeling same looking same people different people different people but I'm singing those same songs do you know the guy that's looking anyway so to answer your question second album sounds a little bit more raunchy more in tune with Joe's guitar and I think we found our sound second album third fourth fifth six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve we got it right but it took that first album had songs on it like walking the dog because we were reran out of songs with wit that was song we played in clubs I remember we had a contract what are we gonna do so we wrote moving out any guys would get stoned and drink Boone's Farm and I go come on you guys we fuckin wrote this song fuck you and flick their joy so I remember getting pissed off walking out they hate me when I tell this story but I remember being really fuckin and walking out this piano and writing one-way street I don't play guitar and I wrote Bono only one doing it make it don't break it first song in the first album so some great shit because I feel like you know in anger you know I didn't know what to do but I just better use that sorry I wrote a bunch of songs and I think it lit everybody's fuse I think that Joe certainly lit mine Tom Hamilton in his outtakes as he called him sweet emotion that's Tom Hamilton now through it throughout this whole time were you exorcise him back then did you do things have you move around back then we just live in life because you say you you're always trying to being out of breath you always doing things physically no no what I'm saying now is just like it's like when I started getting sober I thought fuck I got a treadmill and I got in the shape and you didn't do that before you got sober no because we were three three shows a week I was 127 pounds I was just you know skinny minion just trying to there was no MTV right we had to play by just check this out you want to wonder what drugs I took and why people get enamored by that but take it out of the picture we got high I got high because my manager was getting stoned too they loved it when bands were stoned because they could hand us a piece of paper and we would sign it uh-oh 50% of all of our publishing thanks pal and words like in perpetuity he's fucking managers back then I can tell you the dark secrets please do you do your own urine I do I just told you the dark secret is they get you high end games we all got high together right but they knew when you were good and fucked up you know Here sign this no all managers loved it when their bands were fucked up think about it Hendrix stoned out of his fuck here sign this yeah John Lennon thought what was his aim the new broom when he got a new lawyer and Paul was with with Melinda you know it's it's what happens back then you get you investments today too right I mean the record business it's been that way always this artists are impulsive and they're not business-wise and people come along and exploit that yes very impulsive yeah to think of what it takes if you study this for a second what does it take for a bunch of guys we're not in love with each other we love I love I like I really love what you just said Geneva and young Jamie young Jamie I love what you just said can we talk after this someone can tell me that again so I can write it down said I mean you know so get five guys together right they love what each other's doing I love it with Joey Kraemer plays Brad Whitford plays guitar like a madman Joe Perry Tom Hamilton you know to love with these guys do and then write songs who are we who are we we're fucking and writing songs for 48 years still when I turn the radio one I hear sweet emotion and I hate that fucking song I don't what is it I don't want to kiss your thing no no I don't want to miss a thing I just fucking here's a turn still turn around here that old shit what magic we had what magic it takes for David Grohl to sit down and do his scribbling he's a fucking cop for as old as he is he's 12 I loved when I walked into Paul McCartney's party you know what's his name was walking out where's Amy help dr. Dre was walking out I walked in and there was Ringo and it was your Oprah and there was I mean everybody that I live on Maui so I live there with live in Maui oh yeah really because everybody thinks Maui Maui Wowi back in seven evenings that's still well I don't know everything I don't think that I could buy I could buy a case of Maui buds and have it sent right to my house I did it all the time from Maui it was called Maui wowie I've heard that name before anyway everybody you'll is there right now I live there it is my life okay look it that's gotta be B I'm in an old-fashioned band we all get paid the same hey you okay Oh what an old-fashioned fuckin man who does it today he's got Rihanna how much do you think she makes a night and this and the dancers compared to well there's a big difference on the dancers and the dancers and you Mary what were the band it's all we all get paid the same right when I took Idol tune started making some paper get that paper fuck yeah so what your buddy made fun of me and believe me did you do it just for the money no but but no I you know what I did why because I thought nobody knew who I was everybody knows this guy singing nobody knew this guy oh I wanted that memo you as a human my mom's passed away and she said and she said you know you they need to see that side of you you as a person let you discuss that American Idol was the best way to show that I thought it was the first thing was what else was I had no managers back then that had the good sense to offer me anything I got the offer from Marty Fredrickson I got how long ago was this one two thousand two thousand ten and eleven eleven or twelve I get to sit next to JLo and Randy Jackson and motherfucker mmm beautiful guy GJ long JLo's beautiful you know what us men need I think what everyone needs it's a word called incentive right is it her ass it was her ass all the time but she said you're harassing me and I'd say whose ass her ass yeah the funniest fucking thing is we would do all three of us and I think that's missing now but all three of us you know to do American Idol you got to go to Des Moines Iowa and in a gym and you're all set up with a whole crew and you know three people with these with microphones you know the 12-foot mics hanging down over your head like this and 12 cameras and high def up here up wazoo and but but in 50 40 people a day would come through all these fifty sixteen year old 70 year old little trollop swith you know red lipstick on and push-up bras and going to or get out of here you know after the AF get after the 30th 40th one you're sitting there doing this right you know so II just got a you got a FD need that incentive from each other and sometimes it will get so it was just shit burned out after the 40th person 50th person but that's what people like though there's something about American Idol we'd like really talented people but we also like people who are delusional yeah and we trust me it took me about two weeks to get into it because I told myself I am never gonna tell some young girl who can't sing but she can't saying get the fuck out of here right like that other day you know what I don't I'm a guy yes I mean I don't like your music besides which it's country and I don't like country I heard him say that that seems not that's great but that's also foolish he's a weird case isn't him because he's not a singer well you know what he's whatever he is I said I'm saying her how can I say that to a girl it's gonna be there maybe some days breastfeeding or baby wants to sing maybe she wants to her baby's sick and she's sitting at the other bit on the bed and wants to sing but JLo told her she can't write I didn't have it in me I'd rather the hall you shouldn't have it in you I mean that's his shtick right his dick is to be a mean guy yeah and people like that they like that mean guys say they would say to me you kind of come on man take it up a notch say that that the producer fuck they're doing - they got me a couple times ago did they oh yeah they got you - turn it up mm-hmm and then you feel bad about it disingenuous well you know I mean like there would be there would be moments where I mean we were burnt well like I said I wore some Texas mmm I'd look over the boom started going like this right and it started getting it and they would say number one because it was in the shot you know you know and then so I would whip out my Limerick you know those I go time for a limerick and stop everybody everyone would stop I say something like you know I want some Matterhorn from Dallas she's the dynamite stick for a phallus they found a vagina in North Carolina and her asshole in Buckingham Palace and the fucking you see the boom go like this the place where it was just enough to bring it up and we finished two more and we leave but it was fun like that and it was a good payday so when you were asking me to have a house in Maui yeah and I was made fun of for doing that although made fun of you for doing that uh Joe Perry didn't think it was a smart thing he said that's one step under ninja turtles Joe keep in mind when I'm alone by myself I went is he right why no I thought to myself what Bob Dylan do this yeah I had those thoughts right kind of fucked me up for a minute but then I went so Dylan doesn't have a house on now it does it no I didn't have one in but I wanted one how much money that guy's got I'm sure it's probably the house in them so I took Idol and I you know I never I am so you bought a house on Maui with the money from Idol this is well we started you have kids right youngest is what she just turned eight eight okay I have I have my two last kids Chelsea and Taj we lived in Marshfield Massachusetts and when I could I would take them to either Disneyland or world or Maui go to the four seasons and discovered fall right with your kids yeah but every morning I'd wake up and it would run to the right and go all the way down to LA Peru's and I run back like five miles down and finals back how I saw this house I thought is that where I already know who lived there but I thought somebody what's the lead singer in the Grateful daddy Jerry Garcia so I had rumor was he lived there I kept looking at it and it just is this beautiful house but it was ridiculous amount of millions you know I don't have that you know you don't have that when you're in a band you share all the money plus management publishing and then that contribution song you're stoned I mean come on right so you're into mmm yeah what exactly right beautiful so I'm looking at I'm gonna fucking my notes help me show I want to talk to you about the aliens oh really yeah let's go with that hurt where the fuckers got a lot of notes in front of you man yeah City the most I never even finished that week that's okay okay that's that's we could do whatever you want man no no we're good man this this radio is really important she's giving so when did you compile these this morning they just decided that yeah I finished a vocal last night 11 up a noodle Bettencourt's house got to bed it like I couldn't sleep till 4:00 I'm going fuck what the fuck oh man you're sweet man you're sweet too it's I mean one for Matt to talk truth not only that when people watch your show they know who's to fold a shit and who's not that's for sure after a while yeah yeah yeah what is he telling the truth they know that too yeah shit loaded notches well this is what you were saying about American Idol like then before they knew you was just the guy behind the microphone you sang songs that touch people and move people free just put it right over there oh she wants a stack okay but even that like this having a conversation like this yeah it's uh this is not enough of these out there all right well there is now you know now there's more of them yeah but for the longest time you would never be able to have this kind of conversation because of the same people that would tell you to turn it up a notch on American Idol did be producers around and be people trying to fuck with things add in fixation and this is my the studio notes we have notes is what we want you to do Stephen you know we want you to talk about this and stop doing that thing where you keep singing people don't want to hear that anymore what we want you to do is this and for you to speak your mind like you do your truth and have someone across from me to speak their truth in their words in any language they want and not be edited or audited is unreal isn't that weird though that that's unusual just think about it 40 years ago you couldn't you couldn't say ass on the radio I don't know if you can now I think you can now but I hear a shit hole on CNN i watch you can say that you know Don Lemon Donald lemon yeah yeah one of my favorite guys for like three weeks quoting problems and shithole countries right I was great at what yeah well it is a new freedom in terms of that but I think it's because the internet people get used to swears they're gonna use two people just speaking unedited they're getting used to uncensored video they're getting used to things well it's just words there's no Sun sensor behavior right is beyond he's way past the word fuck sure the words are just representative of thoughts and intent right they're just noises mm-hmm it's like the best way to describe what's going on in your head is use all the words use them all use the ones that are really coming out of your head don't hold them back and give me some watered down version of what your real thoughts are so I have to decipher it and put it through a filter and try to figure out what did Stephen mean by that that's how I got so angry at the way things were going about that I want to say six years ago then I quit management I got my lawyer Dino loophole you quit management to manage me well I got the management that was managing the band right and they're also gone now god bless one of them passed away rest his soul he was a good man and the other one didn't have a lot of good things to tell the bay is wrong direction all the time and now my band is with my management we're together a fucking game so six years ago I would talk to people I go you know what fuck you I'm going on Rogan next week I'm gonna fucking say your name I mean I just built a house up in Laurel Canyon he's fuckin guys I come home and I had a water wall and you know it's Kylie and people would come and go and go don't don't and I wanted to lean back so the water wall wouldn't rolls down rolls down and wouldn't spray on the bridge that goes across right not a chance so after a year I get there and they go you know what I heard that I heard him say fuck Tyler you know I'm just you know I'm just saying so that's the kind of stuff I went I'm on Rogen your fucking toast pal that manager story is a story that you hear I just heard it from a friend of mine she was telling me about her managers giving a shit advice and she just dropped them why are there so many people in management that give shit advice like well because because out of ten out of ten of them - two of them know the answers and they may be they may be right yeah the rest of them know how to play the game if you read the book it's easy yeah management you just gotta tell them what they want to hear yeah sweet-talk them well it's a hard thing to be a managers it's to manage you man it's even harder the hardest thing is to know direction to look at people's feelings right know what they're about why they're about what what guy in the band should do this interview what interviews to do which ones to do which ones not to do or actually not to do well don't do anyone where they're gonna stop it in four minutes you know those Tonight Show ones sometimes you have to that's all they give you you gotta talk it just seemed so fucking forced and fake this stands for me I wrote a book man I was so fucking pissed I wrote does the noise in my head bother you right two people I would say that I go what the fuck's wrong with you what are you talking about what do you mean did I write lyrics what did you do last night the guys would give me shit for not writing lyrics are finishing a song they're upset that you're writing a book no no no no no back when you're writing a song and being around right yeah we're in a studio we put the song don't you lay the track down and then Stevens got to go and write the lyrics right well if I don't then X a they go what the fuck man and I say well I'm trying to get my wife pregnant okay I have life I get it what were you doing that you know but those are kind of shit that happens you get a lot of pressure on you and then because they did that I went and wrote walked this way the lyrics had him in my bag finished the whole record got in a fucking cab went to 351 was 3:21 was 40 the record play in New York right got out of the cab went upstairs went I got it and I fucking went white I left the lyrics in the cab the whole album and my producer goes we're doing Walk This Way tonight so went upstairs took a pencil listen to the track like I did the night before I wrote the lyrics and wrote them on the wall and that's what happened but whoa but you know no one in the band thought I left the fluxes got those lyrics in that cab somebody but the works buddy thinks you fucked off the worst part yet the band went yeah right you left the lyrics in the cabin you know what maybe when you're stoned on coconut and when you're still no Coke nothing's funny it's really a suck-ass drug mmm that's why I avoided it good for you thank you speed could get you well you know what I'm a little bit to me seems like the move yeah I brought you a little bittersweet but but we'll call this coffee right now I can feel it Downers for me and how I look at you you're shaking I had stem-cell shots put my shoulder today come on that's what it is did you really take him out of here no there's some new process they do I'm in serious pain right now oh man that's why I'm shaking like watch I could barely practice I think you saw I thought fuck it's coffee I'm doing it look you just caught me five hours ago move in like a like perfect something like something smooth I'll be okay in a day yeah what do I take yeah yeah gabapentin gabapentin gaba pay is great job it's not you don't get high from it but it kills pain this is to alleviate some shoulder tears I have some tears ease work out yeah you can see yeah so she's a great survivor way let's go quickly back to your bar yeah there's a noise my head bother you I wrote this and I wrote you a little thank-you a verse we reproduce a man breather just remember the less hair I got the more head you get okay the more the less hair you got the more head you get that makes sense you think love Steven Tyler Steve yes what I say you said Steve I think I said Steven Tyler let's go back David pretty sure I've never said Steve Tyler ever so I don't care but thank you man I really appreciate that if you put me down in the worst way I still love you I didn't do that I'm just saying because

like you nine years no no I've won that in my left knee that's 24 years old it is so working awesome Wow good Phoenix with everybody it's it's all about meniscus it's about the amount of cushioning and whether or not they do a good job or placing the ligament but mmm I had very good doctors on my left and right knee shout-out to dr. Gettleman Wow good for you in yeah you know I've mine it didn't work so started going inwards did you get it don't forget what I yeah 98 mm yeah mine was 94 I have a buddy of 93 actually I have a buddy of mine who had one done though and his knees really fucked up to the point where he is about to get a replacement and he actually got a hip replacement on one of his hips because of the damage in his knee yeah because if the knees going in then this is pushing that way yeah and I didn't know any of this shit I just I knew I couldn't take vicodin in a parka saturnine that's how long ago to get your knee replaced six years ago mmm yeah five six you know now I got to get the right one done so now I'm going to Europe with my loved it loving married band I got a country album so you need to get your right one done yeah cuz what's going on with it okay the left knee never hurt right but never never pinching no nerves nowhere know-how mmm right knee it's funny except that's the right side if it pinches on the nerve it goes out like that right I can't be doing that on stage Roxy no Rolling Stones gonna be going he's fuckin stoned again look at do you think they would say that no I don't know pictures Rolling Stones a bunch of different people though you can't really attribute it yeah no I'm not worried about that and he's worried about doesn't do you sure that that's the only way to do it though if you talked to other doctors because what they're doing now with regenerative regenerative can I say that regenerative yeah why did that one stumble with regenerative medicine they're they're able to replace meniscus and cartilage and regrow shit you might want to hang on mm-hmm there's they're able to do some shit now where they can they can fix things they've never been able to fix before and every year gets better and I'm pretty close to the cutting edge of this stuff yeah I've had a bunch of doctors on my podcast talk to me about it particularly dr. Neil Reardon who does a lot of work down in Panama that they can't do in the United States and did Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad who was 92 at the time and on death's door in a wheelchair now he's a hundred and he's walking around yeah I know about those people down there and I have people up and go go to Panama but Penenberg is one name that did my knee and my knees so far you wouldn't believe it if you saw so it's fine it moves good the left knee is good but the right it so pinches right just goes out so I can't go tour with Aerosmith right jumping around like a like I do you know and there's other I'm just saying this I don't know how your knee is I don't know what's going on with it but there's other options now and there's it's one of those things where according to the doctors that I've spoken to the longer you can hold out the more likely you are to never need surgery that there especially when it comes to replacements and they're able to do a lot with hip replacements now with Regina keen and smells yeah the longer you can wait because what they're able to do now is different than what's gonna be able to do in five years and in ten years and the longer you can wait the more likely it is they can regenerate tissue yeah they're doing all kinds of crazy shit now with stem cells well now that there's a lot they're allowing this there's a guy live that is into telomeres telomeres yeah that's your longevity gene sure and he said that people that are like phoned the Lord Horrocks people that you know conduct pansies silly guys and shit silly musicians right Oh silly fucks silly silly comedians right people that are able to let let a childish side of them out those little Hollywood Hills stay longer mmm old people they grow shorter and he's close to finding that out so I love I love today I love what's going on I'm going to look into this yeah please do we'll talk afterwards I'll give you names no reason shit to to look up but so so Mme you know I'm looking at it and one of the girls that works for me said well that's the same thing as what you're into right now mmm a for me I'm a damn ma only use it's something no no it's something I got into in the last year with my lawyer Dina LaBolt and it's called I'm sick and fucking tired of getting beat and ripped off for the songs I wrote in the 70s and where's the money where's the money it's not even a joke right it's not even a joke and now that there's a format that's digital it's even less of a joke you want to fucking go break into these buildings to take a gun and shoot people because their opinion you mean things like Spotify they're not right there they're taking the money for plays of your song they're giving you whatever first of all publishers you know what it's all about 100 years ago 50 years ago 20 years ago publishers take the money we make on Toys in the Attic millions right they keep that money for a year they put it in the bank they keep the interest right then they pay after they keep the interest of course so that's that's one of those members before is it the Sony dirty things like to tell you how about us how about finding out managers buy the first three rows of your shows and and get the money from the fucking promoter in their pocket brought to them in a paper bag you want to fucking go there that what it does that what happened with that's the kind of shit that no it's good shit that happens in the business so they buy the first three rows and then see how simple that is look how simple they go up to the guy this is the guy's assuming with the show right if you have a 90/10 deal fucking great the manager goes and goes to the first three rows see you later or you don't get Aerosmith Wow or you don't get Bob Dylan well you don't get Jimmy Buffett and they're just depending upon those people did not tell you yeah I mean who's gonna tell you the only fight there's here's what happens you only find that shit out afterwards if you're going out with a girl that says I'm the one that brought the money back to him oh shit is that how you found that I said how I found out somebody found out that way that's the story I heard oh let's keep it like that and it's a story this woman's willing to talk about it oh but but the deal here's a deal you know you know I'd love to get angry as shit about stuff I love that I'm gonna tell you kidding you know what's so funny I got sober right now what you have an anger-management problems gaming once you got sober a fuck you what you know what I mean here's the you know you think when you get sober you're off the drugs your isms or was ins right bullshit oh you're all the reason you drank for all the reasons that you drank they come out even more right and then you have to manage okay you gotta learn but you gotta learn how right it's a good thing well exercise right well you know just gotta look recert invokes PE malady you don't forget codependency no more just shit you know shit stuff spiritual stuff how do I rise above your your your abnormalities it's not so good to smack your wife when you get angry definitely not no you gotta learn how to what to manage that anger for sure well it wasn't too about I got over an 88 so you faked do the math because I had enough for those years right I was out of my fucking mind 81 82 83 so you got sober in 88 over in 88 14 15 years then I had you know don't want to kiss you don't miss a thing came out right and I'm up and I'm up and I know what jumping around but this a great show it's good to use these as bites you know right that's just to just talk I think so man we went up to a place where he never played so what I was getting to before a point I really want to make strongly no cell phones no MTV nothing right I used to buy these plastic stickers and then and I get to wait or go around to each guy's room with 13:25 comment and ask him for 20 bucks and we'd get 60 bucks I get these stickers with Aerosmith on it and I would put them on people's windshields piss them the fuck off because they're really sticky and I put them where you throw the money when you go through right I put him to bed move so everyone upset what's that what's that mean Aerosmith what is this error with the name uh what you sat around you know hookers shit stains jits you know but the you know you just you just you throw shit around just once that Aerosmith Joey Kraemer goes how about Aerosmith I went fuck does that mean he was wearing Mary I used to be in a band and we were called Aerosmith for a while and so there was another Aerosmith before Alison well it wasn't yeah I heard from the drummer who was in Joey's band it was just a really short lived you know club thing there's an idea so maybe there was a band that performed a couple of times called eros maybe maybe maybe no are they alive still well all I know is this I for all the names I heard and thought that's a good one I didn't see anything into it look I I have this knack of looking at someone and not necessarily remembering their face but but I feel you I'm it's like stupid how to explain this it's a vibe I'm like a transmute oh you don't have one of these no I don't yes you do I definitely do you do now I definitely don't you don't have this even that's me yes well no I guess I'm fucked again okay leave that I'm gonna show you you it's your thing but where the fuck were we so when you kind of I kind of feel things I feel I don't remember it's a Brad Pitt's got this disease I don't know Brad Pitt has a disease he's got this thing we can't remember proper folk via beyond you can't remember faces is that what it is I'm sure look that's a good thing to tell people if you you're Brad Pitt like I'm sorry man I have a disease I can't remember you cuz you probably meet so many people there like Brad a fucking met you fifteen years ago Starbucks you don't remember dude I swear people come up to me and say yeah I'm Shane don't remember yeah yeah you said I have propofol yeah it's fucking written down everywhere I've know that everywhere but right you know starts telling people I got that shit propofol Bo BIA you can look we're gonna predict this developmental prosopagnosia face-blindness yeah bro that's what I got yeah but but you know not on a large scale but backstage and they you know it took me like 25 years to be able to go you know I just don't remember fill me in on it you don't mean it look take me three years to do you know what Dunbar's numbers know what is a number that you can keep of intimate relationships like friendships and close ties that people that you know in your head and somewhere around 150 which they think is roughly about the size of tribes that people lived in back when we were developing the human your genes really take a long time to change and they think that we essentially have very similar genes to people that live roughly ten thousand years ago ten thousand years ago that's essentially how people live they live in these small groups of people 150 200 people max and that's stuck in your head that's it mm-hmm then there was another million people here a million years ago there was another million people after you don't think so what do you mean you don't think there were people here before the last ice age they underground yeah that's not what they went underground don't you think I don't know the Grand Canyon those caves shit places they went underground no I think so well I'm just talking watchable huh just people people that live ten thousand years ago okay we can go back if it's just the number there's a reason why you can't remember so many people like that you believe that what do you believe I feel if as though there were people here a long long time a long long time ago hi Raj Reed Graham Hancock yeah yeah yeah um he makes a lot of sense that there's been periods of you know massive loss of life and you know cataclysms and comets passing by yeah I believe that where you have you not watched unacknowledged what is unacknowledged you gotta watch unacknowledged what does that one okay you gotta watch you and ignore what is it you gotta watch out of knowledge is that that Steven Greer movie no it is yes yeah wasn't it me ma'am no no no good huh no this is a fucking industry and the industry is in wanting to get mystery solved the great mystery of is there life out there mhm and nobody has any answers there's I did this show for sci-fi called Joe Rogan questions everything and before that show who I was a hardcore believer and a lot of wonky conspiracies like Bigfoot and aliens I just loved them cuz they say you don't live in Bigfoot no I don't believe that's the most plausible you think so yes why because there was an animal called Gigantopithecus alongside human beings as recently as a hundred thousand years ago it was a real absolutely real animal okay and there's they found fossilized bones these things and they found teeth from an apothecary shop in China there was a real animal it was a gigantic bipedal hominid there was somewhere around eight to ten feet tall so this thing lived at the same time people dead so this is probably the reason why there's this myth of Bigfoot that at one point in time this was a real thing but what about the thing about that they're walking around now probably not that sort of most likely not that was what I was saying yeah sure it was a giant yeah but there's you know socially about aliens tell me about most is a business most what about what about the Air Force general that said to gate did that tape and gave it to his wife and said don't put this out until I'm dead did you not feel as though when he was speaking any of that was real I think you've seen that way I think two men have you seen them yeah I've seen a lot of those I've seen a lot of those boys there's a lot of former military people that say they've seen crazy things that it's entirely possible that they really did it's entirely possible but it's also possible that they're crazy it's possible that they love attention it's possible that they're bored it's possible they're schizophrenic it's possible that they have memories that they've concocted over the years and enhanced it's gotten them attention and it's putting them in documentaries and it gets them interviews on television programs but that there's no evidence you know and the problem with all these people is they're all have this same feeling about them and then not this very few of them the come across is rational and objective most of them come across is there's something wrong there's a there's wires that aren't connecting if you talk to them about other things in life like you had a chance to talk to them for a long I'm sitting down with him for three hours ask them about ghosts and psychics and all kinds of shit they almost all believe in that stuff they're believers they wanna believe in nonsense I hear you as soon as that crops up in a matter of a room but it's possible that I mean not just possible it's a hundred percent likely then there's alien life out then like 100 percent glad you said more scared me for a second no I think it's more just like that movie because it kind of had a nice read that movies horseshit okay there's a lot of those movies that are horseshit and their guy he knows some of that sport shit like there's a little baby that they had found that's an aborted fetus I'm trying to pass that off as an alien baby for a long time but they have generally that were there were hybrids no woody can you tell me about the link between monkeys in us seriously well between the two lobes huh-huh and the full-blown monkey well we are hominids we are primates and we're just the most advanced primary the real question is how did we get to be so much more than just that's what I asked you well it's more likely that we found fire and our diet change and hunting and then the stoned ape theory which is a very fascinating theory the stoned ape theory is terence mckenna's theory they're human beings found psilocybin mushrooms and that through the use of psilocybin mushrooms which in low doses increases visual acuity produces these ecstatic states that it might have helped us develop language and communication and creativity and that this term was the reason why the human brain doubled in size over a period of two million years which is the greatest mystery in the history the fossil record they don't know why they did it but there's a very clear path so we do here two million years ago humans well cyberform is some form of okay my mate was certainly here millions of years ago as was deer deer we're here millions of years ago okay it's a lot of animals didn't mean if you're up here please no it's okay I don't know I feel bad I feel like you know just cause there was an ice age that took part that took it was a how many hundreds hundred thousand years was the Ice Age well there's been a bunch of ice ages but the most recent one ended somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago was nothing nothing yeah from beginning to end and we don't know what what caused it well when the ice age exists we have to remember that some parts of the world aren't experiencing the Ice Age and then humans thrived in Africa during parts of the Ice Age I mean there's there's a lot of human beings that live all over the world the real question is where they start most likely from Africa but they could have possibly started from some other places too we're starting to learn that well they're people gia people that are learning no not really why well I mean there's that too but I mean mostly just people traveling when what you really learn from is archeologists those the people you learn from and biologists people that really understand the human genome they really understand the differences between people that emerge from China versus people that emerge from Western Europe versus people that emerge from you know or Native Americans I mean there's so many different types of human beings that came from different climates and that their bodies evolved from these places and there's real science to that you're not gonna get that from these goofy fucking documentaries these goofy fucking documentaries are basically a business and the businesses - there's a bunch of people out there that want they want to know the answers again what is the truth and so you get it was aboard the secret UFO I saw the magnetic controller that makes us travel through the cosmos and bend time and space it's like a wormhole and they'll say a bunch of sciency sound and shit but there's no evidence there's nothing when they talk about there's nothing will you let what's David Wilcock know that guy says that he is the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce do you know that um did you know that yeah I've heard you know Edgar Cayce are you of course famous psychic who never really right figured out anything understanding and thought to be a fraud most like widely by scientist and skeptics and too much laudanum laudanum so him don't you think I don't know everything was written and everybody was stoned well I guess psilocybin mushrooms and opiates laudanum last hundred years get loud loud Blum laudanum everyone was drinking that shit yeah right but but look yeah there's you know there's yeah that shit was in that uh Japanese never they never left the island do a lot of Japanese have the same eyes shapes yes they do is there a reason well there's a reason why they didn't leave the island and come back after mating with other buddy tails so stay tuned do you think they're for mainly no absolutely not it's just that they stayed on that that that's a lot of lives sure but wouldn't you agree guardians from Asian look very fairly similar yeah I do there's variations in the similarities yeah similar but I think it took millions of years that's that's my take look I can't prove it you know they do believe it took millions a year I always finish stuff by saying I didn't see it right I am when I go out at night knowing walks walking I'm dying to see with UFO me too so are you and there's my second I see one the second right that will make clear shit like you know the song I wrote called back when Cain was able way before the anyways about a mothership and shit way before I knew anything about UFOs did you ever see anything when you did psychedelics when you did drugs whether you did mushrooms I never saw anything that wasn't there but you're not that kind of people I'm not the kind of people and some people have though and the idea is that there are things that are out there and neighboring dimensions that you really not capable of accessing them that's where the really aliens live yeah I don't know man but I just know that all these people that are pushing it they're all they all have there's fuckery involved in all these people know that's a real problem because it's fun it's fun you want to believe right you want to believe that there's a general out there that's seen the spaceship that's under the mountain Oh tell me about it mister general and he goes on a lecture tour and he got to pay money to see him and he's in a documentary and there's a lot of those people out there man I live with it I was backstage with Joe Perry what you do is in my own life yeah so I get what you're saying the Wow of the hell of the story but you know people love to tell stories something inside me that says you know what I do they still haven't found that that missing link that betweens if you talk to biology and how they but they do things so van they have Australia Pincus fossil they have the things that were like us that are different from a long fucking time ago they have those in the size of the brain yeah super low brain changed it doubled over a period of two million years I mean that did happen but they they know what we used to be there are simple hominids that were or rather ancient hominids that are very similar to human beings and they slowly became human beings and there's also they keep finding all these different versions of human beings like there wasn't just human it wasn't just Homo sapiens and of course there's Neanderthals and but there was that with the one from Russia what was that called that was in that move that book hominid what is that a deal I can't remember though it starts with a D but it's a one that they've found very recently very recently you find it Jamie yeah here it is Denisovan didn't Dennis so Denisovan Denisova hominin the extinct species of sub or subspecies of archaic humans they found in the 1970s by the russian paleontologists nikolai Oh Dolph so there's been a bunch of different forms of humans we're just the most successful form of human the idea that it's just alien DNA connected with people it's sexy it sounds fun but there's no evidence here you what we are as humans well we are mutations we are an ancient thing that slowly figured its way out we became better at seeing things we became better at hunting we became better at harnessing fire we're decent free well came from there's a lot of people that don't even believe it's real they believe in determinism they don't don't even believe that free will is an actual thing I mean I've heard Sam Harris or argue it pretty successfully that there is no such thing as free will that you are an accumulation of your genetics your life experiences all the things that have happened to you the people you've come in contact with that's true hero and that that feel psychology that's true havior think about your behavior yeah and how much of your behavior is shaped by millions of adoring fans and people screaming and cheering you on and singing songs that move people and chill it early change generations give people goosebumps they hear I mean all that stuff is shaped who you are I mean all that stuff changes who a person is and who you are now and the way you behave now is in many ways shaped by your life experiences as much it is as it is by your genetics and you wouldn't be this person if you hadn't lived that life and the decisions that you make from this moment on right now leave the studio and have a conversation with someone we shaped at least in part by this conversation and mine will be by my conversation with you this is what the idea behind determinism okay sure I would ask was who said this who was into this many many people that come up with this concept but I've heard it that what it was really argued to me by Sam Harris in the most successful Wow interesting I just wonder why then you know certain monkeys certain breeds of monkeys smart ones bonobos I love them because I'm a bonobo they have nothing stickers they'll put a stick in something and pull out shilla gee but you know well that's they haven't taken going oh wait a minute now then they haven't got anything gone past that well you know primatologists are actually believed that chimpanzees have entered the Stone Age this is one thing that's being considered now that they've started use of tools on a regular basis they think that they're learning from each other when they think that they're if if they are evolving right and if human beings evolved over a period of millions of years we are actually watching chimpanzees evolve in real time well I think so too a long long process that'll take millions of years but they have entered the Stone Age so they think that who knows with a series of mutations if natural selection with a bunch of different things happening what a chimpanzee is today most likely it will be a different thing in two million years of course it will yeah and they're totally agreeing right that these intelligent animals they're gonna experiment with things and here it is macaques often use stone tools some things have been living in the Stone Age for 50 years so for 50 years these animals just 50 okay like that that's when somebody first saw them using the stone true well in terms of primatologists behavior these archaeologists have uncovered stone tools they believe these animals have used hmm so or other humans yeah or other human because you can't throw your stone out right now when you look what do you think about when you look up in the night look I don't know the answers that's where I got my girls well I definitely don't know the answers either again but I just said I just repeat shit smart people figured out it's all what about the stones that are cut cut up and not much you Picchu but up and I know what you're talking about yeah those you know the laser-cut scene well not laser but yeah very precise cuts yeah whoever it was most likely advanced civilizations that have been wiped out I've had a close and that's what I'm saying so my mind goes to fuck yeah we were here sampling was underground there's places I saw movies of it uh-huh where you going to the mountain you go back three miles in the mountain right I seen this yeah the curbs yeah this incredible case rooms like this in there is natural cave systems in Texas that go back miles and so mountains so under sales or she said that's where my head goes through this you know ghosts come on that's your own fear I don't know but you know where you're talking about Muscle Shoals yeah those the feeling in that room mm-hmm there might be a similar feeling when a violent encounter happens in a house mm-hmm that might be what a ghost is what a ghost is is might be this thing you can't capture you can't put in a bog and can't wait on a scale but you get a feeling when you're in a place where something horrible happened and you could feel it it's not it's not impossible to imagine this is the case and Rupert Sheldrake was the guy that I told you believed that and he's a scientist and some people would argue against it but that he believes that things have memory and then it's impossible it's possible that even this table has memory all the people that have sat where you said I think it's got a vibe I'm not sure memory no it's got memory water nobody knows about that yet water right because it never goes anywhere you can never get rid of water it's true you can boil it steam and it goes up and comes back down right I think when they find out the memory in water I also got to tell you for the billions of PBS that was this is terrible or new strangled people with their heads bashed in murdered Wars right billions where they're ghosts where's that where's that energy where is that energy because in New York City alone there were hundreds of thousands of people murdered maybe that means apartment buildings should be going like this early because maybe it's accumulation of all experiences positive end neck and the negative experiences are outweighed by the positive experiences for the most part most of the time life is pretty good most the time life is not filled with war life is not filled with cannibalism and murder and animals eating you most of the time so most of the memories accumulated in these individual areas were probably positive but sometimes the idea behind like haunted houses and shit like that is that something so extreme happened that the remnants of that experience are trapped in the very fiber of the room I don't know if I believe it I don't know we're not outside the realm of possibility I don't either because I'll tell you who thinks about it some human yeah that knew that right here's what I protest I would find out somewhere that some unbelievable murder was taking place right don't tell anybody and let 10 families sleep in there see what a dum-dum I'm sure they have a cool go shows you got more notes are you are supportive I just want to finish that thing about MMA I want to ask you about little Tay yeah I did that for Jamie little tase a nine year old shit talker who flashes money and talks about her Bentley's and rolls-royce is nine years old nine years old it's fake you know she's parents so so put in with MMA for me is the music monitors Modernization Act okay so about five about five six years ago Dean will uphold and I just started looking at that and she's beautiful blonde lawyer woman great woman very smart very intelligent speaks over here at Brandeis or somewhere she's my lawyer was my manager for the longest time but she and I decided to go to Washington and start flashing the shit around saying you know what's fair and what's not why our musician is not getting paid right so I just thought Mme it's the same thing music modernization sex I won't forget this forget it cuz you know what that you can't forget so to attain fair market value royalty rates and treatment for music creators in the digital era the G the digital era right now is where if I could they can play my music because it's digital over air you know right Spotify and I don't get paid that the artists fuck me I got enough money I'm a happiest guy you came along I got this free shit I go to sleep right fucking with a smile on my face I get to do Joe fucking Rogan well I'm happy you just recognize a name Aerosmith with Joe Perry I'm happy as can be right but I look at these poor fucks victim you got to hear this well today - they get they have to give up merchandise they have to give up a piece of their concert sales oh they have to give up everything well yeah that's what's going on because there's no more money in actual record sales it's called a 24/7 or some kind of bullshit it's a crazy thing where they have a piece of everything because managers see it and they want your money right well they also realize that their avenue of revenue is gone so then they locked on to merchandise they locked on to ticket sales which used to be all yours right yeah like when you used to do concerts back in the day used to get paid for your render and even if you got fucked over you got some money from the record but then you would get all the money for the concerts right but but well not unless we were own managers 90/10 means we take 90% out 2% of the matters are there so you may like $800,000 a company gets it oh god that's different right isn't that a different thing well the record company gets gets publishing you know writing with all these digital outlets of course and then the then the record company company decides to give whatever is left to the artist which is usually little to nothing smokey fucking Robinson my dear friend I go up to this guy and I go I don't like you but I love you same all these songs phenomenal this fucking guy went to the digital's said you only $250,000 with proof they offered him they offered me for this for his music being played while the last five years why do they owe him that because diffic because he was getting nothing back was coming to him okay he's going shit the coffers are empty you know it says what the fuck right I'm Smokey Robinson right I hear my music his music is covered by hun thousands of people the guy knew legally $250,000 was owed to him okay okay he was offered 12,000 and he was said if you don't like it sue us smokey you don't have that kind of money so what we've done how praises that Smokey Robinson doesn't have that kind of money so it was like that Smokey Robinson should be just wealthy like a king and this does not to say he's not if you had no money at all he's one of the happiest guy and his wife is his sweetest and maybe he's a town attained something you and I don't recognize yet or or the mass media but he's got something he's rich but when it comes to him getting paid actually for songs that's really fucked up so what did he do so you decided to do I don't know I don't know where it's going I got to talk to you but david israelite the president and CEO of the national music publishers association and dina we went to went to washington magic this beautiful blonde of this fucking guy now we're in washington to me you know saying what's up with this this money is going right out the window and not to the artists these new artists getting nothing so we decided to do something for the first time songwriters will have representatives overseeing administration of mechanical licenses and administration so someone's now at least not only can you complain but there's someone watching that goes no no no you do in fact legally owned 250,000 smoke you come here Sam and for the first time so this is something we're trying to get passed in the next don't you think yeah it should be that no I do think you know that's the reason why we're not on that we're not on Spotify and the reason why we're not on is because it didn't make any sense they were like we want to put you on it's gonna be great for you Mike how is it great yeah you guys are gonna make money like you guys are making money you don't give us any it's a it's a court that the whole streaming thing is this weird smoke and mirrors song and dance they put on you're gonna be a part of something big but what are you selling all you sell is artists work you don't have anything to sell yep and I say to them artists get paid so little so little so where is the money going because there's all these in their fucking pockets public companies and their traded and they're worth millions and billions like where's all that money where's it going what's generating it you need to say to them what if I'm bigger than you are motherfucker motherfucker well 1909 19 the laws were written check this out in 1909 on track not paid attention to okay till fucking yesterday yesterday I mean you know five five recently so we're trying to get this Utica Modernization Act gains momentum in the Senate Oh Smokey Robinson powerful yesterday yesterday Jesus Christ Jim you're on the ball Wow so this is it right here I mean you know yeah well yeah there's been some fuckery there's been some legal fuckery and you know in ten years he created magic mm-hmm this guy I said I said to him what do you mean I don't like you but I love you seems that I'm always thinking of you and where the fuck did you come up with that line like I've said to Paul you know what was what was this you know he says well I was sent to New York to do some kind of publishing thing with lawyers and I was sitting in a hotel in New York right before I went in and I thought I wrote those lyrics somehow him being a young black man with songs 50 years ago in New York with lawyers probably white not just saying he was put in a situation where he had the magic he had the magic he wrote a paper I don't like you I love you seems like maybe the hate that he had for what was about to happen created the opposite III don't know but that's what he told me he said I was down there and waiting to meet my lawyers and I'm I said back let me ask you you never know when when Napster came along mm-hmm fucking hated that prick yeah he's so much you say they started stealing our songs yeah great take all the albums we've ever done take all the albums nuno bettencourt make all the albums that fucking you know the Rolling Stones ever did put them in a box over there now all my fur is gonna have access to that boxing right anybody can do it it's peer-to-peer everyone's sharing songs and I'm sure people are listening to me don't say what a prick he's fucking rich old fuck right but what's happened is is it's become the norm well it's been the norm is that people recognize that you can't do that with movies right they recognize that if you're stealing movies it's illegal like if you get caught with a BitTorrent account you got a bunch of movies on there and you're letting people download them you can get prosecuted yeah let me ask you why so much for that and not for somebody songs well there is a thing with songs too but it's just not as common right Jamie is that case of people have been sued for having tons of songs right haven't you but I think it for sure the the movie industry has gone after that if you're dubbing their movie yeah it's just songs for whatever reason after Napster became something that people think that you should just be able to get for free yeah can Spotify and what's the other one Spotify what's the other there's another one say titles getting in trouble right now who is entitle the company that jay-z owns with a few other they're getting charged for streaming to faking streams and not paying people off I mean it's just my daughter Chelsea she's in a band with John foster her husband they put something out and it's fucking ridiculously great where's the money go well this is what I'm saying to you when Napster came along and then things changed do you think that's when the music business really got crazy that's when they really say look we got a start we're not getting money from record sales anymore we're in the record business they can do this shit digitally we got to get a piece of that concert sales we got to get a pic piece of those tickets we gotta get the merch we got to get everything we got to solidify we got to make still make it a big deal and per extra money the pricks and the money grabbers from artists just wreaths uncton yes streaming three stream wreaths uncton and streaming seems like a more hostile version of it but let me ask you do you think it's the movie at the end of the day somebody executives let your ass equally somewhere you know when I watch this movie called vinyl you see that it's a documentary on whatever when it was out for a bit Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese they did a pretty good job they just got too into the characters brain going fucking crazy right and not enough of what was really going on with senior Falls right Mick Jagger's son was called the squeaky parts the nasty parts and it showed the managers snorting below and thinking how they could fucking take this and that it was so easy all the money was coming in to them they were making deals with this were the nasty parts weren't even signed to the label but you hear that are signed to the manager and the manager and a secret deal Sony but you hear that about boxers having shitty look and everybody creepy managers you hear about musicians comedians everything it's I hope there's kids out there right now listening to this that want to become lawyers and say did it I'm going to be the wild wild west with these knives we knew a new type of lawyer my up my uncle used to say oh really you have you know another way when I would say things to him like you know what about these lawyers they took on a case they find out after a year and a half the case is still going on grand jury but they find out that's a guy that they're kept they're handling really murdered the girl he's not allowed to speak they're not allowed to speak because that's the way we are yeah shit's got to change they can they can bow out but usually they don't you know you know when when OJ Simpson was was was it was in was caught right they still around I do your friend of Aerosmith's when we got sober we got sober in 88 the whole band-aid we have a guy to come out with us every month and without meetings and make sure everything was right beautiful and cool or in Germany how's everybody feeling go in the room you cool yeah everybody good feeling like using fuck yeah are you gonna know you know shit like a really cool guy he was asked to go into coj toxic psychosis well out of his fucking mind snorted so much coke and speed didn't mean to do that hold on who had talks about psychosis OJ Simpson he did my guy he's passed away since he cited coke and speed Oh Jay Simpson you don't think it was on coke that I know did you tell me I did you tell me I'm bald you're the one who brought it up it's not out there I didn't hear that did you hear him he was so I never got that far in the doctor that you hear say did I see him myself no no my god makes sense my guy was brought in there and I'll tell you why because he was one of those AAA gurus that the court system saw as somebody that if he says Joe Rogan he was on drugs that night he didn't know what he was doing don't die and now the judge goes okay let's get him into rehab and he's not new that's that you can't do that with murder nobody's gonna buy that toxic psychosis it cut your wife's head off they he was on drugs or some kind of law anyway the lawyers were looking to find someone to say that if he was caught they never did a blood test on him but my god he's arrested my guy came out he was in jail right you might say he's fucking toxic psychosis is when you do too much cocaine or too much speed or too much anything right you know but he also had a history of domestic abuse it was very violent to hit her a bunch of times and he could have just been that he went crazy and just stabbed her but didn't all his friends say he was doing blow all the time getting that guy that he jumped out the window say he was selling them blow I don't know how I do get up I would have to anyway so I'm just telling you sometimes these things do exist yes that's sad thing what managers I don't know I'm not sure how I got there it's okay what was the lawyers fucking over he was going lawyers so a lawyer brought in this a a guru a guy that knows about drugs and says hey he was on drugs I think it kind of softens the blow of the murder you know what he's doing if he was convicted if he was convicted right so you never you know look at come on so that was what they were gonna probably use on appeal uh yeah you know lawyers are right in the sentence lawyers will bring in but bring me bringing him in so because right now Trump won't say I apologize to John McCain because if he does doesn't everything else he said then come into light I don't know you tell me that's a good point but you know that he never apologizes about anybody remember so what just say he did now okay he's got lawyer let's not you know these fucking lawyers they tell him no no no no no don't apologize now because if you do it's gonna shed light on all the other shit you said about McCain I don't think he listens I think Trump does whatever the fuck he wants I don't think he's gonna listen to any he's a 72 year old billionaire and I don't think he listens to anybody I think he does whatever the fuck he wants yeah that's what I think that's the only thing that explains his tweeting and all that crazy shit that he says all the time perhaps I mean it's just complete guessing mm-hmm no I know him I knew him did you yeah fuck Karen does it feel weird that he's a president very he called okay Amy over there worked for his wife for seven years and then I got her and I was in Maui sitting on my bed and I get a phone call good song Jesus Christ is Donald she hands me the phone do you say the Donald or just don't know she said it's Donald I'm just kidding Melania okay she worked for milani in the family for seven years okay I get the phone call I pick it up I'm sitting down and I said what said hey Donald because we I've been down to mar-a-lago and he offered money to do shows one offs for him and just stuff I bet been up to his little castle and um he calls me up and I said Donald you can't use dream on as for causes not campaigns and he did anyway he did anyway and I had to sue him like a Deena's whom sent him a letter of cease and desist so I've been through that shit so I kind of know where lawyers live you know have this whole world run by Lars and Donald's got 90 lawyers that are telling him what the fuck okay maybe he's not listening right but when everyone is saying if you just say john mccain is a fucking hero if if we don't see john mccain as a hero then how do you expect any young don't ever join the Armed Forces because for everything they do in bullets they take they're gonna be laughed at by presidents like Trump right what the fuck are you saying Donald well he said something crazy like but she seems like soldiers that don't get caught things he said but but they do war is war who wants he soldiers don't get caught as they want to exactly so I just tell you that you know he's not saying anything because he's being told what to do and see I think he just does whatever the fuck he wants and if the lawyers tell him Stephen says you can't play dream on he's like fuck am i no it's what he did he played with anyone so I had sent him a cease and desist then he sends a letter and said what when I'm playing Kid Rock or something what what did he found a better song goes I found a better song I guess I shan't my would have to frame it that's his thing you know he likes insulting people and you know what I see how that how people get off on his what it is this I get isn't isn't he a president for this time though I mean this is the time we were talking before the show about people trying to drag people down and social media and there's so much hostility and people are looking to be angry and insult this is the time for that in a lot of ways unfortunately I wonder if he's opening something good he's opening Pandora's box for good or is he opening Pandora's it's our choice I think it's our choice these aren't present he's a president okay but I think we can respond to this bad feeling that we have about those kind of actions in a positive way I think that's where there's an opening I think the opening is for people to recognize it's not gonna live forever you can't insult people into the grave and feel good when you're dying it doesn't matter like what makes you feel good right now if something makes you feel good to constantly be knocking people down and shitting on their grave you're probably a terrible person nobody wants to be a terrible person least the majority of people don't so I think the majority of people are gonna recognize that this path is a bad one then it might feel good in the short term to say fuck you yeah we're gonna make America great again I'm gonna fucking light the world on fire but I think after a while when the tide goes in and the tide goes out people gonna realize that this is not the way to go I hope I hope we're gonna learn I think the world is getting better overall think there's terrible moments that have always existed throughout human history but I think overall if you look at the period of time we live in now you know and Steven Pinker wrote a great book about this and there's a lot of evidence that folks read his book yeah evidence that points to that every now and then I'll find somebody I've read something see something and I call my managers get me his number called Steven up I'm from Boston I met him and had lunch he's great at the what he called Krabbe you know you know Boston yes one of the best restaurants on the planet The Barking crab crab it fucking Menem I had lunch with him and we married Rebecca what a fucking slammin guy yeah he's a really kind hair it's fucking smart as to be friendly yeah this is the kind of people this is the kind sister I agree with you we need it's time for a lifting up yeah well I think that's gonna happen it's a really fun because right now it's natural homeowners well the more you know the more stupid shit goes on like this the more people are gonna recognize that this is not it's not good doesn't make people feel good and it's not even good for conservatives but conservatives just like it because it's their turn now and their turn they got a bully on their side yes the bows gonna kick ass it's gonna fucking do things the way we want yeah but yeah even they're gonna realize like this isn't the way you would admire people this isn't the way to go this is there's a there's a possibility to be kind and conservative at the same time this is possible yeah I think things will balance out that whoa you know only time will tell yeah look I'm using overly optimistic at times so don't listen to me no that's the best way to be I think so you definitely don't want to go into the hole that's what I'm saying doll I mean look at the music business yeah you know okay Hunter s Thompson quote the music business you know with come streaming you know you know this one I love this one it's a cruel and shallow money trench a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs there's also a negative side I fucking Hunter and I we were good friends for a bit I love that guy yeah yeah I'm a giant fan yeah amen you yeah let's wrap this up right here dude you're the best I fucking hope these days we got to do this again I hope we opened up some doors here we did we have some doors with me about UFOs and shit I'm nervous of all I got everything my ship that yes you know what it's totally possible that UFOs are real but beware of people that tell you they know the truth because people want to know the truth so the people that come along and tell you I know the truth too many of them are full of shit it's tui it's an easy conning that's my thought on Steven Tyler motherfucker yeah respect good night today [Applause] [Music]
