hello freak bitches and I was like well what is this whole Fitness connection the Mun thing like why do they need to be in shape I'm like I'm in pretty good shape like what's the big deal well I went with Rinella when I went with Ranaut one of the things I realized like boy I got pretty winded going up these fucking hills like hiking hiking tires you out especially high altitude and then I see your your videos online I was like what fuck is this guy into and then as I go deeper and deeper into I realize like oh this is like an extreme pursuit this is not just like something just go out and do this is something that's really hard to do and a lot of people there I've read this one article but this one guy was unsuccessful twelve years in a row elk hunting yeah boy we finally shot an elk yeah 12 years like how many times this guy go out how many days would be camp in the forest yeah how many days you try to stalk and get winded or snap on a twig at the last minute or you know the elk season and bolts it most people are unsuccessful yeah I mean 9 out of 10 every year unsuccessful I think it's more than that for hunting with archery it it's about it's about 10 percents is it 10 percent yeah so 9 out of 10 are unsuccessful so people who don't hunt who see you know dead stuff all the time they think oh you just go out and kill an atom right no right most 90% don't it is really hard and it's just like until you're out there you got the bow in your hand and you're trying to close in on that animal and you're trying to do everything right from A to Z with and there's so many variables during that whole path it's just like it seems impossible sometimes you know even even for me after 30 years so in a sense psychologically when you talk about postmodernists and their rejection of these classic male structures or what they doing is realizing that they're not going to compete in the classic as stated male hierarchy so they're creating their own version of it sure that's the creative element sure well we asked earlier what's the motivation of these pathological guys who are out there like bolstering up the feminists yeah well you know they don't compete any other way they don't compete they figured out how to compete they compete as allies let's say hmm very sneaky Wow yeah Wow sneaky yeah and that's how everybody always describes him too when you I mean it's almost like that yeah we I avoid doing it because I just it just almost feels gross to label them like that but that is the way you think of male feminist you think of them as sneaky yeah and yeah it's creepy and discriminatory towards classic male behavior well it no wonder yeah they haven't got a hope of competing in that hierarchy wow that's deep that is deep this is going to be hurtful to a lot of people it's not people listening to us right now very upset yeah well you asked earlier why why the postmodernists don't like blunt speech yeah well that's why man you know it's like the truth is something that burns it burns off Deadwood and people don't like having their Deadwood burnt off often because they're like 95% Deadwood and I'm not being don't believe me I'm not being snide about that it's no joke when you start to realize how much of what you've constructed of yourself is based on deception and and lies that is a horrifying realization and it can easily be 95% of you your things you say things you act out you know it's well you see that in Pinocchio which I often you discuss you know Pinocchio when he gets corrupt as he as he matures he first learns to lie and then he becomes a braying jackass on Pleasure Island it's like and and he's threatened by the underground authoritarians right they're going to sell them to the salt mines like yeah that's for sure it's exactly right man so then you figure out you're a braying jackass and you're lying all the time that's a terrible realization and then all that needs to be burnt away and no people don't like that it ties into like misconceptions that are natural like funny thing like when I was in the video game industry there's you know platform games you jump from little platforms and sometimes you have like platforms that move around and rather than Mario type things right in some video games when you jump up on a moving platform and then jump down and fall down you will fall down but the platform moves out from underneath you sometimes you jump up and you move with the platform and you land on it depends on what the programmer did right now a friend of mine was doing a video game and one of the programmers says like oh if you jump up and then jump down the platform should have moved out from underneath you so you should be able to like a you should be able to you know this is the way we should program the physics and then my friend map said no that's wrong and he couldn't convince this other guy so eventually what happened he says right what we're going to do is we're going to go out onto the road with my pickup my pickup truck I'm going to get in the back and you're going to drive along at 30 miles an hour and I'm going to jump straight up in the air and we're going to see whether I land in the truck or I land on the road so they did this experiment I'm the guy the other guy was driving the truck was totally expecting him to like jump up and then fall out the back of the truck because the truck will moved on because he's moving the same speed whereas the truck three jumps up and then he lands back in the truck right and this that this is illustrating that this video game programmer had the exact same misconception that the flat earthers do because they say oh wait the earth is moving so fast why can't you just go up in a helicopter hover a bit wait for the earth to move underneath you and then go back down again right it's just you know it's completely backwards physics because you're already moving so you have to slow down to zero which is the same as speeding up and relatively speaking so the point is that anyone can make misconceptions about physics like that yeah and it's easy to get sucked into it and it's actually quite hard to break them even like this this reasonable guy was like in a video game programmer who presumably knew something about physics he was convinced that Matt was going to fall out of the back of the truck and quite possibly dies but he still ended the experiment [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
