hello freak bitches your heads not to get supposed to jostle away yeah yeah yeah but goes every direction except it goes yeah right except down well I have a buddy of mine who's a professor who's 49 or 50 in kick boxes he's bars and I'm like you but you know you understand that yeah like you're into this yeah you know he's a history professor but you understand that this is dangerous your brain but you get so much enjoyment out of the thrill of being primal yeah we being in their sparring and let me ask you a question did we we didn't talk about this last time that calcio storico thing in italy what yes yes yes bare-knuckle football with bare knuckle boxing insane insane yeah so I was gonna go to know about that please same except documentary yes yes and a Pete Berg I think I'd end up making it anyway but we were like just broken up I'm like why am i making a documentary with my ex-boyfriend this is really self right abusive but it's apparently the eat the month that it happens violence in the area goes down course yeah so there's something interesting about these guys who want to go spar like maybe they're sexually harassing less women at work maybe they're you know putting less bar fights this is calcio storico so it was invented in the 1600s to entertain Kings it was stopped because so many people were dying and then in I want to say 1916 they brought it back they keep it low profile because so many people get concussions and sick I'll just group kick box it's like I think 20 on 20 but the only rule is no two on one these are grown men these are not young like athletes they're not professional athletes they're butchers they're lawyers they're whatever just exchange partners like guys just moved and a new guy moved in they just touched hands like one guy was duking it out with a guy and for some reason they changed bare-knuckle yeah it's also by region so it's like neighborhoods against neighborhoods so a lot of it's like fathers against sons brothers against brothers they change teammates like two guys were fighting and then another guy steps in and takes the place first of all these guys have dogshit skills but it's know these are Nagai just stepped in these are more professional athletes these are literally guys that have other job Hubbs once a year they just agree to fucking just fight shit fuck that's pretty which one is this what what number minute are you in first Oh what first okay how about ball two you should see the ball and actually the goal is to get the ball into the other side but when you talk shit skills is so funny I'm just allowing that when the person scores they get so hit so hard that no one wants to score like everything no you do it you do it because as soon as you score people just pummel you and then you see these guys in the corners with stretchers they just carry people off the field the entire time so this guy's holding this guy down so you could grapple - yes the only rule you can buy it you can kick it bite you can do anything anybody the only thing you can't do is two on one that's the only rule you can bite the only rule is no two on one you can kick in the balls I'm sure I mean maybe that's like a gentleman you like these two guys are the only two guys that are humping look at these two guys this guy's got this guy's back and there's a lot of people fucking lollygaggin sure a lot of cherry figures I guess what are you fucking looking they need to get out there and they're like what the fuck am i doing I have a family that's knock these guys out one at a time what the fuck are we doing here oh is that guy Oh someone got smacked yeah he goes down he's got the ball and went down then another guy took his place and this guy's just sort of avoiding the whole thing yeah this ball guy looks gay is fuck no all oh see there's a guy gets knocked down but look as soon as he gets knocked down another guy steps in and he fights the guy that he was fighting before he got knocked down oh what a bizarre stupid men it turns into just like a melee yeah of madness and it's just it's actually interesting to watch the clusters happen like the energy going into one place only one block I yeah I know that's why it's so that's why it's so nobody watching these are great good guys these are not professional athletes like they trained for it like it's it's almost like a what's that thing the guy earn man it's like a voluntary thing that they do it's tradition if you do it if your dad did it it oh god yeah so stupid it's so ridiculous but there's a lot of tradition in it and see everyone wears like Joker uniforms or what I said guys that are humping yeah this still is bothering just like hey you can this guy's got this guy's back but he's not doing anything by the way you should go out there one here and do the commentary like where all the black people this guy's fuckin gay two more bars getting happy now they just took a bad another like maybe just a Sicilian this guy's annoying you've got dogshit skills well it just seems like uh you mean if you got a little bit going on see the yellow guys in yellow that's when people get fucked up does yeah they just get taken off the field yeah and then they have to play I think it's two 20 minute quarters and then the winner the winners have to play again the next day again that three days in a row Oh championship is four days later and the winning team their prize is a cow look at a cow you get a cow a cow get money you don't get endure the thing I like about it that attracted me to it there's no endorsement deals there's no nothing's being promoted it's just people that want to fucking fight each other but I understand is where's the leg kicks do you guys not understand about leg kicks they're Italian yeah but they're not there's a few kicks being thrown but Noah's throwing any leg kicks they're standing right in front of each other but there's no takedowns there's no takedown attempts it's just shitty boxing with the occasional kick it's this is it's basically just like a giant street fight right but these guys have a little bit of skill like I'm looking at the way these a lot of the other see here's a takedown look at this but nothing happens so you can take your guy down but look at the way these guys are like standing in front of each other like as you can I think they probably get out there and like are like wait what am i doing let's just like pace around and see if we can just get through this 40 minutes so it's so weird because they just exchange partners they move back and forth like they square off and then they decide I want to fight you I'm gonna fight your friend well it's so interesting because think about it it's like these are not trained guys but it's like if you put 20 people fighting there's no pressure to do it right away you know it's like when do you decide it's time to take you down you know oh Jesus this is really okay is this guy this guy with the balls gonna go through he's got to get through yeah and then they're just talking shit like that I'll I said like you look at that kick like how do you get just no one know how to kick no I think most people unless they're in Thailand probably don't I went and saw what those fights in Thailand doesn't have to solve this is I had to watch those but the point is there's your estate
