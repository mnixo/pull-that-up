hello freak bitches I'm talking that story is crazy I was telling a friend of mine about it the the story of you you were in Alberta and you shot an elk and these wolves circled the elk how many wolves were there well at first there was just the one the one came in and you know the one came in on us and I and and that's one I do want to say off the beginning one thing that I always do as a hunter is I always buy a predator tag if it's available if I know that I can get it that I can buy a tag for coyotes or wolves I always have one in my pocket because you do see you know they're out there and they're out there way more now and this and this is an exact reason why you got to do it because literally we had an elk down and next thing you know we're out there kind of you know getting it ready to like you know to cut it up and stuff and get it out of there and all sudden this big wolf comes you know it comes in and I had spotted it and we weren't really being noisy so I ended up shooting that wolf and it kind of went off and you know with a bow there's no noise so what we didn't realize was there was a pack there and that that was actually it was an alpha female is because of the size of it I mean you saw the size of it yeah it's bit as big as me and it actually went off and then we kind of thought that was freakin freaky well then about 20 minutes later all sudden we see another one and we see another one and we're kind of like holy crap so we start moving into this draw and one of them was like making like a noise almost like it was injured or something I was like whimpering so we're like what is a deal so we we were on high ground with the elk and then we started moving down into this ravine because we saw the the Wolves down in there and next thing you know we get down in there and I start looking around and there's like hair on the trees there's like I mean it looked like that movie into the gray the gray the gray then that's a exactly what it looked like liam neeson there was like freaking hairy turds everywhere it was just there was like beds it was hair rubbed on the trees and I started looking around there's like holes dug in and I'm like I literally look at my two buddies that were there with me and I said right in their frickin den like you know and I think we had that elk was not too far you know our elk wasn't too far so when you shot an elk that they probably thought it was theirs oh they definitely thought of it was theirs yeah they definitely thought that was theirs so then once we're down there all sudden we hear this how we're like down there we hear this howl and it was definitely an alpha because an alphas the how it literally turns your blood instantly cold if you're right in on a true wolf howl it's I mean it's like so freakin low and deep and it's just like chills your blood what you realize it's not a game well yeah then I realize I'm like we're in their freakin den and you know I'm kind of looking down I'm like okay well shot an elk then I shot that I've got two arrows left so and you know both my guides kind of had you know once we set oh there's wolves they like grabbed gun we kind of went down in there to see what was up well now this happens the next thing after that alpha sounded off it was like and I mean 12 I think it was 12 sounded off all the way around us we're in a we're literally down anyone who's been in Alberta you know that the farmland is level and then it falls into the river system so we're literally they have the high ground there's a dozen wolves and we're in the middle and we're like what the crap so I just I'm like get you back to a tree so we kind of all spin around and we're sitting there the next thing you know here comes two dogs on a full-blown I'm talking like full-blown like this like running coming and I mean it turned into chaos there was like bullets flying I mean there's freaking arrows skipping off junk and we ended up shooting both of those wolves dead and there's a few gun fires going well I'm down to like one arrow left and I told the guy I said how many bullets you got and he goes well I didn't you know I just grabbed the gun - couple bullets like I didn't know where this was all going down so count we're kind of like we need to get out of here so we started backing up and next thing you know they the Alpha sounded off again and they all reported this time there's only two there are two less so next thing I know I'm like kind of we're trying to back out so when you say that wouldn't you say they reported there's so there's they know that - were dead you so all of them are howl and I'm certain that the first how was the alpha male pretty much saying in is everyone in position because then they all like yes yes all the way around then also in the to come all hell breaks loose then we're like the Alpha sounds again but he's in a different location he was actually to my left like right here and really close and I mean it's thick in there you've been there you know how thick it gets so then they sound awful now this time there's two less so I'm kind of looking because I know this wolf that sounded was and I know it's the Alpha so I like grab my bow and I start kind of creeping over there and as soon as I get to where I can see he's like fricking standing right there and how far mmm 30 yards soon which is wolf can cover Jamie pull up that picture from Joe's Instagram like it was about a week ago he found those pictures of those wolves yeah I forget who the photographer was there's got some amazing photographs war yeah it was it was like not the most recent one on that was on that dead moose but it was that was from National Geographic that was actually a bison those from yeah yeah that's right yesterday or the day before look at that right there that is exactly the face that I saw in the but he was head-on he wasn't broad but that face were he was literally looking at me like that and I mean you're in a fight or flight like I'm in totally in a fighter flight I had one arrow left on my string I freaking grab my bow I literally I like I just I kind of looked at him I knew at that moment it was like he was coming yeah that's like freaking deja vu right the Twitter the Instagram page Jamie do go back up a little bit is CJ M underscore photography and if you go to that guy's Instagram page he's got amazing photographs just and he's out there with them there was another one that I had and it's just right before that Jamie the before that wolf picture there was another wolf picture that one look at that one man he's got snow all over his face and his teeth are bare that's yeah that's a cool picture like to me that's pretty cool Oh wolves are amazing they're amazing and the one thing people underestimate about hunters is our respect for animals I love him why did you kill I freaking I totally respect in my love but I can tell you that other picture right there when you have that looking at you in the face I mean I knew it was like frickin do-or-die and I I literally looked at that thing and I said out loud I said I'm gonna shoot you in the effin face because I you don't swear yeah sorry it's cute and my boy might listen and I remember I drew back I like I literally drew back and I anchored and I came into my peep and it's which means look for people don't know there's like a little circle that you look at through the string we have lining up with you site so I was literally lining up the shot lining up the shot and as soon as I kind of brought my shot down to where that wolf was there was nothing there he bolted no I think he just like yeah like ninja'd well he that wise in that big in that old they've got a no wonder they might mean smart they had to have known that you killed the elk and they had to have known that you killed those other two wolves that chased you they don't have yes I think at the elk I think he came in to thank oK we've you called the fight we responded now he's like sizing up okay I've lost here's what I've lost I want to know what I'm going against he kind of came in he freaking looked at us all and then that was it good thing they can't count for you he only had yeah two hours left yeah yeah two hours and two bullets like how many bullets that guy pick up it was up three it was bone-chilling I mean I mean I have you and I both have friends that are Grizzlies cats I mean cats are notorious for stalking hunters too because I mean they are the ultimate hunter but Grizzlies and wolves I mean they're you have to be on guard that you know there's places now where you know Grizzlies are strongly becoming such a problem when it comes to you know they have to be controlled they're just starting to get to be too many for especially for the food source you
