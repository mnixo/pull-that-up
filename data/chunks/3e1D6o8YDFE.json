the Joe Rogan experience so I wish I went to like a day of media training and it was and it was and the worst part was I've done interviews I've been fine before yeah but I got this guy sitting across from me who's interviewing me doing this mock interview and then I've got the publicist and my writing partner and they're just staring at me and now Alison I can't do it right all the pressure is there who's teaching you who's teaching this media training here's the day right away like you kind of suck at this yeah absolutely I mean they were really nice about it they're like okay all right well there's some through some room for perfect oh my god really oh yeah I know it was the worst you seem like a natural I mean there's what what is there to teach you well know what this is the things I'm really comfortable with this yeah but with us just hanging out here talking sure but this is what I do is I Yammer when I'm a nervous talker so you asked me a question if I'm nervous I just kind of go and go and go and people are like Jesus you know so the thing is I got this guy stood across me really nice guy and he's the guy who's coaching me but I know I'm gonna give you like fake interviews look how they quote you first he gave me he gave me a lot of really good insights and the funny thing is every rule that he's saying as he's saying it I'm gonna yeah I do that oh yeah like everything he's saying that I shouldn't be doing I'm like oh yeah that's I always do things you shouldn't be doing I mean that the main thing it's kind of like we were getting at before that when somebody's setting a trap for you because so much of right now media training is just about don't go out and get yourself into trouble by going in and and just talking about some ridiculous area that because that's what people that's what everybody's trying to do now like just as a for example I did a Time magazine interview about adoption about a year before we even made the movie really yeah they and it was just because I was in the process of working on the movie and anyway so I the whole thing was just about adoption in my family and whatever and it was right when the Harvey Weinstein stuff was blowing up so ladies really nice interview and then at the end she said hey you know since I'm talking to a Hollywood director I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff and I was like no I enemy and I didn't even think about my answer because I don't you know I didn't know the guy was never around any of it that's sort of like more like fancy movies and I was like yeah no I don't I don't know I never met the guy whatever I didn't think anything of it I got off the phone and then I thought oh she didn't say what do you think about this stuff she said did you know about that stuff hmm it was like and yet I knew but I kept it a secret yeah yeah you know the limiting factor was just like I was just getting bored I wasn't actually breathing what were you thinking of this is the thing I mean you had any given time any tied you had to think of something that was going to be more powerful than the thought of stopping or fatigue or si else's like deeper into your skin and so sometimes it was real easy because you were swimming with dolphins minke whales that's one with a basking shark did they come over to you yeah one brilliant yeah there's a video of the ages ago with the the minke whale and the house for 12 hours across the Bristol Channel so that's kind of England to Wales and this this was without doubt for all the hardship that I've spoke about I just want to say that there was some amazing moments this one particular moment swimming across the the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden minke whale kind of about because this table breeches right next to me I was like whoa like Thomas Rhys I turned to map the captain I was like man am i safe like what's going on like shall I get out the warranty said no no no you're absolutely fine and I was like is he's a minke well that they find the friendly I was like ok fair enough so I keep swimming and then for the next five miles the minke whale was circling me it was breaching over the top it was coming under me and swimming like that well I turned him out I said like now or what's going on and he said I've never seen this he's been sailing like 40 years he says I've never seen this he said but what I think is happening is I think it's a female and I trying to fuck you well I said it's not mating season it expires fine again what I think happen you for later okay I've seen him for four months in this water I'm gonna fuck it mating season is probably right around the corner she's like if he sticks around I know I was like that was a concern of mine but no Matt said no no I think it's a female I think that she thinks that you're an injured seal and so for the next five miles she basically guided me all the way to the shallower water and as I got there it was literally the depth for the water Matt said yeah yeah much shallower water and we turned whale breached one more time and then and then swam off as if to say you know you're safe now Wow why is there so much pushback against it well so the thing is I think what's going on and so people worry that it doesn't look like a problem to be solved anymore so when you want our kids we both have lots of gay friends but we didn't know it because they're not telling anybody because someone's gonna kick their ass if they knew that they were gay now yes gay people are still discriminated against but it's so much better than it was then what you don't want to what I think people are advocates don't want to say is well there's no problem anymore because then you can allow them to still run into troubles in various circumstances even though the trouble they run into today is a thousand times less than the trouble they ran to and very little same thing holds for racism same thing holds for sexes and they've all gotten so much better but and sexual violence is a perfect example you know if you look at if you said this is in Pinker's book if you said rape and homicide - you call it both of them whatever level they are in 1970 - a hundred and then you track them through to the early 2000s homicide is in the u.s. homicides dropped down to like 50 rapes dropped down to like 25 but if you listen to women's advocacy groups about campus sexual assault and stuff you'd never know that and the reason you wouldn't know it is because they people worry well if you think the problems getting better on its own then you won't keep doing anything to help fix it and that's a really unfortunate part of our psychology because it makes people feel like there's been no progress and when you feel like there's no progress then you think well maybe we need to completely overturn the whole system and try something new and that's of course the point of Pinker's newest book enlightenment now know things are going freaking great turn it anarchy and all those things are really bad ideas voting for somebody like Trump's a really bad idea because things are actually running along really nicely it's just that we tend to forget it because every advocacy group who's all worried about whatever their particular issue is doesn't want the word to get out that things are a lot better than they used to be because I think it's some fundamental level they think well twenty five rapes here isn't bad enough we better say that there's a hundred you know I'm not saying they do this consciously but of course twenty five rapes here whatever the number is is bad enough right it doesn't it doesn't have to be the numbers that it used to be when I was a child to be a problem it all has to be is a number above zero for my whole apprenticeship alcohol was a reward you know you did a good job tonight drink you know and then it went from reward dude oh shit there was like a bloodbath in the restaurant you know we had to pick up this guy at the hospital okay it's not a reward let's forget about it let's drink you know yeah and it was it was always there you know that's great service let's have a drink no you're in the food industry but you're also in the wine industry because fifty percent of what you're doing is selling food to people and the other fifty percent of what you're doing is selling alcohol to people so by default you're part of the people that sell a liquid drug dealer in that you're in that world every day you go to wine tastings you talk with peoples that sell alcohol that bartenders you talk to people that sell wine you're partaken eating and other your colleagues restaurants and drinking wine X thing you know you have a little bit of celebrity you've been open for 15 years and you look back and you go the seven days in a week seven days in a week and I drank six of them I don't feel good on Sunday I'm just kind of recovering and then what happens is one week turns into two to four and then you kind of look back and you realize in 2017 that you may have drank forty eight weeks out of 52 you know and then it goes quick then it's ten years your pen your restaurant and you've been drinking five days out of the week for ten years and then all of a sudden you kind of have a problem you realize that like my day-to-day is based on food and wine right now I don't want my it's not making me happy I've had all the wines I've had all the foods am I better for it not really what am I better for restriction eating less eating clean drinking all that spent very special occasions do you still drink especially I don't I'm completely sober no you see them now I've even seen them switch teams and you see them switch teams and I don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology but I think is what they're doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an in on this team right and they can just say this is the problem with the team I used to be on those fucking losers and they're really Benedict Arnold right and like they probably have as much of an affinity to the ideas of one side as it do the other side they just go all in on one side to get acceptance from the group right you just no way people change their opinion that much over two years or something like that or you know it's like they just decide this group makes more sense now and I've been attacked by people on the left so I'm gonna go to the right or vice versa and usually what it is is meaning when even when they say they've been attacked like oh you fucking baby there's 300 million people just in this country alone if you put something out there publicly and a thousand people attack you don't act like you're being persecuted okay you have an idea you've you've you've launched that idea out into the zeitgeist and people took a big shit on it you know whether it's people on the right or people on the left you got to be able to argue your point one way or the other and not just immediately jump ship on someone who shares ideas with you decides that your idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and maybe you're right but you got to argue that through but this idea of these partisan patterns that people just seem to automatically fall into they're so detrimental to dialog they're so detrimental to us under really understanding each other and really having some sort of a sense of community right this is a giant community of 300 million people that's supposed to be yeah and this idea that it's this group is trying to fuck it up and they're trying to turn us all Muslims and this one wants everybody to be gay and this one wants everybody to fucking have free food on this and is this is nonsense this is nonsense we need better understanding and what and you know the word better education gets tossed around but it also means better social understanding right better social education like an appreciation of who we are and why we think the way we think and calling out weasels on both sides of the pattern like calling out weasels on the right that are pandering that are just trying to like get up you know the repeating a lot of these like accepted beliefs because they know that they can hit this frequency and a lot of people sing along or the same thing that our people are doing on the left they're doing it on both sides I think most reasonable people have a collection of ideas that they share from both the right and the left and most reasonable people are reasonably compassionate and I think that's one of the things that we're missing but yeah most places they have them and they're managed and you go out and buy two small game license for 12 bucks or whatever get your hunter safety get yourself a 22 or a shotgun and you can become a squirrel man or a squirrel lady like your buddy Kevin Murphy this is one of my favorite guys on your podcast he's a squirrel man this guy blows a horn in the woods before every hunt to alert the animals that he's coming yeah blow yeah he carries a cow horn around because I think that I think um it's in a shofar right is that right for you know when you blow the shofar and like a Jewish in a synagogue is that what it is Thanks called a shofar like you blow the ram's they blow a ram's horn it's not it's not a cow yeah it's not a cow horn but Saran horn you know the end of um you know in the end of no country for old men yeah have we talked with us before no he talks about his father riding out ahead of him with a horn of fire in the end when you get here elates the dream it's in the book and it's in the movie murder the time he Lee Jones character is describing a dream in which they're riding through a snowstorm and his father rides ahead with a horn of fire and I was wondering how many people heard that and had no idea what he was talking about but what a common practice used to be is you take a horn buffalo horn cow horn and it's hollow because it grows off a protrusion of the skull called horn Corps and you pop the horn off in its Hollow and what people would do is when you left your campfire in the morning you would fill that horn with embers and cap it but there'd be a little pin hole in it just to let a little bit of air in air so it could continue to smolder and you carry that horn all day full of embers and at night to start a new fire you would dump the horn out and rekindle your fire so when he talks about his father riding out ahead of them with a horn of fire what that's meant to say is that he knew his father would be waiting out of head of him with a fire burning whoa yeah but Kevin Murphy just blows it less squirrels know he's coming [Laughter] [Applause]
