hello freak bitches I also don't know if life can actually evolve and progress just through pure logic or pure rationality I think chance is very important in life and I also think being creative and creative must to some extent involve that ridiculousness at least must involve the question of asking why now it might get more logical and rational as we go forward but I'm not sure we're ever going to completely be the perfect mathematical model that we would want to be I'm not even sure that if we had perfect intelligence if let's just say hypothetically we became that perfect intelligence we might purposely sabotage ourselves just so that we always have that element of irrationality in our lives to keep us on the go to keep us moving forward to keep us evolving so I'm so that's the first part of that I think the second part of what you're speaking about the interesting thing that I always tell people because I get asked this question a lot is that right now our current perception of the universe is pretty limited for example our eyesight can only see about 1% of the light spectrum our ears can hear far less than 1% of the of the sound of sound waves and what's possible in the universe so our actual ability to determine what is in the universe is is completely limited and in fact so limited that we're just basically getting tiny bits of it as we get as we progress forward I think we're going to have apps more applications towards getting a better perception in our senses of what the universe really entails we'll all have night vision will have be able to see different types of gases in the air will will have different types of feelings that are based in with with this these kind of hyper senses and that in itself will give us so many new experiences and I try to tell this to people a lot that we're actually going to become much more complex we think this is our world around this but actually if you and I had bionic eyes we'd see that there are maybe a billion different organisms in this room that are also interacting with us and that's something that I'm not saying it's going to maybe take us down either a smart or a bad path but it's something that could be different that could take us to other ideas and other ways of experiencing the world that makes it so it's not either worrying or makes it so it's not so you know so kind of crazy though you know I don't think that humans are ever going to entrace humans at least to start with are going to give up some of the ridiculous aspects of their life because one of the things that motivates us is fun and one of the things in in human experience that is fun is being ridiculous so I think you need that creativity you need the creative element in the species I think that most I've ever done was I think 10,000 the gym corporate event it was it wasn't people showed up to see me I was a sammy hagar was on and steve miller i was on wow you were the sammy hagar honesty but what a steve miller look like did you even recognize him I know because the album was only the white horse like so by wagon you know teenage years of listening I've never saw what he looked like he looked like a dad with a blazer and jeans and just one out there that's the thing about steve miller he is the least recognizable major he walk round rock star yeah he could walk around anywhere it seemed like he never tried to become famous are you gonna out him on the podcast that's Steve Miller that's what he looks like now dude he had some fucking jams jungle love that was Eddie Redmayne oh that whole album reminds me of just yea high school take the money wrong yeah this is star about peeling jokes we thought we thought we were cool too because we're listening to classic rock yeah that was technically so we're into this stuff not this new edition you know it's really fucking weird man I went to high school in 1981 and in 1981 I started hanging out with these kids I just moved into town into Newton Upper Falls and I started hanging out with my friend Jimmy and Jimmy and all of his friends were all from the other side of town there they all like the north part of Newton and they were all like everyone at doors t-shirts and they were all smoking weed and it was like they introduced me to all this music that I didn't even know existed but when I think about it now the shit was only 10 years old yeah like the Allman Brothers they were they were playing like some Allman Brothers or some doors that shit is from like 1969 1970 so at the time we're talking I went to high school in 81 that was my freshman year this is what is it 12 13 years old in fact it's nothing that's like some music from 2001 yeah like that's contemporary you know like a song from 2002 you could still hear like on a regular basis that that would be on radio station that was 80's 90's in hits sex and candy yeah you can hear that you could easily hear that someone can play that non ironically on a regular radio station they wouldn't be saying y'all remember this shit that would be a song they would play but that sex and candy song came out like like 99 or some shit yeah so think about that like that we wouldn't say yeah man that was the classic something fucking happened to time all right time is not what it used to be 10 years ago doesn't mean shit anymore but 10 years ago back then meant a lot when I was in high school and in 1981 a nineteen seventy car was a mother fucker if you had a nineteen seventy Chevelle or a nineteen seventy Barracuda you had a fucking sweet car all you got a classic muscle car it's like 10 years old right what the fuck happened and hey does that what happen the acceleration just information where pump we're going to the library every single secondly look at her phone you know that's what's happening right that is what's happening here oh that's deep let's clean my bedroom the other day and i have a pretty big bed but underneath the bed it's like in the middle you never can get anything on you know like if something falls under the bed so i was trying to get everything and i pulled out a single cheeseburger for mcdonald's that i guess i was eating and I through what threw it on the ground or something and I just went in there getting person to you I know baby happy to live like I'm had mcdonalds in my bed for at least six months and so that should but when I opened it it look brand new it looks just exactly the same you would buy it at ryans apartments like the raft of a survivor see it's just scattered disarray with bobbers and nets and one shoe yes higher it in the corner for some reason here yeah that big area in the middle we can't reach under your bed that area is a problem it's disgusting because if you ever do move your bed your bed you're like looking at one that's so gross how much we have to pay you to lick that the center area where you can't reach just do the whole line line all the way up from the head of
