ladies and gentlemen one of the best boxers on planet earth and his trainer beau Mac and Terence Crawford gentlemen thank you very much for coming here thank you but live now appreciate it appreciate it hey man I'm a big fan of yours I've we've talked about you many times on this podcast I'm a huge fan of the way you switch stances you know you switch switch stances as smooth as anybody ever like like you got to go back to Marvin Hagler to find a champ that switch stances like as fluidly as you it's pretty pretty impressive stuff man have you always been doing that lot of practice yeah since I was little I remember getting in trouble because I used to always switch him my coach just always saying you need to worry about fighting one style first and perfecting that before you try to try to switch and do a different style but I always switch so it got to the point where there was just like all right would you gonna fight like that we're gonna train it like that Wow so you forced it through right Wow now when you first started out was there anybody that influenced you to switch like that or was it just something you felt naturally or was just naturally wow it was just like art it's not working so I gotta do something else just make it more tricky right yeah well that's that's part of what's interesting about watching you fights watching you fight is that you could see you trying to figure out what's up like first rounds with when when you fight is one of my favorite things to watch because I see you measuring dudes I see things happening and you're switching stances and then when you start finding the timing it's like timing is one of the more fascinating things to watch about boxing because a guy who has perfect timing and perfect but like when you see a guy make a read and then execute and it's perfect it's one of the most beautiful things in all sports right right it's like you you know you're watching they every move and then you just dissect and them slowly how do you think do you think about it like when you when you start around a first round of a fight is it different for every fighter or do you always want to do that do you always want to like put them into the computer now it's different it's different like sometimes I just want to go out there and just be like all right I'm gonna see what this duel guys see if you can tell you just go right to them yeah and then sometimes I just black all right I'm gonna take my time and you know figure them out see how fast he is see you know what things you'd like to do and what you don't like to do or see if I move this way his reaction just certain things it's you know but you came to the UFC this weekend and you know obviously I love MMA but one of the things that I love about boxing is when you take all the elements you take away wrestling and kicking and all that stuff you get the highest level of in exchanges and punches and you get to see with guys like you guys like Canelo or Floyd or the the top level boxers you get to see what's possible with guys that are training with the best scientific methods and with all the knowledge of all the past fighters I mean when you were growing up who what was the the fighter that influenced you the most well hands-down Floyd Mayweather and Roy Jones jr. you know I used to love watching Roy Jones jr. I'm pretty sure everybody everybody was a fan of Roy but set aside Roy always watched it Floyd Mayweather and Pernell Whitaker yeah I was too young for Sugar Ray Leonard and them so I'm old enough for that I was there for the Sugar Ray Leonard days I was there for Sugar Ray Tommy Hearns that the Sugar Ray duran I was there for all that stuff but I watched everything when I was when I was young my coach Mitch miner he used to always take me to his house and watch boxing tapes that was the keep me off off the streets and keep me out of trouble until I went to the gym is he still around my pass damn he probably like look at that what did that work out you know we talked about an investment in time that worked out tremendously yeah it's always in our culture there's a special place for the highest level of boxers it was like a special place of admiration and I just feel like with guys like lomachenko with guys like you with Canelo and triple G this is a great time for boxing it's fun to watch man there's so many Italy Aero Spence jr. there's so many elite boxers right now it's like a really exciting time for sure for sure do you recognize your place in history to recognize that like you're a special dude of course of course like always tell people when they mentioned me and arrow Spence you know of course I want to fight I'll tell her everybody always say with or without him I'm going to the Hall of Fame well you look at all the things that I've accomplished in the sport of boxing people that's in the Hall of Fame then you've accomplished that you know so I was I just tell people I don't need them you really need me well we need it right don't you agree you're boxing do not boxing needs it I mean it's one of the beautiful things about when a Canelo and a triple G do get together as you see these guys in their respective weight classes that are in their prime it's fun you know like that's what everybody wants to see that's the fight that's what it's all about you just stopped a whole lot of barbershop conversation yes I need to stop a whole lot of comedy club conversations barber shop garage everywhere yeah that's the that's the fight to make in your weight class right now right for sure what's whole what's the holdup you got to axe down oh it's them well everybody has to hold out a little bit right to get the best deal that's right you know it's all about business but at the same time my side of the deal is ready whenever you can see all the interviews out there man you can see where if there's tears for myself or Bob or anybody that's affiliated with team Crawford we all say we want to fight you know yeah we had a fight tomorrow you know if we wanted to so but we know is literally see it won't happen well so when would you think that he's waiting for the right time marketing wise or do you think he's ready for the right time where his skills he feels like are able to challenge you like what do you think is the actual holdup I think it has something to do with Ty rank and PBC oh okay so it's a promoter issue so it's a financial scramble I want to say financial because the money will be there if the fight was ever made I just think it is you know Eagles yeah I think he goes after Gant right some Eagle so do you think hopefully this is just something it's gonna take a little while but it will eventually come to play of course I think it happened you know but I think you know me being with Iran could stand in the way of a lot of things happening mmm that makes sense that makes sense it's like it's interesting that promoters of boxing promoters work together well at all right you know like you think about it like if the UFC how to work with Bellator and put together some World Championship fight every basically there's so many times you get champion versus champion they have two different promoters and have to decide to get together and make this happen who want to get the most of the pot yes or what network is gonna be on Fox or ESPN and who's gonna promote it and it's also like when someone like Floyd Mayweather has done what he's done and sold the kind of paper views that he's sold and then you know and achieved this sort of level of financial Fame as well as like people he's famous not just for being the best boxer but famous for being insanely rich like that's part of the fame because he promoted yes be promoted because he figured it out and a lot of other people are gonna probably try to do the same thing as well right that's not my style too busy right too busy yeah man I mean you gotta just stay busy being Terence Crawford you want to be promoting that seems like a lot of a pain in the ass man my mouth what about it after you're done when your career is over when you've retired do you think you do some promoting then or training what you do no I just be in my gym back at home yeah I close you gotta said gym and just put my time and effort into the kids in the gym and my five kids that I had beautiful yeah that's a that's a that's a solid plan you know you don't need to get involved that promoting shit no he get a gym sometimes you can't work with the fighters funny because it's funny to see work with because after about two Rousey over and over do one little simple thing and like just say you tell them keep your right hand up right and then keep more like this like are you talking about brand new people like yeah like even even boxers that been boxing for years that they really don't have the fundamentals down to a tee and you like dude you've been in boxing too long for you to still be making the same mistake mmm and it's like I only could say certain things for solar and learn for solar and then it's just like Ariana saying it all well yeah your opinion is as valuable as anybody alive do you one of the best fucking boxers ever if so you're a beginning boxer and Terence Crawford teaching you something you're not listening you're probably nervous is shit for sure that's crazy that you be working with beginners that must be wild for them then I'll work with all of them that's awesome that's kind of freak them out though the ones that's professional and they be in the gym and I'd be yelling at them they'd be able to miss with beau Mac I'll come over there and critique them and they'd be like here come by hey look at me like am i doing it right am i doing it right you know I just want everybody to win I'll just keep them sorry well when someone has achieved that level the level that you have you know like anybody around you that gets a chance to watch your train and be a part of that that's that's gigantic to see something like that in the gym when you agreed just to see like world champion I mean for just having him around you know in the gym when he's not even posed to be training or just being around in the other fighters rise its phenomenon because you see this little extra pushing the guys sure yeah or like he'll come and run with them and I could see the smaller guys try to get ahead of you you know so what it's cool when it's cool it's really cool yeah that's uh do you think about that how much you're inspiring guys of course all the time that's why I come to the gym when beau meg be like me and just take a rest just relax I come to the gym and workout when you know I don't have nothing coming up just so I can show them like even though I'm the champion of the world I still work extra hard to make sure our state champion says it's harder to keep the championship title then getting there it's one of the more beautiful things about boxing is there's no shortcuts none for the best ever you have to Train we have to train hard as fuck you just got to do when you don't want to do it there's no doubt about it you got to do everything he's supposed to do there's no if ands or buts and if you don't fuck with your head and that's one thing I took from Floyd Mayweather you will always see him yeah working out I don't care if he was at a bar you were seen running from the bar he got his little workout clothes in his little TMT van and he just ran home let us see him three o'clock in the morning man let's go work out you know and that's what I admire the most is his work at his work ethics off the chart it's the only way you'd be that good there's no other way I mean yeah he understands boxing at a level that I mean grew up with it having his dad and his uncle and all that that the family was so many great boxers around him all the time but he you don't get that good without insane work ethic there's no shortcuts no not at all I have never seen nobody like put as much work in as Floyd so that's why you know for me I'm like thinking to myself I gotta work twice as hard you know if I want to get above him because I never want to be like anybody I always want to be myself but I want to surpass the people that was in front of me was it i opening when you got to watch him train of course of course you know when I was younger it lets me know that I wasn't working as hard yeah so now when when fighters come to my camp or I bring in some sparring partners or some friends that's professional that I just wanna you know come to camp and just experience just been in camp with a world champion they all said the same thing man I thought I was working hard till I came up here man you work and you work too hard and anything for some people because some people are they just but like I can today now I'm gonna let y'all do them too I'm gonna go to the gym but I'm gonna do the other stuff I just be like man come on man my body like man see that's what's gonna determine winning and losing you complaining about your body when you can rest later you know right what other stuff you're trying to get them to do I know you do a lot of stair running right I do a lot of everything I do yoga I do a relation I do swimming yoga I love that joke I used to do it everybody can do it is just a mixture of you know just all-around body working out what do you find that you get out of yoga man Yoga is harder than you think you know you in there you got to control your breathing you know just holding your hands in certain positions it's tiring so the little muscles that you're really not using you know in a day to day activities you using a yoga and it's just burning and you just like me just hold your hands up like this and going like this you believe you've been there shaking like me it's kind of burning and you see the girls and you like trying to do and it just it helps you with your balance as well yeah it helps you with a bunch of things it's just interesting that more fighters don't adopt it you know I think anything that makes your body more flexible and increases your range of motion and then gives you strength and although it feels like when I do yoga like all the connecting stuff like the shoulders and hips and knees all that gets like this extra stability workout that you don't really get from a lot of other things I feel like it connects everything together good in it and it helps you prevent injuries yeah yeah now but speaking of that like what do you do in terms of recovery do you do ice baths or sauna and massage that kind of shit massage I don't like the cold so I'm gonna let me take epson salt baths yeah give massages that's a grown up in Nebraska thing though right what's that oh it's cold in Nebraska but I'm used to that cold but I just can't fix myself to get in the ice tub mmm I never was that type it's hard I realize you pick your poison yeah I stick my feet in there be like I ain't getting in there yeah it's rough they be like come on he's gonna help you are is gonna help me next time because I actually like that one time that's easier yeah it was cool cause riots yeah dry dry and it's only three minutes yep so but that that ice bath yeah I'll do the car cryo the ice bath you want I'll be sorry I don't know what the science says what's better I've heard both things I've heard that the ice baths better cuz it's prolonged because it's like 15 minutes and I've heard that cryo is better because you hate your body with such a high degree of cold that it freaks out and produces these cold shock proteins better but either one you do those you do massage you do yoga what kind of I know you do strength and conditioning stuff go watch your Instagram you got a great Instagram right your kids are wrestlers right yeah that's awesome yeah do you think your kids ever fight MMA no actually I'm on I'm trying to convert him to baseball really partying in the next year you know because it ain't it ain't that much money in wrestling it's true you know when you look at the MMA fighters they making a lot of money to get beat up like they getting beat up like look at Pettis he broke his feet right you know yeah it looked like he broke one of his ankles maybe and or at least heard it I'm pretty sure he didn't make over three hundred thousand for that shot that fighting I'd like to know see if they find out how much Anthony Pettis made for that flight would he broke his foot for sure yes oh yeah he was walking around or being pushed around a wheelchair today on Instagram yeah that's ralphing you see people getting me kicked in the face teeth do you look at it as being more brutal than boxing yeah yeah like you take more risk and UFC it's not see more head injuries mmm but you have seen more rays yeah for sure for injuries right broken bones and ankles and knees and shit yeah and I just thinking anywhere for that boxing ain't worth a lot of things to cuz you seeing people die in the ring and anywhere for life at the end of the day when you decide to hang it up how will you know when you know I will meet personally I won't think I'll ever know when but I just got a date and the age like I you know middle thirties meld you know I'll be 32 next month so you're close close so you have it in your head just go out on top like Marvin hacker was one of the only ones ever do it he went out on top another switch hitter right Marvin Hagler was the only one at all the greats who lost that fight controversial loss to Sugar Ray Leonard it's like fuck this I'm done she wanted away nope never never came back his last fight was all religion what are yep yep that was it controversial lost to let her became a movie star in Italy you ever seen his movies in Italy no I just watch some clips Marvin Hagler fucking people up he's like oh does like these crazy Italian movies what is this just how much he made for 155,000 get it Wow another 555 if he won so Diaz made a flat 250 for the win yeah the they used to before the Reebok deal they used to make much more sponsorship yeah because uh I got a buddy who saw baked it you know really good very talented braska oh is he okay cool he's fun Bosnia but he mm-hmm lives in Lincoln Nebraska okay you know real real good friends real good for anything talented kid yeah and they just always say art well we get paid for this if we win this for showing up this if we get best knock out of this is this is this is why we as an action hero and this is like not far after the fight with in do two because there's a lot of a lot of shit that was unresolved haven't embryo one he was I've never seen it you know this these are the Spaghetti Westerns like but for you know whatever year this speak the language uh yeah yeah apparently speaks it Italian and you know he's a star over there Wow yeah but he just decided like I don't want a box anymore I'm done that's good yeah no I mean gotta get punched in a hey no he speaks perfect when you hear him speak today they do you know he doesn't never I'd love to yeah I'd like to meet that guy I was he was my hero when I was kid I remember there was a video of him he was training from a staff of Hampshire and he's running down Cape Cod in the winter with a with a hoodie on - screaming war whoa all that cold coming out of his mouth the steam and he's running I was like oh my god cuz I was you know doing martial arts back then and I was watching him going like that is that's the ultimate champion that's a chamber that puts himself in a terrible play puts himself down on the Cape in the wintertime to do all his training in the cold runs in the cold and it does it runs in combat boots - he ran in combat boots and he would just be it was hard as fuck and he just had crazy work ethic crazy work ethic and I remember whenever I would think about was being think about being lazy I'll think of him running down the beach going whoa just a shadow punching in the beach oh it's crazy that you say that because I remember was little we used to always run into cold I mean Toby song cold where the snot is freezing up yeah you tearing up but as you get older you'd be like on the treadmill well you already know you you already know you know how to fight you know you know how to persevere you already know you're a champion you already know you're at the top of the game you have to prove that to yourself anymore you know how tough you know many times but it'd be times that I'd just be like all right we we need that hardcore work let's go every time I'd be like what we oh I know I am one time one time we ran right after Thanksgiving Oh No right after right after Thanks so he made he made Thanksgiving dinner and the we in training camp so you know we all gotta lose weight and stuff and po made all this fool man we all grub in this stuff and then so I'm eating not talking i eating I'm like man I'm stuffed I'm like man I can't wake up this heavy I was like man everybody let's get it ready to go around and everybody looking at me laying down like man it's cold you treat you fruit so we run it with these little flashlights like oh man like yeah go fishing and stuff so we are running air by honking do it was that night it was it was pretty chill Wow yeah but that kind of shit like what Floyd Mayweather does that's that two o'clock in the morning workout routine every now like it's good to just throw monkey wrenches into your sense of what you should be doing and when be ready to do it always mm-hmm yeah that's why they're cold-weather running this big those people that live in cold climates that run in the winter man that's that's a hardy breed of human that's not a regular person that decides like nobody's got a gun to your head it's not your job you decide to put your fucking running shoes on and lace up and go out there when it's zero it's kind of like when before I fall Aamir Khan and I was down there shadowboxing and in the snow in that blizzard oh oh yeah I put it on I'll put it on my Instagram everybody was like oh he trained for Spence like my god team seeing inches that 10 inches that day it was blizzard and we actually got knocked off a couple days from leaving leaving for training camp yeah Wow cuz it was almost fucking snow dude but there's something about that like even you're talking about it you know it's kind of wild you're out there boxing in the snow shadow boxing in the middle of blizzard something wild about but it's crazy though because when it's snowing is not that cold right it's true isn't it yeah like in Chile it's a little bit some word why I was just sitting in the house and it was just like man go outside and do something so I went outside ran a little bit and dinner I come home and I was like come here because I would like come on recording the shadowboxing and stuff at that ring say that's cool so when when I see you doing those little stair runs you do that quite a bit right right every Sunday where you do that up and don't probably won't tell anybody where you go I know they know okay that's a famous spot right man it's cool experience how many steps is that the whole thing some crazy is a mile and a half no it's about a mile up a how long does it take you to get up there probably like 35 minutes there's all four fucking horrible run well you're not running we walk but some people are running oh you walk it yeah that's insane them people that be running saying because the air getting thinner and thinner as you go and then the steps you got some steps that's like this that's small and then you got some steps where you got to really reach oh like and so if you're running you slip yeah it's a fucked up for really yeah like when you when you up at the top I feel like you in the clouds sometimes like looking down like the cars is straight shot would you do your training camp up there your Colorado Springs just for the altitude yeah I actually got a house up there oh really you just go back and like for you to camp what made you decide to do camps out there just to get away from home you know clear my head get away from all the negativity and I've been doing it since 2013 13 13 2013 so so do you have a gym set up at the house oh that's nice I saw like Canelo had something like that down in San Diego there was a thing when he was training for one of his fights they just ran in the house turned the garage into a boxing ring you do that kind of thing you have it all set up out there yeah a lot of guys do that a big bear too right yeah it's similar today yeah having that high altitude is that what you prefer like look for your wind yeah that helped my win but at the same time everything is is already set up like everything from the yogurt swimming to the gym to everything it's like a second home to me so it's not like I got to go looking define where I'm gonna do this where I'm gonna do this it's like everything is everything and you know my family come up there and visit me and we get the job done so it's all locked in right now when you go up there who sets your schedule as far as what your daily routine is I know you said everything of yoga all everything well it's it's a it's two more coaches day that helps me Saudi agates and red spikes so we all get together we make a make a calendar like a month in advance in now when you do things like when you add in yoga and swimming how do you know when to put those in well it everything was always it started off with a trial in the air Mac in 2013 grab that microphone like I said all right it was like I said it's done with a child in here 2013 you know we tried this and we tried that and we started doing this and we started doing that and then you know just just look at the fighter and just see if it is if it's working for him you know and if it's working for him you want to stick with it and then you start adding little small things into it like the old gun the swim in the run and you know the incline mmm so after so many years I think we since 13 I mean just work like clockwork now now do you monitor in your heart rate or how do you know like do you do do any of that stuff are you trying to nothing just go by feel yeah yeah there's a two schools of thought right the schools of thought is like the old ways the best way like just do hard shit chop wood yeah you know run do the do the standard stuff and there's other people that watch their macros and you know they're met you know you're smiling you know I know what you talk about but I don't we don't do none of that yeah I think we train more or less like the old-school way but we do got like some of the new stuff in like the strengthen condition we got a district two conditions guy Jamie Bell he's excellent and he kind of adds a little stuff new modern age stuff in in a into the workouts like sometimes I he want to do more and he'd be like no I was I was enough for you like you might not think you did enough but trust me you'll feel it tomorrow tomorrow you like really is sore yeah but they're sometimes like I'll add you some stuff and just I'll just you know try to make things different you look at me saying no but we're not doing that like trying to add extra stuff where he'd be like one more round all right come on one more round and then you'll do that one more round and it'd be all right we got one more round y'all you like man you be like man I just pushed everything out of that last round because you said that was the last round well come on baby come on I'm not about to argue with you so you can be so it's like all right well the fighters like there's a there's got to be a balancing point right like you don't want him to do too much right so like when that guy told you like that's enough for today and you like want to keep going that's the natural inclination is to work harder yeah it's that weird balancing point we got to figure out when you're overtraining right and so if you're not monitoring your heart rate or anything like that you just basically if you have a flat day you feel flat you just chill out yo yeah like sometimes sometimes boys X me before we go work out how you feeling how you felt I'm good I'm good or sometimes I'd be like man entire like maybe like are we just gonna coast today like if the sparring day he'd be like are don't be trying to do too much we just gonna spar hit the Miss get out we're gonna do no bad when you gonna do nothing extra and then after I do the bag and sparring I mean not the bag but the medicine spar I might be feeling good and I'd be like man let's do it like no you say you wanna feeling good at first listen come on let's go that's the hardest part right there the pull to know when to pull it back right because he he know he's been with me since the beginning so he knows just by looking at me you know what type of day I'm having like either in the gym or outside get you that's got to be important isn't it knowing him from the time when he was younger and just start now - today is definitely his way it plays a big part in in the relationship forest-like see inside the ring and outside to ring because you know as a trainer you you'll never want to fight at overtrain you'll never want him to under train so but I never have to worry about him under training because he's always in the gym but I do have to worry about him overtraining you know what cuz he always in the gym you never saying yeah so just like you said some days and be like and they were gonna pull back this week why man you been training for already for eight weeks you know so and we still got one or two more weeks to go before we hit the down the actual peak point you know I will pull it back you know and then sometimes you get all right hit it let me do a little bit more all right do a little bit more but don't do too much you know you gotta put your all into it you know just just just move around a little bit you know basically all fighters like that you've sexy fighters good fighters because most good fighters like Terrence in other fighters it's a bail hearing Steve Nelson you got a look you got to pull them guys back always got a pulling back because I always want to go go go go go go cuz I always got this winning kind of fucking win I kind of fucking with I understand that I want you to fucking win too but I want you to break your body down I want you to go you're boxing inside the gym you gotta have something left when you go to the fight that's a lesson that's very hard for young guys to learn oh yeah oh yeah yeah but it's so critical to know where your body is and at this stage your career I would imagine you just kind of feel it yeah you know exactly and when you're in training camp and you're gearing up for fight is that how it feels like you know where you're at like oh this is where I'm supposed to be I feel this right here oh you just normal it's funny though because every fight every single fight before the fight you know bhowmick always waiting to hear me be like oh man already like sometimes they'd be a week before the fight sometimes it'd be two weeks before the fight but when you hear that's what I'm that's what I've been waiting on like now I'm not I'm comfortable because like sometimes he just be like you look at me I'll be working and stuff and then he won't say nothing but then when I come to him like it already Hebe like you get that from the fire fuck man I'll beat this motherfuckers that well because you guys know each other so well and you work together so long like you must like say okay here we are where we're supposed to be right right you've been there Falls right into place right my biggest thing that I always total bone every since I was an amateur because I remember losing a couple of fights because I didn't train as hard and I got tired you know and I couldn't really do too much and I always told boy I said bone if I'm in the best of my best shape that I possibly can be nobody being nobody damn boy I know that's why you need to quit bullshit so is this got to the real friend that's a real trainer and a real friend so it just got to the point where I just started like training real real hard and I was just like training not how old were you in this happen I was a teenager I'll just start training not to get tired if I can go in there and fight and not get tired i'ma win that's what I always stay so the switch flipped yeah he figured it out kyla I was losing the people that I shouldn't a lot loves to just head down just swinging long while but they was in shape and I was trying to be all cute and sleek and get tired now it's a matter of life and death knee hold and they pushing me I'm falling all over the place as a little kid you know and I was just like I never get that tired ever again in the fight that is such an important lesson for young fighters to hear such important lesson that it's there's no shortcut when you look at a guy like Terence Crawford you say well that guy must be insanely talented my the his timing is his reads on people the ability to switch stances he said what no yeah how'd that come about that talent came about through relentless hard work right that's what that's what makes that talent emerge I'm sure you have an amazing inclination for Boxey every elite of the elite fighter does but you don't get to be there without any hard work it doesn't exist there's no way there's no way it's so important for young fighters to hear that so loud a lot of guys that don't see is that hard-working that yeah you know Sam when you look at any top fighter and you look at all the sacrifices they made just to be where they at and you you will have people taking shots at them and stuff and they'd be like man you don't know what I didn't put my body do to be here today or you didn't know what I went to went through and it's just like total disrespect for somebody that haven't even stepped foot in the ring you'd be trying to critique you we named Danny never stepped foot to get punched in the face before that you can never really understand though right no one could ever really understand what it takes to be an elite boxer when you're hold the future of your family the future of yourself your financial success and all the people around you is dependent on you navigating the most shark-filled waters in professional sports a bunch of trained killers with their hands everybody's real good at knocking other people out with their hands and you're successfully navigating those waters like you know no one really understands that other than you you and all the other people like you like the real people on the outside that are close to you kind of get it a little bit you are the only one who's ever gonna be able to understand that so all these people talking shit like they might as well be speaking a language they don't even know what the meaning is thanks it's nonsense they say nonsense and it's just like you got a bull's-eye on your head in your back mm-hm because you you you reverse first you had your eye on somebody and he was like man I gotta beat this door after this dude I gotta beat this dude so he was eyeing that person that was in your shoes you know that was once champion of the world like I was iron Ricky burns when I was coming up you know and after I'll be him now everybody's on me because I'm chef now so it's no more Ricky bar this Terence Crawford we got to get Terence Crawford he's the chimp mmm so now it's like Pam everybody wants y'all here so now you've got trainee where harder to keep the title hmm do you ever guys show up at your gym talk shit like Shannon break stuff if you his weight class he would show up in Omaha you will leave one wall to say wait gave me Nina got beat up by somebody you ever see what he did the wladimir klitschko when they cut each other no when they were when well there's a couple times wanted a restaurant pulled water on his head but knee to knee he comes no that's right from the broken glass right he said but the other time was on he was he was on a wakeboard or on a paddleboard and Shannon came by at a boat knocked him off the fucking path wait fellas I think that was staged I think it was seems like it was staged like man hey you know where this man at every single time he lets go some point it's good point and then you just so happened to have some good cameras getting the footage it's true it wasn't good cameras but Shannon wisely would travel with good cameras and then just start making these these scenes he never fought him yeah he fight him I think he forty when he was younger so I'm not the amount of something like that vitally vitally knocked him out yeah he fought he fought the older brother Vitali he was a monster yeah that's we fought right I believe email it out he didn't I said really really that's how you save Italy that guy had an iron jaw the brother nobody could knock out the brother was crazy like I would just take bombs remember when II fought Lennox Lewis immediately yeah it took bombs I mean that guy was so goddamn durable he would have won that fight if he wouldn't got that good giant cut yeah he was winning what a weird style too right he had one of the most awkward yeah like it's so strange watching him throw punches but it was effective and he remind me of Drago off ya akhi a little bit that guy's a doc look he's got a PhD I think speaks like five language mmm they would they call him dr. iron fist was know his name yeah what character it's interesting to like the heavyweight division has now become the focal point of boxing again it's very exciting yeah for a long time Vladimir Klitschko was the heavyweight champion the world and for whatever reason nobody gave a fuck was weird because he was dominating for all those years he was jabbing clutch jab and clutch I think is because we didn't have the American champion yeah you know for sure so everybody was like ah forget it we probably do it but if he was fighting and stuck he was fine the way Deontay Wilder does who cares if he's from the moon right you know some people like that like we want to see that guy fight you don't care if that guy's from fucking Brazil wherever he's from good night god damn it's one of those punches where people just go that you see people in the audience he hits hard even when he don't fully explain it be like crazy thing is when he fought Tyson Fury he was 209 209 that's nothing any punch is so fucking hard it's crazy that dude is so an anomaly the fact that he won a bronze medal in the Olympics three years after taking up boxing right said said insane it's just insane yeah because there a lot of people they asked me because we was in the same you know trials in 2007 it was like do you ever remember the once' water and an amateur's I said man he came out of nowhere cracking people say he never went on none of the duels or nothing he just came out of nowhere yeah he's all the top guys in a heavyweight division crazy that's uh I'd say he's a unicorn you know when you look at his record what is it like thirty nine knockouts out of 41 fights something like that 49 49 coats at 41 fights it was always four-year getting there you know yes - only two fighters went with what is it the first one was at Brazil DOM no no Brazil just knocked out who was who went the distance Vern's her and went the distance in their first fight yeah and then he flatlined him in the second fight that crazy one people go flying he got the ladder he got the right last name Wow what's he do wow he started and then he loses hashtag till this day he uses that all the time on his Instagram so that guy's get shell shocked he gets PTSD every time is fine you know because we all we all be saying that now today's day I'm going back to that that story so here Mises he took that phrase over it that was a that was a phrase you know that he just owned he took it over that's his net hard that's it yes that's it say that's his one interview one interview one interview before a fight was getting geared up but you see the look oh my god to knock me out for sure 100% he would never do that it's like you'd be ear in the room and a lion like oh no and he's aggressive mr. lion are you sure this thing's trained to eat me he's so that must have been terrifying I don't like please Blaine is fully geared up and ready for war before this fight that is that is hilarious that is hilarious so this whole division now if you look at the heavyweight division between you know Andy Ruiz just beats Anthony Joshua and then they're gonna try to figure out what they were gonna try to do that in Saudi Arabia but apparently Andy's like yeah fight in America it's all you regular a big money fight I'm sure well they're still gonna do it there isn't arguing over is it off the table now I don't know this - who knows man me you guys know better than me this is a lot of gamesmanship right like what you're talking about before ego and stuff same kind of deal I'm sure as the arrow spends junior fight same kind deal the jockeying to see who could get the and he's worried about him thinking fuck yeah he's worried about taking some Mexican supplements while he's over in another country that they won't test him so he should have vada yes resting now that is gonna go over there and you know test the fight yeah that's uh that's one of the reasons why people gonna love a dude like Andy Ruiz as a champion like he he looks like a regular folk right well you know he's like he's got a lot of extra body fat yeah I was a bad motherfucker but right you know Anthony Joshua looks like he was made in the lab perfect physique you know it's crazy how how big God he's huge cuz man he wasn't that big at first but now he's slim it down mmm but I think he put on a lot of weight you know carry weight Klitschko please go is that what he put all the weight on yeah thanks um yeah what kind of testing they do for that fight uh they test you for everything but do they test you for everything at the weigh-ins no I see see me I'm I'm with the vada during the full testing it cool so they show up six o'clock in the morning the whole deal and they can test out they can test me right now and if they wanted to see them I'd be waiting outside right now it's cool cuz all right I'm good so but when he fought Vladimir and he got all big with it would they do any kind of water I don't know what type of contract better what they signed for on on a contract on a fight contract but I know me when I'm in training camp they come whenever they had come six o'clock in the morning turning around and coming six o'clock at night if they want to that's a point of diminishing returns you get too much muscle right like you can make you stronger but that that's gonna need a lot of oxygen too and if your body's not used to it if you if this is over the course of a year or two all sudden you've got this extra muscle like is it you are you fan of guys lifting a lot of weights in the light weight yeah right way just to stay strong yeah well I have a van der Holyfield we're scheduling the van I feel I'm excited huge Evander Holyfield fan but he was one of the rare guys that put on the mass and moved up from cruiserweight to heavyweight and fucking still never got tired I mean Evander never got tired ok put the word crazy work ethic and he was a guy that got thick and muscular but didn't slow him down it enhanced him you know especially when you get into like the Tyson fights like that muscle didn't hold impact at all and he was fucking jacked he was he was comparison to cruiserweight arounder Holyfield you'll get heavy weight at random with like the riddick bowe fights he did is I loved a lot fuck he was just cut oh yes chiseled yeah so that's what Tasha should do she cut cut down a little bit chisel up it gets a get mobile do you think this was something that he got mad at Lennox Lewis for saying that he needs to change camps do you think that makes sense maybe just he should sit down what his team to figure out where they went wrong it I don't think about I don't think you should change everything the word was that he had gotten knocked out in training mm-hmm you heard that as well my joy well if tans Crawford heard I won't say it feels real or fake I'm just saying I heard you heard it yeah but you know most people heard the rumors go around and everybody here and it's not even true that could happen right like Richard Gere with that chair Bubba's ass member that one kids we're kids there was a rumor that Richard Gere had to go to the hospital get a gerbil taken out of his ass now I grew up in the East Coast my friend Eddie grew up in California he heard the same story I was like this is the same goddamn room where like how this rumor get across the country with the same age right no internet the rumor made it all the way across the country when we were in high school so was it true or not I think you'd get a turtle out yourself it's not worth the embarrassment you take some time go to store buy some tweezers but you're uh you don't need to go to the hospital just get a mirror and some tweezers we could handle this we don't need to let everybody know our business all right the other one was Rod Stewart Rod Stewart there was a rumor in high school it was booked pre high school the Rod Stewart had swallowed a bunch of jizz and had to go to the hospital get his stomach pumped it's probably some guy who Rod Stewart fucked his girlfriend Rod Stewart the bad guy yeah and I probably when I hosted Fear Factor we made people drink come drink donkey come you could drink it you could drink a lot of it and you're fine my experience on fear factor taught me that I don't believe that Rod Stewart ever had that real problem hey so did you ever do any uh attempts I ate some shit they wouldn't let me try any the stunts the insurance purposes or you know there cause the insurance doesn't the hosts just try it out for front like I wanted to drive some the cars off buildings and shit but they wouldn't let me do we had one where they hit a ramp off the top of a building they hit a ramp and the ramp flipped the car through the air and they flew and then landed on these cardboard boxes they stacked these cardboard boxes of like several storeys high and that's how they would get these cars to land softly so the car went boom hit the cardboard box and just slowly sink down and then they would use a crane flip the car over and then they could use that car again it didn't even get damaged Wow so these people would fly this fucking car off you look like the craziest amusement park ride ever hey you wanted to fuck yeah I'll do it for the promo like I won be cool with jumping not the plane yeah we didn't do any of that but we didn't have people bungee cord jump off of a fucking helicopter that was crazy we had a people with a cord that was attached to a helicopter and then they were hooked up to a tree and they had to unlock themselves in the tree they had only got a ring of keys there to find the right key in a certain amount of time and then when they did it they unlocked and between they went flying through the air because they were attached to a bungee cord and the bungee cord was underneath the helicopter it would go fucking launching them out into the middle of this crazy Canyon I was like oh my god someone's gonna die someone's gonna die this isn't worth it this job's not worth it there was a couple times where I thought someone's gonna die that's crazy stupid ridiculous I'm glad I'm glad we got through it when nobody getting hurt who came up with the stunt slaughter there was a bunch of people they had a whole team there's teams that people that came up with the eating stunts there were the b-team stunt guys and then the a-team stunt guys was the first first stunt and there was the C which was like the big championship finale thing it's ridiculous show last time nice watch this show all the time yeah all the time I can't believe it's real i watch it to this day I was like it's not really me I used to watch jackass amazing fine am I making a fourth movie Oh rolling that dice the rod died someone's gonna die damn that's crazy that I only seems temps today Johnny Knoxville was a movie star for a while all right is he still doing big movies yeah he was doing big movies and then he was still willing to let a bull hit him he put a blindfold on stood in front of a bowl and the bull just fucking launched him through the air blindfolded [Laughter] guys got fucked up man I mean that is there's they're taking some beatings yes so we do laughs no no yeah yeah yeah see what you do is control who gets fucked up right that's what I like about boxing when I watch boxing Express at the highest levels like one guys controlling who gets fucked up you know yeah whether the guy liked it or not whether other guy likes it or not what was that the Mexican gentleman that you fought recently that was talking a lot of shit and stopped him Benavides benefit that's right yeah yeah that seemed like a particularly satisfying one for you yeah cause uh shit talking shit for years there's certain times we watch guys talk shit I go sodden but it just came out of nowhere like I never said nothing to it I do never nothing to that do like and he just out the blue just four years like I'm talking them I'm like do you went up and wait I'm at 140 like when I was at 135 he was talking about fighting me he was at 140 I got up to 140 he wanted a little fight and then he moved up and waiting I'm like you're nobody for me to be worried about so then it got to the point where he was like oh well they made me offer to fight you and you duck me and they said so he started telling everybody I'd duck them I've been ducking him since 140 so in a press conference I said did I ever and offer me or him a fight to fight each other and it was like no so so we come up with that it as I will don't matter we fighting right now so I'm sorry it was a good fight it's good fight it was a good fight to to showcase you you know particularly the knockout when I was a beautiful combination man we clipped him right and then he gets up and then you put them away when you watch a fight like that will you have a guy with talk shit and then you want to fucking them up is it ever more satisfying are you because you seem to enjoy it so hey best fighters enjoy putting a beating on someone of course like going into the fight I had to calm emotions down cuz of the anger right right because I really wanted to hurt that duel you know so going into the fight I gotta keep reminding myself stay calm relax don't go in there and do nothing stupid because this is what he wants you to do and you've been here before you know there's nothing No you know how people talk crazy to you but not to the level that he did but you didn't have people talk crazy to you so that's why when I first got in there I was being patient taking my time and just filling them out you know cuz he's long he's tall he's long got some speed on him but he's a naturally counter puncher so it was like I wasn't gonna go in there and be careless and get counter cuz I already knew what he wanted to do so when you when you see got a guy like that and you're fighting him but what is the strategy than a normal fighter because length and the counterpunch mobility so you have to adjust right so what is what was your plan going in there well see me I got long learners to be in the division a my height so I was just like all right just pick them apart you know and then once you go into your combinations make sure you throw more than one it's because you're gonna counter that first one properly and when you watch the fight you feel like that's exactly what you're planting preparing for right now when you see arrows pants excuse me we see arrow Spence jr. does he represent to you like the one the the best of the up-and-coming guys that are there possibly on your radar at least I really can't say that you know because arrow this is the first real big test that he's up against mm-hmm you know his last fight was with Mikey Garcia that was a good fight I mean that was a good test other guy it's true you know Mikey came from what 126 you know he's what five six when you see the two of them at the weigh-ins and you really could see the difference and the size of arrow I mean arrows ripped right you know so that's that's why I say you really came tale with Mikey Garcia don't get me wrong Mikey's a hell of a fighter you know but that's his first fight in the division he's a smaller guy he's short his arms is shorter Erol taller longer bigger you know so faster so he really couldn't I really couldn't see what I was trying to see I told Mike yo Mikey went up just because it was a big fight right is he gonna stay there do you think hers yes I believe he's gonna fight Danny Garcia Oh interesting interesting there's so many different outlets for boxing now you know there's PBC there's Fox there's you know ESPN is putting on high caliber fights now - alright it's very interesting but HBO's out of the game doesn't that feel weird it doesn't Bend that that was the go-to channel to watch boxing when I was coming up when he people you had on the Showtime was Mike Tyson and it was the best commentary crew tubes Jim Lampley Max Kellerman Roy Jones jr. or sometime George Foreman you know Larry Merchant American what he was doing yeah man Emanuel Stewart and Harold Letterman would come in in between rounds giving his score it's fucking great I missed that yeah don't you miss that me Harold Lederman rest in peace he passed away recently didn't he yeah but I missed that man Jim Lampley it was fucking great and Max Kellerman was great it's like you don't have that there's not a commentary team like that right now in in boxing is there am I wrong not today to the level of why don't you guys go over to one of these streaming services like the zone or ESPN or something it just seems like that's the team right yeah well Andre Ward Andre Ward's fantastic he's coming on here - I'm Tim Bradley coming along pretty good - yes very good yeah he's taking he's thick it look like he's taking that role of Teddy Atlas yeah yeah like he got all the energy yes well Teddy's I really get out there fight scream when I was kid - fucking scared funny I hear tape on here these judges need to be fired yeah they looking at he doesn't give a fuck yes Laureus at bad decisions and he's right he's right sometimes you know he's wrong about that Jeff Warner fighting the Jeff want Pacquiao fight I watched out is that one of the ones that's when you freaked out I watched I when I first watched it you know listening to the commentary I was like am back yeah whooping them you know I mean why do you why do you buddy what I cheat him you know hmm because I wanted to fight Pacquiao because I was the next and of course I see champion so of course I'm rooting for Peggy I don't win because that's a bigger fight but after watching the fight again I was like they not saying nothing about autumn shots Jeff horn was hitting Pacquiao away and he was brutally bullying them roughing them up they could say all he was being dirty sometimes your hair but but it's a fight that's what happen you know but it was real life manhandling Pacquiao like pushing them all around and you see Keith Thurman couldn't even do that yeah you know and seeing him beat Keith Thurman at 40 years old like god damn this guy's great I mean just look at his career with eight different weight classes world hydrogen 88 different weight classes 40 years old beats Keith Thurman who's in his prime right crazy I mean what a man and what a world champion only short time break Dan's a time on that one fucking crazy ending any fallen spirits both moments so fun in spurts and I thought keith was gonna pick up on it but Pacquiao was only fighting fighting they ended around like Keith would come on a strong at the beginning of the round and it would be like alright Keith winning winning this round and then packages for like it's right pop pop pop up and then Keith would be like I don't even seen the four when he dropped him with that right hook early in the first you like oh right shit yeah no I was like he jumped in with the Laughing in followed by like I was straight right it's crazy yeah it was crazy it's like wow a shoulder yep that's his plants yep they were showing him hitting other fighters with it the same thing well boom he has such a unique style the leaping Judah did if he came in with that shit on you I give I'd take my hat off to pack you out like do you think it's possible that you could get a crack at him now cuz now there he's you know he's in the hunt right now okay I wouldn't say I wouldn't say so because I was in dimensions and talk to fight Pacquiao since 2014 and we was in the same promotional company and they couldn't make it happen so you think it's because he's not interested in it I don't think he was interested in it because his coach mentioned numerous of times he didn't want him to fight me hmm he wanted him to stay away from me so I don't think that was interesting yeah well I could see that at this stage of his career but you know Keith Thurman is a fucking murderous puncher right which was one of the reasons why it's more impressive that he beat him and so who are they talking about Pacquiao matching up with next he chasing him a way they're so cool so why not right Boyd come on I know you love money he was saying that he thinks Floyd's out of money already cuz he says Floyd spend so much money he's probably already out of it well he's paying money too I think out spam or money in employ everybody yo oh that's right cuz he's got like 50 people that he just like you has supported yeah I mean he's a he's an interesting guy man cuz he's so friendly like you know like Pat even like when people are trash talking he's like smiling and then the kids in that ring that roast like this is a whole different set of rules he's flying with like keep Durbin talking about you gonna crucify them don't say that good luck enough I like these killer pool players you know that about Pacquiao no it's like world-class like he could play pool professionally me tune really yeah oh we got applying that yeah a little personal estate I'm pretty good yeah you good okay what do you play whatever you want to play you put like nine ball ten ball whatever okay we'll play cool you can pay so if I leave five balls on the table you owe me if fire your balls on five balls I'm tip my butt will you play an eight ball that's nonsense it's a nonsense game hey that's a silly game you try to get me leave my balls on no I'm saying but if your balls if I win okay and you still got five balls on your table fired five or your balls if you you got seven balls and fucking a table so the only way that I went explain you're saying okay so you got seven balls to start if I beat you and you still got five or your balls on the table okay then you Oh Oh what so if you mean if you break and run and I don't get a shot no that's seven baldon if you get all the balls seven ball if I have five balls left and you went yeah but it's out what kind of weird gay is that I'm not getting it so if I win and you still got five balls on the tape okay then what happens you oh I know what plate but see if we play behind ball or ten ball you can't win if there's five balls no no no no 9-ball and 10-ball that's different but that's what we're saying yeah yeah so you're saying like split eight ball but I don't like playing at - that's tricky yeah it's tricky yeah play as a strategy yeah yeah you got to learn how to get out yeah I'll hit all of them me miss the last one you play a ball though that's a cool I like eight ball it's okay but it's a simpler game and you pop me for the last yeah yeah I leave you hanging yeah you fuck up leave that ten ball wobbling in the hole yeah like you did all this for nothing I've done that before where is like all that for nothing you know and the guys thank you for cleaning it up no that's a game that no one wants to lose to a girl like it's hilarious watching dudes play pool against women when women are good they panic they start getting nervous like there's something about losing to a girl it's almost like getting your ass kicked by a girl some call I didn't seen some girls at the pool hall oh yes taking a lot of money oh for sure yeah there's there's like elite women players know what I do to eliminate that what I just right now especially where you watching them and in each other I got next I hear y'all y'all complain cuz it ain't it ain't for me to be getting washed out by no female well and any professional I've played a lot of professionals like because it's one of the weird sports you can enter into a tournament and you you could be a guy who you know as a full-time job and you might wind up matching up with like ever Andreas it was like the greatest player of all time you might meet him in the first round of a tournament you both all you just pay your fee then you pay your entry fee you join in just like everybody else and you're playing like a world champ like the Terence Crawford of pool yeah like whoa you could just be some regular dude playing F Andreas but it's cool to you can be like man I lost - yeah their greatest loss to one the greatest of all time yeah I played a bunch of like great play Mike Segal before I got to play a bunch of like great players get my ass kicked I'll write you know professional pool player no no I'm quite a bit like below like if you had like Manny Pacquiao he could play professional he would beat me I'm like one notch below that I'm probably like a match below but Manny like plays in tournaments he Gamble's they call him unfortunately they call him the cow because they're always milking them real high level pool players man I mean he's man he's too busy with running the country he's a fucking senator on top of that he's one of the best boxers in the world and on top of that he's got a family he doesn't have time to be at the pool hall today all those Psychopaths that are like world champions they play pool 810 hours a day they play all day long all day long you go there you'll find them that's where they're at they're there every fucking day everybody that I know that's an elite world-class pool player like mica Immonen and you know these kind of guys you go there they're there at that goddamn pool every day no money in that shit though you think there's no money in UFC there's no money in that shit there's a lot of money in poker there is how to play I know right Coppola it seemed like my friend Anthony Giordano he directs those used to direct those poker shows he said what changed it is when you had the the TV shows where you could see the person's hand so like we were all playing the folks at home could see what I have they could see what you have but we didn't know what we have so they're all in on it so the fuck are you gonna play that I was gonna play that so it made it way more interesting than just watching because if you were watching three guys play poker you would have no idea whose hands or what but when you're at home and you watched on TV you get to see the hand and I still don't know how to play yeah well I'll just be seeing people with a poker face all in don't have nothing and then this dude with a good hand is below though his hands just be like Oh something cool about that Riley got bullshitty it's bullshitting you know there's something about that like the hustle there's new thing about poker that doesn't exist in anything else a cycle hustle that's why they call it the pokerface yep that's a lady Gaga song bro pop-up or somebody that's just looking all like looking all sad like yeah knowing you got a good yep it's tricky Danny hey you all in okay gamblers when they're around each other all the time then just fucking that's all they do is gamble and read signs and check each other out there's probably like a highly-tuned sense of someone bullshitting right highly-tuned oh there's something going on behind his eyes but that's why they were in them glasses yeah you know what I've always liked love watching but I'm scared to get good at his chess it just seems like it would eat your fucking time see yes do you play yeah he taught me to not beat him the same hate him the same at the same day he taught you yeah he just taught me how to move the pieces and I'll be wrong Jesus wow that's interesting so international right so I'm one with a fish right now ranked know what I'm saying we only international show right the whole world watch it yeah I like this do beat you let him be but a but this is how you do it there's some fights where I want him to play test lock things so I can use his mind right mmm okay all right all right the whole can't be using this mind you use this mic okay all right so you come out there yeah great performers sounds like okay all right that's another strategy try to get him to do better right but there's some more knees I'm tell you about this last morning we had you know let me beat him I just beat him anytime I really want to win I win come downstairs right so he comes downstairs and in his boxers and shit put this old Terence Crawford look looking at your eye like hey good morning good morning let's play alright I'm kicking his ass right it man he get mad you can see you can see it in his face right so he stopped making these different but nah man you can't do that no man yes I can yes a kid no you can't do that but you know you can't do that after a while you just gotta kind of fear for your life a little bit yeah I like hey I like Vic feather with this duty chest but it's funny it's funny what he's looser day I was because he just caught me off guard it's like you know I mean like I'm coming downstairs the east and breakfast and you know this plate he got it ready and everything I'm making student my team and so he went he won't play me but the next times he played me I've watched children so so bad to where he he don't even want to play me no more it's funny is that's one thing the champions have all champions they hate losing any game I mean Jordan they said if you beat him playing pool who fucking hate you cuz what didn't want to talk to you didn't want until he could beat you again so we got you again see my thing is we have a lot of people that want to play the game right so I'm I don't play the game like I used to I used to playing I used to beat them all but once my nephew got good I stopped playing I'm like man your game here I ain't got time to best just sit on gaming right you know like video games like yeah - Kayne you can't fuckin - those kids those kids that have responsibilities they don't have children they don't know they have nothing but time they get too good at those goddamn things you lose your life trying to change them you like sit down so now it gets to the point where I just watched him play so so we had this dude named chairs it out oh man so so chance we got Shakur and we got Chucky they all like to play and we got Kenny so kitty was playing Chucky Chucky and chance was always going at it with each other and uh Kenny was beating Chucky and he was just rubbing it in his face and it was a slight you can see how mad he was like and his dude Chucky he's the one I always like joking around and stuff it's all fun and games and like you could just see you're like why usually were talking if you're not playing it get so bad in the house man - you have to put the game up do you have you guys have like moments where you don't want to play games and things like that like during camp you just want to just dressed no no that's relax it relax yeah but video games are a little they get you tense that's why he took the game again so you're so tense people want to fight each other to get mad that's why we spawn when we get to the gym huh how about that be funny it can cause problems - oh sure we'll a bunch of competitive dudes all training together and then you play something competitive that makes you angry if you lose yeah yeah recipe for disaster right hey they don't care they don't care they don't care enough and they just like whatever I still want to play it's like a big bakery I'm the oldest gotta start cussing at home you can't eat don't you come out your room get up here do these dishes it seems like you guys are having a good time man that's all yeah it's fine campus campus fun it's hard work and it's hard but at the same time you know we worked as work and then we try to come home and you know clear our head and not just be sold mentally drained all the over thinking about the fight right right so we want it to be fun at the end of the day do you have like a mental coach or is there anybody you've ever worked with that's like like we've tried to do visualization work or formulate a game plan or just just go out there and get it done just get it done no need no need like my mental is so strong like from what I've overcome and been doing my whole entire life it's like nothing is gonna break me that's my mental like if that couldn't break me you're not gonna break me I mean in terms of work your childhood and yet growing up you know I guess everything that I went to irreplacable right people that have gone through like Mike Tyson like many great fighters have gone through a hardship when they're younger that heart that did ability to endure it's right I want to say when I was younger it's still going through still going through I still go through a lot a lot how so like seemed like before all my big fights somebody died or my family you know like my grandpa just died the day before yesterday sorry to hear that yeah but I'm here you know I mean I'm about to going training camp prepared for my next fight you know so it's just like things always happening but at the same time I got a job to do and I must still be focused and nothing's gonna distract me now will you go on a training camp with a date in mind or we're just but do they but you haven't nothing's been signed yet right nothing that's been signed yet so do you just sort of go in and get the wheels move in and then just get ready to ramp up like how do you determine when you ramp up your training camp if you're like I say if you're getting back in the training camp now but you don't know when the fights gonna be scheduled so how do you how do you approach at the beginning no I don't know I want to necessarily necessarily say I'm getting in training camp right now because I'm not like my training camp is six to seven weeks so you get for it ready to get into training camp no I wouldn't even say that I'm just saying in general okay you know oh you're not getting ready right state right now I stay working of course you know know when you're not right when you're not in ghent well when you were in the gym but you're not training for a fight are you still doing all the strength conditioning stuff everything is getting here and there yeah you're not not to the same intensity but just to keep moving right and so you do that just to make sure that you preserve your body and don't get injured and things along those lines so when you think of it in terms of camp like that is the roughest experience you're going through right you're going through how many nine weeks that would you say you've not her this is seven seven weeks seven weeks so that those seven weeks or is when you're pushing it to the limit and then everything else is more like maintaining make we like stair steppers we got a pre count and then once we count it's like this don't don't don't don't don't don't you know where those steps are right so when we get to the to the end of camp we already yet the highest highest step so that way when we go to to the fight we already add and so this is planned out in the amount of rounds you do the amount of run every week every week is it something added on every week if it's for round six five eight rounds 1012 minutes we do minutes you know know what's amazing about this conversation is if you were a young up-and-coming boxer in you know 1982 or something like that and you want to know how Marvin Hagler did it there's no podcast right there's no like Marvin Hagler breaking down how he does a training camp and talking all about it but today kids can watch you and they can see what you're doing and I guarantee just listening to you talk about realizing how hard Floyd worked and you working out you wanted to work out even harder and all the crazy shit you're doing like people right now lacing up the shoes all right right now getting fired up running out the door thinking I got to work like parents I have to you know that is one of the coolest things has to be about being a world champion is that you are the guy now you know when you were a kid I'm sure you had like those Ring Magazine posts yes and shit like you're that guy now right that's got to be crazy dude some kid right now cuz like six years old was just getting into Golden Gloves he's looking up at his bedroom wall yeah well you'll see several gloves and when you're doing silver gloves doesn't sounds good yeah boxing amateur boxing kids getting in amateur boxing there for Heroes you're one of them man I mean that's gotta be gotta be a cool feeling oh yeah man I

is a different era cuz it was a you didn't watch him fight watching Roy Jones man when I was a kid when he was in his prime he would lead with a left hook he's like more than a jab he would just whip that left hook at dudes and they didn't know what the fuck to do with that that speed was preposterous so fast whoa Roy was doing stuff to people that made you just go wow like he's not even doing the same thing they're doing right he's like he's on another dimension he's a different record speed you know he was so fast like Max Kellerman had this incredible rant once about just realizing how good Roy Jones was in his prime this wasn't like he wasn't around great fighters but they couldn't do shit to him he was around world champions but he was lighting them on fire right it was crazy and you know all good things come to an end it only lasted for you know X amount of years I mean what was the best years of his championship reign but he was untouchable untouchable untouchable woulda knocked out Virge with that body shot why he like God to him one punch when he when he put his hands behind his back and still knocked out James Thomas I mean he could when he dropped his hands like this and James Toney does it too many leaps in drop some with that one dude he knocked out with his hands behind his back who was that dude he was on the ropes yeah put his hands behind his back the dude moves forward and drops him and knocks him out like this is a movie scene right this is a real life no one does that in real life right Josh was having fun with people yeah he was having fun with he was

in a headlock right oh sure we're playing together he's a nice guy oh he's a person yeah because you see someone that's achieved a certain level of status and Championship reign and you know see him

then I drop off yeah everything else like I need 65 to 70 71 is only only Barracuda and Challenger that's it everything else fell apart by 71 what about the Oldsmobile they made some cool shit they made some cool shit but it's just not as good as like the 60s 60s and the 1970 cars like 70 Chevelle hey Aziz might say to share that surveil come on drop the drop the problem the drop top is they all the weekly you know the like there's a lot of body flex to it well you don't get the rigidity that you feel like the solid hardtop muscle car right you know what I love those old cars man they have something to them right they cost a shit ton of money you get one that's all original yeah everything the paint still like man you bought this car to put it in the garage for 30 years dude I saw Sarah CUDA that was for sale for over a million dollars a million dollars for a car that was like thirty thirty thousand not even right didn't we talk about this wasn't in like five grand when it's brand-new something crazy like that and that's a million dollars I got it Jaden I don't know one of those knuckleheads it likes everything perfect and original there's certain dudes like with original numbers-matching look at the VI n number of matches the tires there's the original tires from 1960 got a paperwork you better go slow around the corner with those shitty tires everything original means everything shitty no shitty drum brakes and shitty suspension and noise I used to always get up and watch them car auctions oh yeah them each of those just to look at the cars God if you have a ton of money and you're there that shit could be real bad yeah like if you're one of those dudes it's like a collector and you see all those cars moving by like I want that one fifty-five often Chevy oh my goodness yeah this there's some I mean I'm just a big fan of those shapes those shapes of 1960 shapes this is something about the carb they just nailed it they just knew how to make a car look beautiful back then and it was enables bill starting yeah like nowadays you pump a car you big old tent pumper falling off back then you can run a car over and he'll still be a little bitty dent and going but your way yeah it's a different but also they now car cars handle good they have airbags yeah this is this some good some good shit about in today's cars too right by itself yeah yeah yeah been in the Tesla there freak-outs man will freak you out look you driving that thing oh my god you they fast this shit it's ridiculous right did you ever drive one yeah dude the crazy thing about the Tesla's is it's like a race car it's like and you'd be waiting for it to be like like but it don't never change gears it's just straight like that it's so fast and he makes sense it's like a race car it's like a time machine it's like it compresses time like there's a certain amount of time at a normal car you feel like you have to go there's a certain amount of time that lets take place before I can get in front of that guy and then get over here and then get to the on-ramp with the Tesla just go shoot you there it's like time light presses yes zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds tail you never even felt anything like it's a goddamn roller coaster ride so your pity your seat it's just going yeah like fuck and they're making a faster one there go one's gonna be 1.9 the Roadster that really slick looking little tiny one they're ridiculous that's the future yeah I got a demon dodge demon oh those are nice yes fun that's a fun fuck it was hell 800 horsepower I think 909 sometimes after anything over seven they will sign my rights away really you gotta sign all these papers talking about if you die or get seriously injured and can't nobody else come back and so on all I'm a crazy shit why cars so fast they letting you know like you know you can get real life fucked up it do they make those in a stick shift or is it just an automatic I don't know I got a man it's a crazy amount of power but I think I think nowadays you you got the parameters yeah how does shifters that's cute or you can put manual and anything shift in with your left foot in the clutch and shifting gears or your right that's like part of the whole muscle car thing yeah part of the old-school thing you want to old-school automatic it seems silly you know you just think it's cool yeah that's true it's way faster oh it's way faster cars today away faster period and they're all gonna be a lecture within ten years they're just so much better they did so much faster right if this is always they can figure out how to make it charge quick that's the thing the gas has you just pull into a gas station 10 minutes later you got a full tank right so your card charges up yeah every night 8:00 let's take a good solid six or seven hours if it's dead if it's almost dead it'll take like six or seven hours at a super I have a supercharger to normally it might take twelve like with a regular outlet yeah it takes a long time yeah so if you pull into like one of those superchargers I think they can get you up to like 80% in like an hour to first charge the first 80% quit pretty quick so you could do that it's like you can't forget yeah yeah you pay for it yeah use a credit card I got that one for it yeah I see them there but the airport's free you plug in at the airport and it's free it's uh it's a weird experience man because I love the sound of engines but that car makes them all look stupid yeah they all seem dumb yeah I got a had that muscle muscle it's fun yeah I'm wondering what you get you can't burn out in it no there's no burning out just go it makes it noise like this we like it doesn't make any noise it doesn't like there's none of that we just takes off yeah doesn't even seem real I like them the inside is crazy with screen touchscreen and ya know they dope you just look like you're in the future risky it feels like in the futuristic what what do you spend your money on do you have a thing that you you indulge in no I don't really have no spinning habits just that's the main of fishing and yet we were talking before the show about bow fish and you're like both fish I love it I love it I got took on bow fishing one time and I've been hooked I've been spending money on it we actually walked in this pond I bought waders I got waiters and everything so I'm out there in water talk in a little mud and stuff hitting the little guards and and uh anything I can find do you uh do you eat guards you smoked a lot I don't you can't eat him I don't know we mainly trying to get the grass carp because they they're invasively yeah they try to kill as many of those as they can right yeah so it's crazy though because the Asian carp we on my boat we in the river and this was the other night we going through this little spot in the river they start jumping in the boat yeah that's not weird have you ever seen yes these TV shows I can crazy like this they like this big no hide there was lights a car jumping Park my Asian car six seven pounds and they fly through the air and hit you in the face Asian carp is different than grass cart wheels shooting grass carp and a pie but in the river the Asian carp Dahl was jumping in my boat was every bit of 30 pounds and they're hitting people in the head they own them flatline them so then they bring those state those carbs over to eat up something in something look at these these people fly a boat look at these guys are trying to shoot them while they're flying that is so ridiculous what kind of fucking fish just froze itself out of boat it's so crazy sound of the engine it yeah get them started something like that it's crazy like this give you a target panic man you're not gonna get good at shooting a bow and arrow getting hit in the head while you're pulling back your bow to shoot no one's even pulling the trigger oh that's funny look at that top yeah just keeps getting hit donk what a weird Andy ducked the second 100 that got nailed yeah I'd have a bat oh yeah sorry Bebo I'm telling you your samurai sword item must get big so there is many those they're trying to kill as many of those they can those things have overpopulated lakes just taking over I don't know why they brought them in though originally and more more so of the lakes is grass carp oh yeah not Asian carp yeah in some rivers that's this big red one here those get humans in ink in America we think is shit there's like trash fish but in England their prized like in England they have carp fishing contests and they have certain carps that they catch and they weigh in and then they release them and they catch them again like a year later like they know the carp and like they were in World Records like the OE caught mr. fishy again mr. fishy is now you know eighty-five fuckin pounds they keep catching them year after year until these things die and when they die they make like a big deal we lost his car but they take carp fishing super serious which is so strange because over here in America we think of them as trash they eat everything yeah when we see the Asians fishing and whatever they catch they they keep yeah so it's like the car the Asian carp they eat them up apparently gar tastes good if you smoke it that's what I've heard I've heard you smoking on not fucking one that it's a dinosaur I feel it's a weird thing to eat it's like eating a snack I didn't shop one just to look at the meat and it's all hard highlight autumn poems how you gonna clean that thing yeah I saw a guy do it on TV I cooked it on TV I forget what was one of those wild game cooking shows we smoked a car I can see an alligator gar like when you go down like Texas or suppose that a different kind of gar like alligator gar than let's get P maybe that's what it is you know but the guard that we got a little skinny little pencil things also they're tiny they like that be home yeah those Texas ones are freakish mine yeah they don't even look real yeah well listen man I'm not gonna take up any more your time I just want to tell you I'm a big fan it was an honor having you in here I really appreciate watching you fight one of my favorite I think when I want to talk to people about about combat sports one of the things that I always talk about is like the difference between the skill level of an elite boxer when you see what that's all they do versus like in MMA you see openings in MMA that you would never see like in boxing so I'm just happy you're out there man I appreciate it and I and let us know when your fight is we'll let everybody know and just alert the world I'm excited thank you sir thank thank you Man Thing bye everybody make him get efficient [Music]
