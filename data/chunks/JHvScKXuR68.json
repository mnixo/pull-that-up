the girag an experience that's the scene I actually uh you know when I said where did you get this Johnny Depp actually added lived a funny line he goes my dentist but it was funny because he turns out he's a very funny guy but I did say this when I was filming that scene and it became in my stand-up I hate to be corny and a story from my stand-up but is true I I didn't really know those guys at well at all and I go is anybody in this scene not on probation Johnny that's like what did you do I go I said The Tonight Show on fire he's like yeah why'd you do that I go I don't know I thought it was funny and then I'm like you smashed up that hotel he goes yeah I go were you drunk and Johnny Depp is funny he goes in my defense the hotel room made the first move and this is juice dairy cuz then I look over at Paul Reubens and he's just trying to ignore the conversation it wasn't like hey yeah I rubbed one up that is a weird rock and roll thing to trash the hotel room yeah yeah but I mean have accountants pay for it all but but I've always felt like during there was a period where I was trashing television shows you know and and it was just I had the same kind of frustration and rage and I thought well I do it at a Holiday Inn you know big deal why don't I do it on a TV show that's kind of funny at least I know that makes no sense yeah yeah look at me well I you look like that RCA Victor dog just been staring at me I mean I kind of see your point but I don't I mean I don't see the point of doing hotel rooms I've never understood it just smashing shit and like what are you doing that's just out of boredom in the room but it's so stupid to me just so child well for me I couldn't do that because I'd be afraid of waking up people next door I'm serious like I have no problems the second that's a nice delivery or oh yeah we're smashing up the Arsenio Hall Show but the idea of I don't want to put somebody else out you you smashed Arsenio Hall shows - what did you do there yeah way crazier than the Tonight Show I oh yeah yeah yeah because he got fired you know because of they put Chevy Chase on in 70 markets in front of them so paramount kind of fucked him over so I went out and I said are you really quitting is like a week or two before he goes yeah and I go well let's not make it easy on them you know so I I spray-painted paramount sucks on the backdrop big letters and then I I started throwing the couches into the audience the crowd was going crazy oh and then I remember I took a television set monitor and and just threw it and then put my put my work boots through the back of it Jesus Christ she's way more expensive than anything I didn't it's night you know but yeah so then they they like tell Arsenio like get him and so he wrestles me down and as he's got me on the ground he goes thank you man what well colossal fuck you and then like you know a week later Jay had booked me on The Tonight Show you know which because any came in the dressing room and he's like you know don't don't smash up too much stuff you know cuz cuz they were hoping and I do something fucked up now I'm not blaming them I mean I wasn't asked like you felt like that was a bit of the green light oh yeah I mean I knew that I was on there to do something screwy but but you know what what made it arson was that I actually had the this lighter a barbecue lighter taped to my wrist like I was like that's what made it arson yeah because it meant that it was predetermined yeah exactly yeah it was like in taxi drivers do you didn't worry about doing we worried because that was on fire no I mean cuz I knew it burned clean and the lighter fluid and stuff and then I also had a buddy I said you know stand next to this fire extinguisher if it gets out of control but but you know uh I I don't mean then make this my hook cuz I've talked about it another podcast but but I guess it's good to clean clear the air you know right but um I don't know people think like I was banned from The Tonight Show but they had me on immediately right after it was you know was weird what was weird was see it's a lot bigger than I always try to make I got the little fight Jesus Christ well that's cuz I'm squirting lighter fluid right there why why did you come that I show to get ready yeah and this is like speechless twice now he just looking at why
