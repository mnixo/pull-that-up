we give zero fucks here at the Joe Rogan experience do you know that that was Sarah Palin she said that Sarah Palin had a conversation with a librarian in Wasilla Alaska where she said that on the internet there was a photograph of a human footprint inside a dinosaur footprint and the woman like the woman like talked about this when Sarah Palin was running for president or vice president whatever and she was like what pause the bots fuck like this is a woman that got that heartbeat away from being the president and she thought she thought that dinosaurs and humans walk together and then you see people who are intelligent you know you're that apparently pull that down Brian dinosaurs and people coexist amazing does it say there about the librarian yeah whatever well and I I think that um what's the other one not Sarah Palin Michele Bachmann Michele Bachmann's worse well her husband's gay right his gay is gays gay as gay as the day is beautiful and long and flowers smell pretty and butterflies are beautiful that guy's gay electrically he can't suck enough dick there's no way if you could just just give him a free pass if you ever got that guy liquored up and put a hard-on in front of him he would jump on it like Greg Louganis off the top here he swan dive on that day his head would be spinning out of a gainer and he'd still get some tongue on the shaft he would automatically start salivating to the point where it was like a waterfall coming out of his mouth just pouring down just saliva long stream wouldn't know where the pool started any saliva for dick that's coming out of his yeah it would literally be like a saliva waterfall and like when but not when people have a backyard and they have this really like like fancy little rock formations where the water comes down into their pool really fancy schmancy that was a mouth yeah if he he would say to a young man do you want to go in the hot tub with me and the guy would go okay they'd get in the hot tub the guy would go there's no water in here and he'd go just way nice your cock yeah warm and gooey is comes out 96 degrees I'd let him blow me if I knew that I could take down Michelle Bachmann but take her down from what though just it because she will be a Jo you really feel that I know so look you just have to see who Fox News is trotting out and she is one of the first pundits they go to for comments on shit she is introducing legislation in Congress right now that is actually being enacted so what's to stop her me I will suck her husband's dick and release it on the Internet I'll take the hip all we need to do is get him on some ecstasy right just get him to realize the folly of his ways it's like these people that are like that I guarantee you if you got them on some ecstasy and gave them a hug and go fucking don't worry about it man don't worry about it I know you are just let it go be you don't don't be right gobble gobble gobble just grab it I'm stuffing them in there stuff in it party up dude you're already like 60 he's probably actually probably having a lot of gay sex he's having a lot of gay sex and I think it's similar with a lot of celebrities I don't want to mention names like say Oprah like her husband I believe how dare you I believe each I've heard rumors he always have to substantiate things like that I've heard rumors that he looks extremely gay to me I would say those rumors automatically if I knew that there was a woman out there or a man out there rather whose girlfriend makes a hundred billion dollars let's say that guy's gay right fucking right out of the game yeah I guess your dick would get so small from being around that much money every day and it's not yours she's so dominant over him and what does that guy do is you make a hundred grand a year I mean who knows what the fuck he does I think he goes out and does well here's here's the cash in for doing nothing is the he does speeches like they pay him to come in and do motivational speeches oh my god yeah oh my god that's hilarious motivational speeches yeah whatever you would you this is how you find a really which powerful woman and just connect our people we these people man look who knows maybe the guy's like a really brilliant intelligent guy maybe he doesn't give a fuck about money maybe he's just enlightened no it's true actually I know dudes that are like that that are with really strong women and they are totally cool with it they they find them and you know enchanting and humorous and they they go for the ride that's fine I guess for us we're kind of alpha males so I think it would be difficult for us to picture being in the backseat maybe and maybe not I think there's it's really hard when you say like that this would work or that would work generalizing because there's people in my life that on paper I shouldn't like and I fucking love them you know I mean this relationships that I've had with people that despite all the craziness I enjoyed the fuck out of my time with them and you know and sometimes in a more intense way like even though wasn't like wasn't anything that had legs like they could actually last like this after a while you have real relationships where you could actually go on vacation with someone right you remember when you first started going on vacation with girlfriends in like three or four days and you're like oh my god I need to jump out of a fucking window now right I had a girl that I faked a phone call my friend called me up I faked an obligation to get rid of her she came to stay with me for the weekend just for the weekend and two days in she was complaining about everything to the point where I was like there was no fun to be had everything was just a complaint complaining about the music complaining about where we're gonna go to eat complain about every fucking thing and it was I was panicking my friend called me up and and ice and I go hey what's up man and I go oh dude I forgot shit fuck I gotta come get you oh my god I'm so sorry this is my friend Johnny who's quite slick character was like oh okay it what's going on boy you know I go Bethany's hero name damn nice person but it was the wrong time for both of us right look I was a fucking pain yes that too right that was part of the problems like I was a fucking like that's it - I think that when you're a young man I think it'd be hard for you to travel with anybody but other young men you're just you you're a fucking Explorer you want to really go nuts and you not only that you're dumb yeah I was 12 20 or maybe 23 at the time I was so stupid yeah I mean I was so stood and crazy and it was only like two years removed from fighting so my brain was hardwired the wrong way like I had a rewire it my brain was was wired for violent competition and then breaks in between that like that was my whole life so going from that to like the like being around girls and relationships and trying to manage those waters was very confusing for me yeah my fighting was such like a solitary pursuit right I had I used to keep journals up until probably when I was like 23 or something but I was dating this girl and we went to Europe together it was like after sophomore year at college that summer she had she had studied abroad in in Austria for the second semester so I saved up some cash and I flew over there and we met in London and we went to Ireland and we went to France and I was fucking miserable and I was in a journal and I look back at it now and it wasn't her it was just that like I just wanted to do my own fucking thing I wasn't into negotiating and compromising because at that age you feel like life is so short you don't want to waste a day you just feel like whatever the most exciting thing is that's what you want to be doing and that's often not what comes out in the compromise there's definitely that but there's also I was just selfish yeah I didn't want to do what anybody else would say yeah I mean but it wasn't even that I was thinking hey life is short it wasn't romantic it was like totally egotistical hmm you know like if you look back like if you had to go back in time and be yourself when you were 23 or 22 years old like what a fucking mess that would be like you'd be like oh what I have to deal with yeah you know you would like look at the relationship so you try to manage like what the fuck mess you created and that it's just such a different human now than you were then you spent so much energy on relationships back then but I'll tell you man having like a relationship like especially when you were 16 the mount emotionally I grew from like 16 to like 18 which was during the time that I had this girl is a girlfriend she was a very nice person too she was she was not a mean or nasty in any way which was really nice as well like I dated some girls after that where they were mean and nasty and when it was first time a girl insults you it's like it's a weird thing you know because like this my first girlfriend never would do that she was very smart as well and like we would have conversations they were interesting conversations there was no manipulation there's no weirdness and then I dated this girl about a year later that was the opposite she was very nice and she was very pretty unfortunately for her because it gave her this fucking this ability to constantly have men around her constantly up people hitting on her but she knew how to fuck with you and like you'd see it happen she would say something was you knows always that crooked and I was just like what like I don't know and then I remember thinking what the fuck was that like ooh what's going on here I should say shit like that like all the time you know yeah weird shit and that's where you see bad marriages is when when either person insults the other one it's like unless it's you really get that that's their stick and they fuck around and bust each other's balls right but when you see the guy get a little bit you know damaged by it you just think yeah and the girl the girl getting damaged out of it has even more like tension because there's a physical violence she's worried you know obviously you know women do violence on men I mean I lost a very good friend and Phil Hartman for that very thing his wife shot him while I was in his sleep that was a horrible relationship and that was a relationship where his ex-wife used to do subtle shit to insult him in front of like large groups of people like she would chip him down because she was a failed actress and you know Phil was a superstar was coming up senator live was constantly in movies and you know he was just like a deeply loved guy and so she would take he would take her to parties and she would take that opportunity to insult him in front of people like in real subtle ways like we were talking about cars because Phil was like a car nut and he bought a Ferrari and he was so happy he bought this car like he saved up his money it was like a big deal for him he saved his money made from a couple of movie and he always wanted one of these things and the way he would talk about it like he was a very interesting guy very very smart smoked weed and it would get like real crazy about shit like really into things and have these wild conversations and like it was a really like he loved things he loved becoming a pilot like he became a pilot while we were doing news radio and I remember seeing him sitting there like studying dutifully all these aviation books I'm Way too ad D for that right this guy would study I mean like his lines like when we had a scene he would study his lines over and over and over and over and he was such a consummate professional he's got so when he was talking about this Ferrari it was about the Italian engineering in the shape of it the sound of the engine the whole experience was everything he had just and so she goes I like trucks you know my ex-boyfriend had a truck my good boy friends back home at trucks and so what is he thinking when he what do I hear what I hear is she's talking about these dudes who probably truck a picture truck I picture brutish men right gorilla fucking her in the back of this truck just throwing some hay down ripping her pants off and just fucking send it he's not alone of course in fucking the line of dude ropes fucking stirrups on shit but she would say that kind of shit yeah you know she would always make jokes about him being old or make you know various jokes about whatever you know she was trying to chip him down about but I'll never forget that just you know I like trucks all my ex-boyfriends back home had trucks yeah that's just a gross thing to say yeah and you get that from your parents I mean they model it for you how you're gonna treat your spouse is like I see it every fucking time I was hanging out with a friend couple nights ago and the parents were around his uh his in-laws were around and I could see the way they treat each other I was like oh yeah that's your marriage that's how your wife treats oh it's so true so my parents like they really respected each other like they never they never did that they kid it around a lot but it was so obviously fun what they were doing and they really respected each other they never took shots in public and when they had to if they had to have a serious discussion and it wasn't yelling they would wait we went to bed they go on the other side of the house close the door and we heard muffled you know there's like some people do sucking arguing in front of their kids it's like well that's what your kids are gonna do when they grow up yeah yeah that's that's super important man so it's super important to show them the model of what's possible and if you're in a bad relationship it's just as equally important to get out one of the really important things my mother taught me when I was a little kid is getting out of a relationship when we were five she moved us in with my grandmother and then we got an apartment we moved out of my dad's place because her and my dad were involved in this abusive relationship so I remember thinking that like wow like my mom is smart she does the right thing when shit goes wrong she doesn't just take it she has off it's out she figures the way out of it even with two kids you know so it took a lot of courage to do I was gonna say balls that's ridiculous [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
