hello freak bitches you know that is real I mean it's that's not just talk it's not talk where he Zig we should have zagged and you know Roy Roy story is a perfect example of that a friend explain who Roy is Roy is he's who got me started in bow hunting and he is the toughest man I've ever met I've shared more experiences with Roy in the mountains he's life to finding type experiences that that we've talked about and you know the the bond we've created together has been over a handful of experiences you know and you you realize when you're out of your comfort zone like that and when you're both so committed to a pursuit those bonds form quickly you know and so we've formed a strong bond over a handful of experiences over a couple years well Roy and I you know we went to high school together we started bow hunting as you know I think 18 19 years old and had hundreds of experiences life changing life defining experiences together over the year so our bond naturally was like brothers and uh you know he he was when everybody doubted me when I was growing up and doubted my dream of ever becoming anything he never did he was always he was always the guy that believed in me well this year of sheep hunting he was out sheep hunting where we had sheep hunted before together and I killed a ram and it was you know it's a it's a tough difficult dangerous hunt and he but he's more prepared or he was more prepared for hunts like that than anybody in the world he's done it he's done it as much as anyone that I know and I've been successful I think he's killed had killed nine Rams and he one misstep he fell and died prime of his life essentially 49 years old just you know a father husband three kids somebody who even the toughest Alaska hunters looked up to one step gone and that's you know that's so it's not just talk when you say Zig you should have zagged there's risk but that's I mean if you're gonna it it just puts everything in perspective that's the lure to it because I can speak for Roy and I because I know we we always have known about the risk that was part of the draw is we wanted to go where nobody else wanted to go or do things that nobody else wanted to do that was the only thing that made us difference and it goes back that made us different that's and it goes back to you know I the level the playing field well we felt like well if we would go and do the hardest hunts and the toughest conditions nobody else would want to do that but we would all said we were calling the shots we don't call the shots the mountain calls the shots and on that that hunt the mountain one and Roy fell and he died and it's uh felt 700 feet right yeah yeah it's a you know that where he fell just tough unforgiving sheep country and you know once once you start going there you're not going to stop and it's one of the most dangerous hunts sheep yeah yeah it's a-you know on that hunt specifically they give a hundred tags and a lot of times there's this one sheep killed it's that difficult and and I think 40 percent of the people never even go because of the weather because of the conditions because it's so hard so they draw the tag and don't even get up the hill it wasn't that there was a case with you when you went up there grizzly hunting you were supposed to go sheep hunting as well right yeah what know is moose hunting moose hunt we were going to do a moose sheep combo but there's so much snow we couldn't even get to sheep country and that was a plan we're gonna go sheep hunting and that was with Roy that was with Roy right so we had you know an amazing moose hunt together and I killed a nice big bowl we just had just just another epic adventure something you know a hunt that maybe a handful of people would want to do because we were so far back you know miles back and had to haul a moose out over a mountain in the snow a very very very difficult huh but the ones it was just it was perfect because is our last hunt together he died two weeks later and that hunt encapsulated everything about us it was just hard it was miserable and it was rewarding and and you know we achieved success we're not many people would have and we did it together and uh yeah I mean then two weeks later z' was his sheep huntin there was an iconic photo that I think it was forever going to define you from that hunts with you the big cut in your face and blood streaming down your face and you sent it to me while you're out there yeah you were you're saying we haven't we haven't got one yet yeah we're out here hustling yeah and this is photo of you looking grizzled as fuck yeah with blood coming out your face snow in the background yeah and I'm like yeah that's that's Cameron Haines it it is because in role it always would we would always say we can make an easy hunt hard because we wanted to be hard what you went into an area where very few people were having success and even with rifles right you're going deep deep into area it was a rifle area so that means you a bow hunter had a different size of animal that was legal or if you're hunting with a rut so if you're hunting this area was a rifle area had to be a little bigger so had to be fifty inches wide but had to have four brow tines which so you're you're you're making it harder so we were there and there in the rifle area and we got it done and it was it was the hunt that it was a hunt that that's what we loved we loved hard we just loved the test I mean a moose is will help it I might pounded that thing way we had about six hundred pounds of meat that's just the meat just to me I mean how much did the animal way oh I don't know over I mean 1200 pounds probably a thousand I don't know some enormous enormous animal yeah until you see one like in your there physically next to it you don't realize no it took us hours to break you know I killed it it was in the evening and uh Roy and I we had cameramen there but they ended up just they filmed a little bit of the the process of breaking it down then they headed back to the spy camp in a row and I stayed there which we like just doing it by ourselves back there together singing in Disney saying he would always say I don't really uh what kind of stuff he's saying yeah country girl shaker for me little Luke Bryan maybe little little uh Lady Gaga I thought oh god yeah he he was a well versed a terrible singer but it was just what we did right it was also as part of the part of the deal you were happy Oh successful hunt it was you know God you know I'm just gonna I'm gonna miss those times with him because uh it's just hard knowing that the journey we'd been through together that's why it's so appreciated and you know who else you know there's another example we hunted this year in hunted the brown bear together and uh he uh I killed this bear Desalle went over and was attacking the corpse of the bear but the bear died she didn't know what was going on she smelled blood just went crazy the these brown bear are they're big predators and something goes in their head she's gonna have an issue so she heard when I shot the boar it made a noise it sorta ran towards her she stood up didn't know what was going on knew he had made this noise so she ran towards where he was well as soon as she hit his path she smelled the blood from where my arrow passed through him so she tracked him by the blood just basically running smelling blood blood blood she got to him and he had died already she started attacking him yeah this is just what they do these are you know these aren't crying hugging bear and uh so she's gone and I'm I'm with Roy and I'm like I said she's turned on my bear and I'm not God my bear I'm yelling to her I'm like you know and so I tell Roy I'm Mike I said we got to get her I said shoot out there so he shoots boom and she's like not didn't even you know he didn't shoot at her he just was mentionin oh yeah just a scare nothing I'm like hey get off that bear and she looked up and then she like saw us else in here she comes sprinting and is like what is going on and uh she's like a blood frenzy yeah just it was so much going on at one time and then it got something triggered in her head and she was just crazy so here she comes and I killed my bearers in a creek she got to the creek and Roy says he says if she doesn't stop I'm gonna have to shoot her I said yeah so she comes up to our side of the creek I have an arrow nocked and you know I don't know what I'm gonna do with an arrow but it's I don't have I never pack a gun so I said my bow and he had he had the gun she stands up at 20 yards away and we're standing there and it's a standoff and so we think well she stood up she's gonna see what's going on um there's three of us standing there and she's going to say okay I'm drop down and leave so we're like get out of here and uh she drops down beeline right towards us and one er charging and so Roy boom and he uh he drops her you know one shot made a good shot he hit like missed her head but hit like right here and is folded or right there and it was what what the what stands out for me is that you know we were out we were never worried about our lives were at stake we're never worried about and you know like maybe a typical reaction would be like oh my god we could have died or something like that I I was just like I cussed because I'm like I was mad she did that and required Roy to act you know so I was just I cussed and he's like he's like dude I had to and so we weren't worried about ourselves we were just we didn't wanna have to kill another bear and we weren't nervous about the situation and I'm like I said I know and it was like where else am I gonna have somebody that's on that same page with me that that's calm in that situation and not see there I flash before their eyes just do what you have to do just to stop the risk that's never going to happen I'm never gonna have somebody like that in my life again and I think about we were you know we knew the risk were involved in everything that we did and we embraced it and we were fine with it and it and it didn't consume us or anything and that's that's what I'm gonna miss is having somebody so on my same page that I can trust like that you know Roy was the best you would have to have someone who's experienced that as many times as Roy has had where it was a he knew exactly what he had to do that moment yeah he did and he said people know what they have to do it's it's executing that is what's hard you know and so knowing what it takes not panicking being in control and then getting the job done with one shot very rare and he was so Roy in those situations was as I don't know everybody I haven't been with everybody but I would say he's as good as anybody that that I know of you know and uh that's why you know when he fell and I got the news that he fell and died I mean I could I could believe it I guess but I was mad I'm still mad and I know everything happens for a reason and I know you know he has a lot of faith and I know you know we want to thank everything's going to be okay and we'll see each other again I know all that but it still makes me mad because you know we missed or we missed out on a lot of experiences we'd still love to have and we talked about and we were just like we had these big big goals and big dreams and I'm mad that that's gone so it's completely it's not it's not just understandable it's um it's something that very few people could probably relate to the kind of intimate friendship that you would have with someone who's experienced those kind of hunts it's been in in the will that's done like that moose hunt that you were talking about what you guys were deep deep in in the in the wilderness like that it's it's something that very few people will ever very few people ever experienced at that kind of danger that kind of an intimate moment in the wilderness just that connection to the wild that you guys had together right and so the whole point I guess with all that is it's people say well you just your murderous or you want to kill it's such a small part of what me and really experienced together the kills were I mean they were we achieved our goal that was it it was the journey it was the Brotherhood it was you know growing up and that's what that's what hunting is it's not just you're out killing it's you're experiencing nature its most brutal or its most rewarding or the entire gamut and when when that makes you who you are um it's powerful and that's you know that's what hunting was to us you
