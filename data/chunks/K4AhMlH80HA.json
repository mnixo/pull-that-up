trained my day Joe Rogan podcast my name all day but what the fuck were you talking about the way in today you drop with some knowledge on me about some gem where they're fighting oh the fucking movie with the black dudes what's that movie that was the kid came out here Billy Corbin did Oh dog fight yeah the more we talk about dog fight then you're talking about some German you said you'd save it for the podcast this is what I was telling you like do you know what happened with Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz with a bottlee threw water bottles at each other plastic water bottles they get well well someone might have thrown a monster energy can did someone throw a can so if it can't hit you or someone you care about that would suck the water bottles when I come on anyway they got fined a hundred fifty thousand dollars and he should definitely shouldn't fucking throw water bottles right so part of me is like well if they could discourage throwing water balls that shit stupid right but but did the altercation the altercation is probably good for business the altercation I mean I get excited I see Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor screaming at each other across you know fuck you yeah yo fuck you fuck you make it crazy with each other it makes you excited and I think that generates pay-per-view buys I don't think Conor stupid I don't think Nate stupid I think they're smart I think they know what they're doing would come to that kind of stuff so that's a part of the show I mean do you really think he was going to hit him with that water bottle you know fucking you Nate Diaz it's hard to hit him with a punch how the fuck are you gonna hit him with a water bottle that's coming from 300 feet away he's not gonna see that he's not gonna move out of the way of that water bottle you know I mean what they decide to get upset about and what they don't decide to get upset about is what's weird about athletic commissions you know like one of the things they were talking about whether or not they were gonna test Nate for his vape pen because he had a CBD vape pen which is CBD not even not even psychoactive it doesn't make you high but it does alleviate some inflammation and it provides people that have like you know back pain or something like that especially after a long fight provide you with a little relief but what's crazy is the only reason why they would want you to not do it obviously it's not performance-enhancing you're not performing anymore the performance is over so are they protecting you from yourself like what are they doing they don't want you to do it because you're flaunting the fact that you're doing it in front of everybody that they piss him after the CB deal just after he was smoking that I think he had already done his post by post fighting I think you do that before you do the the press conference I think I don't know though it's a good question I'm not entirely sure and they might do it different way differently in different places but either way you're not concerned about them like what are you with what's the issue like what is the issue it just looks bad does it look bad these that vapors coming out he's scared of dragons the CBD all business we're not the roof then I'm sure it did and it should and it sure the roof and wait wait till it becomes legal we're a month away when it becomes legal then it's really gonna go nuts it's gonna be good for everybody but anyway so they get fucking pissed at him for that but the the the Connor the fine was so high I'm like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars Wow well he said he made 40 million next time she's your mom they won't fucking know that's true a hundred you know even the other kid made two three mil half of that after taxes 1.5 150 don't really put a dent in your fucking thing next time you won't throw fucking bottles that is a state bowling unless they both went to Dana's Alisa this jacked up the things I like to see everyone in this at UFC pick up the tab for 300 because it came out of your fucking and for the paper views and something there's always 150 is not that bad they walked away with it on the loot so good pours gotta be some type of repercussion 150 and they can fight again in November right listen I got court without a license ten fifteen years ago in LA first time ever I was talking on the phone like I pulled over guys resi license it didn't work that day I went down to LA County I stood in front of a judge by pop pop they gotta look me straight in the face she knows you could pay two hundred and come back with your license don't give me five fifty and I don't want to see you again what do you think like they're getting too good game final I getting 550 and in time I got my license not with a grant on my head yeah sometimes you pay a little actually they let you fight November now your next time and now you could Mack up that 150 you're earning at least they're not suspended for fucking a year yeah that's true here's here's my thought but I don't think 150 is bad if you got a good charity for it the sin of the charity yeah instead of they've gone to an athletic department what I mean yeah I'm sure you have nice cordless apartment somewhere yeah girls soccer team so something like that right for that there you go that that's like a good thing right but we have a thousand into their pocket is what pisses you off well it's what they decide to get mad at and what they don't decide to get mad at cuz there's a thing that I found do you know did you watch when Floyd Mayweather was doing I believe it was for Showtime they were doing one of those behind the scenes things at his gym and he has what he calls dog house fights and I don't let me just say that this kind of thing has been going on in gyms forever right they've always had gym wars and people have even set up this was a thing that I'm pretty sure became illegal in California fairly recently within the last decade they stopped allowing people to have what they call smokers and what a smoker is they have organized fights but there's not really like a lot of medical on hand there gets paid nobody gets paid but it gives people valuable experience they used to have a lot of them and Muay Thai like I used to go to them they were cool they would set up like these little plastic lawn chairs you pay a small amount of money you know like 30 bucks or something like that and you go and you watch all these amateur fights and a lot of times kids are pretty fucking talented and it's fun to watch but so they've always had organized gym fights so essentially what Floyd Mayweather did was have his own like in-house gym fights like amateur fights like they didn't even disguise the fact that it was a competition like they weren't trying to they weren't trying to spar like these guys are having fights and he was talking about how it's to the death it's really crazy and he has these guys one guy gets beat up and he's Hawk Hasim rock bands brother or son seen Rock Mont son I believe see if you see if you can google who the gentleman was comments were saying it was his brother but I was just okay his brother maybe it's his brother that makes more sense because Hasim Rahman is not that old to have a kid that's that you know like that developed because he looks like he's like in his 20s maybe yes anyway point being so this English guy beats up Hasim rock bands one brother and then the mom comes back with the bigger brother and the English guy fights him too all on the same day and they're fighting like these 30 minute rounds this gets crazy is there a winner in this they put it on TV yeah I mean dude if there's definitely winner little is that money raised yes sorry the question was is that Jesus no I don't think there is I mean there might be I mean Floyd might reward them or something like that but I mean it's it's crazy shit and I mean in one way yeah this will develop develop character and I don't have a problem with people doing whatever they decide to do if somebody wants to fight a 30 minute fight I don't have a problem with that you know Jerome you know you should be able to do it if you want to they've been doing this since Jesus love Chicago but the thing is in Boston when you with a brown belt yeah with your buddies you did this but I'm but the thing is I'm not a promoter in Las Vegas right that's a big different that's a big difference and I'm not a professional fighter on television I'm nuts I'm you know I'm and I'm not necessarily saying there's anything wrong with what he did because it is a part of gym culture it is a part of what's made champions I mean this kind of stuff these dis heat these heated battles this is of our uncomfortable reality that elite fighters like Floyd Mayweather face like to be that good you have to be that real and for a guy like him to show like these kind of easy 30-minute no time limit fights in the gym and put it on TV it's pretty wild it's pretty and I see both sides of it I totally see Floyd man with a side of it look at him he feeds off that but that guess what that mentality is why that motherfucker was 49 and oh right that motherfucker is arguably the best boxer ever who got hurt less than Floyd Mayweather who box people's face off that everybody thought was going to kill him better than Floyd Mayweather remember when he fought Maidana and he found him the first time and Maidana caught him in one of the exchanges like right before the bell rang we were like whoa and then they fought again the second time and he just put a clinic on Maidana just put a clinic on it's like all of a sudden Maidana was fighting a totally different guy like Floyd had figured out Maidana style or decided not to fuck around this fight and decided you know to really take him seriously and really focus on him and he just beat his ass you know brother he differentiates a lot of ways you don't agree with a lot of this shit he does you know but listen man he sucks emotion games off the church off the charts his self-promotion games the greatest of all time he's I mean more money he's made me laugh at night sometimes I watch this show and he's made me laugh and some insights show you watch because you don't really like the dude yeah but you wanted I mean he you know so I like that I would love him I bet I would love he's a psycho and I've watched them fight like three times I'm like you know what the proof isn't the motherfucking pudding exactly it exactly was in the pudding let him do whatever the fuck he wants you don't you don't get a guy like that unless he's a guy like that you don't get that 49 I know unless he's that kind of dude but I think he handles it as good as any fucking human being that could be in that position handles it it's a crazy position of being to be a young guy be worth that much money and you know your nicknames money Mayweather I mean it's where the fuck leaves himself money which I mean he's hilarious ain't got nothing wrong with you if you talk shit in back yeah anymore exactly where I live you know what I'm reading right now a buddy of mine gave it to me Hollywood Henderson are you old enough for that Hollywood Henderson was a Dallas boy that was the real deal you're gonna stab me they don't even make him like that no more I showed up rookie day I'll give you the article with three hits acid a grandma blah right here the Thousand Oaks in the offseason he would rent the hotel and hang out with Pryor at the Comedy Store Hollywood had this some was the lab would point his sisters this was before big change and before they played the Denver Broncos is his claim to fame he went on national TV and took a can Orange Crush but the Denver Broncos drank that soda and he fucking crushed it with the juice in it with one hand whoa and Super Ball he intercepted his squad has a line back and then he just fucking blew up the ball with big fucking you know he talks shit people hey hey he talk shit yeah on game day he showed up then they threw him out because he put fucking two fingers up during the game in the corner of the cowboy saw him at that time what's two fingers he can't do two things evolution on TV a national TV and Hollywood Henderson the camera came over instead of watching he advertised the towel he goes oh if you need these towels and they would like to receive his company the next day Tom Landry fired Hollywood Henderson and after that it was all over he smoked a fucking crack and bazookas but he won the lottery in Texas on the lottery became a born-again Christian oh my goodness it was my motherfucker dog well that's a fun story yeah I mean I just want to be clear about all that stuff that I was saying about the Floyd Mayweather thing I just think that the athletic commissions you know like when they find people and when they get mad at people for stuff it's like sometimes they do it in a very heavy-handed way and I think it's kind of obscene like [Music]
