hello freak bitches I mean everybody has their moments of getting hot and then cold and you know you have to hope if you get cold you're get hot you know it's yeah but yeah it's really fucking stupid I don't know like during that whole Chris Brown thing that's my only example so of course I was getting invited to be on shows and talked about it and I declined everything I was like no I'm not good for you I was like absolutely not I wasn't a Chris Brown thing we talked about it before the podcast but if people don't know Chris Brown obviously was in trouble because he's beat up Rihanna and that whole thing and you know the domestic violence issue right and you tweeted something at him what did you tweet well it was like my lowest form of comedy writing is the celebrity retweet it's because I can't think of anything else right and I'll just go to my favorite targets like Kim Kim Kardashian and I only make fun of when they write something stupid I never I never ever like I've never talked about somebody's looks their weight their you know like it's just when something dumb and with his you know what he did he's a horrible person and he had showed no signs of remorse like he kept doing shit even threw a chair through the window and Good Morning America when Robert and Roberts interviewed him yeah well I mean like asking him about it and apparently they had made some sort of an agreement where they weren't gonna bring masks violence I'm here to talk about my album right now but the whole thing it's like how he channeled his rage you know throwing a chair through a fucking wouldn't it really like you couldn't so I was bored child yes I was bored and he had tweeted something like man I look old as fuck and I'm only 23 and so i retweeted it and I was like I know being a worthless piece of shit can really age apart I thought it was funny and then all of a sudden like I look at my replies on my phone and it was look like that those waterfall of just like all of a sudden was like a thousand two thousand I'm like holy shit whoops just like what did I do and then I realize he was coming back oh like you know telling me to suck his dick I'm like no your mother must be so plague I just I played with him it was a Sunday I was bored and like next thing I know is like he deleted his entire tour account and I'm more like wow that's not what I meant to do did he say one to shit in your mouth to shart in my eye your eye retina to be your specific I don't know beam accuracy does he have with a she didn't even just laughing away and I like he said like ass Rihanna if she mad I'm like a scree onna if she mad hmm so like I tweeted back and then I linked his police report to that tweet that was funny and we went back and forth for a while and then he deleted his account and that's when it became a thing did he put it back up back yeah it was like down for like a couple weeks or something can you delete your account when you put it back to you get all your followers back you have to start from scratch yeah just start from scratch but he has the most insane loyal group of idiots that follow him just misspelled death threats all day long I was like well you know whoops but then the next I was like my manager like I love the call that I got she's like Jenny no and she's like okay are you sure you don't want I've got good ones of you Larry King I was like no view is a good one how hilarious she was like she was totally not promoting listen she's like got some good ones and want you to be on got Larry King we got the view I was like no no no that's one way to do it mm-hmm and I've definitely done that way before I've done it a bunch of shitty what's the worst way you've ever done it just a chicken nuggets way but I mean I has it right around that same time not not eating I remember so my first kickboxing fight ever I fought a guy named andy souwer i don't know if you're familiar with it that was the first kickboxers fight first kickboxing fight ever fuck is that yeah is your manager how long dandy been fighting then he is already his record at the time I remember too and for some 93 and one oh my god that's so insane 93 win and I was your first kickboxing fat oh my god I was 12 and oh as an MMA as an MMA fighter oh my god nineteen years old I had maybe one or two amateur boxing fights and I had been training him and I've been trying to keep boxing for a long time but anyway I had 91 I mean I'm a 93 and one I remember what fucking governing body sanctioned that it was in Japan I was big I was the guy who fought a lion in Japan exactly I was the guy that they're bringing in for the slaughter oh my god I show up out there and I'm only I think I remember I was only like eight pounds out and we didn't know what the fuck we were doing with with regards to the weight cut at the time I was 19 and so I'm like oh shit and I just stopped eating I just didn't eat for about four days oh no no that's soca' meanwhile eight pounds ain't shit I'll do that yeah the day before a quick oh we're good yep exactly still still eats one during the sauna yeah yeah oh my god and so I starved myself for about four days and we checking your weight way starving yourself yeah I think I was I don't I don't run was a long time ago but it was same day weigh-ins - oh I waited in the morning oh and fought about maybe eight or nine hours oh my god and with five rounds with him I went I got I got my ass kicked I got my ass kicked but I learned a lot and I grew from the experience the big one you know that the film addresses is the is is the livestock you know that's what's got out of control and that's what's literally destroying and taking over the wildlife so if you're really concerned about wildlife if you're real wildlife person the last thing you do was not only consume say factory farm but we that's the whole thing about our film people think it's about factory farming we don't even talk about factory farm we talk about the grass-fed beef we talk about the organic the organic free-range organic grass-fed milk and that's what's killing the wildlife and that's the whole point of what we jump past the factory farm because ironically for wildlife if you care truly about wildlife and that's what they discuss when we talked to my animal agriculture Alliance they say they say people think we're living in somewhere 50 years ago hundred years ago we're not we're living in a place with 7 billion people the only way to efficiently feed people who want to eat meat is to put them in factory farms their factory firms because they're efficient they only take around 2 acres per cow where is the grass-fed cow you're talking about your buddy in Wisconsin the guy in our film he had cattle in Wisconsin he said 50 acres 50 acres for one fucking cow one cow 50 acres 50 acres think how big that is no other wildlife can enter that so that's the last thing you'd want to eat as grass-fed beef the last thing you wanted to be fed is um with beating is these organic dairy farms that is destroying all our water Water Resources polluting the rivers and destroying all these predators and these uh you know the other wildlife that you write but the argument would be that when you have a grass-fed cow and it's eating on 50 acres that's where it's getting its food from whereas if you have a factory raised animal it's getting corn that corn is raised independently on some other large area two acres though two acres two acres - yeah because you can grow corn so much per acre and grass-fed it needs 50 acres that no other horse no other bear no other cougar know that all these animals that you're talking about no other animal can live on that area is that during the life of the animal that's that's just period that's just a slaughter yeah Phil slaughter stand there because that's constantly so imagine on a 50 foot fence nothing else well sweet more than 50 foot 50 50 acres sorry 50 acres for one so that's the last thing you want to be eating is grass-fed beef if you really care about the environment if you really care about wildlife you you need to say either I fuck the cow screw the cow the cow is a miserable life but you know I care a lot about more like you know about the elk and the moose and the Wolves I care more about wildlife than I do about this cow you got to choose one or the other if you're going to do it and if you can really care about wildlife you got to say screw the cow and let's go with factory farm that's the whole irony of this whole grass fed myth that's happening and that's what's that's what's kind of ironic about the film and people don't expect that shocking [Music]
