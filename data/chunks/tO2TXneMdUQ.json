Hey meow whoa we forgot what you were yeah this is uh this is the original spot and in the original spot now known as des quad east that's what East has cats and for some reason Brian has decided that des quad West is a primate based it's all monkeys and scary things live on - right well the the studio itself definitely has a different feel you know with the werewolf when you walk into the place that this extraordinary that thing's awesome is hasta coolest thing I've ever bought my life powerful pat mcgee guy from pat mcgee special effects he makes them you can order one any can order one before you got married your house would have at least seven innocent yeah so different would you live with a chick man they start moving your shit around putting pictures of your kids on the wall and I used to have chimps up all over my house if you went over my house when I was a single man I'm gonna do I said pictures of chimps everywhere in sculptures - yeah yeah weird sculptures weird shit yeah like literally you'd walk around his whole entire house under be a monkey or a chimp every five steps there'd be a different picture really needing a tiger one no no chips eating Tigers but I got him like how long chasing after for how long were you ooking that though oh man I've been obsessed with chimpanzees since I was a baby so even like like a teenager style you were know yeah I've always been obsessed with apes you sass with them I find them fucking fascinating my production company's name is talking monkey and Corey yeah yeah sure I got that was in like 1988 and that was a line I stole from a movie with the fuck was that dude's name I forget his name well you know God Harmon Mark Harmon thing knows is he had a funny movie like a summertime movie Carmen okay it was like summer school or some shit like that it was like that was cool yeah and he said to a guy if you lose one more brain cell you'd be a talking monkey and I remember that all of a sudden put in my head the idea of a talking like like how stupid would a person have to be if we real did evolve how far back who do we have to go until we became a talking monkey you know what is that and so that became I mean was that was my initial obsession but that's why I named my company talking monkey incorporated I can see how an obsession with monkeys they're so fascinating yeah if they didn't exist we would be tripping the fuck out if we if someone showed you if Newars no chimpanzees and all sudden we found chimpanzee somewhere would be like holy shit look at them they're looking at you they're thinking oh my god they're using tools holy fuck look at this this is like a window back in time this is like the fucking sensory deprivation tank in altered states we can see our past I mean you literally can see your past yes means somehow or another I don't understand that evolution scientifically behaviorally wouldn't when I talk like this people said well you really don't understand how evolution works okay I appreciate that but I think you can reasonably extrapolate that if people exist and then there was some early people there was like you know homo whatever it was like a whole bunch of different homos yeah right lots of homos yeah homo Australia Austria Pittacus I think Australia Pittacus there was that one tube our direct and you know ancestors that they believe it's like somehow or another we had to be like more primitive it wasn't like we just started out like like close to a human there were some steps along the way you fuck okay and I think it's not unreasonable to look at chimpanzees and say even though that's not our step along the way it's from a different branch of the same tree the same primate tree I think you can reasonably extrapolate that there's something very similar the way they are that we probably were you know at least we can put it together them and orangutangs and bonobos we can mix them all together and try to figure out what the fuck we were like there's different models that have come along before humans fuck yeah there's a stupid c-class and there's an e class and then there's s class you know you know what fuck fuck commercials for this podcast I don't feel like doing any commercials this is like a podcast that came out of nowhere we didn't even see this coming Tommy buns we put it together last minute so no commercials suck it suck it please move on and let's just get going Brian Redman working the mic rocking the disks turn the table the Joe Rogan experience join my day Joe Rogan podcast my night all day da-da-da-dah ladies and gentlemen Tommy buns now this podcast maybe the first podcast it's serious ever plays will you get the full podcast no seriously they don't have to edit it because we don't have a commercial in it oh that's great so people don't know is that I'm financially irresponsible and I'm not that good at advertising shit right and a lot of times when we do our podcast the advertisements may take as long as 20 minutes because somewhere in the advertisements you know Bryan Callen might bring up some crazy fucking book that he read and all of a sudden we're on this wild journey or Duncan Trussell blows your mind with a certain thought in the middle of a commercial talking about something and now yeah you're off on a tangent half but a lot of that shit never makes it to Sirius satellite radio I even think isn't the show like an hour long too like they just edit it down to an hour probably I don't know but it's awesome that they put us on there yeah it's I'm happy to be on there because it's Opie and Anthony who are my friends and there's it's just it's a good group of humans you know they're good guys Jim Norton is a great guy I love being associated with those guys you know those those guys are I'm down for them everybody said my friend it seems like a good crew man they're great guys man Anthony's beautiful human being Opie's a fucking awesome guy they're awesome Jim Norton is like one of my favorite humans ever yeah you know so it's like all them together we have some great conversations you know they're not dumb guys by any stretch of the imagination even though I disagree with some of them ideologically like sometimes I disagree with Anthony he's like real strong like right-wing Republican but he's also I believe in a lot of things that he believes in there's a lot of shit that I believe in especially like the gun control issue you know I mean he's a pretty bit extreme you know he's he's got crazy gun nut and he has guns Oh lovely it's all I see but I honestly believe that when you see the shooting victims and all these different things this is not a gun issue it's a mental health issue it's the ability to do that that should be so alien from our society and I liken it to a group of close friends okay and this is obviously an exaggeration it's really hard to do when you're talking about a giant Society of people that are never gonna get to meet each other but in a group of close friends like us the people in this room okay let's pretend that we were all on a desert island what are the odds that one of us would become a suicide bomber okay pretty fucking small yeah right pretty fucking small points how does someone become a suicide bomber how does someone become a guy who drop a bomb off at a marathon finishing line how does someone do that what what what the fuck happens to that guy that lets you do that because the reality is that there's a lot of shit that can kill people in this world including cars and everyone has cars and if you wanted to kill far more people than this guy did at the marathon you could run over people in your car the reason he did it this way is because he wanted to not be accountable for it he thought I could get away with it sure if this is the you know if you by the official story how Alex Jones have you by the official story ladies and gentlemen but if you you know you look at this guy like who they're claiming this guy is that was the the the older brother they think you might have committed three murders as well three murders outside oh yeah there was some and one night three people were murdered and one of them was a close friend and training partner of this guy and the bodies cash was left there and the bodies were covered with marijuana yeah and this guy was very religious apparently and become he had become more and more religious in the past few years now again settle down tin foil people this is if you by the official story yeah I don't know the fuck this dude was you know I'm just I'm just reading what I'm getting out of you know essentially almost all news sources seem to be agreeing with with these stories that this guy was like super religious well he went he got kind of radicalized that years ago he went back to to rush for six months yes a that's when he became back and radicalized you know yes again that's the official story I've shown Lu is a false flag event Tommy yeah what they're doing they're trying to take away your guns well supposing he listened to Alex Jones he was a fan info for our Sochi websites well maybe he was a fan of Infowars the way I'm a fan of Sean Hannity like I'll listen just because it's fucking hilarity it's funny to watch people twist the narrative like that it's funny to watch people that are just like so blatantly right-wing yeah they'll just never admit ever that anyone on the left has any idea it's always any even compliment is said with a smirk that's soon to follow some disparaging remark about who they are yeah it's never like Obama's a brilliant man or either if it's even if it's an idea if they were behind yeah there's still a spin on it so it's a it's a it's a fucking game they're in a team and they strategize to get that team to win and they do it within the rules but they know they're full of shit like as they're doing it you can hear their voice they know they're full of shit but the game is so screwy it's one of those games it doesn't make any sense like baseball why the fuck do they dress like that look how you're dressed look what those stupid fucking tights and what is that outfit what is that dosent they've always dressed like that goddammit they're stuck yeah they're stuck with a stupid outfit back from when people didn't have newspapers that's what we made that dumbass outfit that outfits retarded it is ridiculous ridiculous the stupidest fuck it puts me to tears to watch that game it's much fun game to play but sure the but getting stuck in that old shit like that that's the only reason why politicians are able to get away with the way they communicate I can't I can't imagine being a person who is into politics like really into it yeah and like you know not be cynical and not be like it's so disheartening to follow politics it to me it just it absolutely like kills the soul you know what man I recognize it as I've kind of come an older man I recognize it for what it is it's an act right you know and you know why I know cuz I do an act too mm-hmm I know what an act is like I know when I'm doing stand-up when I have stand-up I'm going to if you know want to do my best what I do is I have lived quite a bit but I also have some key components that I have broken down into pretty specific ways of saying it right because that's the best way that has the most response but I'm trying to tell jokes when you hear a person give a speech and they have that weird sort of artificial quality to the way they're talking we should reject that yes I completely agree we shouldn't let them do that yeah we should look just talk talk like a normal person yeah what are you doing about the budget yeah you know and how the budget yeah it's an important priority of this administration it's something we think about every day so what the fuck are you what do you if you guy was talking to you like that you'd be like stop stop asshole it's what you know else does that that exact speech to that that type of language comes from surrett corporate world if you were like if you talk to a guy and you're like I had a bad experience at your office's he'd be like you know every time a customer comes into one of our establishments they want that we want them to have opportunity we want them to have choices and what and you be like what the fuck are you talking about that's corporate like it's not how humans suffer like stop exactly but you can hear the training video you get that sometimes when you go now when they go do you want to sign up for the the special extra warranty you go I don't know they go well you know when I had my computer a couple years ago I knocked a bottle of coke over I love coke and it left the thing and because of the warranty they took care of it you're like that's a training CH they tell you to make a personal story up and you're like I know you're saying that to me right now it's so Gordon happen to you yeah you know that that feelings when someone's lying to you that when you're looking at them and they're just straight bullshitting you and they won't even look in the eye that's looking down looking around panicking as they bullshit you sure there's the worse as if you know somebody that can do then when you know they're lying and they're not panic and you're like oh you're a crazy for you're a fucking sociopath yeah and that's a weird moment when you're talking to a guy and you're like I'm not sure what I'm not you're playing this game and I'm not wearing a hat right now I mean I'm not wearing a hat and you know okay see it on your head right I don't know where am i man especially if they get in stuck in a bad situation yeah they get stuck in some somewhere they did some douchey mmm-hmm you know yeah like wow Oh crazy b-boy so strange it's so weird to run into someone it just doesn't see things it is man like you you see the world and they see a gigantic galactic conspiracy to ever tell you about this comedian who will remain nameless who came up to me and just start showing me pictures on his iPhones he's like look at this and I'm looking at its pictures of clouds yeah right I'm like I'm thinking the cat it's beautiful clouds he goes yeah look at that and we just keep doing this he shows me like 10 of these yeah and I go he's the older guy so I'm trying to be considerate I'm like yeah yeah Wow pretty cool and he goes you know I've been seeing them for years I go when are they he goes they're alien crafts he goes these are UFOs they are they've been coming in various forms I see them I've been taking pictures of them it's incredible that you know no one's paying attention to this it's a very strange thing and I'm like - catch I'm like is he fucking with me cuz if you know he's a kind of a silly guy I'm like if he's fucking with me this would be kind of and then I realized oh oh wait a minute I'm dealing with someone who's got a screw loose yeah but there's a screw it's not it's not worth supposed to be he's not a hundred percent crazy yeah like he's very functional for the most parties I I enjoyed talking to him he's a nice guy but when it gets to he'll pull out his fucking iPhone you got to run you got to get out of there cuz you're gonna be looking at pictures of clouds and he's gonna tell you about spacecrafts that have been contacting them yeah and it's but other than that he's normal do you like cheeseburgers on cheeseburgers yeah yeah I get fries yeah you pass me a salt please sure so what's going on man how's uh how's the road treating you like you have a conversation yeah sure then if you get into it I know a guy like that and it's you think he's like just being like kind of a storyteller he starts telling stories and you're like there's a lot of exaggerations in these stories and then you're like you know he kind of rambles on and on and then he switches topics like faster like a whole new story but it's about something like he's like you know I got shot six times and you're like what he's like yeah so I was over I was in the set in South Carolina I was going past Columbia and I got it and it's a new story that starts and you're like yeah and then this guy held me and then we were up in the trees and then this guy pulled out a 9-millimeter and he has like everything and you're like whew I thought they're talking about fishing or something like and then you know he goes back to like yeah you know when I went I took a hot-air balloon I bought a hot-air balloon company number years ago and I took this mind that I got from this investment into in mines and I bought this company that takes hot-air balloons up in the air it cost me like quarter million to get the start okay when you're like what you don't you make $10 an hour what are you talking about like it's just story to story yeah and I'm like and then I start kind of like I don't know what to believe and then part of it's fun to believe and I start to think for a second I'll stop and be like are you an improvisation like genius are you like a like a brilliant improv guy right now is that what's going on am I getting like played or getting Punk'd yeah and then but then there's something you see in the eyes where you're like oh I don't really think there's there's maybe I'm talking to somebody who has a form of mental illness yes and I'm not it's not it's not the type what makes you go like I don't know like maybe more scare or maybe like sillier like it's not he has all the intelligence and you can talk about like what should we eat now and you have a kind of normal conversation about that and then it goes off into like 10 different storylines it's all it's almost like it's nice fault yeah it's not it's not at that point yeah I don't I don't know how your brain works man you know you don't i I'm guessing I always guess when people act like why the fuck did you do that like no I have to like stop myself sometimes and go I don't know how his brain works my brain would process the same scenario in a different way but maybe his brain would handle some shit you know that I can't handle very well yeah I don't know I don't know how you think but I know when I see someone who's just not we're not there's a missing connection there like I feel like this guy's like yeah he's missing a whole piece right like what's going on here sometimes you can see it from the moment right like you there's some people oh yeah at the moment you're like but it's scarier when you have long normal conversations yeah before that then you're like what like I just been there the whole time yeah I've talked to people and then like 20 minutes into the conversation you realize they're crazy uh-huh yeah like some some people it takes a little while some people it's like right away doesn't it dangerous crazy dangerous crazy I have like sparks to them you like no I just want to bike back away from them dangerous crazies they give off a older you can't you can't be dangerous crazy unless you have this like a certain amount of danger to your odor you just feel weird you feel weird to be around every dangerous dude I've ever known has us like intangible odor about them you know you're just like okay yes let's get the fuck out of here you know there's those dudes smells like the cunt form yeah doesn't it and more yeah but I'm not even dating that's not dangerous oh it's just silly people are just I fucked up I feel like that with almost with super negative people like really like people that's not good for you to be around right you pick up on additional vibes yeah you know like just being around them yeah you don't know what it is right yeah I don't know yep it's not like they give off heat but if they leave yeah like if you're just meeting them and they leave the room and like let's say you just brought somebody in right when they leave you're like Phil thumbs off yeah you go settled off with that guy absolutely she'sa their eyes for me because I always look people roomy in the eyes for like a second just you can see like the were enos where the friendliness sometimes yeah or sometimes they just smell crazy I remember bryan callen had this chick once and he brought her over and I mean and I'm not bullshitting within three seconds of meeting her I knew she was nuts really yeah like he brought her over and they introduced you know hey you know this is Jojo this is whatever her name was and I go hi go hi nice to meet you she was high and I go come here for a second I go that cost fuckin crazy I go what

nervous if they see people that have been on televisions yeah yeah but that goes away pretty quick once you start talking like usually they're weirded out but you can see what the weirded out was right this was like like this was a like Oh like a crazy person just like I was like what are you doing counting like she wasn't bad-looking she was very attractive young lady yeah but unfortunately there was something wrong with her mind and years later Brian was um going into a bar and he ran into her and she was a streetwalker Wow a couple years later yeah it turned out she was cranked out on meth and while he was uh you know while he's with her she's like doing meth like it took him a while to figure it out like exactly what the fuck was wrong with her and he tried to fix her oh really he was doing that and then he gave up on that and then you know he runs into her and he's going to a bar and she's a streetwalker oh he probably cut out the part where he slept with her again oh no he

it was a typo I think of as ambien are you Sam being something wrapped so I'm from America it's a pet Oh happen and they've let they so many people have let these things go and like how Florida has the Python problem they have this rat problem it's an invasive species that's we let go one of those pythons in college did you really yeah we're part of that area Lori you went to some florists yeah yeah garius fucking day of my life we're moving out of that apartment and I might you know how you move out you got clothes everywhere I'm just digging my hands in and my buddy comes in the roomies Oh keep a lookout for my buddy fuck no way like that's right it we lost it in the middle of the year like and it just was in our house and as a pathway wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait about what do you mean we lost it we okay we got broken into by uh by these dudes and we had dogs me and my buddy Hartley had dogs my buddy cheese had a Python he put both his dolls she's G she's used

like fucking broke in the house stole all our shit so you're not totally responsible for it somebody else left the snake out yeah I don't know did you ever Diaz did you ever see a banana ran eight a minute how do you know they didn't just steal a snake uh-uh cuz cuz she's like I don't know if it's been in there or not the fucking lid was open they looked for it I don't know probably in the laws okay assholes are allowed to buy snakes any asshole like this anyway any responsible iguanas Savannah monitors I was into reptiles big - got you got a pit bull and I I think that they should give you buy a pit bull you need to take a GED yeah that's a prerequisite for it they're everywhere they should definitely fucking everyone there definitely thank you answer question yeah yes Matt I've had them and they're dangerous animals I'll go step further as Hanul think single women and the 30 should be allowed to adopt dogs why does he that because they've have fucked up their life now let's stop it there let's cut it off there and not let them fuck up a dog - have you ever seen a what look this is I'm taking a stretch and I know I'm saying some woman in the thirties yes like mid thirties like 35 in it when they go that's it I don't know I'm comfortable with being single now I'm gonna get a rescue dog and then you go hiking and that dog goes after your kids cuz they don't are you sure that they're really comfortable with being single or the mate it's it's probably hard to find a good dude I don't yeah but I think you never had those women that get the big dogs and they're like it's a rescue dog this is my origin and watch them love ya and exactly and then they don't fucking discipline it and they just let it go fucking bananas there's definitely like a fucking dog yeah there's also dogs get really protective of their owners and if they sense that their owner might not be like you know very dominant yeah if it's if maybe it doesn't have deep voice somewhere that the dog might be here extra protective was your kiddos dangerous yeah yeah yeah yeah I have pitbull encounters or one dog kills one of my other dogs like I came home and I know in my living room one of my females had killed my other female oh my god yeah you can't have two female dogs together female dogs apparently will always fight over dominance whereas a male and a female whom they accept like who's who's the boss usually the male just lets the female like that Jesus leave me alone and like the female snapper jaws and the male like sort of gives up but the females never give up they never give up the position they oh they'll fight to the death they fight and then they give up and they figure out like who wins and who loses but then though the challenge the one who lost wants to go bad again and they they did it a couple of times and I thought I had gotten them over it I separated them and I did all sorts of different things and then I started letting them be together again because I thought they would had gotten over it because I felt like maybe was just some like animosity like it was too fresh on each other's mind they had gotten into a fight but it's so normal for that breed to get into fights you know they're beautiful dogs with humans they're beautiful dogs with humans but with people with animals rather they have just this incredible kill Drive it's like nothing I've ever seen my dog killed two cats he killed squirrels he killed anything dumb enough to get in his yard and he would kill lizards all day like we had these lizards that would run around and he'd that was his video game he would just run around with his paws on the wall trying to get these lizards just running around the perimeter of my house trying to get lizards in hindsight I look back and I'm like what a crazy animal to have you've got a monster you got a monster it loves to attack things but he was a very particular type of dog he was a um a hog dog the origin on the Argentinian not know he was a pit bull yeah we once in Hawaii well he's from Hawaii yeah it was from Hawaii and they're there they breed them to be super animal aggressive because they're breeding him for hog hunting and so they all they have longer ears and the ears like pick up more of a scent and they're larger dogs he was crazy it was beautiful dog though he was awesome with people with people he's the greatest thing ever he was awesome he was just amazing buddy he was like super smart he always wanted to hang with you you always be down to wrestle like I never felt in danger yes to do jiu-jitsu with him I take his back you know I go time to put the Joker maybe I got her he lady who'd kiss me a good love you too like I would be like choking him and he would kiss me he was a sweet sweet sweet dog with people but with animals to another who's I can be trusted it was not to be trusted it was the craziest thing it didn't what didn't have to anything to do with socializing I socialized him with other dogs like right away he started fighting with other dogs what time is a baby they got they people yelled at me at a dog park when he was a baby he was like four months old he was trying to bite other dogs he was just gangster like from the womb there's not and I was a fool to try to control this animal as in pet you know like my dog now the big one Johnny he's a sweetest dog ever he's a sweetie yeah like my other dog that's ass much smaller dog that she Bellini bulldog mix that dog tells him what's up and Johnny knows all right all right just like relax real I just lets it all go by you know so you think it's they're born with it though just like these other bred yeah it's all the hard bread yeah they encourage a certain type of animal aggression aggression towards animals they encourage it they encourage fighting and it's been that way for thousands of years and it's the cruel aspect of the dog fighting though is what makes amazing dogs because the ones that survive through that horrible ordeal the genetics that were passed on because the dogs that quit and the dogs that cowed and and backed away from a fight were killed right we're all killed yeah that sounds horrible to us because we love our dogs sure but they weren't looking at dogs like that they were looking at dogs as a way to make money and the way to make money I mean you're talking about like this probably went on from maybe the turn of the century on I mean it's probably something that's been going on even before that if you could really get into the history of it but they they bred dogs specifically for fighting they bred them specifically for that they had them on chains they would put them there's a dude that I know that was a famous pool player used to keep 35 pit bulls he's this pro pool player 35 pit bulls at his house they weren't his pets there were fighting dogs crazy man there's yeah craziness man I think big boy from Outkast used to do that dude well that that's a big part of the culture fool oh yeah he bred those dogs and he bred though the the bully ones that are stocky he bet he bred those oh you never went to his website and looked at in there expensive yeah you know big boys website well yeah well no this is purple ribbon in the in the world of fighting dogs this is where it gets really squirrely because it's not like I'm trying to glorify this world and get give it morals or anything like that but the reality is in the fighting dog world you're not supposed to sell the puppies they're called puppy peddlers and they're looked down upon you're only supposed to let your dog breed with with really respectable breed so you're gonna make some crazy killer dog and men will loan out their dog and like you see like the lineage written down like you know Rough Riders Bronco and you know saddle stables Sheila E you know and that's the dogs precedent and they all know the championship bloodlines it's totally illegal you have dog fighting but the shit has been documented yeah like very thoroughly it's the same thing with chicken fighting like they have champion chickens like I know a dude who raises chickens and he fights him you know as this old Mexican dude he's cool as fuck you know and but that's his culture man he grew up fighting chickens yeah and this guy knows like championship bloodlines and they breed the right chickens with the right hands like it's a been a part of human history forever but it's it's like in the shadows in the darkness of our of our world and we don't want to admit that in 2000 and whatever was nine or whenever one went Vic when he got busted me what year was that 2009 maybe right overnight yeah maybe or once it was Evan I had some time in jail yeah we never want to think that a guy who's capable of such great heights is being like this massively successful football player could also be capable of such an insane quote so insane I got to tell you I love dogs like I mean you know you guys all did me a huge solid doing the fundraiser for the dog last week and I love dogs but I still I also have a problem with people who don't let somebody like him like serve his time and then get another shot at like earning a living again because a lot of people were suit like rightfully we're credit critical of what he did right but you know he lost his name mm-hmm he lost hundreds of millions of dollars probably right absolutely his contract was like about the biggest at the time he had crazy endorsements he went to prison which is what the punishment was he did it he brought to prison he did his time and then a lot of people were really upset that he even has a chance to make a living right but it's like he we he paid them well the price how undeniable is his fucking Talent the NFL's like you know what come on back come on but you know why because if they don't do it someone else gonna do it yeah some some someone's gonna grab that guy you know it really wouldn't be any other way to play football means that's kind of a I mean there's the NFL and there's basically that's it that's it that's that there's the the B League is not really a League for fin football hey I know what what is it

listening it's my dad it's like any guys has to bring back childhood memories but like it's like when Joe was a kid and he first learned how to ride a bus that's what I was in like Joey I remember when I took Joe to the holiday and you remember that Joe and hamster like shut up about me this motherfuckers lying in his bed playing with chimpanzee dolls Bernard Hopkins owns the right to the to the title I am the machine how much I know I know that's made that might be that'll be right all right because you know what get out of here yeah be back okay you've tarnished your reputation indelibly some word later brother we'll see in a bit Bert Kreischer will be joining us tonight the sold-out ice house comedy club show along with his man and I'm talking to you right now Tom Segura that was so exactly what we were in it and I wasn't thinking of him at all but it was perfect ah it was perfect he's sort of you know but it wasn't no he wasn't he's not a crazy person no but does he does make me think what we were talking about which is like a lot of times I go how does fucking Bert's brain work yeah I think yeah all this yeah how did how did he get there yeah you know which mean you do when you're sitting around he's not even high though he didn't get high no sorry he's got no goddamn excuse he just showed up and I just didn't know where I was going with the dad thing I was like hmm dad's on vacation oh taped adventure to ki Oscar but somehow those things do connect in his brain you know I'm saying like we go I don't think so I'm just waiting for an opportunity to talk about doing anything together yeah I think it was more that I do want to go canoeing like fucking off I'm really bad you guys ever used to go cuz I mean while middle of the night fucking forest is on fire cuz Bryan left behind one lit cigarette we're gonna I don't want to go canoeing with ya I up there in a river wait what happened you you like spiked your dad like you you didn't finish that or when did you do that to your dad you told them you were doing it though oh oh yeah whoops hey listen I mean I guess I mean sure you do well you brought it up no I just remembered no I love me Joe Joe gave me like this big bottle of pop soda uh-huh you know that was made out of marijuana and I had it in my fridge for a while and then me and my fiancee at the time we were all recording ourselves like because my dad was in town for the night and I think I put the camera down and then he is like oh I want to have some of this wine or champagne or whatever I'm like that's not champagne that's okay yeah you can drink that and then I just like let him drink it and then like in like within like a half hour so he just became so giggly and just laughing and it was really actually one of the coolest things ever cuz like did he freak out of all no not at all he was just like almost like a happy drunk buzz where he was just kind of right giggling and laughing did you ever tell him what happened no never he probably no but you should tell him because he would enjoy it yeah yeah you know I mean maybe it'd be one of those things that he discovers late in life like wow this Lakes makes life so much more enjoyable but you'd have to get it to him in that form though right that's the coolest forms that the edible the best form I think I like it the most oh shit sorry as long as it's mild yes it's not like super strong the effects are like really Pleasant super strong ya can bring super strong is not good that's that that's a terrible feeling it's like well I'm just trying to relax and get through this day I don't need to be contemplating the fate of the fucking galaxy youth do like an a super strong to psychedelic is that what I asked it is very much so in fact in a lot of the ancient Hindu writings a lot of what they talked about really extreme psychedelic experiences that they they talked about it we're all from eating hash really yeah eating cannabis can if you eat enough of it you can have an experience that is every bit as strong as mushrooms really yeah you just have to eat a lot of it I've had I've been moved to tears a few times I have had experiences in the tank eating eating pod that are like a fucking like a ride a movie like like experience that you wouldn't believe if you wouldn't if you didn't see it with your own synapses if you weren't going through it I thought it seems impossible yeah it's all just eating pot eating pot and getting into a tank the tank filled with water and the shoe but you have to eat that that you got to get to that critical level where you feel like you eat too much that's where you got to get you got to get to that feeling where you like I fucked up I fucked up and that's when you can close your eyes and see nutty shit like how much are you talking about well you see it in the dark see that's when you see it like you don't see it if you open your eyes if you open your eyes you're not going to loosen eight it's not like it's going to misinterpret visual cues email information but what it will do is supercharge your imagination to the point where it can't deal with the blank slate yeah so when you when you eat the pot you close you either close your eyes I don't have this habit on planes before where I eat a cookie before I got to the airport and then while I'm on the plane you're tripping your balls off when you close your eyes and the darkness of your closed eyes that's when your imagination starts firing and you start seeing wild crazy neon colors like fucking you know like you start seeing like like computer cartoon fractal shows it becomes very very bizarre and that's just closing your eyes on a plane inside the tank it can really like it almost like opens up another realm of experience kids very strange because in the absence of light this all the stuff flying through your brain sort of manifest itself as visual information yeah you don't just get the feeling like oh well I've slept it away you yeah you get that feeling when your eyes are open but everything looks normal you know everything looks a little faker and everything looks kind of two-dimensional a little closer that it should be but it still looks normal but when you close your eyes then you get the fucking collar show yes madness and craziness in front of you yeah I've had absolute freak out oh my god blowing my mind experiences eating it yeah you just have to eat it there was how much do you admit what's the most you've like consumed like well this I was gonna say there was a friend who made pills he made THC pills and I forget how he did it forget what his process was of extracting the THC and putting into pill form but he told us like very specifically only take one he said do not take more than one I only took one I listened any Bravo took two there's Eddie Bravo was one of those silly bitches like him I can't even get too high it's impossible how to high you could and it was unbelievably strong just one I was like where is this do traveling every day yeah this dude is going to car raising town every day and that's something that a lot of people are overlooking about this whole medical marijuana movement everyone's focusing on smoking pot we don't want people smoking pot you know the eating pot is five times stronger five times more psychoactive when you heat it and you're getting guys just loading up these cookies loading up these candies and you can eat three or four of them before you even know what the fuck's going on and then an hour and 20 minutes later you're on your deathbed yeah I mean you're freaking the fuck out like Yoshi yeah like you see like the Nana bread Joey Diaz actually had a funny story from a long time ago when Listerine strips first came out for a pot Listerine strips and they used to have like little containers just like them in it and he had a whole one and his friends I can I have one and he takes it out and they had all melted together and there were like nine strips melted together enjoyed is like I guess that's it you know and then they gave it to mine and I guess the guy called like the ambulance like it was just like ten times the amount of this other strong dude I I do per stroke I used to take one half of those breast trips it's really hard to find them now yeah they don't have them anymore but I used to take one half of one and that's all it took one half of one you gave me that one time oh Jesus oh my gosh Jesus Christ that was when we were headed to the East Coast yeah we were on a red-eye yeah and I remember we both landed you like that is the highest of everybody in my life I go right there on that plane go right there on that plane yeah like what was that like it was down what you go that was an adventure yeah it was and I also remember that I was by no means not high anymore when I said that and I felt like like 11 hours later I was like still kind of feeling it right now like yeah dude that should kick my ass that was unbelievable art 'add after that I realized that like for me to not have that feeling a quarter of a strip was was better you know I mean like I could function on a quarter yeah I'm not on the half man yeah mom I don't like eating anywhere I had one the other day and I didn't think I felt it the whole night like I took around eight o'clock around 11 or 12 I was like all right I guess that was just a shitty edible then I couldn't go to bed and it started like my hearts are going crazy like alright now it's starting right now it's like 1:00 in the morning how long did it take to kick in four or five hours on you gotta go to the doctor you got some blockage somewhere son that doesn't even make sense for five hours yeah that doesn't make sense you just defied logic you defied science you broke medicine yeah I couldn't go to sleep though for like hours oh yeah maybe just took you a while to realize you were high or you like caffeined up maybe I was having a hard time getting in there yeah I think I must have had too much other food in my stomach maybe and just took a lot of digested or that's another possibility if you ate something heavy right if that's behind it does that happen is it worth that I think so totally right yeah would you yeah I was like busy your body has to take it down and doesn't get to it we're totally unscientific refers to an understanding of the digestive system you know I'm saying the juices break it down the brain juices ooh yeah I don't think we're right about that but yeah the I think if anybody should be concerned about experiences it's the eating it because I don't want anybody to have bad trips man yeah it's no bad trips steer people away from weed and you don't get anything out of those bad edible trips either cuz you they usually come when you don't expect them like they come when you're trying to go to a movie have a pot cookie with your friends go to a movie and giggle and the pot cook we look though and everybody just wants to go home you just got to get out of there everybody wants to leave panic is never a good time and that's what it is it's you are in like you have super anxiety going at least I do and that's not like that's not fun man you don't go that was really cool the way I panicked for my life for a few hours you know just from sitting there when I was in full panic mode okay from taking this one one pill when Eddie Bravo had taken two I was in full panic when I was talking to this dude and the dude I was talking to was a very high level jujitsu guy who also apparently was a rapist and while I was talking to him I'm so high I mean I'm just I'm so I really shouldn't be talking anybody but while I'm talking this guy I'm like man this guy is a fucking killer like he's got this just feel about him like he feels super dangerous yeah you know he's a like a really high-level jujitsu guy but he also feels like wow like if you were alone in the woods with this guy you know and you'd gone off for a few days without food he might fucking eat you and then later after that had happened he turned out that he was a rapist he got arrested but he didn't it didn't get arrested by the way he fleed and the way they caught him was he started doing jujitsu again he couldn't stop doing jujitsu and start doing jiu-jitsu at a new gym and he didn't realize how obvious it is that he's like a super high-level guy there's not that many high-level guys you know when you get I mean there are quite a few but I mean it you know maybe there's hundreds but the people in the jiu-jitsu world are pretty much aware of a guy that's that high level yeah and this guy was just tapping everybody including their best black belts and everybody's like okay what pleases dude who is this dude and he says he's from Brazil and so someone got a picture of him or something and they went oh my god that's a guy he's wanted for rape he couldn't he couldn't go on the lam and not do jiu-jitsu that's incredible it's amazing yeah I mean maybe they would have got him anyway yeah I don't know I mean that's two things I gotta have is jiu-jitsu and raping people grape juice I gotta be able to do both of those things to be a happy guy yeah he gave off this weird dangerous energy you know especially when you're that cranked out on the wrong side of the pot rainbow yeah you know it's just I was in the never world I was in the world of fairies and elves and dwarves and monsters and Dragons in the night well that's the things if you're having that type of experience a trip yeah you've eaten too much and you happen to be in a not cool environment like in an already dangerous situation oh my god yeah yes somebody get us home please God get us home right now get us out of here yeah yeah there's bad spots in the world imagine eating a pot cookie and going to Karachi oh the middle of Pakistan watching people pull up with mopeds and gun people down you see that on Vice the dangerous border Wow yeah fantastic amazing what an amazing amazing access we had Shane in here he was telling us about Karachi and how insane it is that looks insane yeah like millions of people all in this one giant city this is 20 million there something Craig's a lot of people and crimes just running amok he says they hate their neighbors so much and they're hated so much did so crazy he the way he described it to me he's like it literally is like the scariest place on earth like you can't believe it exists it's like the apocalypse in a city and it's it's there right now and nobody's talking about it yeah nobody no one even thinks about it when you talk about dangerous places people talk about like Detroit liked Detroit is not nearly as dangerous as Karachi have you had Kumail on have you ever had him on the show Ismail done Gianni no who's that he's a comic from Pakistan from from Karachi oh really yeah whoa yeah he's really good comic like where's he from like this in America does he live in LA he lives in LA okay she came over when he was 19 how do you say his name again Kumail Kumail Nanjiani Nanjiani yeah he's a really really good comic I like really good we had him on of my mom's casts a long time ago a long time ago I mean he's very successful like he does very well I mean yeah I mean he just did an hour special he's on he's acting in like all kinds like he does really well and he's like he's a super really like the thing that I was obsessed with when I had him on was that he didn't like he grew up there and he didn't uh he didn't like watch stand-up growing up and he came into college at 19 and he's so good at it that I'm like yep I don't understand how you're good at it because like how is your sense of humor developed you started at like basically 19 like being exposed to this at all right and he's like exceptionally good at it so you you see like he just has such a command of doing stand-up like everything like really insightful smart really really good writer performer it's so funny and I just fascinated at his whole background his whole story yeah that is interesting because there are cultures that do not have stand-up comedy right I mean yeah he definitely didn't have it they all have some sort of public gathering yeah or someone gets to talk but for entertainment I mean how many places have it's just breaking out in some parts of the world now like I know in a lot of spanish-speaking countries you know there are clubs now and you know a stand-up show even for television but it's not they don't have the like basically 80 hundred year history of that we have right are they coming like from the Catskills and it being like a thing that has different genres you know I mean it's it's it's newer in Bo's invented here it's totally advanced here but there's a lot of confusion or a lot of questionings as far as who invented it I mean who the fuck invented it is there anyone who is like known as the godfather of stand-up that's a good that's a good question because stand-up sort of became stand-up with Lenny Bruce yes before that it was like a lot of guys that would share jokes and they would they would like do the same sketch for 20 years and you know they they would go performing the Catskills yeah and they would all steal each other's material and shed they were like people in show business almost like you would think of a contract studio person from like the 1940s and 50s you know you think of those people that have contracts with the studio and did all those studio movies well these guys kind of where that they were like it was a different kind of comedy and then Lenny Bruce came along and all of a sudden he starts talking about real shit yeah and all the sudden starts like you know like breaking down our use of language and why do we have to say this and who's talking about real scenarios in a home and and like whoa like that was the earth yeah you know yeah like if you go over my house there's all these Lenny Bruce posters everywhere it's not like I listen to Lenny Bruce a lot I mean I certainly have it's not like it even holds up to this day because it really doesn't it's really hard to laugh at Lenny Bruce's stuff it's hard to put yourself into that mindset of the people that live during the 1950's and 1960's if you could if you could go back in time and you would be bolon away I'm sure of it I'm sure his point of view was probably so incredibly unique at the time and his insight you know his jokes some of his jokes today are great jokes he had his joke about homosexuality being illegal so what they do is they arrest you and they put you in jail with a bunch of men want to have sex with you yeah you know it was it's a good joke yeah I mean it's it's it's funny in 2013 and he probably told that in the 50s it's crazy what people were like what it never hurt anything well fuck did he just say yeah yeah I mean Lenny Bruce went to jail for it he went to jail for using bad words like people don't understand that that is in this past century people have been locked into cages for saying naughty words not even threatening not like saying I'm gonna blow up this plane yeah not you know words like that but a word like fuck or word like shit or tits or something like that the document you're going to jail now they drained his money ruined his career Jesus yeah that in the smack house the other thing we need to learn from guy like money don't stay away from the smack my friend miss Mack it seems like nobody gets through this Mack okay nobody does there's no recovery from that I had a buddy who had a hard time kicking it he in a pill form he hurt his back and the doctors immediately of course gave him heroin that's what the oxycontin says he mocks cotton and he was like dude he goes it was it was magical he goes a cured cured all the pain he goes I didn't it wasn't even that fucked up when he was on he was he goes I was just he goes it just stopped the pain you know but then coming off of it he had to take some other drug it's my friend Tommy jr. if he's listening right now prophet Tommy jr. and the they just give them to you man when you get hurt like I know guys who were junkies yeah I went to the doctor and you know they give him pain medication and you know that's dangerous trip like you're getting high like mark mark it down cuz here comes you know do you like being sober you like keeping your shit together don't take that that's no bueno you know and take that pill to the pain kills with a beer yeah oh it's that's a oh my god other ballgame most people do yeah it's like super common yeah of course but not supposed to right right that's good isn't sanics a really bad one to take with alcohol yeah I saw a lady do it on a plane but she was laughing about it yeah she's like you didn't honey you know just a glass of my want glass of wine and my xanax and I'm good to go and she was like laughing ha ha just put some fucking goggles on fuck it later all right yeah I'm rule it on the chair she had she was letting everybody know she's abusing drugs yeah she didn't - but if I let them know if I said listen I took a pot cookie an hour before this flight oh I'm out of my fucking head right go back to the gate guys yeah we're gonna turn this thing around land it in the desert get this fucking creme on stir off of our plane you asshole what were you thinking about thinking about fingering girls in high school what was that all about you having that flashback yeah well let it the excitement the first time we touched a moist vagina like holy shit I'm in them and they're and girls that would grab me dick and some girls wouldn't you have those girls that like everyone would pass around like during movies like when they had the projectors out and they makes you bet Oh some girls yeah through some girls that would just let dudes finger him yeah you know ellaby that's this obsession you need your pussy things to balance this universe you know and it's not necessarily a good thing that those girls are so needy that they're doing that but there's a cause and effect and it's not her fault you know that's what people have to realize whenever girls do like really overreaching things to get attention it's because they didn't get enough attention you know it's really that simple or they got the wrong kind of attention right they got fucked up and it's not their fault man you know and that's that's something it takes a long time to figure out you don't realize that for a while man I mean people just sort of judge people by what they see and that's one of the more interesting things about having children is you start judging people by how they became that thing how did you get to be this this angry like really like deceptive you know shitty selfish person who's ruining lives and stealing from people and how does a person get to be a murderer has a person get to be a robber breaks into people's houses when you know they're not going to be around and how do you get to be that person well some a bunch of shit has to go wrong you know there's a bunch of people have to fail you you know you start off nothing but potential that's what a person is yeah nothing but potential and that is the number one thing that we don't pay attention to and it's the number one thing that's fucking up this world is that people are raised by people that don't have any idea how to raise the most complex thing ever a developing human beings the most complex thing we know of it's a thing that literally can create an atomic bomb that can blow up the fucking world that's how that's how powerful the human mind is and you're leaving it to assholes you're leaving it to a bunch of people that have no idea how to raise a person correctly and weren't raised correctly themselves so I have all sorts of baggage that they're carrying into this this relationship between mother and daughter and father and son and you know most people have no idea how the fuck they got into the place they're at right now they live their life on momentum you know and raising a human when you're stuck on momentum and screaming the people at traffic and calling your wife a cunt and you know kicking your dog and now you got a baby okay this guy has a baby all right now what happens now this baby's fucked and he's being raised by a shithead and that's most of what's going on in the world which is most of the problems is a lack of compassion and a lack of compassion from birth to adulthood and and it's so common and it's not being addressed nobody talks about it everybody wants to talk about oil everybody wants about Oh what are we doing run out of oil what will we do when peak oil becomes a problem in this country when will we step up and learn but nobody looks at the number one commodity that humans have to offer that's humans our best commodity is humans and the more potential that you can have in that commodity the more the better the world would be for everybody but the problem is that the people that have billions of dollars are a bunch of cunts and they want to hold onto that money with their greasy old moisturizing cream fucking leather hands because they've had it their whole life and they've been in this position of privilege and they understand what it takes to make 16 billion dollars you know how many people I had a payoff you know honey lobbyists I had a bribe you know that I earned this fucking boat you know yeah but that's the the extreme form of you know the the wrong parts of the competitive aspects of capitalism do you see did you see Queen oversee no what is that oh my god what is it documentary it's so fucking you're not the first person to say it what is it about it's about the guy who he started it's the world's biggest time shareholder company on the west gate I think it's called or it was called something like that things westgate anyways a few years ago he went about building the large home in the United States it was 90 thousand square feet I think okay 90,000 square feet and it was modeled after Versailles the palace and France and he just so happened to be doing this and a documentary crew was filming him the you know for this purpose and it happened in a 8 when the market crashed they had a lion they this the oh my god it's for their own I'm 43 year olds his mother of eight I look she was the most beautiful girl in the world it took me a while to fall in love with him well we have a great relationship there's 30 years between us but he doesn't need viagra at least there is that option if he does like I don't have 10 years from now we never thought out to build the biggest house in America it just kind of happened it's bigger than the White House two tennis courts dirty actors full-size baseball field and kitchen antique furniture Andy that was graphene oh my god no this at my room that's my closet you know what nothing's really normal about this life we ran in line to do a billion dollars in sales for the year we're on top of the world and it came to a screeching halt the market fell over 700 points I would say it's touch-and-go right now we don't talk about financial problems I guess I'll have to watch the movie to find out what's going on to my life where everything changes this is almost like a riches-to-rags story she knows we need to cut back but she's still compulsive all they could afford a watch I would tell you - I like cultures are seeing oblem is Vegas our lenders have made it very clear that you'll have more money than he knows what to do with you can go back to building this house if he turns over this building over my dead body you can buy the palace that timeshare mogul David Siegel already wants to sell just think of the bright side you might not have to clean this house the American Dream is raising way up above what you started well and that is what she has done when you're down is when he found out who your true friends are you get strength from your marriage [Music] no I'm in this fantasy world you know it's nominally hit oh my god she is completely oblivious to how she like she comes off well when they start having to make cutbacks yeah their cutbacks are things like we're not flying private we're flying you know commercial and like she picks up like one of her kids they land and that she picks up her kid at the airport she's like what's that what do you think of flying commercial was that crazy and the kids like I don't even know you're talking about like we're just planes right she's like yeah commercial or they go to rent a car to visit her friend at the airport and they're like it hurts and then she's like so will the driver like meet me out front or how does this work he's like this is Hertz rent-a-car she's like what is that like there's no driver and he's like no you're the driver you're renting a car right now she's like okay I just I don't know all right whoa like that that it's pretty removed from society where she's she's living in such a fantasy world how much money the homeboy lose I mean nine figures for sure for sure well yeah but he's been that's like a hundred million dollars yeah so over a hundred million for sure of a person's lap and think about that denying figure yeah yeah yeah he lost a substantial amount of money oh my god and then you know because the property's basically basically what happened was his business is a luxury business but it's luxury for the middle class so timeshares or something where it's like if you you have a good job like you you know you can more than pay your bills you can afford to do something like let's go to Disney World this year let's go to Vegas but they sell you on well you can afford to do this and it's people who have that you know extra money some disposable income but not like so what is wealthy and what does it mean when you have a time shows I mean like you have this month and I have that much it's exactly like that it's like you get to come to this awesome timeshare whichever let's say you like Vegas near the timeshare in Vegas and two weeks out of every year maybe you get to pick your month if you pay more or sometime during the year LeSabre July you get your Vegas place it's yours and it's fully furnished and it's awesome but other people have the keys to it yes yes so it's not who are the other people though people who like you signed up for the service and not like your friends no pick it no it's total strangers see ya know what but there is a property whoops there's a property manager that's on site yes not just some stickers for you oh you have to go through him oh you know you're basically so no tell them it is you're paying to go back to the same place and be like this is my shit but right now it's not but it's gnarly and I don't keep a TV there and ya keep stereo no I mean it's probably I'm sure furnished with all that stuff yeah but what happened was probably for a lot of people more comfortable than going on a hotel definitely and probably better like if you can eat my families do it all that's the thing is that go to a supermarket shop like you're at home and you can get a way higher end place than you would like if you were renting the equivalent at a hotel right you're not going to get like a three bedroom suite like you're going to get at your timeshare you're right right but how much chef to pay a year I don't know it's not that much uh it's probably it's like the one I went to because actually got suckered in doing one of those like you have a timeshare know what when I was 18 my stupid roommate he was like hey I want a vacation and I'm like oh so Brian and then and instead we went to Florida he's like what we have to do is find a way to Florida and then we have five days in the Bahamas and a microphone yeah so we get there and we had to like fly like spend her own money to fly to Florida or we could've drove there and we get there and then like the first day we checked in to this like hotel it was all paid for I was like this is sweet he was like alright well we got to go to this condo thing we have to just do this little thing for a couple seminar seminar oh and he didn't tell him he totally did not tell me that we had to do this every day like for our day yeah except for like the last two days how many days were you there for I think five days and so so every day they just went to a new level trying to and every day I would say the same thing I'm like I'm 18 I was like do you really think I could do this I Howard how'd you even get me here okay what were they saying to you they would show us the condos which they were all amazing but they would walk us around and then like the next day would go to a different part of at the time it was Florida at least is what happened is like the last two days was in Bahamas he didn't tell me that either he's just like five days and Bahamas but what was in Pompano Florida the whole time she just went to all these different like hota these condo places in Pompano and they were like and this is this so-and-so place and you know I know that was in the Bahamas not the first three days the last two days and yeah I you to the Bahamas date-date you take a boat cruise thing over to the Bahamas does it take like three hours not you know the Bahamas on a boat in three hours yeah I think so yeah and so then but what sucked is like every day they tried to get you to sign this contract and it was like fucking like hardcore like they were like no you need to sit down here and talk it you know I'm like look I'd really yes young guys who were the guys who tried though these were older older gonna cool you know like what were they saying to you they were like do you understand you're at the perfect age and I'm sure your credit you know this would be a good investment in your life because you can like you know rent this out subrin it out and you always this really cool place you know in the pomp notes or whatever also telling you like if you don't use it for the weeks that you get it you could rent you can rent it out to other cable and I can profit from it so yes Lee it's gonna cost you this but you could rent it right exactly and I want it I want to say it was probably something like you paid once like a huge chunk of money like I want to say it was like something ridiculous like ten thousand dollars and then every year you pay like a maintenance fee or something like that that's like $200 I want to say it's something like that so it's a top-heavy sort of thing yeah definitely top-heavy and they were like always they were saying like look we have the best financial solutions we have these are we are friends with the people at the bank we will get you you know the best rate that we can get you for 20 years you know to divide that 10,000 out to probably thirty thousand after finance charges you know it's a scam right it's uh it's it's it's kind of a bit of I mean it's a it's one of those scams it's been around for a long time though the high-pressure marketing scam you know it's like a legit scam like you're allowed to do that you're allowed to do but that that kind of like high-pressure shit if you're like socially awkward or weird you could really crack people with that you know I was just getting really pissed and the other thing they don't you we had to pay for all the tax of all the hotels that we stay that so at the end of they were like all right you a $800 in taxes so I ended up having to pay like back then like Ohio days $800 both had to pay $400 or something like that this was out of money it load of money that drained my bank account and then like I only had $300 so that my room my roommate gave me the extra hundred and then I never paid him back because I was like look dude that was bullshit I'm sorry that you did not tell me any of this he said we had a free vacation I'm sorry but I didn't you made me spend it extra you know blah blah amount of money yeah and so we did we stopped talking ever since then we became enemies for a long time and then just because over $100 is it funny how something like that had or wrong you can just decide that that person should enemy great well this is locked me out of a hundred bucks bullshit man it was like it's definitely bullshit not a vacation well you know it's also it would they would probably have to pay you a lot of money to make you sit there and listen to those people right and in the end what you did spend you probably could have done almost the same thing right with your 400 bucks or you know or whatever the hell it would have caught let me how much can you go to like on the cheap to the Bahamas for and stay in the cheapest place possible I bet you we ended up spending more money by monopoly to impossible if you both got a two-bedroom in the hotels were just like that was one thing it said like it's three and a half or above a hotel uh-huh it was like very borderline it was like courtyard at the Marriott you know what I mean that's one thing about like I think it happens to the older you get to is like I will not compromise on certain shit like certain I got a paper well like just certain like like like hey man you want to go see this shit and backpack with like eight people but we'll see something awesome like nom and I don't want to do that like if I I'm not saying I have to have four seasons that like and I can't you know afford to do that and I'm not like I'm basically not going to take a trip if I can't do it at least at a level that I'm comfortable with you know so one man I agree with you most of most of the time but I you know I went on that show meat eater and yeah camping for five nights in the Missouri Breaks but that's a trip usery River but we want to do that that you want that experience I'm saying I'm not saying like if that experience were presented to me I would consider that for what it is right but I'm not like I met a dude who was like yeah been to the Bahamas I went on a mail boat like this bringing mail over and like slept with like like basically the mail carrier like them and the letters and I was like not you know what the problem wasn't that the problem with that is though I I'm the same way but I'm kind of grumpy I'm getting the older I get it but you know I went on this trip to Joshua Tree we we stayed in this like little RV and I was so against I'm like look you know I want to go Josh retreat but I want to stay in some shitty RV in the middle of some campground like what can we just stay tonight and I was being a bitch about the whole thing until we got there and then ended up being the coolest adventure ever like I would never have done it but like or like I I didn't like this girl I know wants me to go camping with her and I'm like doing the same thing where I know if I go I might have a great fucking time you probably were great yeah I've just been grump that's again like a specific experience I think though too you know I mean like it's like it has the group qua like the croup in mind going into it is going something like that if you go if somebody goes hey man you want to go to Paris right now and you're like okay and they're like now we're gonna stay at this place well you won't have your own room or bathroom but if you get the key from the front desk I'd be like you know I'll wait on Paris for a little while yeah I can you know stay in my own room or something you know I mean yeah like I'm that I don't want to exactly then the lack of sleep you're gonna get sleeping I do because you know it's snoring and you know your snoring is gonna wake you up it's gonna be a goddamn disaster last time I slept with a dude it's my friend Gary it was coming to he's got that little ringtone last time I slept with a dude we're dudes it last time I slept with a dude um he he came to stay with me and he he didn't have enough money for a hotel he was out here doing like some shit from New York he's a comic as well you know Gary Valentine okay okay we're down time yeah yeah Kevin's brother um and this motherfucker I never heard anybody snore like this yeah it's crazy it's crazy right it was crazy look in the middle that I had a gap oh go are you fucking kidding me this is when we were kids we were both like in our early 20s just like in the early 90s a couple years ago I stayed at the the West Palm Beach had as a condo uh-huh and I was down there and my buddy Chuck came to town Chuck's 6/5 like 290 big big dude and he was like yo like can I crash the condos a has like a you know whatever a bedroom and living room oh I was like yeah he goes lays in the bed and like before I even can sit down I hear him uh like not just snoring but he also grinds his teeth oh my god and it sounded like a monster was doing it because he's like such an enormous person I laid on the couch in that condo with my noise-canceling headphones uh a son like a shirt over my eyes like block it out and a mouth guard in my mouth so that I eat it sure and he came out he was like what the fuck are you doing like look like you man you came to visit and now you've ruined my night that's what happened like that yeah snoring is grow my god grinding things the worst that's just it's very sounded yeah ah why do people do that they said stress or what no I'm a clincher like the dentist said like no that's actually okay you clinch that's why you're really strong many of my teeth are cracked and weight lifting what yeah really lifts are fucking ha you teeth are cracked from there you miss me I know some serious weight man I'm a very strong person yeah my man but yeah he told me where I mouthguard when I lift weights no shit yeah it's probably do you like squat tears are hitting the bag as well yeah I don't hit the bag with a mouthpiece on when you when you bite down you know when you're really digging into something you actually lose a lot of power if you don't bite down it's really strange I don't understand it I don't really with it yeah yeah it doesn't seem like you can hit as hard when your mouth is open it's like your whole body needs time it needs to work together you know and as you explode out on impact and when your mouth is open a little I think there's a lack of of power that's kind of strange but it's very difficult to get full amount of power and explosive energy when you have your mouth open they actually did like tests on it and I think it was the basis of one of those mouth guards they had they have like this power guard where they proved that like if you bit down on it it actually increased the amount of weight you could lift really yeah yeah like they aligned your jaw in a certain way that increase the amount of power that your your body hand I don't understand that I don't know why that would be the case but for some reason you can't hit as hard when your mouths open that's really interesting I know like you know breathing can affect like how you like yeah like holding your breath versus breathing related to a lot of physical things yeah it makes a huge difference huge difference yeah and being able to sustain like a an in and out you know breath versus like holding your breath it is one of the biggest issues in jiu-jitsu is breathing learning how to breathe right and that's why the really the best guys are all really into yoga and pranayama and learning breathing techniques and stuff like that because if you can control your breath and your your diaphragm is a muscle that you can control much like you can control with your arms or your legs yeah and there's certain guys like this is dude Hicks and Gracie's like the greatest jujitsu guy ever and he does all this crazy yoga shit with his stomach where he sucks his stomach in it's really freaky to watch man but the guy has like absolute control of his breathing it's incredible and because of that I mean not just because of that because he's also incredibly talented just he has a wealth of knowledge of jiu-jitsu he just he's a master is a true master and on top of that he's also a yogi yeah not that breathing shit is like it's super important coordinating your breath with striking as well not just with jiu-jitsu when you kick the bag when you kick a person when you breathe out as you as you strike yeah you know and that's why and a lot of like the karate and even in muy Thai they they they like not like the same thing they Kia like they yell out when they want to hit things yeah you know and Thai guys do that a lot in training like you hear my god yeah you know and like in when you go to see Thai fights they yell out like the audience you know the trainer's yell oh oh oh they yell out you know and um it's like you know like you're tightening up as you're delivering the shot yeah and also to protect you a little bit if you get hit yourself I know a lot of the like the heavy benchpress guys yeah what they're trying to rap out on heavyweight it's always a one in and one out yeah supposed to go like take one breath in and push it out with one breath you know yeah and that's how they try to do like 225 like thirty fucking times that shit is like all you know it's better than going you hold your breath and you're totally fucks up the rhythm of it you know what's crazy to do what's really hard to do that I enjoy doing a joy it as an exercise is a minute in a minute out really yeah I take a one-minute breath in a slow one minute breath in I can then a slow one minute breath out and it's very hard to not freak out and just talk in the middle of it it's very hard I did like thirty seconds but I did a lot I do it in the tank that's how I start my tank sessions I start my tank sessions by completely controlling he always been a my breathing no no I had a build-up to okay your buddy uh was it Danny yeah powerful Denny yeah powerful Denny he he said he does yoga like every mole yeah Denny's a bad motherfucker yeah he's a world champion yet he's been I've known Denny since he was a young kid he's a great guy he's awesome Denny Pro pocos he's he runs 10th planet jiu-jitsu in San Francisco he's you know he's a young man but he's also master he's race developing master you know as he's getting better but he's uh he's really into yoga right now yoga and meditation and he had a few back issues and he actually gave me some pointers and because uh you know I had some I had a bulging disc in my back that's actually been getting better but yeah Denny went through some back issues himself and he did like a very strict regimen of yoga and like like it was like a type of tension it's like a spinal decompression it's like literally like pulling your neck well cord and he did this like very disciplined over a course of like five or six weeks or something like that fixed his issue Denny has that quality too you know we were talking about how you can sense bad energy and last dangerous denny to me has um like just being around a few moments you sense like a type of balance okay I get the feeling it from him that I do from a lot of people who are very disciplined yeah there's a certain intensity to them but there's also like a certain amount like you you can feel like they're control at work like there's such discipline characters a lot of times like really good athletes there's that like energy that they bring into a room you know like I know these like these guys that do like triathlons and stuff to have this like it's like a quiet intensity to the Ryan well like you you meet them and you can feel their presence like there's their discipline comes through just in their when they speak to you yeah absolutely they're the best type of people to be around yeah best type of people to be around good in fact control the apps inspirational influence I agree you know I agree and Denny then he's definitely inspirational he's I loved him I love the fact that I've seen him as a young man so I met him when he's young I think was like 17 or 18 and he was always a cool kid I mean back then he was great but to see him evolve and develop and become the man he is now I love seeing that man I love seeing people progress yeah love seeing people get it together you know like I was telling Tony Hinchcliffe the other day I had him on the pod class and I was like I love the fact that in the time I've known you you became a really good comedian sure you know I love that I love that I didn't know a guy he started out and then I meet him a couple years later he's a great comedian oh this we got one right there it's pretty awesome it's fucking amazing he's great I love Tony man that guy Larry is so funny he's a total natural yeah and like he the best comics are the ones that can't even help themselves like yeah if a joke is in the room to be said he just jumps he dives on it like a fucking grenade yeah absolutely I love that feeling with comics yeah I love the and I love seeing like I have so many friends who I started out with who I'm like proud of just watching them as my friends ya know like salute I was where I brought you bet Matt fuller on I brought ya I love that dude I mean he can't help himself either what oh you're in there what a great personality that guy Matt was nice is the best fun and he's a when you're around on my he's off he's like I got a legit smile and all sudden you're smiling and everybody's he's a great guy there's certain guys like that like we only talked like a little bit but I could tell if he's okay he's awesome he's awesome and um you know he had the week off and I asked him to come with to do the show today yeah Thursday Saturday and Sunday and he fucking like brought the house down every set it was all really yeah yeah I would imagine he'd be really funny yeah yeah anybody that came to the shows Friday night and all the weekend thank you very much you guys were awesome San Jose was the shit that was the shit Northern California might be the best place on earth it's awesome it really might be I mean the weather's not the best it's not the best but as far as like human beings as far as intelligence like vibing with human beings I think I've I better with Northern California people than anybody on the planet really I really do I have some friends that live up there and whenever hang with them I always like goddamn it why don't I live in Northern California it's awesome it's better yeah is it you know the weather sucks a fat dick though unless you know that's only a negative if you don't enjoy sucking subjects yeah but if you enjoy sucking fat dicks I'm just talking from my own personal perspective no I'm not trying to be sexist nor homophobe some of them are too big to really get in your mouth right especially was like a diamond dick or yeah giant warthog only wants a mouth fuck you yeah that's not beyond the realm of possibility I watched a chimp fuck a frog you know I watch the chimp fuck a frog's face um no as a video of it this is a video of it online have you seen it poke see if you pull it up James I have seen uh pornos where I see the girl really struggled to get a guy's soft dick into her mouth and like yeah thats a big dick right there yeah she's really struggling with his limp that she's left her mouth is all dry wow that's really fucking stretched under all that math is tough to generate saliva gang at yeah they have a dry blowjob right that take too long dry blowjobs take too long that's uh we've had to say this chimp rapes a frog it makes this frog suck them off so because we know this exists because we know that this chimp takes this frog and picks it up and puts it on his little chimp cock and fucks it because we know that exist I don't think it's that preposterous to propose that in an alternate world there could be a giant boar that makes you suck his cock Wow all he wants to do is hold a personality's rape in that mouth right now fucks it yeah yeah fuck that's nyquist boy look at them and by the way this is not the only time this has happened there's another video of a chimp fucking a frog apparently when ships get frogs they fuck them guys beating off using that frog I mean this this is some shit we never saw a mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom yeah they would edited this out we need the internet to give us this information mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom would have you believe that chimps are cute friends to be taken with on rides in in semis on sitcoms this this is what they are chimp is busted I respect this murderous frog raber's to be fair I bet it does feel pretty decent probably feels oh I feel better about your own impulsive like nature when you see that yeah I would try snake they're like the cut off the head the snake not a bad idea but the whole you eat a whole frogs have a nice big hole you know if you can keep him from clamping down on your cock and balls and I think that maybe chimps probably have a much more leathery cock skin than done I think that was the whole idea in the beginning you know we had more leathery cock skin and then that's why the head retracted you have the sensitive tip and that's what makes you shoot but the average cock back in the day was probably a lot tougher than the cocks of today what is fucking dicks today they can't take branches snap it into him or rub it up against gravel where you fucking try to climb up the rocks at the beach no these cocks are today are weak yeah cuz you would you'd funk your wood fuck which it winches and you wouldn't wash it off you're just letting you know that winch is that what they used to become winch not a winch lynches don't fuck a winch a winch is the thing you put on the back of a truck to pull a log out of a ditch that's a winch a wench wench is I think because I got in trouble for saying winches on fear factor why don't we lack ones he likes I was trying to motivate a girl and she was on an all girls Fear Factor and there was these other girls that were saying don't do it don't do it they'll eat up because she she was scared and so they were trying to make her more scared and I said hey I go listen listen to me don't listen those catty wenches Wow so what like what would a winch be today like a hoe yes apparently they what they said what the what the reason why I got in trouble is because apparently a wench is like a prostitute I mean we're talking medieval time folks okay is it really is that what it really means that's doesn't it mean what what it means the cultural context and the cultural context where I grew up in Boston a wench was a chick like I his fucking wench it's like she was kind of a bitch she was like a little bitch you know winch isn't and so a caddy wench would not be a prostitute it would be a chick that talks too fucking much and is trying to damage a young lady's confidence in completing a challenge for $50,000 wench caddy wench but people get all upset they got or they got all upset and this was back in the day and this is a fear factor like season two or something like that it's not like today if you said anything like that today you'd probably get arrested you know somebody tweeted like that Ari said on his recent podcast punch-drunk that he doesn't believe half the stories I say half the stories you see yeah and I'm like how why would I wait make no how would I make that shit up that it's it's me merely because you're a little awkward right a little but yeah and you've been known to tell a story a bit on the exaggerating side to make it more exciting maybe occasionally but it doesn't mean that didn't but you're not real you're not a liar I I really think I just need to follow me around to these massage parlors and stuff yeah believe me yeah you also live an extraordinary life sexually that I'm sure he's not really able to deal with I hate that because he knew you back in the day when you were kind of a zero and I just hate that you're a hero I hate that shit I can't win what you know it's stuff like that though like what hey well if you really don't believe my stories once you ask me here's me really here's really what I think why care why was heat why does he care why do you care why does everybody you guys are friends what is that about you know it's about it's a distracting amount it's it's an energy distraction it's not something to focus on for him or for you he shouldn't have focus on it you shouldn't focus on it you know it's like there's a and sometimes it's that you're on a podcast and you're ranting and he wants to keep it real and that's really what he thinks you know there's that too but it's unnecessary it's it's you when when you do that especially like with a friend you put out like a certain amount of energy you put out a certain thing you know you put it out there and then okay well then that has to be like responded to it like it's being responded to now right and he probably didn't even think about that when he did it but if he just said it or if he just thought it and then didn't say it he'd be way better off or if he wanted to talk to you about it just say hey man I just want to tell you sometimes you tell stories and I think they're fucking theirs then I don't trust them right so and then I would say what story Ari yeah but you know you do tell a squirrely story on occasion tell me one I can't remember I can have people that were involved in the story okay well that's even more ridiculous cuz you're saying you've never exaggerated or told I don't like I would have to have an example you know I'm just in high school mom never did it like I'm saying like as an example I would probably be prone to saying something like uh yeah that girl was like fucking hot man she was like an L a ten you know when maybe she was like seven or eight nothing or something like that nothing well I get that slight exaggeration but it went someone tells me the truth Ari would tell me the truth I'd go what'd she look like you go hello sucks maybe right maybe right he wouldn't say oh she was a 10 - greatest piece of ass ever you know everybody appreciates that more than they appreciate exaggeration because exaggeration although I enjoy it like Joey Diaz style exaggeration is the greatest fucking thing on earth absolute I mean so in a way it's hypocritical so you don't enjoy exaggeration right it's just saying you know enjoy that but you know Joey also tells a very honest story as well with the crazy saturation said you know or for comedic effect I mean it's like part of the fun of it all but that's also part of like each of these people's nature yeah like Ari is a guy who he's not like I'm gonna add all this little spice story he doesn't like it when you do it either right and he's very specific yeah he doesn't want you to bullshit him cuz he's not a bullshitter but that's his own trip to you know his own trip is it he's very like focused and ambitious now and he doesn't want to hear any nonsense you know and and that's because he's on a great groove right now he doesn't want anything getting hijacked yeah well this is time hijacked with a fake story or someone giving him a fake impression of what happened another guy who you've witnessed may add a huge crazy leap dude we were with Ari when Ari was first starting yeah you know at the store I think when Ari came to the store I hate that I don't know this but I don't know if he start I think he started out his first sets in DC right uh-huh I don't know I think but then when he came over the DC improv right because I remember him I'm having a hard time for them um taking him seriously you say Baltimore I thought he was from Baltimore me no he's from it wise right it's close enough close but he's not fair involved now he's from Washington DC but um he's from Maryland I mean DC and Maryland I mean they like right next to each other yeah in Virginia is right there - anyway point being he came over here when he fairly new to comedy you know but he was a really smart dude he was always a smart dude we became friends like immediately he was a young kid hanging out at the The Comedy Store and you know I remember at first he was like you know everybody's weird around people that are already like successful when you're an amateur you like you can't believe you're allowed to even talk to them of course they get weird but then once you get past that weirdness you realize oh you know that's just Tommy Lawrence or Tommy Tommy Lawrence what's his name what's the fucking guys from in living color what the hell's a Tommy David David yeah yeah confusing with Joey Lawrence for some reason oh is the first time I saw Joey Lawrence it was like what were celebrities ever saw yeah and I was on the set of news radio and Joey Lawrence had a show right next to our show he's like he had his Mercedes there and he was like had his leg outside the car yeah and he's like singing along to his own song oh and I was like and I showed up it was like it was kind of starstruck was like holy shit this Joey Lawrence was Joey Lawrence like singing his own his own shit by his own car yeah so Tommy Davidson was another one I remember were first talking at Tommy Davidson at the Comedy Store Tommy Davidson was like hey man what's going on there like you know who the fuck I was I was nobody when I first came to the store I mean I might have been a paid regular but I might not even been a paid regular yet and then I realized Oh Tommy Davis is just a comic you know like we're all just comics sure and then I always tried to be the same way with guys young guys like young guys coming up I always tried to make sure I let them all know we're all just the same fucking thing just because that's Tim Ellen just because you see George Carlin over there he's a comic they're comics everybody's cool here yeah this is a cool environment yeah and Ari was like one of the first guys that I saw go from being like you know like an open-mike or to like a fucking legit headliner like a real headliner who comes up with an hour's worth of new shit every year it's pretty crazy he's a bad motherfucker yeah who's great your your your thing for your dog he was killing us both man yeah it was a crime fucking howling so important to have good comedy man without good comedy our life would not be nearly as interesting man wouldn't be is interesting to to perform because you'd be looking around and all this other stuff and you wouldn't be enjoying yourself yeah you know it wouldn't be interesting as interesting to watch of course your fucking clock is not right Brian Christ nothing meows but it's an hour behind you yes I'm the one looking at your clock I'm like why do I have a pee so bad yeah I haven't even been it's sitting here that long I'm gonna take a piss and don't let him talk about anything too silly when I'm gone okay okay hey no silliness all right uh so Tommy we should talk about your podcast you just you just uh already with some really silly okay hey um oh my god I got I got the silliest thing poop update May second I'm in Toronto and doing this show at the underground comedy club and then May 17th I'm in Portland at the fun house lounge and we added a second show at 10:30 how silly is that all right I'm gonna be am a third I'm gonna be in second you know it may 4th I'm going to be in Sacramento and may 5th and maybe a cobs in San Francisco and I'm bringing Sam Tripoli and Tony Hinchcliffe oh this is silly and you know what I was wondering because you've been doing some shows with your your your lovely wife christina pazsitzky is just giddy and how did that go DRD see a future of you guys doing on there that's a lot that's what we're doing the 17th and 18th has to be great we're doing Portland and Seattle problem together yeah man that's awesome yeah dude it's gonna be awesome see yeah this is silly conversation and your dog Theo is now bettered he was coming with us and are you really bright yes absolutely and um he is doing much better thanks again for doing the show man it was awesome view yeah that was really cool man actually I met somebody from a bunch of people from Cartoon Network because of that really yeah what do you mean they were at the show they were at the show and they they they were like oh you're great and I might go check out Cartoon Network Studios pretty soon and maybe possibly pitch an idea to her that's a good idea buddy me and Joey Diaz has cats maybe oh yeah um uh I got to talk to you about doing some shows I think you would find fun and entertaining what no dude I don't believe in rabbits the talk Dave rabbits a talk have been featured in many cartoons it's the stupidest shit but there was stuff you believed ducks but you don't believe a bit no that's silly rabbits don't talk the carrots actually I was really stoned and I was reading about Who Framed Roger Rabbit and how they edited out all these like the artists like you know there's a scene where Jessica Rabbit pops out of the taxi and you can see her vagina and there's a few other scenes where like a baby looks up a dress and there's drool coming out of it the baby's mouth what's that guys man I really Robert a Fleischer no the apples no no oh no no no the after that that's opposite doesn't care a bit yeah I'm talking about ya Bob no Haskins hostas Bob Hoskins yeah you're right Hoskins I so then I found out that the only version that you can find that part in the movies on a laserdisc version and there's only one version of that laserdisc and so I went on the eBay and bought it for four dollars you have a laser player I do it no higher haha you have to go back to Ohio to get it just I can see her vagina okay Bob where do you how do you buy a laser player cuz it's not like turntables they still turn too right no you can literally the ones that are out there are they once exist what's cool about the one I got is I got this really high tech like five disc changer slash laserdisc player and I was like this is like the best it's on clearance for some reason and then like two months later DVD came out I got goodbye isn't it kind of fucked up that the real sound people the sound freaks say that music played over a record sounds the best yes laser this is better than DVD but yet everyone went crazy long deep it away better is it better than blu-ray though no it's not better in blu-ray but what's a rocket there's no argument can suck unless you have a laptop made by Apple who can't work out a deal with Sony I feel so weak when I see a fucking PC user whip out as Bluetooth well or blu-ray what Lou to look at the blu-ray players are in the all the PC laptops a lot apiece there's no laptop where players no new Apple fanboy I'm just saying none of the laptops today have DVD players in them this because that's like blu-rays the only ones a donor Apple ones well their tactics actually taking them out of most laptops are days you take the mountain wait why would you take him out why would I take him out you take them out as though you said no no no no not an laptop and a pc laptops I'm not up on that but I did when I was at my friend the Google friend's house I did see the Google laptop with the Chrome operating system I got to play with that touchscreen touchscreen laptop yeah but it's all non-local everything's like stored in the cloud horrible idea well that's what supposedly the next Xbox is supposed to be where you don't buy games all your games are on a cloud so you can only play if you have an internet connection which drives me fucking crazy can you imagine sitting there going I just wanna play video games there's a storm I what the fuck right yeah that's that's ridiculous you should be able to play if you're camping if you're camping you set up a generator you shouldn't have to hook a fucking internet connection to it through yourself that's right yeah I mean you can't get away from the Xbox hat I'm such a second-generation guy for that - like I like people to buy that first one that needs all the work and come through in the second me Frank yeah I know you got everybody got everything I love your dedication to sing the Jessica Rabbit snatch one of the UM one of the episodes of this new show I'm doing is about computer simulation theory and one of the things I'm doing is I went down to a place that makes computer games like they actually do like 3d scanning and there they scan my face and they're gonna put me in like this fake game if it creative dude yt to this show this shows I'm getting to do so much cool shit most of it I can't talk about cuz I can't give away any secrets or anything any of the things that we found out but it's so much fun it's been really interesting because I'm getting to talk to all these like experts I get to talk to all these like interesting intelligent people and crazy people too you know it's been like a couple of months so far or a couple of weeks rather and in a couple weeks I've had so much fun I believe 100% in simulation theory it's getting worse and worse and worse why do you say that like last night I've been having problems with my website so I call up dream house who's my who serves it and it's like 5:00 in the morning this girl lives in California she works from her house and she's just helping me out not to get you freaked on about it's kind of funny sitter so I I was watching this movie Tim and Eric's billion dollar movie nobody got time for that huh nobody's got time for that and so in the movie they are in this mall and it's I always find like places that have closed down interesting like this whole mall is actually a real mall that's in Palm Springs and whatever so I'm like researching this mall while on hold you know to try to get to talk to this girl and I find out there was all these pictures of this big Marilyn Monroe statue where they took two parts of Marilyn Monroe and put it in front of this mall somehow it came up with Google search and I'm just looking at this crazy Marilyn Monroe thing and then so I'm talking to this girl and the next day today I noticed that she follows me on Twitter or somebody from dream house follows me on Twitter who's a girl and she like writes me she's like you got somebody on your side I'm helping you out right now I'm checking in that may try to help your website close her right so direct message so I go through her photos because I wanna see what she looks like one she's a pretty asian I'm like wow so you've started following her after shoes phone me right so I went through it on my pop she's a pretty asian girl like the fourth photo is her in front of that fucking Marilyn Monroe statue never seen in my whole entire life and now this girl that's helping me out this asian girl that's helping me out on dreamhost a little German you guys didn't trim therapy together in the next picture if you backed up one further you would see her finger yourself with the desk water oh yeah the whole time I hope so this whole time that she's actually won a hacked my computer have you seen the pictures of Ronda Rousey with a desk white t-shirt on yeah no it's a fucking coolest thing ever that's very cool seeing Ronda Rousey gives up champ the thumbs up the baddest chick on the planet yeah but by the way there's a lot of badass chicks on the planet there's a gang of a man there's some skillful women out there there's so many of them this new fight that they have the new one episode of The Ultimate Fighter with his girl cat Zingano and Ronda Rousey together looking at that's also happy to be wearing what she's so nice man she wants to come in the podcast again - it was gonna be on somewhere after the beginning of May we're gonna look how bad as she is she has a fucking bed in her kitchen like that's the way to do it yeah well you know she probably lives in a studio yeah I mean she this is probably the same place she's one of those chicks it probably wants to keep it real too she I think well I say where she lives but she's awesome she'll be back here again but she's fighting cat Zingano and they're going to coach against each other on the Ultimate Fighter and cat Zingano just beat Miesha Tate there's another beautiful dangerous girl and cat Zingano - they're all like pretty girls that can beat the fuck out of you it's really kind of scary out but this is in gonal chick is a beast man she's so badass she sure and Miesha Tate fought and she'd this the combination that she finished her with dude she pull it up cat Zingano versus Miesha Tate the the female fight dude I was watching it at my friend Aubrey's place the female fight was the highlight of the room we were going crazy it was me my friend Aubrey and a bunch of his buddies he like five of his friends over and we were eating Mexican food and watching the fights having a great fucking time yeah but the room went nuts when the Mesha take cat Zingano fight was going down it was chaos these girls were going off on each other dude I mean it seriously might have been one of the most entertaining fights I've ever seen in my life awesome you got to see the finish just look up the finish if the whole fight was great and you know we should take him really close together in a heel hook it was like Dominic grappling exchanges and yeah you don't want to watch all this stuff now it's although actual fight parts are cut off YouTube but I think they have like highlights oh yeah these this is though so the show and you the highlight was working you don't have to play all this stuff because I hope it doesn't get us pulled off a YouTube which I'm like right but here but I probably won't I mean I know imagine it will here I'll just did picture pictures you just show the video yeah she beats they beat the fuck out of each other man it was nasty I mean it was like such a tightly tightly contested fight and really mishit a is probably getting the better of it on the scorecards but the end of it nah no hits her with that elbow and drops her and referee Kim wins no stops to fight she's a badass man you're me the Feeny this is there's it like this is what excites me is it's not that they're girls anymore yeah it's now they're like really real highly skilled fighters yeah they're not just women you know it's not just like hey and girls can do it too it's like no these chicks are badass yeah like they're not half-assing it they're all going for it sure and now that Ronda Rousey has become so famous it's like this is gonna open the door to so many female athletes that I've never even considered it before
