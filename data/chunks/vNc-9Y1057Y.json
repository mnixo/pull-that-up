and four and three and two and one Dominic oh what a way to lead the show there Joe Rogan's I like to do it that way I don't know why I've been talking to you like that forever but I know you are we always go with the desires exes they would throw us out of our with those exits I think it was when you started touring in Ireland on a regular basis uh-huh that's a long time Joe yeah but you you've always been touring in Ireland I remember you talked about how great Ireland was decades ago yeah yeah you've always loved it there I'm did it Kilkenny festival more than any other white guy no I mean American how long you been there how many tell me times think like 22 holy shit rich hall also went a lot but he's based in London I'm the only one that actually still comes over rich Hall he did the sniglet series on that life he's based in London now yeah he likes it better there no he still works here once in a while he's got a place in Montana but he was on Saturday Night Live and he did that snake let's book and it was a big smash I paid to see him live when I was one week in a comedy he was performing at stitches and I went there live yeah so he lives in London now is he still doing stand-up yeah yeah I saw him at the Laugh Factory in Vegas a couple weeks ago him Harris Pete and Blake Clark he always used Harris Pete like he would take Harris PA rode with him and Harris Pete used to watch his Montana place for him right that's where he was a joyless doorman like he made the comedy experience tense and miserable yeah pretty funny he was he was rough as a doorman Harris's but he's one of those old staples of the comic stories I'm almost kind of weird not having him around yeah yeah him I mean he made it so uninviting you know yeah just have a smile to show to people you know they're gonna have a good time he made it like a military thing you know yeah it wasn't good yeah and then it was chewy who was always the the the guy was sort of working at anything or anything you needed from chewy yeah allegedly you know he played he played guitar at the House of Blues across the street and he was really good yes with this group and I was thinking 30 feet away you're like the slob who's like you know running around trying to trying to sell you know coke or whatever he was doing and here you're like a big star like it's so close it gets so far you know yeah he's to headline at the House of Blues we would all go over and see him yeah it was fucking good man very good yeah his band where's he at I don't know Wow I've been seeing in me years you haven't seen that guy in literally forever well this whole Renaissance The Comedy Store has happened since you came back and the guys and they started filtering back bill burr and and Chris D'Elia came in you know but it's but when he was here it was some slow nights man oh yeah you know you know when you know the place is slow when Paulie and I are the most famous people it's not a good sign I'm not putting myself down but let's face it you need a little more than two of us yeah it's weird there now isn't it you go there now it's like it's mobbed he keeps back to the hall well it's incredible I mean you know like you always think what's going on it's nothing it's just a regular night but you'll have something in the main room or Sam Tripoli or that's incredible Tuesday night main room full that was unheard of yeah Tuesday night main room sold out while the oor sold out while the belly room sold out yeah on Tuesday night it's crazy it's good though it's great for us it's fun yeah well I love the crowds I mean I really get something out of all three clubs I really do like the lair factories like college kids and and foreign students and foreign people and the comedy Stewart to me is the most cross-pollinated like in the sense that there's so many more tourist hotels you know right and then if the Improv is kind of like Hollywood slick yeah yeah and then there's the Improv lab which I just can't get a read on I've done it a couple times just for the challenge and then they sit there and then all of a sudden they laugh at like scares you because they were sitting there it was quiet and then they you know they do it weird a little room yeah they're very discerning you know that that's like the hip spot there the thing is that room used to be a great room when it was set up the other way the other way too it was amazing when it was that whole bar area yeah yeah well you know I just the thing is I don't know you go you don't do the multiples it shows yeah you do them all at the store I do some of them some nights I'll do the improv then I'll jet over to the store - I don't really do the factory anymore yeah but if I can do it if I do an early show at the store sometimes they'll do the ice house as well we'll do benefits there well yeah that's the way build build does it - and so you know whatever makes you happy you know we've talked about this it's like I just loved the idea and I know you do you have a thought and you can go on that night yeah you know I mean what imagine like you're an actor can't do that no it's giant - because sometimes that thought is funny to you right there in that moment you know why it's funny to you and you might forget why it's funny the next day you might have like a little napkin with something written down you know tampons Kleenex right you know paper towels well I don't carry tampons anymore anymore because my rectal bleeding is more they still I don't think that's the way to go with rectal reading I think there's other options I figure did you ever get that colonoscopy no colonoscopy right yeah anyway people ask me they'd say something that goes it's funny I said I don't think these college kids want to hear about that no you know it's not the kind of subject I would bring up it's bad enough I'm older than them I don't want to bring up stuff that hasn't happened to them yet yeah stuff that they did only they're never gonna understand like Alzheimer's hey kids you know what about Alzheimer's disease right disease I can remember saying we were Towson's Jamie we were talking I was talking the power of this podcast not to stroke you but you know you know how it's not strong it is when I went to Australia not even thinking of all these boys were were there and they were like busting my chops about not knowing how much you remember we did a thing but how much does a girl away yeah much closer than I was and they're busting my balls about not knowing him like Rogan beat you on that one you know that's funny in Australia of course it's about wildlife over there I got a buddy my buddy Adam green trees always trying to get me to come over to Australia and every time I find something on online that can kill you from Australia sent it to him what fuck you yeah but you never see that stuff you got to go to the outback for that well that's what he wants to take me now what do you why would you want to go there he might as well just go to the Baja be you're hunting there's a lot of bow hunting in Australia bull hunting bow Oh like archery Oh Mikey can you do that in Australia no can you do a good with a bow and arrow for real yeah that's where I got that Wow no I didn't know I bought one did can't believe I never told you that no I do it for years I've seen pictures of you and Brian hunting hunting and bear and stuff with rifles was that with rifles do you have any idea how much more of a man you are than I am I'm not thinking about that often but I never I mean I don't hunt I don't do anything to me it's like a big deal to have somebody drive me to Vegas I feel like an adventurer I don't think it has anything to do with being a man well just think you you don't the same interest as me that's the beautiful thing about America Dahmer era do whatever thank you wanna thank you for telling better the country that we love but I I just don't I don't know I mean the whole idea is sleeping in and out in the woods and all it's fun I enjoy it I enjoy five-star hotels I enjoy those 24 hour room service I like that as well that's nice too I'd like that as well but I do like getting up open up the tent looking out and just seeing a mountain filled with trees and hearing the birds chirp and yeah put your boots on having a cup of coffee that's warmed up by a fire must be very funny with you and Carolyn Oh Talon is one of the funniest guys that's ever lived when it comes to like just hanging out yeah bullshitting definitely with a small group of people yeah we did yeah his energy and he just still he knows how to make shit laughs we did this hunt in Montana in 2012 it was like six or seven days in the Missouri Breaks which is like a very really a real wild place you don't see any people there's no cell phone signals and it was six solid days of gay jokes coming out of town and I mean gay jokes like Kalin being gay with us like want with us or wanting us to have sex with him and and just it never stopped being fine he's fucking hilarious it's now do you get all this down do you just anybody cover it you know pretty like a show some day yeah that was for a show that was for a show called me either it's a it's a hunting show that my friend Steve Rinella has and we've done that show three times four four times we've done that show four times this is does your wife mind you going on these trips no she's arts it and the meat is amazing you know I come back with wild game on here imagine killing some than eating it it's so so what you just eaten meat right there what the chicken yeah but I don't think of it as like of course cuz he didn't kill it yeah I know do you ever think of like salami as being like part of an animal which to me it's like it's just this little thing that runs around the cut its legs off and make a sandwich well I think about it that way now I think about it as meat but yeah I always just thought about it a salami it's very convenient yeah yeah it's very convenient to think about things that way and you lose that convenience when you hunt you get a weird connection with your food that some people just don't want and I understand that to this some people just want to be able to go to the grocery store pick up a little Styrofoam container that has a stake in it take it home cook it they're good and they're fine with that that's fine too so you've killed stuff and eating it there I've killed stuff and eaten it in the woods yeah or eaten part of it obviously and then you freeze it yeah yeah bring it home and freeze it what did you start this Joe 2012 so six years ago more like five and a half and you lit a crossbow or what do you know compound bow looks like a regular bow but it has wheels at the top that are called cams and then the cams when it turns over gives you no mechanical advantage it makes the bow more powerful good that's cool it's intense I like the crossbows yeah those are good but it's really just like a shitty gun that's what a crossbow is it's like you're just shooting a stick instead of like you're you know you can rest it and look through that like you could put it on a rest actually and look through the scope and squeeze the trigger like a rifle it's not nearly as difficult as a regular bow did you ever shoot an animal hit it and then it ran away unfortunately yes I did that on TV I did that meteor show yeah there was a problem with the right the riflescope was off yeah I had fallen and the rifles good the rifle scope was installed by one of the guys as we got there we changed scopes because there was a sponsor of the company sponsor of the show rather and they put a different rifle scope on and shot a deer with it and it was wounded and what it didn't die and kind of stuck was horrible I mean I'm sure they sure had died within a couple hours so we couldn't get to it in time yeah who can find it I'd rather just hit it with a car ah well that's one of the problems were where we were in Wisconsin like at night time you got a drive slow oh yeah they're fucking everywhere they're darting out into the middle of the road especially when what's called the rut kicks in the deer get oh honey that's what I was thinking yeah yeah they rut they run around they get fucking crazy they get so crazy they'll just like walk right into traffic and just stare at cars I'll fuck anything know what's coming at me I mean there's there's videos of moose trying to fuck bales of hay during the rut like they literally lose their mind they have no idea what's going on they're loose you're like nine feet or so they're gigantic yeah good-sized moose like a good-sized Canadian moose could be 1,800 pounds oh shit yeah you can't even imagine you don't need them do ya it's not one of those room you have moose burgers yeah yeah yeah I've got moose burgers serious yeah I've got something left over yeah I got a lot of elk burger that's an elk wow they're delicious so good for you too it's like the best meet you oh yeah doesn't even look the same it looks like you got deep dark red I don't know how a psychological it's obviously ecological but it's certain meats like rabbit I can't eat and I don't know why because I'll eat chicken it doesn't really make sense are you a Bugs Bunny fan yeah big hardcore hardcore you get the tattoo yeah but I don't talk about it can we talk about this off the air please yes sorry it's embarrassing I know I know yeah well a lot of people get real attached to rabbits but chickens are like they're heartless little dinosaurs they're noisy and yeah yeah um chickens they're they're you know they're lit basically a lizard it's just a lizard with feathers really yeah yeah you pluck all that shit off and look at him like what is that yeah what's a bird it's not a flying lizard not a good looking animal do they know whether or not pterodactyl I just found out for my seven-year-old that pterodactyls are not dinosaurs really yeah it's corrected they came in a different period I don't know she told me they're not dinosaurs and we googled it and she was right I was like how am I so then I was thinking you know we always had those images of pterodactyls or they were flying around they had like bat-like wings right right yeah yes I'm for me that's what it says it says that they lived at the same time but they're not actually dinosaur technically it's a good question somehow they are not actually dinosaurs they were flying creatures and paleontologists keep telling us that dinosaurs are birds so the diet what wait a minute the petrol source but that doesn't make any sense because dinosaurs are birds so Birds became dinosaurs but pterodactyls who could fly are not dinosaurs I was in the bird the the closest descendant of dinosaurs yes yeah they're not dinosaurs so what the hell are they here's the thing like when they showed that image of them with the skin for wings instead of bats I don't know if they know if that's real I don't know if that's based on what they absolutely know or like what they think because they're starting to think that a lot of dinosaurs had feathers now this is pretty recently I was in the museum in Bozeman Montana there's a museum like a Natural History type museum and they have like a split image of a dinosaur like a raptor and it's covered with feathers Wow yeah because they think it's entirely possible that a lot of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers well I didn't know not as much fossilized remains of it huh I didn't know that man never lived with Dinosaurs at the same period yeah I didn't know that until a couple years ago you really didn't know I thought cavemen you know cuz they always show them like in Kurt I always gone by the Flintstones you really didn't know well I mean you're a real comic Tom I guess so yeah you don't pay attention to shit outside it's all jokes thank God I can do that decently know what I do I have no skills like I like to teach kids I like I like teaching fourth grade and that was about it but you like having fun well if you teach kids don't teach them about dinosaurs what did you teach I painted everything I taught everything because it was Catholic school I told everything but but the smart kids math because I was dumb I stuck with the dumb kids and split the class oh come on you retards come with me which II couldn't say now yeah you couldn't say that now you get in serious trouble you'd be in the front page USA Today you know I still have kids that get in touch with me really yeah they said it makes me feel so good that it was the best year of their lives as far as going to school because I really had fucking fun I would go in my speech was I want to go to the gym more than you guys do so don't mess it up for me and you got to learn some of this stuff I don't know why I hate it too you know I'd be like kind of on it right and they dug it and we had just we said we had dance contests and everything was hilarious I had this one kid Tyrone done he was like a baby James Brown he could do a split well complete split and then then get his herself up without touching anything Wow yeah amazing like James Brown yeah Wow yeah well when you're kid and you're going to school like anyone was any spark of life is exciting I still to this day think about some of the teachers that I had in high school had two really good teachers in high school one lady I wish I could remember her name and one guy who was a Spanish teacher that I'm pretty sure fucked one of my friends who was a girl oh thanks for clearing that up he was a young guy he was like 25 years old and she was hot and I know that they were like talking lunch she was 17 he was 25 I'm pretty sure he fucked her I'm almost positive she was very sexually aggressive and she was a advanced for her time both physically and mentally like she was one of those girls like you knew she was not gonna last in that town she's gonna get the fuck out of there I remember I did this clean show at the that hotel in San Diego the it was some like it hot was it's a clean show del Coronado I did a clean show like an early show at seven o'clock on a Saturday they make you be clean oh that can only make you be so clean but the point the thing I was getting that was there was these 15 year old boys there right and they were with their parents he could tell their parents for a little snooty so I said 15 what a great age and this is this could be a dangerous thing to say I said you know what's great about being 15 you could nail a 15 year old girl and not go to jail for the rest of your life right like and the kids were crying laughing and the parents were really they look like they wanted to pull them out of there you know yeah parents don't want kids fucking hilarious well if they're both 15 yeah you really can't get in trouble well the girl could get pregnant yeah that's no bueno but like the idea they're gonna stop them like hey you stop doing that thing that feels better than anything they're ever gonna do at school at work don't do that though you're all of your cells in your body are compelling you in that direction but don't do that but don't do it your whole body your DNA your thoughts are haunted everything is wrapped around like tits and ass and legs and feet and mouths don't do it I remember the first time I whacked off in my I was in my bedroom in Philly and I came so much that I thought I'll never have children I swear I thought I empty this train the tank it just kept coming no float gushes yeah and amazing how far you would shoot back then to the distance was insane knock your eye out from blood we googled it and we think I think if I remember correctly the furthest a guy ever jizz was like 29 feet holy shit yeah I can't throw it that far I don't remember making that circuit your memory like a childhood molestation there was a it's got Lenny Schultz I remember crazy laughing you do yeah I used to do a bit about jerking off a midget because like jerk off the midget and he would come in here and then I would baddest come on to the crowd would say to that good I see you writing always writing he used to fucking walk on stage with a Smokey the Bear doll and he would he would hold the doll up and say only you can prevent forest fires oh shut the fuck up and punches the bear you were crying laughing he was one of those guys that was just fucking funny from the look in his eyes to everything he said he just knew how to he was his own unique style he just knew how to be funny well he had that psychotic 22 and like he looked like a guy to a petted pigeon and go yes your daddy loves you in the snap its neck yeah what did I do exactly they loved you exactly and then Chuck it aside and get on with his act he grabs the bear only you can prevent forest forest remember Jimbo's place and montreal yeah how many works yes where we were that's where I saw crazy Lenny that's probably around the first time I met you then probably yeah like 93 ish somewhere in that range I remember meeting you at the club soda yeah that was fun and then we ran into each other again at Amsterdam billiards right there's only a few of us to play the pool Artie Lange plays real good pool does he yeah very good Fitzsimmons was here yesterday he plays real good yeah Greg and I just played it that at The Improv they used to have a quarter table upstairs oh really yeah for years oh the set up up there it's very nice down out yeah they had whole green room with the the podcast studio yeah that's cool very nice it's good setup we're plugging the shit out of these clothes yeah like out of guys who play pool like comics to play pool it's a fucking small group of us yeah not that many who else somebody else plays good I think Matt Adam Ferrara place for please very good your honor plays very good yeah he was at my house playing but I know I never get you back there because there's too many obstacles jack up those little baby cues well Joe who has room like this who has 50 feet on each side of a pool table hey well we're gonna stream some stuff from here we're gonna eventually stream pool matches oh yeah yeah yeah we're gonna set up cameras and just talk shit and have a live stream you ever heard of twitch do you know what twitches twitch is a streaming service where you play games on it mostly video games most people use it for video games but we've been talking to them about doing video games and then I'm thinking we might do some pool matches as well and even some archery put me up against Tosh alright play a little bit but I just I always beat him you know oh logical advantage no I love beating him that and then shooting baskets because it calls me old man grandpa and all the shit so I want to beat him in something you know what I'm modeling some of the what I do after Tosh in that he doesn't do any interviews he's like I did enough so fuckin smart he's so smart he's like he knows how to not be overexposed and I've I've fucked that up in the past and now I know I'm just like when I get here I might get requests for interviews I'm like what I've said I say too much already I'm already talking to notice I never asked you again because he did me the favor and I don't want to push it but the fact is we had Jamie to fuck around with that time so no you know I'm not gonna really nail you on an interview make you oh you mean on your pot yeah yeah that's different I do friends podcasts all the time but it's like interviews and real shows and stuff like that it's like you got nothing to gain Joe yeah you're famous enough and Daniels right I mean with it what are you gonna get good out of that like doing Jimmy Kimmel you know doing five minute you probably wouldn't want to do to stand up even though it's your favourite thing and then you go over to the panel and you know like I like Craig Ferguson only because it was in problem right right right well I think that sitting down and talking to someone should be like this you really really really want to get to know somebody yeah you talk to him like this have a have a real conversation with him having a conversation with someone when you're under the gun of five minutes and you known his there and you're sitting sideways and you're in the desk and I'm sitting over like this and you know we're talking about some project that I'm doing it's like a quick pitch you have like a quick story that you can tell and just so I understand you rent a car when you come into town what's that like I do rent a car and I always take the insurance you know why cuz I Drive like a fucking maniac you people here in highway 95 what do you nuts what is going on with the drivers and Los Angeles turn to the audience you know I did Ferguson show once and he gave me the wrong plug I was I had already worked that you know the Denver Club that you like so much Comedy Works yeah I already worked that and he they plugged it on I said you know I came out I said Craig you got a really crack staff here I already worked that gig I said but I'm so hot I'm white hot in this business they have to post plug things so there won't be a riot they said well we'll just start it over you know cuz they're filming it I said no I got a spot in a couple hours I started over and we got like in a fake argument was the most fun I ever had doing live stand-up because I said let me go go sit in a high chair and judge me like a little joke monkey and I'll come over and we'll say funny stuff there too well he's just doing stand-up now yeah yeah it's on serious too as well yeah but he just got tired of doing a show wasn't his name Hitler something or a well really I think so his name is Hitler Craig Ferguson what kind of asshole for a parent if you're born with the name a Hitler I don't care how far you get away from that I can't remember the whole name but I think Hitler was in the in the name in the name like Hitler's burg waiter Stein Scottish right yeah what is it it's a big Hitler he was like yeah Oh Bing Hitler Oh was it it character yeah yeah oh I wish we could play it oh Christ look at him that's a little sick he's 12 he looks like he's a kid in school really the young face Diaz was faking actors here all fucked up give me some wine accent so so much sticker and drink Wow mister from Mexico Wow so he had a character that was the character that he do and the character he would go crazy with it hmm there was a time and they're stuck Allah is still a time where we're in thrall by mediocre people with fake accents yeah yeah not fake accents but you know accents from other places foreign accents I should say not fake so it's like the thing that bothers me and I love stand-up and it was what a guy acts so different like all of a sudden he goes into this character mm-hmm you don't I mean like now instead of the funniest guys to me are guys that do characters but themselves yeah and they talk real like you know that's why I mean you and burr you're the same guys on an off stage you know we're talking sometimes you get silly sometimes you're serious right be just be yourself yeah I know you're saying be sincere but you can be just as fucking goofy as you want but don't stay in that yeah it's so hacky to me it can be I'm always waiting for someone to do it right something I don't want to pass judgment like maybe one guy comes along and he's in character all the time but it's fucking hilarious I just watched Jim Carrey on the end when he did Andy Kaufman yeah it was fucking amazing oh that was them the documentary that was yeah that spring sprang from that but I was watching the movie last night I figured what's called something man in the moon yeah man in the moon yeah what Jim's good Oh brilliant you know what's really interesting with him he's taken like a severe psychological and I guess philosophical turn where he's he's just thought about life and things some he must have had like some psychedelic experiences - I think so it sounds like it yeah because he's just talking about like what matters and what doesn't matter and you know and there's a bunch of like interviews and clips of him discussing things really like whoa like this guy does not he's not talkin like Jim Carrey the world-famous the a-list actor who's had gigantic smash movies he's not talking like that all he's like talking like some guy who's just trying to sort of understand his place of the universe yeah yeah it's really a really profound way it's very well thought out God you watch this about him painting now it came out a couple months we didn't he play this where some of his paintings are really cool they're like in neon and Joey talks about he says some of the stuff that he's been thinking about in dealing with so it's called I need color and it's on Vimeo so folks who go check that out yeah yeah I tell you about the little part I have been dying up here no okay so I play Fitzie Anderson because they wouldn't let me use fritzy Anderson remember 40 Anderson no just they go on hello yeah and they wouldn't I wouldn't fritzy was a slur for two Germans what yeah I sort of cheese so anyway I go into the Comedy Store in a Thursday night why I was there just to practice I know like real and trying a couple lines and doing some shit and Jim's in the audience it comes out he hugs me anyway long story short he he was with his boy his ex-wife and they were their daughter was ill and it's great girl she's really good singer too by the way but anyway they start talking he said fucking funny Dom was she good he goes I want to put him in this show and Melissa goes will tell you one thing he's not going to dance free you'll want them yeah I asked him but he ain't gonna audition because I'm not gonna make my audition I've known him for fucking 30 years anyway that's how I got the part and that funny just randomly randomly he was he came in to look for young comedian so I am NOT one of them you could tell boy I'm a receding hairline but yeah I mean amazing I mean just there that's Thursday night randomly is that she'll still going on yeah we're shooting they're shooting 10 more I got a I know I'm doing an alcohol an alcoholic the whole time which is I never watched it I watched one episode and I thought it was pretty good but I heard that it goes better yeah yeah I heard that it was improving I heard you know all those things start yeah do you remember Seinfeld the beginning I remember news radio the show I didn't yeah it was clunky yeah it took a while to really get rolling yeah they get the ribs on what it is sitcoms are very difficult you know one of the reasons why people like Obama there any good sitcoms in the air well god damn it's hard to do well this is a serious one like I'm kind of the comic relief on this because it's about like comedians but not like you know when we goof around hi Joe as a Brogan right I don't see hardly any of that you see them more like jealous of each other and you know they're showing the dark side of it the woman who plays the mitzi part is Melissa Leo she's won an Academy Award for some boxing movie I forget but she she's playing Mitzi really serious and I don't want to say anything you know because she's a great actress but if I were aghast to give one note I would say they were mitts he really had a fun side to her by the way for those who don't know it was the owner his own the owner of the Comedy Store Pauly Shores mom she brought us two things one of them was awesome just kidding on the show yeah he's been on yeah yeah I like Pauly he's a sweet guy he's a good guy to be around like he gives people hugs and shit I mean like all of us yeah well he's he had a hard life I mean he imagine being babysat by Sam Kinison know what in the fuck kind of crazy shit is that assembled in Staunton your mom Argus and Sam Kinison hanging around your house everybody's doing blow yeah and you're going what buddy it's me so he was gigantic at one point in time who Sam well Sam was for sure but so was Pauly Pauly yeah Holly was gigantic it was it the weasel I mean when he was doing movies like in the army now with Andy Dick remember that Jesus Christ is huge she had a three-picture deal Encino man there was another one biodome let me do biodome yeah with a Stephen Baldwin was a good movie I enjoyed it don't look at me like that it's not admire he some people talk about son-in-law all the time yeah he's fucking funny those movies were fucking funny yeah I don't know what he did wrong or where it went wrong or you know sometimes like I think people just get bored they just want some new person right yeah who's hot right now Alice Tiffany Haddish - do I love that girl zhu zhu xi's let's try to say he's Jewish by the way is she yeah she's Ethiopian Jewish no kidding yeah Tiffany hatches the person who told me about sickle cell anemia being related to malaria that people who have a resistance to malaria developed a trait for sickle cell anemia well that's where the origins of it are apparently that's crazy it's primarily a Jewish and and a black disease right more is it a Jewish it diseases workers and and blacks get it than any other other that's interesting I didn't not know that I thought it was just blacks I had a friend who died from it really yeah I'm Walter yep from back when I was fighting he I remember he and I would love to see fight you I was a different guy man I was very intense I wasn't about very fun did you ever think he'd be a comedian when you were in those days no I didn't think I was funny I made people laugh but the people that I made laughs were all psychos they were all like guys that I was training and fighting with and I was just like I felt like we were all freaks you know because we were martial artists that were travelling literally all around the country and entering these full-contact tournaments you don't have any video of some video there's a video of me on YouTube I only knock it somebody out look kid yeah I was 19 and Connecticut or no I couldn't I love you too much I just hold you well you know what you do which is really interesting for a guy that's strong you never mean right there does me in the blue and I kick that kind of oh oh that's how I have another video on my computer somewhere some like uneventful round of some Taekwondo tournament there's a guy out there it's got a couple of videos of me though he and I have gone back and forth on what weight were you that was 154 I when I was in senior year in high school I fought at 140 and that was too light it was too hard for me I was always dehydrating myself and I would uh like do things in the shower like jump up and down in the shower and shadowbox in the shower with this the hot water on and try to sweat out wait I couldn't eat for like a whole day and then I would fight that day and was terrible I did that for one year yeah there was a professional boxer yeah and he anybody was the bad thing about it he was a 500 boxer Oh No box 511 but boxing you you got to be like 800 you know at least yeah make a livin when he won he would come home beaten up oh no that must be hard to see yeah fucked up yeah I see people um that fight in the UFC and their kids come to hug them you know in the cage and you know you see the terrified look in their children's face and they're looking the guy's eyes all fucked up and mmm godson it's a different group a different type of human being that does that I had so much fun the other time you invited me to the one in Montreal where the guy who is the king of Montreal with George st. Pierre that was incredible is the loudest noise of cheers I've ever heard yeah they love him and the other one was when we went to the place that were those those guys who will own the Sacramento Kings the the plate where they have a Playboy Club and you had a fights there talk about its off the strip yes than the Palm Somme yes yes and one of the cool moments I mean even though it's he realized how powerful real it is this kid got knocked down and I was sitting next to his mother and his wife mmm and he wouldn't wake up for a couple minutes Danny they finally got out but and then there was another kid who like was like in the cartoons he ran up the wall and I don't know how the fuck he did it and he just his young black kid he'd ran up the wall and went upside-down and then landed on his feet you know I mean yeah John Dodson is a pretty sure is that after fights he runs up yeah he's a freak awesome athlete yeah yeah that's a different kind of human being that does that oh yeah it's to to be in that world that's a that's a pool it's just an intense existence that's unlike very many other yes and this world other than war you know war is probably the most intense existence guys who are warriors actual soldiers mmm other than that I think MMA fighters and then obviously first responders firefighters the ops of things long oh man I was thinking about that with those fires this year oh god my buddy's a firefighter he was up there and now he's in Simi Valley and they shipped him out with everybody else I need tell me was insane he's like you you just you couldn't stop the fire it was just too big and then you know that thousands of firefighters and here's the other thing not just thousands of firefighters but prisoners really debt prisoners working the fire they could get out early baby I don't think so yeah I think they got paid and I don't think they got paid much I think the unpaid like $1 an hour like something fucked up and they're out there working on the fires I'll just pretend I got burned just run into the fire I got a fake ID I'm going to Mexico yeah I'm I'm pretty sure they did I think that's one of the most fucked up things about prison is that they get them to work and they pay them like pennies I didn't know that I mean I know they get them to clean up but well even if you have a DUI you can get that and I wouldn't even go into prison yeah I'm pretty sure yeah you can't you can work it off for pay it off don't really clean the sides the roads a friend of mine did that instead of he didn't have the money how much is the money to pay DUI I think it all comes to around ten ten grand yeah with the lawyer and everything ten grand at a dollar an hour's a long time oh my god if they really pay you a dollar an hour yeah well you know I get that DUI yeah just use uber it now most the time right yeah he's drunk right now no he'll be sad like I get nervous when they talk to you we've been friends for 30 years almost holy shit that crazy we've been friends for 25 years somewhere in the neighborhood of 25 years that's a long time mister era yeah that's crazy no nuts do you think I'd have more material by now you've already used it off hey are you whoa you're talking about filming something what would it mean are you talking about filming a special you know what I did one last time I was on the show you told me I should do when I did it and I just didn't like it Wow when did you do it not whatever last time I was on the show it's like a year ago I would imagine a little more and then I waited about three months and I shot it and you just said not to release it yeah what was wrong with it like what didn't feel good about it I don't know I just my ass look fat I just didn't like it I mean I did it didn't seem to have the energy I thought I have hmm you know huh so it didn't feel to you like representative of a real set that you have I got it right just a normal night of the club that's all I wanted did you feel pressure look because that's one of the things that I feel that I always battle when I do a special is that like here's the moment it's now ready go and one of the best ways I found to combat that is I do a bunch of shows I do for show see that's smart I did too yeah it was tight yeah and they were back-to-back yeah sometimes people clam up I've seen people do one and it becomes a disaster you could feel the deafness on stage because there's so much riding on it right this is not just a regular show there's no room really to fuck around you gotta have room to fuck around like part of what a live show is is flowing I mean I would like to get myself in a club where I'm half once like some if something's like worth talking about with an audience member or something that's really cool I would do it but just be a normal Club set that's a lot right right like a normal but very strong Club set where did you film the Laugh Factory in Vegas mmm yeah let's remember that so you still the Laugh Factory in Hollywood that's a comfortable club for you and they already set up for filming yeah I know I could do it any night yeah maybe that's a good move well Jamie one did it taped me like a couple weeks in a row doing like 40 minutes yeah you know you should that's a great place to do it Dom because they they film you whether you like it or not there yeah well we talked about this that's not a good sign but they do have the set up they have the set up to film you the Vegas room was nice is it yeah well you know as drop that's it here's the thing that's great about Vegas Joe is that you could do it I'm doing the that the first week April I think the the Trump then I'll do Brad Garrett's club to because they don't give a fuck it's Vegas right Vegas I'm like Columbus Ohio they have the same audience pretty much you know but they're they have the audience comes in from far away every week you know so you could play Vegas a lot that is true like that's one of the reasons why residency works in Vegas yes anywhere else yeah have you ever thought about doing that a residency I think well I think I killed myself in Vegas just booze in and yeah hanging out and I get in a rhino at 3:00 in the morning my Fistful of Dollars I go out with this girl and she's got really hot daughters right but she's hot the girl you're dating yeah she's very hot but she's always telling me how beautiful her daughters and I go look I know but I don't wants to stop pimping off your daughters to me I took him to see Tosh I was in town for the Super Bowl and Daniel was at the Mirage and they got say I forget how big a deal it would be to a 16 year old boy to meet him and he was so it was so gracious with them but it was I think I couldn't believe it because this kid played John Lennon in love when he was a little kid so he's got he's been around theatrical people you know love that Beatles yeah that needle thing is fucking amazing good at the Mirage yeah yeah yeah they start that acapella because yeah very cool well yeah I know you're a huge Beatles fan yeah you've always been a big Beatles fan so I I took my family to see that about a month ago or so yeah I want to see that Faraj fuck it's incredible it's such a show man and it cool to see your kids kind of diggin it yeah all those years ago and you know I know so many little kids that liked the Beatles it's weird they're so good they were so good and you and I think it's hard for someone today in 2018 with this vast variety of music that we have and so much good music over the history of music you know oh so much recording that it's hard to understand how in the 1960s how using the Beatles were ya that out of nowhere this band at a Liverpool right comes out and they just have this revolutionary music it's just so much of it so different yeah it was very different and they were the ones they added orchestras and all this stuff you know a bit it reminds me of the the thing we were talking about before of the sitcoms mm-hmm they were given a chance to get better a lot of people today if they if they're one with two bad records they're out yeah and they got some other beautiful girl replacing them and that's true you know I there's it's the same way with fighters you know I had this conversation with my friend Brendan Schaub and I were talking about this the other day that I don't big brown guys get into the UFC too young and then they're fighting top-flight competition like right away and it's either sink or swim yeah yeah and some guys swim but some guys have real massive potential but really they should be fighting someone of a lower caliber and developing their skills and experiencing a bunch of different styles and then eventually working their way up to the UFC after you know five six years or so and instead they're fighting in the UFC at 20 years old and they're just not really ready for top-flight competition because the UFC if you string together five six wins you're entitled contention in some weight divisions yeah that'll discourage your shit out of you yeah and you're getting fucked up by some guy who's just many many levels above you you really shouldn't be fighting him like the flyweight division is perfect example because it's run by this guy Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson's probably the best powerful pound fighter that's ever lived and you know I'm saying something man he's fucking incredible and he's a wizard like you barely gets hit and you know and you we've seen him in the Octagon develop and grow and become this guy and now now he's just just there's everybody and then there's Mighty Mouse Mighty Mouse is just another level above everybody I never seen anybody as good as Mayweather to avoid punches no one's better know no one no one gets hit less it's incredible yeah I mean guys 50 you know and obviously one of them was Conor McGregor which is kind of crazy but Conor hit him you know I mean Conor can crack but he just didn't had no business in the ring honestly maybe we really didn't know if he had business in the ring until he fought him after the fact it's easy to say that yeah like he caught him with that uppercut in the first round what if he wobbled him what if he heard anybody can get in he's out yeah if you get hit right anybody can get it out but Mayweather has been hit right where he was hurt I don't think Conor hurt him I think he just hit him good but he's been hurt Sugar Shane Mosley heard him he's been hurt a couple of times in his career but over the course of 50 professional fights where most of them are at World Championship level but it's crazy remarkable I was watching the they had like a highlights of the MMA on when Fox today and Ronda Rousey when she got kicked in the face oh what a great kick that was Holly Holm yeah that was in Australia I remember being there for that oh that was a Melbourne right I think was in Sydney I wasn't yeah pretty sure Sydney it was crazy might have been Melbourne you might be right might be right think you're right now that I think about it think you're right um no you definitely right now that I know um stuff are you who uses our leave yourself alone you're a good burger trying to remember I love Melbourne yeah I love that great restaurant fuck I was just gonna say that great coffee to Donovan they have everything like their seafoods fantastic but it's almost like an artsy sort of San Francisco like yes ever just goes the one like imperative yeah but it's got its own thing yeah Mel burns got its own thing fucking crowds were amazing well aren't they cool and it's so fun yeah they're great up there I did a comedy store in Sydney in between like bigger gigs that takes you know to make it worth it for them to bring you over there and I love it yeah love the culture and the pie did that to Ari and I did the Comedy Store in Sydney on a Sunday night on a whim the fights took place early in the day so that it could be a UFC pay-per-view uh-huh and so we called up the Comedy Store and said hey can we do an impromptu show tonight we'll just put it up on Twitter and they said all right hold on Lois call you right back all right we doing it let's do it and so we put it on Twitter and then Ari and I went and did a show that night the kid they came yeah I was packed yeah it was absolutely habit drawer like you helped me get a draw in Australia and then amazing crazy yeah I mean when I was you know when I started out looking on The Tonight Show that would be the first time whole all of America saw you but the whole world not like this the whole world hears this yeah this thing's got its own life I remember when you're working the wheel I was at your house one day when kind of like you had started but you said you feel forget what the exact word but baby imma Menem going when you felt you you knew something was something incredible was gonna happen with this show remember that well that you just had that you told me you have a feeling like you weren't bragging not at all but you was just like going with the energy of it you know well I was I was saying that I felt like there's something going on yeah like this show like it was just starting to pick up momentum then and I was like there's something going on here and then I was thinking about what the potential this was and at the time when we first started there wasn't that many people listening to podcast it was very small yeah and we were also streaming live on Ustream and there wasn't many people listening to that either or watching that but I was like but this keeps growing and I and I knew that I was very interested in doing it so I knew I was gonna get better at it and I was always trying to figure out what what ways I could do it better how to get out of my own way how to not talk over people knowing when to talk when not to talk how to figure that out well it's tricky it is tricky it's tricky to to pay you you have to put yourself in the seat of the person that's listening and I think listening to podcast helps us well and listening to things that you don't enjoy so he's one of the things that Stephen King always says about writing is that you should write but you should also read you shouldn't read a lot I think that's the case with podcast too I think that's the case with stand-up as well I think listening to other stand-up is good as long as you not getting ideas from them you know as long as you're just enjoying it like what the the good feeling that you get from watching stand-up watching someone kill you know it's like I get inspired by it and it makes me and then I see things maybe what they're a little clunky in someone's act like how they need to clean that up or taking this up and it makes me more cognizant about those flaws in my own act and makes me more more self-aware yeah I love to watch like say like Chris Rock when he does something and then two weeks later it works yeah yeah and you know he's got a germ of something there but he's so good at putting it you know setting it up to be a potentially great bit you know well he's one of the all-time greats for a reason and one of the reasons is he's a real craftsman he's a real artist you know Chris will go in there and he will he's not just trying to kill every time he goes onstage you know he's he's trying to develop material he's using that time and is a very valuable thing for him you know well I really believe that this generation is better than the generation I started with and only because they got to see them and grow from them mm-hmm you had to have somebody in the middle because I mean honestly you know and you and bill to me I take you and Bill over prior in carlin sacrilege no serious I stand up but you know and I'm not saying that because you're my friend and we're here I'm saying it's just I seen these guys and I loved I love them you know I mean I was like one of those kids that grew up watching him but I think you just you know this your generation is taken it to a different level there's uh there's definitely a benefit in being able to see the people before you for sure I've learned a lot watching other comedy work watching people just getting you know we were talking yesterday about Richard Jeni that I think brilliant writer oh you're so good when I see a man with sandals I think I am are you doing this Spartacus good yeah he I was listening to one of his recordings on the way home a big steaming pile of me like I don't know at least a year ago is probably more but I remember like getting a noticeable bump in my writing after I listened to it because it was so inspiring yeah and that I think that's a giant advantage that we have today with like YouTube and iTunes and things along those lines where you can listen to anything you want I can go back and I was listening to an old Woody Allen recording the other day I just in my car driving all this in a Woody Allen do stand up in the 1960s yeah you can tell he was a fucking pervert even back then yeah well you know there was a line there was a line and loved it there was a line in love and death over love and death yes and Diane Keaton goes to this high priest and she steps on his beard it's very funny scene and he says the most beautiful thing in the world is a 12 year old girl blond hair preferably twins right and this is all this perverted things yeah this though this happened 20 years be 25 years before he got accused of anything yeah you know but it was just interesting hearing because he did a couple he did it even in Manhattan with Hemingway was a little bit a little bit twisted you know I don't remember Manhattan very much well he falls in love and she falls in love with him she's like supposed to be 16 and he's Jesus Christ yeah well isn't that something that people tend to do they try to normalize whatever fucked up provision and half and they put it in the art like that was one of the things that they were accusing louis c.k of with this movie that he released right before it came out that he was jerking off in front of a bunch of it though they had this movie and part of the movie was just talking about how everyone's a pervert we're all perverts I'll tell you something off the air how can we get off remind me to tell you I don't wanna sit down with Dom our era that's your new show off the air with Dahmer era all I do is burn people and lose any context at everybody it's not I gotta go in there actually the night that he went or the the day after he when I went onstage I got I said I'm so excited I got a part in a Louis CK's new TV show should shoot in about 10 15 years and I took to my beat and then they got it I think he'll be back in a year well you know what Joey has that advantage of he was the one that created the idea of selling your own thing right yes so he can do that he doesn't need a producer for that that's true that's true um you'd have him on this show right I would 100% have them on yeah um I think he's a different person than when he did those things I think what those things that he did jerking off the front of a bunch of people was terrible and I think he probably had an idea in his head of what those things were and of who he was and who he would be and I think a lot of your self definitions a lot of times are based on this very limited idea of who you are very limited idea of who you're going to be and he's like wallowing in his own weirdness and just wants a jerk off in front of some of them you know it's out of all the offenses of things you could do to someone it's one of the least egregious because he's not raping he's not as he didn't lock the door he's not yeah he didn't lock the door he's not doing anything awful to someone he's just doing something weird in front of them I think it's beautiful do you know I don't think it's beautiful there's a lot of things that I think of you to think it's a plike it's definitely a pike well it's it's human like then I batted it out of the air because an ape doesn't really care if you're jerking oh if you're watching when he's jerking on he could be he could be eaten jerking over the banana in one hand banana and the other get it Hey yeah out of all the things that he did and I think that his apology but pretty was what's a way to look at it I think was honest I think it sort of explained how his mind worked and why he did it in the first place it's not it's obviously not something he's proud of it's obviously something he's disgusted by himself and you can't here's the thing you jerk off in front of someone 10 years ago how do you fix that you don't do it again and he hasn't done it again here's the thing no one's saying he's done anything in a long time like all the accusations were like I want to say they were from they were from years ago right what do you do like how do you fix that like sit say you did jerk off in front of a few people dumb like you know like I don't know why can't you look whatever blind lady is that is that still count it depends on how good her hearing is oh she's here yeah you're right she's like what are you doing and she has to guess it's all fucking guesswork what do you how do you fix that like what does a guy do to fix that I mean I think out of all the people like how the fuck would you rehabilitate Harvey Weinstein how do you let Harvey Weinstein around a woman again how do you how do you leave Harvey Weinstein in a hotel room with a woman who comes in for a meeting or cosby's was the worst he's the worst the word I don't think you really belted him how what do you do how do you how do you how do you fix that the only way Cosby gets rehabilitated I mean not really rehabilitated but the only way he gets reintroduced into society is if everyone believes those girls are lying and that'll never happen it's impossible because everybody heard those stories a long time ago when I did Star Search in like 83 and he was the guest host and we were hearing shit about him on the set then really women Eisen and stuff yeah I mean Chris not not as his extremist druggie drugging them and run raping them but like if you're a guy like louis c.k how do you what do you do like what would he what could he have done before the story came out that he's doing that the girls what what could he have done to to make amends I mean what could he have done he said sorry to some of the people I don't know why you looking at me like that I don't I'm just trying to think I'm just trying I'm you're my friend looking at you right there I'm just thinking like what would one do I mean it seems like let's I mean I'm not exonerating him right but it seems like all these years since then he hasn't done it again right so if he hasn't done it again he must understand that there's something wrong with that yeah some weird compulsion and it had to be a power thing because if anybody could get a hooker and do that you know well here's the thing he's probably doing that too yeah I mean if you like jerking off in front of people he might just like jerking off in front of all kinds of people he might have jerked off front hoof to I mean I don't know saying but we know that he did it in front of women that really didn't want it yes that's what I thought it might be part of the kinkiness so yeah but there are some stories of him doing it in front of women they thought it was hilarious he didn't find some female comics and they thought it was hilarious how do you stay hard when they're laughing you gotta be a real animal it's better than better man than me Dom but I did a lot I don't know what you think of this one but I what do you and I see that mention him on stage and these women started bowing I said why are you bowing and they said because of what he did and the daughter knows I said look I don't know I said by the one thing you gotta admit he really must love her because it's not like she's hot you know I know but that got a laugh when we get offstage I'll tell you one Toni Hinchcliffe new bit I can't say it on stage but I'll tell you on stage when you tell me your thing on stage one has a new bit that's fucking ruthless and killed me and we came up with it in the car this weekend we're on a road trip and we were talking about something and he said it and I I fucking died I said you got to say that on stage he goes seriously I got to say that on stage yeah you do it last night in the room fucking exploded gotta come back and do the show when I do it what show his show his show kill Tony I don't like to work Monday nights oh yeah well you gotta have a schedule now you got to see the family yeah but I have a schedule now on Monday Sunday's a month a Sunday knit yeah Sundays and Mondays is extreme family time I don't do jack shit because you won't have these days and they can they grow up so fast it's not to get corny but it's true him yeah it's true I'm enjoying it I'm I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life good that's great to hear that yeah and I'm also I think I'm a nicer person now that I've ever been in my life wait wait wait I said she's yeah much to compare with he little prick I think it just makes you uh you know Dave Chappelle said this to me once and I think it's a really great quote he said not only as having children made me made me love someone more than I ever thought I could it's changed my capacity for love and that's cool yeah yeah he's like my capacity for love is much greater than might that make sense like you realize like a lot of our struggles and a lot of the shit that we we go through in this life it's a lot of it is about perspective and a lot of it is about who's around you and what kind of loving environment you're around and it's also having kids and not having the strain the financial strain the emotional strain and the ignorant strain that my parents had and their parents had like ignorant is a big thing to like didn't know how to raise kids back then of course they hit us they you know they yelled at us and they didn't know me didn't hit me but you know it was a common thing for people to hit their kids I remember Bruce Willis said to me went on to be a named drummer Hey he said they you know one of the things about having kids he goes his little girl I forget the middle little ones a name he said she would wake me up to walk her to the bathroom and to her I wasn't a movie star I wasn't any I was daddy Grimes because she's afraid of the dark walking her and you know yeah he said that really humanizes him and made him feel good because you know you know it's like he gets stroked all the time it's like something you just want to be normal well not only that when Bruce Willis was famous there was way less famous people because there was no famous internet personalities there was no famous reality TV stars there was way less famous rappers and there was way less famous comedians think of how few famous comedians they were well that's why we all like me and dice and guys that were on Rodney's specials we were really fuckin lucky because we became instant draws I paid to see you after you were on Rodney special were you a dick yeah I went to see you at next and I went to see two nights in a row cuz one night I thought you were supposed to be there and either you missed your flight or something happened and Dennis Leary was there instead and I was like what the fuck and so we came back the next day and we saw you again but movie with a girl that I was dating her name was Stephanie she's uh she's tell me what to do she's older oh really she had the dominant one she was is the first girl she was 25 I was 21 she's sick she liked the dick though tell you that woo well that was what was exciting about she's the first woman I dated like you know she was a woman yeah I dated girls before that that girl was a woman and you know she was fucking smart - I prefer girls who are a woman's age yeah yeah yeah she was um - just intense she'd tell me what to do with stand up - she's Commun stand up really yeah it's kind of hilarious I saw that Seinfeld episode where the girl broke up with him because of his act funny she goes I don't think this is going to work he goes we having a great time she says well your act with the IG ever notice you know she cuz that's not my style economy goes you're breaking up with me because of my actually goes yes I am it's the other the foothill arias well if you were a girl and you were a huge comedy fan like imagine if you were a girl and you just you love Chapelle and bill burr and da my rare and Duncan Trussell and Joey Diaz and all these great comedians and then you start dating a prop act anybody and he's the worst prop act yeah it's like fuckin Stu he's got a soundtrack he has to play hit the music drop-down and comes up with an ally said hit it what's the jokes and so he told me that she would she couldn't go out with me if she didn't like me that makes sense yeah yeah if you're a comedy fan me if you're a music fan how the fuck could you date a guy who's got terrible songs yeah how could you would be brough you know if you're a bad accountant you know be you're a great guy you probably still get a date you know if you're fuckin terrible to think that someone loves right well it's so much more personal than debits and credits you know it's like yeah your stand-up is you reflection of you generally I mean if a good goods you have is one of the most personal things I think music stand up maybe writing writing is pretty personal yeah yeah but stand up but really good stand-ups reveal something of themselves you feel like you know them for some related for sure yeah yeah it's um I mean there's more famous stand-ups today I was talking with Jeff wills from Lion I know Jeff Jeff and I were talking about the the number of guys today and gals that can sell out big ass theaters and it's nuts he's like dude 20 years ago there was nobody there was like a handful everybody worked the clubs and there was a few George Carlin's out there yeah you know a few Chris Rock's or you know whoever it was at the time that could sell out a theater and now like fucking everybody selling out these theaters it's crazy that they have the right social media social media but they still have to have a knack because they'll sell out one maybe twice but then and then it's done I still haven't won a lot of those people from that that stand up competition show oh yeah yeah yeah Last Comic Standing ran once than the ones that were good like Alonzo Bodden Eliza yeah the lies is probably the most successful out of that group yeah she's done more I think she's had more specials she sells out everywhere she does good size theaters she's selling out her she just sold out her whole tour she probably has the most success she works hard she does work hard that girl kicks ass like she doesn't fuck around she told me something so funny when she was on my podcast I heard this when Jamie still did it and she goes I have a great body you know kids with sweatpants on I don't think of well I don't know I don't know she will show it for god sakes we're skirt I don't know then she'd tell you you're some piece of shit for our show but I mean I don't what to tell her like yeah well she's funny she's a aggressive girl when she was on my podcast is the the fucking comments were hilarious like men either love her or they fucking hate her like I've heard the thumbs-up two thumbs down versus Eliza like on the podcast the thumbs up versus thumbs down she got like one of the worst ratios of anybody that's ever been on the podcast really yeah I enjoyed it I enjoyed talking to her I liked her I'm not threatened by confident I would say cocky women doesn't threaten me yeah but for a lot because I'm not threatened by confident cocky man I'm around them all the time worse doesn't bother me I don't judge you by it maybe I feel like it's silly sometimes with some people they're too confident too cocky or they're too dismissive of other people I think it's silly but I don't get mad at it I would have when I was younger yeah when I was younger someone that was like cocky or overconfident or just you know just I would just I feel threatened by it or be upset by it or judge them you know in a weird way where I'll connect all my own shit to them get upset at them yeah I know what you mean you know I definitely I definitely have trouble with attitude I'm thinking you know lucky or you know lucky we are to be in this yes your fucking mind it looks like to work well one of things about you Dom you're always super supportive of young guys and you oh and girls too you've always been like real supportive of thank you comics you know I think you should be you know I think so too I've learned a lot of that from you oh cool man that's nice to say I was thinking about Tiffany because Tiffany means a lot to me you know I taught her at comedy camp when she was a teenager and I've seen it really yeah I've seen it through a bunch of struggles yeah crazy lost their homes and she kept trying to keep her family together so I had her podcast and she said you know she said back in the day she goes I wanted to fuck you I said first of all Tiffany be like a goddaughter to me it never crossed my mind and it really didn't even though I think she's a beautiful girl and I said the second thing is I never take my pants in front of your said no I got this beautiful black girl going you call that a dick that's my biggest fear it's funny watching her blow up she's hilarious and she took to it like a duck to water men like immediately look at that confidence oh she's got massive confidence yeah but immediate like like almost like she feels like that's where she was always meant to be or just waiting for the bell to ring you know when she did Colbert honest to god I was sitting there crying I swear Brian happiness yeah that's awesome no jealousy I was bitter fuck how'd she get on the show and I I loved Colbert hi he doesn't even return my calls I've got Trump jokes too yeah that's all that show is these days right well I don't think it'd be on the airport for Trump it would be on the air I don't know they were dying they were they were way behind that with my Nielsen ratings all of a sudden but they were behind right they're way behind and then I went for it and when he called the president's mouth Putin's cock holster I was like holy Sh annek Wow leave he said that I'm here he went on this epic rant about Trump and then he said something about his mouth being Putin's cock holster Wow and I just and they beeped out cock yeah pretty obvious what he said but I'm sitting out alone what is going on with late-night TV yeah well the kimmells been on a run lately of crying and yeah breaks down like every night now my ratings it's really good for a he's a sensitive god good way to cut to commercial he's a legitimately sensitive guy that very nice guy I like Jimmy Kimmel is a very very good person like he's a genuine nice guy with a real heart and he really does care you know I remember he cried after the Vegas shooting he's from Vegas did he cry recently was the school shooting yeah but that was brutal those he's fucking there so would I go out with was there that night and she was at the Trop and all the people came running down into the truck don't you know so New Year's Eve I'm with Vegas shooter yeah yeah and people they had to stay there for a couple hours they had everything under lockdown because they didn't know who had guns and who didn't they didn't know it was one person or 50 people right and she's there she's at the Trop and she got kind of traumatized by it so New Year's Eve we're walking outside and all of a sudden she starts shaking and she was having an anxiety attack you know about being in a crowd so I was just fucking or trying to make her laugh but you know don't worry about it and then when we're you know the fireworks all I really care about is fireworks and you took that away from me because you're selfish feelings you know but I got her laughing anyway if the fucking the volume of them it's just it seems like every couple months there's some new one remember when Columbine we thought this is terrible right that's won't happen again yeah it's like there's so many now you know you get used to it what you said yeah it's fucking crazy and I don't know what the answer is you know I don't know if it's a tighter gun control I don't know if that would stop them because it would just make it more difficult to get guns but would that be enough I mean but we're not doing anything well interesting try something I don't know what to do I mean and there's also the number of people that are on psychiatric medication it's fucking crazy well I think that for the m15 s or whatever they are they should be are sold they shouldn't be I mean I really need that to kill a pheasant it's not a hunting gun really you're the guy who designed them said he was we made it for war yeah the real real guns for hunting are usually usually bolt-action rifles which means you have a round you have usually two or three in the magazine you have a couple or one in the chamber you put it in there you lock it in place you clamp it down and you fire a shot and then you have to bolt it again you have to use the the action again the shell pops out and another one goes in bolt that down and then you get another shot it's a very slow thing yeah it takes a musket whereas these a ours like tack tack tack tack tack or with the bump stocks they apparently the president wants a band bump stocks well the bump stock is oh yeah it's a stock where you pull back on it and apparently you push forward and pull back at the same time I might be fucking this up but the thing is the stock makes the the trigger go like that it's almost like an automatic weapon and the Trump just decided to ban those and there's a lot of people that are up in arms about him banning those like these the gun rights people don't want to lose anything they don't want to lose any rights they don't want to lose any fucking crazy-ass weapons they think that any slip is is eventually going to lead to them getting their guns taken away I follow a bunch of NRA people and gun people on Twitter and nobody's gonna take their guns away they think they are they think they are I mean I agree with you I don't think that's ever gonna come to that but the idea that tighter regulation is bad I don't think that's true I think I think first of all you should have to go through some sort of examination if you can go through exam you don't you can't drive a fucking car unless you prove that you know how to operate a car like someone has to be there with you that's an expert it's a driving expert who watches you they watch make sure you know what to do what do you do here at this light do you know how to hit the brakes do you stop perfectly do you look left and right before you turn all that shit is super important if you want to drive how the fuck is it not super important if you operate a goddamn firearm I know I don't understand I'd like the kid who bought I think the kid who did the latest shooting in Florida mm-hmm I think if I'm if I'm putting two stories together I don't know but apparently he was underage and that fake ID and still was able to buy it I don't know I didn't read that story maybe you know I did the story I saw the kids face and it's it's fucking insane and you hear all the stories about kids that were saying that they knew that this kid was going to be a school shooter anyway they were saying in in the past and then one of the things he wrote I wrote it on Facebook or something that he wants to be a professional school shooter and then two years later and he got visited by the FBI the FBI actually checked this fucking kid out talk to him about and decide he wasn't a threat how do you decide someone's a threat or not a threat well if you're talking to them they're a threat I mean they may be I can't talk to everybody but I would I would be suspicious of anyone that it took that much energy to go find how did they find him why would they go I would they would question yeah I think people were saying and he's a fucking psychopath yeah it hurts it's just sad it's just fucking sad that it's sad that anyone could do that it's sad that anyone would be hurting and so fucked up that you could take a child imagine you have a kid right you got a little doll Moreira a little tiny baby and he's just a cute little fella a little tiny baby and they don't know anything the most a tickle them and then from there one day that becomes us to a school shooter oh my god that's what people after take into consideration this isn't this boy this 19 year old boy who did that was a baby at one point in time he's a failed process a failed product whether it's through his environment his family his DNA all the above his life experiences all the pain the trauma mental illness all these various factors but that used to be a baby probably the cutest little fucker probably hold them and cut alone we'd go to sleep in your arms and one of the things has changed with me since and it changes a little bit every day I feel like every day I just get a little bit more compassionate and more standing and I work towards it it's something I really think about but having children I think of people as they used to be a child he has to be a baby I think of that with homeless people yeah she's lying there and they're all those blankets and stuff I think this was born this person was born to somebody yeah I was thinking that the other day I was a coffee bean and I knew homeless guy was there from the smell I was pouring cream into my coffee I wouldn't have smelled them do you wouldn't have right you were just talking about the day before the podcast your sense of smells no good good anyway the guy's smelled so bad that um he was dressed fairly normal he wasn't disgustingly dressed I had a look at him to me just to recognize like us guys homeless I looked over and he just fucking stunk it was rough I mean he just stunk and I looked over the guy sitting there with his head in his hands like this like he's probably just full of you know terrible anxiety or thoughts or depression or whatever it was but all I was thinking everyone pouring cream my coffee like that was someone's little boy yep Oh someone's little boy and now here he is he looks like he's in his sixties and he's all fucked up and smells like shit and he's sitting there in this coffee bean and he's sitting by himself with his head in his hands and everyone's avoiding him I was moving around him and yeah if you think a life like that he took a people like that it's easier to be humanized yes I like we were talking about lily and not to na Chloe again but this kids I was I was working the brokerage and I in Long Island and he comes in with his mom to see me and he said I don't think what Louis did was that bad I didn't rape her or anything I said well and what about if he did it to your sister he goes I'd fucking kill him I said well that should tell you something people you shouldn't kill them for that but you know if it bothers you enough you know that's somebody else's sister yeah you know and you know Louie apologized and I'm not trying to jump on him again but I mean you got to know how you'd feel about it when it was personal yeah well the Louie ones so weird that's very weird yeah so weirdest whenever it's not like you're with someone and you're making out and you pull your dick out and she grabs it and she not buddy I'm getting hard over here I mean this is this is not not in the act of intimacy it's just touching there's no not even verbal abuse the only touch yourself mayor is oral abuse like as in sound maybe you wait made weird noises you make that face too I wonder how many people make a Ric Flair when they come what's that you know when Ric Flair whoa no you're talking to the Rolex wearing diamond ring wearing jet flying please let me same Ryden he's a fighter no he's a pro wrestler that's what I meant yeah yeah yeah yeah it's fucking just he is uh he's an American iconic character not just a pro wrestler like an American I contact icon but Thursday well I'll talk about Ric Flair on stage and point the microphone in the audience and the audience just goes right there Nature Boy Ric yeah I don't remember him who is the guy that Muhammad Ali modeled his quiz it's gorgeous George he model him yeah you get credit to this guy that's professional wrestling no kiddin that's interesting Gorgeous George could be there was a lot of those guys back then yeah remember you remember killer Kowalski yeah I know him yes the claw could grab your head who was the one the Coco but Bobo Bobo Brazil lover Brazil did the coca and there was Bruno Sammartino interesting it was world champion how Muhammad Ali's fascination with pro wrestling fueled his career inspired MMA interesting Gorgeous George was crazy yeah interesting was it stupid ad you have to watch for the Olympics there boy I'm that Olympics is I think I'm gonna say this I think the Olympics are gross this is why I think the Olympics are gross I think it's a great opportunity for all those athletes I think it's great for people to watch it but I think it is a fucking disgusting money grab and all those amateur air quotes athletes don't get paid shit and these companies are making billions and billions of dollars off of them and I really wish they would all quit I really wish they would say fuck you pay me I really wish they would just go straight Ray Liotta they give you payment they get their their youth for that not only that the fucking companies they're so restrictive the IOC and all the people that are behind it are so restrictive and they are making ungodly sums of money ungodly contracts they're just giant contracts to air the the Olympics giant amounts of money to build these stadiums and set up these or these events and everything is about nationalism and national pride whether it's in Korea or Russia or whatever the fuck they do them but meanwhile the athletes don't get dick they don't get dick if you're lucky and you're Michael Phelps you become famous out of it and you get a bunch of commercials and endorsements and you make a shitload of money that way but how many Michael Phelps's are there there's a three or four I mean how many but how many in all the Olympics and out of all the Olympics Jamie Europe sports fan how do all the Olympics say like the Olympics this year well let's go the last one who the fuck came out of it were there a household name right now you've got Shaun White and maybe okay I heard of that guy the girl that won Kim as their last names last night or two nights before the real famous there's Lindsey Vonn that's just very famous it's very famous she used to date Tiger Woods that made her famous too plus she's hot that makes her famous very interesting name so yeah her she's a gold medal winner I believe how many other ones are there it's like a handful they can build a story around someone than the whole story but but when you get to the point where it's worthwhile to sacrifice your entire life and it actually pays off what is that what are the odds it's so fucking small but meanwhile people are tuning in to all of it they're making massive amounts of revenue from all of it and they're not sharing it with the athletes at all I think it's fucking gross they pretend it's amateur Tennyson amateur it's a goddamn motherfucking business that's the Olympics are well you can't basketball and football really n-c-double-a says student athletes shouldn't be paid because the Thirteenth Amendment allows unpaid prison labor what the fuck oh that's Shawn King this is breaking out this is uh find me another article well made one going around but there's a that's crazy don't really say that didn't really say that the Thirteenth Amendment which allows unpaid prison labor they cited in a lawsuit response to a Moses and that's what they use it's so disgusting they're so disgusting they're the same to me n-c-double-a the college football and basketball same thing to me hundred thousand people yeah fuck you pay those guys pay them pay those girls pay all those athletes you're making money you're making money and you're not sharing it with athletes they might as well be slaves they might as well be fuckin prisoners the Olympics NCAA all that shit it's just these no way there's no way you could do that fresh today have you started from scratch today or and said we're gonna get make billions of dollars and we're gonna give you all got all got so cool there's no way education imagine they did that with the Olympics today they said look we're gonna spend billions of dollars in athletes what are they gonna pay oh we're not gonna pay them shit they don't get anything money you're fucked you're out it used to be that you made money you're out but now they let basketball players play in the Olympics they like the NBA players because I think it was Russia was was getting close and beat and they beat us once in 72 I think I was that what it was they started thinking about it then when they we got where they were catching up to European players were catching up mmm they go fuck this we're gonna send over our brothers NBC Sports is about to make one point four billion dollars in 22 days thanks to Super Bowl in the Winter Olympics okay the Super Bowl at least is professional athletes I guess I get paid they get paid whether they get paid enough is up for debate I get that but the Olympics they're not getting paid dick and it's fucking gross it makes me angry and it's one of the reasons why I don't watch the Olympics I get mad at it you know I wanted to be in the Olympics at one point in time to fight I wanted to be in that when Taekwondo was being introduced the Olympics in 1988 well I tried out for the national team I got it to like the quarterfinals in Miami I won 3 fights and it was that was the last like my last uh my really last fascination with Taekwondo had kind of given up on Taekwondo really before it I'd started kickboxing already and I realized the limitations of Taekwondo was a the hands punching to the face Taekwondo you don't punch the face he punched the body and you kick to the face and kick to the body which is yeah it's a very different thing because it's so easy to punch them in the face comparatively and so hard to kick someone in the face so the the dexterity of the legs like for people that know how to kick it's just it's just you develop much more leg dexterity and you get way better at kicking and moving your legs but as soon as you fight a good boxer you realize how poor the like the balances between your hands and your feet and I had to really develop my hand techniques and so I was really concentrating on boxing at that point in my life like really learning how to box and learning how to punch correctly and learning how to put kicks together with punches because you just there's a bunch of stuff that you can get away with if someone's not punching you in the face that you can't get away with as soon as they start doing it and I was already kind of disillusioned because I was learning I was just learning that it was very flawed and then I started doing Muay Thai with leg kicks and I realized like what Jesus Christ like as soon as you kick the legs like this most of the shits out the window right it changes what's a billet what you can and can't get away with what do you think's the most lethal martial arts the best martial art to learn for someone for self-defense or even fighting them for beating them in the fight it's hard to beat wrestling because wrestling you dictate whether or not the fight stays up or goes to the ground right we're wrestling it's like in my opinion the best base but once you once you've passed that then it's about submissions so it's wrestling and then submissions because if a guy has wrestling he could take you to the ground punch in the face stuff like that but if the guy on the bottom is good at Jiu Jitsu he might still be able to submit you like the early UFC days hoist Gracie submitted much larger people like Dan Severn off of his back and Dan Severn was a real world-class wrestler at the time and hoist submitted him off his back with jiu-jitsu because he didn't know jiu-jitsu so I think wrestling the ability to take someone down is probably number one but jiu-jitsu is a very close second because the problem jiu-jitsu is if a guy knows how to wrestle really good and he can keep you standing up if he's better at punching and kicking he could fuck you up standing up and you'll never get the fight to the ground to use your jiu-jitsu because his wrestling could also keep the fight standing the wrestling dictates where the fight takes place that to me is like the most critical thing like you have if you're a wrestler you have the ability to take someone down you have the ability to stand up and you have the ability to keep someone from taking you down those are those are giant like that to be able to choose where the fight takes place is giant that's cool but when I was doing Taekwondo there was really no MMA no one had ever even invented it like I stopped fighting in 88 I think 88 or 89 I'm not exactly sure I was doing comedy at the time - when did you say we met we met in 93 I think or 92 might have been 92 so I was probably with Kim at the time yes yeah yeah yeah um yeah I was done fighting then I was done but I was still thinking about it I'm still think about it for years you know if everything went wrong how many fell apart for me maybe I'd take a fight you know when did you know the comedy wasn't gonna fall apart a couple weeks ago two weeks it's looking good I was driving one of my four four cars driving my one car over to the other car guys might work out sell all this and just live modestly yeah I don't know man I guess really I really didn't think it's gonna work out until I was on TV you know then I was like hey this might be all right yeah but that's a good thing though then not knowing it was gonna work out it's what keeps you hungry I think the worst thing in life could ever happen is to get an inheritance kind of takes the incentive away just y-yeah you're not scared if you're not scared about the future you're not scared what the fuck's gonna happen you have to that feeling of not knowing is awesome I mean that that feeling creates movement and anxiety and energy like some of my best sets I've ever had I mean the biggest jumps I've ever had in my life in my career have been after I had terrible sets and some of my best moments in life as a person have been after I felt terrible laughter I just i fucked something up or I did something stupid and I just like how could I do that what the fuck is wrong with me and then you feel like shit for a few days and then you emerge out of it like a phoenix from the ashes and you you're a better person because of that bad feeling like those bad moments like don't just drown them out don't take pills don't don't just drown them sometimes those bad moments are an incentive for you to move forward and progress I remember when I did The Tonight Show the first time it was not fun because it was like the imprimatur who's like Johnny yes and it was like who was that like it was terrifying I wanted to run into the woods and in Burbank and start a new life I swear to God I just I was so small patch of woods I was scared yeah I know but from the street do you know what I did Joe after after my set what when did it set at The Comedy Store oh wow yeah I just wanted to see the juxtaposition of the two and must have felt good oh great just to be back on my turf you know cuz that wasn't my turf they said Teddy Bergeron did that do you remember teddy bears Ron's economy store let me tell you this folks I know if I've said this before I probably have some repetitive fuck head but Teddy Bergeron at one point in time was one of the greatest comics that ever lived he was fucking incredible and he did a Tonight Show set and he we got on the piano and he was like singing on the piano and talking on the piano and it was magical magical and they said he went to the Comedy Store that night got fucked out of his head was stumbling into the streets and just out of his mind just had a problem with substances yeah I know I remember he would be is so drunk that we were at a club in Long Island and he sat on the edge of the stage and started crying and the audience thought that he was fucking around so I just started laughing oh my god okay Matt I didn't so that's hilarious and by the way his first set on The Tonight Show this is what I was told he did so much over time that they had to bump somebody and that's why he went to the couch wasn't he went to the couch because it was so great it was and he never did the show again as far as I know but I think he never did the show again because he fucked something up I think he got drunk nobody saw him I did that he did way too much time is that what it is yeah but they loved him like Johnny was loving him like how could he know Johnny Johnny was very supportive of mostly everybody in there so he was he was the greatest didn't Howard Stern hate Johnny Carson no did he really I think he did I think he hated him like I remember him talking about Johnny Carson being a terrible person a piece of shit yeah pretty sure I hope I'm not wrong with that the most nervous I ever got it ever for doing anything was doing Stern oh yeah I was terrified because you wanted to use an idol of mine I mean for me he was he was my generations Johnny Carson yeah cuz I didn't give a fuck about being on The Tonight Show to me I was a dirty comic I cared about I never came to see Joe yeah I like I like guys like Hicks and Kennison and dice and then Pryor and like that's not that tonight's show stuff was great I enjoyed watching like Jenny on or you on or someone who's that who could do that style and do it really well style is really hard for me I'd rather do improv but you used to do it well you were great on those shows I tried but you know but it's not you like at the Comedy Store killing no it's a different thing it's a different thing I just was never attracted to it just to me the five minutes the censorship the all this stuff is just like it it didn't mean anything to me I always think the coolest thing about your career is you did what you wanted to do I mean you did it basically you did a sitcom you did it like look look what the career you have now I mean it's like it's your it's only you and in that Lane you know what I mean it's bizarre that you do this announcing jobs and it's like they could be just that and you're already a success but you got stand up you got anything you want you know well yeah it's just like you said it's just things I enjoy I'm lucky that there's things that I enjoy their jobs yeah better lucrative that's always a good thing but the night before I did Stern for the first time I was shitting my pants I never never thought that nervous is fuck cuz it was to me it was like I can't even believe I'm really gonna do a show like to me like if they told me I was gonna do tonight job like alright I'll do it like I mean I would have been nervous I would have been would you do it now no I mean you can win you can have a good set no one and everything that but you're expected that well it's just I talk too much I talk too much already I talk too much so far I wanna go let's go play pool let's wrap this fucker up let's do it let's all shoot a couple games alright let's let's wrap this up and go play pool oh thanks for having me on anytime my
