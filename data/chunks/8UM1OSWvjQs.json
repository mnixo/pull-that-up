Brian Posehn ladies and gentlemen just got done doing the podcast you're hilarious as always thanks buddy Brian as well as dudes that I I've known for about probably 15 years or something like that but I've been down here since the nineties this is the first time we ever really sat down like a serious conversation yeah for sure well we talked when we work together yeah yeah but yeah nothing like that like a long two hours yeah that's fine yeah that's cool Brian is no longer in the pot Club and folks I'll be back three months completely sober that's gotta be a weird thing to be like I'm worried the metal comedians it's just somebody pointed out to me yeah you're right yeah but yeah definitely I don't do that many pot jokes but it all kind of came from a Platt place I mean most of those jokes were written while I was high and the thing the important thing is that he's the one that indoctrinated Doug Benson it's probably the biggest pothead comedian I mean nobody's connected more to pot as a comic than Doug that's like teaching Carrot Top about props but where do these two things together and make fun of that I would ever say worse but I mean it's bigger because carrot tops not spreading props all across the country and getting other people to do props so that's like a dog for that movie super high me yeah how many people got start smoking weed because of that movie but a lot yeah I bet a lot of people looked at dango what the fuck man he looks fine so this is if you with you're upsetting Doug bunch of monsters I guess yeah bet you did dude you spawned it Brian Posehn ladies and gentlemen thanks for be on the podcast man thank you appreciate it mmm this looks like that city in Seoul City witness oh yeah all this salt on the ground is actually when I get out of the tub the tank rather and it's also because I had one coin time back in the past I have a rupture in the lining and the salt water leaked out and got over the floor we had to wind up cleaning it out and doing a bunch of different things too tank from full lab flow lab technology so this all this shit on the ground is all just song [Applause] Neal Brennan thank you very much for beyond the poncho pleasure was all mine get you into the isolation do you know I'm getting I'm doing this in Venice and they're calling for you it'd be an awesome thing for you to sit and think up ideas there's no environment like that on the planet well you don't feel your body just gonna brighten your body and you're all inside your head some pretty close to that just walking around I'm so in my head that that I'm a I'm a I'm a human isolation well in your head in your head there no I'm fuckin hear it when does it kick in well it depends on how relaxed yeah you know how much you can let go it takes a while to get comfortable the experience cuz it's so weird I really got witness cry does that make sense you might cry have you ever cried not in there but in real life yes you have several times Wow
