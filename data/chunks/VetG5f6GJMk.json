I really enjoy ting is a podcast come for a podcast company podcast sponsor that what they decided to do is make their own cell phone company rent time on Sprint but do it their way do it do it their way with no early termination fees no contracts just sell people service on Sprint so you know you get anything excellent network and give them for a choice the best mobile phones available through Android and iPhone leave that I found out five on there and instead of like the way you do it at most places if you go to a one of the bigger name cell phone companies what you're doing is your rent sort of like leasing a phone like if the phone cost two hundred bucks its iPhone doesn't cost two hundred bucks bitch an iPhone cost six hundred bucks but you pay two hundred bucks and then over the course of the years of your contract you pay off the rest they don't do it that way ting if it says two hundred bucks it's because it's two hundred bucks that's it we're done here do you give them two hundred bucks they give you a phone that's a wrap like you see that iPhone five they had two hundred sixty bucks that's what it actually costs and then that shit is yours and if you want to leave you leave you want to come back come on back nobody gives a fuck all right what they're trying to do is sell you an excellent cell phone service at a reasonable price with reasonable rules and they also have it set up so you only pay for the minutes that you use if you use one minute a month that's what you pay for if you a hundred minutes a month that's what you pay for it's that's what's gonna happen in the future because all these fucking goofy rules where it's like you need to go over a hundred and twenty minutes and you got this fee because you got an overage fee and all that nonsense can you imagine if one of the big-name guys did that they would ruin everybody because all right oh yeah that makes a lot of sense let's go to the this other big-name place I think in the future that's the only were they gonna do it I really do I think ting is way ahead of the curve they're also ahead of the curve they had on their two-year anniversary they just for no reason just decided to

and an IT a human optimization website what we sell it on it as all things that we have found to improve you improve your mind improve your endurance improve your mood if we find things they prove to be good if we look at the research and it makes sense we post all that research along with references all the stuff that we sell whether it's the controversial things like alpha brain and shroom tech and new mood what you're dealing with the Alpha brain and new mood you're dealing with these things called nootropics what nootropics are is vitamins and nutrients that have been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive function it's very controversial stuff if you you know you google online you can find people that say the vitamins are necessary and they're bullshit they don't do anything for you nutrients all you need is what you get from your food do you know how much fucking weird grasses and moss you would have to eat to get some of the nutrients in something like alpha brain you're not gonna get it from your food man like is it better to have a healthy diet than just to eat a shitty diet and take supplements i've abso-fucking-lutely healthy diet is number one it's the most important thing but for optimization for optimization meaning making your body and your brain function at its very peak at its best when you feel the smoothest the longest the most often you can do that with supplementation better than you can without supplementation this is from anecdotal evidence my personal evidence would like my personal experience rather and it's also from research all the research available at on accom including our own double-blind placebo studies that we did on alpha brain we did one showed positive results were doing a much larger one now what we're trying to do it honor is to sell you the shit that we find that works as far as strength and fitness equipment the strengthen conditioning equipment we sell like kettlebells and battle ropes and weight vast steel maces all these different things are great for functional strength no bullshit's no gimmicks no fat loss nonsense if we find it it's got to work before we sell it and we look into it very very thoroughly we also have a 100% money-back guarantee on any of the supplements 90 90 days 30 pills the first bottle of 30 pills 100% money-back guarantee you don't even have to return the product we're

Rios you can rotate the stock we're in so whatever you need don't send it to you the first of the month you have to sit then go back on the fucking computer try for 90 days comes yeah the get on it program has been very successful tremendous go there catch a freak on Joey Diaz is here the Joe Rogan experience mooom shall lock lock boom Joe we motherfucking Diaz what's up my brother violating state law you an electronic cigarette in the house what am I gonna do I have a question for you but I wat it cuz I always I always have questions for you I forget to talk to you about a month ago somebody posted the mushrooms the quadricep mushroom cordyceps cordyceps there and shroom tech and they had like what this mushroom looks like and then 10 years and how it got fungi and this is what it does the inside your system that's all bullshit it does inside your system like inside your body what it does announce this shit look there's a lot of mushrooms people eat on a daily basis like fungus is a normal part of people's diets you know when you when you eat but if you eat shitake mushrooms you're eating a fungus it's reading something that's a fungus you know your whole body's filled with little growing organisms but no cordyceps mushrooms not going to grow inside your body and like make roots great fucking plants and come on those ads on Facebook they show like if you eat quarter-cent mushrooms well there's a bunch of different kinds of cordyceps mushrooms to the there's two different types in in shrimp export to different types of course ups mushrooms now when you do the shrimp export it's not that you get height I don't get height now I just feel it at the end like I'm like I look at the clock I'm like well usually I leave at this time when I got one more yeah you get an extra round or two we got one more yeah no bullshit me you know what it came from came from these high-altitude herders they were like moving cattle around and they founded these these when these animals would eat these certain mushrooms they'd be noticeable mostly more lively so they realize like it's probably something to do with oxygen production it's like I guess if you go to certain places of the world it makes sense that there's certain foods that would be good that grow in that to help you deal with certain aspects of the environment that's challenging you know like high altitude you know it's like go to Denver let's fucking go up the flight of stairs like whoa that's like whenever they have a UFC card in Denver I'm alright here we go fucking they had Ben Rothwell and Mark Hunt two dudes not exactly known to be triathletes good fight in Denver and it was a crazy fight man just a ridiculous crazy white report guys almost died they don't both almost had heart attacks the fighting of fifty five hundred feet above sea level you weight 265 fuckin pounds how much do you have to how long before it says it says six weeks to acclimate yeah what they say but I don't thankful I talked to a guy who lived there who was a triathlete and he told me that he moved there for his training yeah like there like a lot of those endurance athletes moved there he was in Boulder and he told me takes 3 years 3 full years before your body is like like right the right how you are right now if you're in Burbank boom right now Joey Diaz you would have to get to be this level of comfort with your breathing environment and with the oxygen level in the air it would take you approximately three years to get a hundred percent but you get pretty close within the first five when those fighters go to Denver how long they go two weeks there's a lot of like debate on that what they're thinking now is that what you should do is not train at altitude what they think now is that you should train at sea level but then sleep at altitude so if that's the case like you don't have to go anywhere like BJ Penn had one of those tents that he would set up in his house and when he was would go to bed at night he would sleep in this oxygen tent and it was like it simulated being at high altitude so that's what guys are using now they're using these tents it was funny because BJ set it up and it goes it was really funny as you said it up he goes he goes when I gotta sleep in a tent someone's getting their ass kicked he's setting up this fucking plastic tent in his living room you know it's a wild I was just in Utah in Salt Lake City and also elevation yeah you don't remember you just go out and do something this BJ's sleeping in tent back it up said Joey is that coming I got it I got Anthony Gonzales who is he I don't know he's just talking football player oh yeah a lot of guys do this now they sleep in these fucking tents I know when they play football in Devon but that's murder when people come and visit they gotta fly in on Monday and they get to practice the whole week the NFL does you don't get do because you got to do something just to acclimate you got a ramp up for that shit you can't and you should you should wrap up your your training in your cardio beforehand anyway just to deal with the fact that you're gonna like this some guys I don't have to do anything they're just in such good shape they get up to Denver they're they deal with it a little bit they feel it a little bit but they're in such good shape they can just push forward that's amazing when you walk around the city of Boulder per se and you walk around you're there for six weeks and you'll acclimate and everything or whatever they say and you start getting used to it and then you go skiing hmm and that's what you really find because there's a level on the mountains that it's just brutal mm-hmm it's just fucking brutal yelling 11,000 feet here's the fucking crazy thing a lot of people decide to eat up there and that's when you're in trouble really your body can't have that your body can't handle no shit a little while up it up down I'm talking I play 11,000 you could ski down it that's fine we ski then we get to the bottom we go up and you get your momentum and your ski and you get it's when people stop up there and they hang out for an hour neat they get out to to sickness I out the truth you know the high altitude sickness it's a motherfucker it's being seasick really it's like being seasick you just want to lay down it makes sense man yeah cuz living at 8500 feet you like when you go up a flight of stairs like any time we go for flight of stairs you gotta go oh like I'm never I never go up a flight of stairs and take a big deep breath but in Boulder don't take a big deep breath and you can imagine that like if you go higher than that go like 11,000 like 8,000 to 5,000 is a big difference so I gotta imagine 11 it's like some next-level next-level shit and and it's crazy when you're up there for a while you're tired like you don't have to do anything just talk to people up there it just puts your body through something because the first time I moved to Colorado I didn't go to Boulder I went to Aspen and all I felt like doing was sleeping and I was 18 I'm gonna sleep now at 50 right teen I didn't fucking sleep we slept a man for like three weeks all I could do is fucking sleep I couldn't take him em all wow it was just that heavy I passed out up there smoking pot the first day I took a big old bong hit picking me up off the fucking floor first day and asked for a Sunday more afternoon I went to some people's house over it was Galena Street they had an apartment up in tremendous we had a catch a fear factor executive in New York we had to catch her because she passed out on the street stepped outside of a bar this is after September 11th it was the the coolest time to be in New York man everybody was so goddamn friendly it was like less than a year since the attacks and were filming like maybe a year I don't say it's 2002 somewhere and so we're standing outside this this bar and I go who wants some of this come on pussies who wants some of this I pulled out a joint and they got crazy they go yeah we'll do it we'll do it with you Mike oh my goodness you guys are fucked like they don't have any idea like non-smokers have no I mean they might smoke we a little bit in college you know what the fuck you're getting into if no idea crazy sweet is oh my goodness so she took one hand and she's standing there and then just here eyes like slowly start to roll back and I see her body give in and we just rushed in and Carter were like whoa and then we call the ambulance yeah yeah didn't know what was going on she had had a few health issues too so we're a little worried like something might be going on other than the weed you know so we called her call an ambulance for her but it's weird watching someone blackout from weed you know I told that story about that one person in college that she took one hit of a joint or a bong or whatever it was she stood up and just started running as fast as she could into the bathroom and trips over the bathtub and smashes her head into the wall and she had no idea why I said she said her body just took over and she couldn't she didn't know what she blacked out and she just started running that should be the commercial we [Laughter] nothing's for everybody but anymore nothing's for everybody including you know fucking cats you know I know lady's allergic to chickens she's like I love chickens but I'm allergic to them what the fuck are you talking about you're allergic to chickens are you how you allergic to chickens how does that even happen can't even pick up a chicken she I was a kid I was allergic to dogs like a motherfucker I mean really doctor I had to go to a doctor if I had contact with a dog but you're not like that now over the years I just kept playing with them I couldn't live like that I couldn't live like that normal that's when she was a horrible way to live if I went to somebody's house as a child and they had a collie or something it's khalili yeah collie you know when you were kid and somebody got a collie that's it that's lassie motherfucker you know that's as good as it gets and my godmother had a collie my mom you can't go now I got a fucking going out I see him they call them lassie and I would hug him in an hour later my eyes would be like fluffed and I got punched in the face both of them Wow and they make me wash my hands after an hour they go to the hospital they put some whatever and I they tell me have to fuck with the dogs I eight times I said dogs are my fucking thorn in my side when I was a kid from getting bit I got bit in the face I got bit in the leg I got I kept getting bit Oldman pinches kept biting me German Shepherds are my bike kids because kids have grabbed their face no I never asked them I fear I had such a fear of them and then one time I'm like Spanish ha a guy used to walk past me every day in the summer and he had two dogs and he would say don't tell a lot of my dogs don't talk to my dog okay cuz I was trying to work over the fear I knew that somebody said you got to play with them not they're gonna keep biting you and bow after a summer one that and say a lot of the dogs like the dogs are bought by and the female came back and bit me in the fucking leg so this is that time like I haven't been scared of dogs at all at all well there's some people that have bad dogs though there's some people that just have bad dogs they don't they took didn't take care of the dog they raised a shitty dog and the dogs dangerous that's a fact listen man thought was just you know you can't every day we hear about a dog attack or some shit you don't fuck well it's weird we're living with animals we've got this weird animal that we allow to live with us and you know it protects you which means what protects you means protection from other people I mean one of the last time you heard about a dog protecting someone from an animal it's pretty rare right they're protecting you from other people and so you got a dog that's trained to bite people which is very strange animals that you have around you that are essentially like trained weapons trained to go after people like when people have those attacks Shepherds remember when George Foreman when George Foreman fought Muhammad Ali he brought his German Shepherd to Zaire and it was this big deal because the black people that lived there the at the actual Africans that lived there fucking hated German Shepherds because German Shepherds are the dogs the cops a cop said so they saw George Foreman as like the enemy and muhammadi played on that like a motherfucker he played on that like a motherfucker and realized that Georgia fucked up by bringing this German Shepherd with him to Africa and that's where the ollie boom bye-yay ollie boom bye-yay a lot of that had to do with Georgia well the only fight in Africa just him yeah in Philippines he fought Joe Frazier races yeah Manila yep the Thrilla in Manila that's the place where he pointed the gun on them from the bottom Joe's phrases on his balcony and shit get in the Sun and Bob well he said Joe Frazier and he pointed like I started this pistol at him did he really yeah it's crazy you know Milo he was crazy in a funny way I'm saying like he was crazy in a funny way wolves I hear was you know that video I showed you James Brown uh-huh the first time I came in your pocket that's where the video was taken because it was George Foreman against Muhammad Ali Don King said wait a sec I ain't stealing enough on this fight I might as well get a musical performance get a bunch of motherfuckers out here steal from them too and I just robbed a bunch of black people all at once right right so he robbed he got the spinners he got he got James Brown he got all these black bands to go to fucking Zaire and perform as a music festival celeea cruise he got the funny all-stars he got a who well he got like just all these black bands and what happened he probably just stiffed me shit he probably just stepped them to he's like I didn't make enough money no gonna cancel that fight what I think something was wrong with that fight hook it up something happened it was gonna get pushed back oh really he had the music already set up is very interesting that that I they made a movie about it called soul power and that's who's the guy that says lovely day lovely day Bill Withers I don't remember yeah Bill Withers is in that in that movie fucking tremendous that was uh they made a documentary about that fight to write when Kings watch like pieces of I never watched the whole thing good not bad you know as much as you could watch those but there's a great picture of Muhammad Ali with Bill Withers you know the guy sings all those great love songs you don't know with us and he's got his shirt off in Africa the fucking steak and eggs and Muhammad Ali is just dropping now it's talking you know about the fight and Bill Withers his next to him and he won't look up he's just eating this fucking steak is so yummy for your tummy he won't look up no shirt on bill with his fucking tremendous that was one of Don King's first fights was it really yeah it's apparently one of his first ventures according to Wikipedia as a professional boxing promoter and he managed to get Ali and Foreman to sign separate contracts saying they would fight for him if he could get a five million dollar purse so and then he took that and then he went to this other company I'd go to an outside country for the event because have the money so i ears president ready for this name Mobutu say say Seco asked if the fight could be held in his country and eager for the publicity for such a high-profile event blah blah blah blah blah and they put together a bunch of different investment different companies invested some Panamanian investment company British company bunch of different companies and they all coughed up the cash and threw it through it together what a fucking fight that was - I was surprised what a fucking fight that was that was one of my Muhammad Ali's greatest performances ever because nobody thought he's gonna win nobody nobody people don't understand what he or just when he was 70 - oh brother 74 Wow people don't realize what a motherfucker George Foreman was back then he was a motherfucker you know you hit hard and he was like a silent Ally but you didn't do a lot of talking but he was just thugged to the max he was so dangerous when he fought Joe Frazier and to picked him up with a punch he hit Joe Frazier so Hardy went up into the air he was just a different thing you know Joe Frazier was no walk in the park either fuck those are three dudes there's some scary fucking heavyweights I think Joe Frazier is a really scary guy with that fucking left hook to his it hits you like a fucking bomb yeah okay yeah it was a come over hook yeah he was like tremendo be good guys it's hard to do that like to just come up like that BAM he throws whole body it's whole body I never seen just fucking that hooked it he knocked Muhammad Ali down with oh what a picture-perfect punch he was just swinging into that thing even if you knew it was coming yeah even if you know once you saw I'm ducking like that once you saw him taking that little step that little crotch whatever that's call he would do that shell to that Philly shell where he put like one hand up one hand down and bobbing and weaving and coming in whipping shots Joe Frazier was a motherfucker bad wasn't we used to go to Philly we used to drive past his gym I'm away from the a plan a but he lived at his gym before he died yeah any but broke in the end look the amount of money that these guys make for the time look they're talking about five million dollar purses for Ali informant for the time you have five million dollars back then that is a a lot of goddamn money but guess what you live like you got five million dollars so you're a buying fucking Cadillacs and paying for this and paying for that meals here and jets there next thing you know five million dollars doesn't even make it to the 80s and you know the brothers are showing up at the door my long-lost cousin yeah listen man we got adventure and this motherfucker can't go wrong Bob shot some white neighborhood first year gonna make 30% of your investments second years 60% of estimate and they just hit you with some crazy speech how many of those you ever had to deal with three oh you get them all the time I had to deal with one recently movies TV shows you get them consoles your beatings man I'm not a movie producer all you have to do is give us a check and we'll do the rest you don't have to do anything you'd have to worry about yes I do I have to worry about it no no no you don't have to worry about it no no I do have to worry about if I give you money I'm gonna worry about it get out of here you crazy idea does the reason why they have banks okay go to the bank if you have a really good idea and you have credit go to the fucking back if you don't have credit I gotta assume somewhere along the line you've already made some poor looking choices I don't want to be involved in that people have this everybody has this idea that they they're gonna figure out how to circumvent this time art system of Hollywood they were gonna get to Joe Diaz if I can get to chhoti as I know Joe Diaz been counted on the road if he can give me just $2,000 and I could start this film you know Quentin Tarantino this is my my ramaa Kevin Smith made clerks and and they just think that all they need is a couple grand from Joey Diaz Joey Joey Joey Joey you can't go wrong okay nobody makes movies like me okay Joey they just don't want me in they don't want me and Joey dick don't want me and Joey Diaz they want to keep me on the outside so you get them for your time it's not even that you get them for money it's you get them for your time yeah look at you you're living through you you're busy yeah you swamp there's no more no someone I keep telling people that to get mad at me no yeah they don't understand when you have children there's no schedule I can't count on my schedule bro ten twenty she wouldn't get off my fucking lap watching one two three videos on YouTube at 10:30 yeah she went to pick her up go away what yeah what will you fuckin talking about I'll be back in a couple hours you don't have no fucking idea what it is to and I went to get to go into the room at 9:30 to get out of it I was gonna get out of the early got a little bitch open the gate I I heard those stomping and like there's there's no argument she just puts hands put youtube on I gotta sit there with a one two three four or five you know and then she again daddy okay well the problem people ask you to do things too is that you gotta do this shit for yourself okay the way to do it is not to go through other people and ask people to pick you up and help you that's not how it works it doesn't work that way okay everybody thinks they're gonna figure out some fucking joke shortcut because they know you or they know this guy or that guy this there's no shortcuts in creating something just figure it out bitch I love stand up because there's one part of me doesn't need anybody I'll even open mmm right here this is my tools for stand up and a person we're gonna go to Bob's fucking coffee house on North Hollywood and do three minutes you know me I don't give a fuck yeah when we talked about having a band that somebody came on here and said that it was the toughest thing in the world for a band to stay together you got four people personalities you know you get these people that come to you now and I was breaking it down for you on the plane it'll say hey Joe how you doing my name is this read my script do you like it yeah we're gonna get eight million dollars and then you go okay when you get it call me I really like this script something you're interested in whatever three days whole thing you do get a call and they say hey we're making a movie but guess what we didn't get two million dollars we got two hundred thousand dollars so instead of you getting ten thousand a week you're gonna get a hundred a day and it's gonna be a hit we're gonna make it happen not another ten they run out of money for marketing mmm and editing and the whole fucking things to your movie ends up in YouTube they don't have a legit schedule so you have to work Saturdays and fucking Sundays you know those people that are involved in those low rent movies they're a fucking nightmare and it's their dream and I get it's your dream but don't include me in this fucking thing because you want me to do everything cheap on my end all the hours and it's your fucking dream if it's that much you're dreaming do me a favor if we get the 200 G's go get another 300 G's and make this fucking work well not only that you can find other actors out there that will do it for cheap there's people out there that just want to act sort of like a comic will go to an open mic night there's certain actors to just want to do something to put it on a real go find them there's a lot of talented people out there that are not working as far as like acting goes there's a lot of fucking people that can do it there's a lot of lovely people it's just the I just have a problem people like asking you to help them do it like I get it from comics all the time to just looking for a break what are you talking about you see you're not you're not gonna get a break from another comic the way you get breaks is by going onstage and being funny like go to an open mic night be funny the club will say hey Joey Diaz you're fucking funny we would like you to come here more often the audience really enjoyed you next thing you know some manager says you know what Joey Diaz you're really funny we would like to think about taking you on as a client and that's how it works like a comic coming along is not gonna make you funnier and then the people that do that they always have a distorted perception of how good they are already you know those those kids that are asking for a break the kids that want you to help them hey Madge need a break if I could do sf4 you really help my like and that's not you don't you don't go the Doug Stanhope show and ask for a fucking guess all our Doug will probably put you up dr. Potter all right 2:15 start go up front Doug will push a parking open Micah and his first time onstage he'll do that in front of like a crowd in Norway or something but that stand-up you know it's not normal yeah you have to do it's amazing what people you know we weren't like that thank God we knew that this took work and hard we knew that this to what wasn't gonna happen in one night I was old enough already when I started I was longing the truth already that I knew this was just not gonna you know you just didn't walk onstage and things happen and people come here and they call Desperados where they just do don't come up to you for a guest then you're gonna ask him what is this gonna do for you Ryan how's this gonna fucking change the way it's like I've never been to much of a hangout I don't believe in that I never believe in that shit you know I believe in doing this spot if I go to the economy shows I'm doing a fucking spot final goal I don't go to the improv my name isn't on that list the Hangout there's no for me there's no no no no because if you come up to Joe Rogan Redman or Jamie and go hi Jamie my name is Joey Diaz I'm a fucking count I'm a funny comic Jamie's gonna say are you going up tonight because we all want to watch it I love to laugh but you're funny let's go no I'm just here hanging out yeah that's fucking funny if you're not on the list that's not funny or they don't know about you yet there's a possibility though no no people that go to the improv that's it they'll tell you dog you got a network what network network on stage I've networked on stage yeah when they laugh and I walk off that's network well not only that when you're a comic you're sort of like a fruit or a vegetable in that you're you're growing and then you get a one day you're gonna be ripe and when you're gonna be ripe everyone's gonna know about it people find out about you people people found out about everybody they found out about you they found out about Hinchcliffe I

question with your animals I know you don't watch it but you gotta watch this shit there's a lot of affect you I watched that real sports with buffa Bruce Buffer yeah see the story before that you know horses know how they juice it if you think Vandelay in jail with juice little fucking nines what they do you know many horses died an aqueduct race trail loan in January this Jesus from steroids 26 well that's what all those like equipoise remember equipoise bodybuilders would take that is a horse tear equi is like whore equine it's about horse I'm asleep but doing this you're right steroid my brother look it up there beyond aquatics aquatics they give them decade' Roblin for germans they give really yeah well 26 horses in one month for weeks divided by 26 that's a lot and then that I'm watching this and I had to go to the track I had to go to Santa Anita that Saturday for a kid's thing they paint your face in the middle and write the kids on horses I was looking forward from me you know what I ain't going I told my wife that my own boycott that shit I said it she was Joey you gotta go you already make commits mr. kids I went up there third race fucking horse died the heart attack to fall down they just bro they're just dead dying on the track again ha they've just juicing them to the gills for the gills bro speaking of juice to the gills pull up that video that I put on my Twitter page yesterday about the strongman guy breaking his back see that he didn't break his back apparently he's okay what apparently is okay his body failed in the middle of lifting what they call an atlas stone and Atlas stone is like a globe like a giant globe but it's a rock and that weighs like 300 plus pounds and this guy's hoisting this rock up on to these pedestals and he's in the middle of Helena's rock up on the pedestal and I guess he blacked out from the strain I guess he was straining so hard that was like he was getting choked because like he didn't have any oxygen his brains just boom he falls down in this fucking huge boulder lands on look at this dude check this out look at the size of this fucking boulders voicing it up he's trying to get it up there [Applause] call fucking 9-1-1 right now why is that funny why you laugh because III won't watch the video but I was watching the guys okay the guys okay everybody thought that he broke his back and that was the the title of the video but apparently what happened was he just blacked out and really had nothing but cuts and bruises um even went on to finish the event which is crazy you know I don't know how the fuck the guy did it three hundred plus whatever the fuck it is pound huge thing landed on his body I don't know how the hell you survived that I'll ask you some steroid questions sure is deca still relevant do people still do all these steroids I talk about from the 80s like anavar and withdrawals this I'm sure if you're in bodybuilder circles you know it's not for MMA fighters and what mfa MMA fighters get popped for more than anything it's testosterone just because you can get regular testosterone now so easy there's so many people that are getting testosterone replacement therapy prescriptions they like it's gonna like 100 or something set in the last three years more I probably more probably more chiropractors yeah fucking making a killing tire practice they're the ones who do it the most they what prescribe to what they do is what they do is they get a doctor in house uh-huh you get some slub like the medical marijuana doctors retires wife it's a lottery yeah you ever go to a medical marijuana doctor they're all over 60 I won't for the great one a banana peel they don't give a fuck they've already been sued any times when I give a fuck you're not gonna get sued for this shit like that one guy that gives us the weed prescriptions that has he's the best he's the best he's the one that shows up with you and fights the court and tells us not only that he went to jail yeah he went to jail lost his practicing with the jail in the 90s he was one of the first adopters but uh yeah you know what we talkin Oh the chiropractor I brought it I didn't smoke but I didn't either half a cookie yeah I hear him don't get me wrong I did have nothing wrong I'm a fan so uh they what you do is you partner up with a doctor you put her in the office uh-huh you go upstairs you draw blood you come downstairs a week let your no one testosterone yeah you need a real doctor to do that because you need to get all your if you're gonna fuck around like that you got to get all your your levels measured your thyroid level measured your idea they I mean they're real doctors Joan but I didn't know what they're doing yeah they send you to they do all the paperwork and you go upstairs with the test and then they read it to you they prescribed the blockers they grab everything all at once it's just you're working you're working very closely with the chiropractor and the chiropractor is not some guy who walks around with sandals right this guy is six foot six 292 pounds fucking 90% yeah if I show you this chiropractor here we go oh yeah oh yeah that's the man motherfucker you know chiropractors it's a very controversial science if you want to call it a science practice you know some people believe in wholeheartedly some people think it's total horseshit have you sat with them for a while no solitude I got a good card I have a good I have a good friend to count but he has a bunch of things in his office that I also like he has like a really good massage therapist he works on stretching with people but it was like he's big on posture like a lot of things that I know about posture come from him like he explains it and like some no bullshit terms and he he also explains like like your whole like when people stand this is what's wrong with slumping I always thought slumping just looks sloppy he goes no it's putting undue pressure on certain areas their spine your spine when you sit up straight and you stand up straight your spine supports itself in a straight line but anytime you move head forward you're putting all this pressure like an uneven point like in the middle of your back you're but essentially we're supposed to be like dogs we're supposed to be walking on all fours you know there's a reason why chimps most chimps walk on all fours it's like they don't have back aches it's like it's a better way of moving when human beings start standing up apparently the flaws in the design of the back began to surface like we're not done yet like what eventually the body as it stands like now with this back issues that most people have from picking things up most likely the body's gonna evolve over the course of the next million years or so and do probably a much stronger version of a back in the future now the kettlebell training has helped your back oh yeah for sure it says it basically says about people's backs um when you start kettlebell training your back becomes they use this word resilient yeah well you get muscle all the the whole look if you feel someone's back if you go and like feel the actual back muscles themselves if you have more stronger back and also supporting your spine it just makes sense if you practice proper posture and you have more muscle and stronger muscles supporting the core of your body then you can resist movement unexpected movement like say like in jiu-jitsu class or something like that if like you get yanked to the side back and forth the stronger your core is the more you're protected from that you know like like if you roll the guy's got a really strong core like judo guys specifically you can't move those fuckers around man their core is so goddamn strong so if you're trying to like lean against their core compress their core it's like either flip them over or sweep them their core is so goddamn strong it's like they're pillar the what connects their body together is just you can't get through that fucking thing wrestlers same thing especially greco-roman guys their upper body and their core so fucking strong from throwing bodies around all the time and that's sort of what kettlebells mimic just throwing things picking things all wasting things with momentum are all that stuff that all builds core they're all builds when everybody likes to call core but people do sit-ups and leg lifts and shit get the fuck out here with that you don't need that you need heavy kettlebell swing those motherfuckers and press them and do windmills that's where you get strong my weight loads wait do I increase the way to avoid creeps the reps work increase the work okay the more we fight you listen you can do 45 pounds for an hour or you can do 55 pounds for 40 minutes what that's all in how much you put in versus how much you get out as far as for health benefits when you go heavy the problem is your risk injuries when you go like 55 pounds 70 pounds 90 pounds once you get that gets a little squirrely because you're hoisting a lot of goddamn weight and you're carrying it in all these fibers and tissues you straining when you're doing like 55 pounds or 45 pounds it's not that much weight so you can get in a lot of reps and you get it exhausted like that that's what I do get to the point where at the end my form sucks once my form starts to stop I step back yeah that's that 14 and like I do I try to do 10 sets of swings infinitively you know times 12 sometimes I'll do nine and I rest a minute I'm on a minute timer then I do another 1416 then I rest a minute another 12 15 I go with my body right once I get done at once I do 10 of those 45s I I do the single ones mm-hmm and I do 15 of those like seven to one and I switch it to eight in the other and vice versa Christ still with a minute by the time I get to the 14th one I can feel my form starting to fade that's when it's over pick up the 235 and I walk around the block like I can't take it no more for my workout that's my posture that's it that's all rate workout listen I've read I've read extensively I hang out with you I have a friend who has a coach and he goes the thing about kettlebells is though forgot that 50 the less is the better but go with your body know what it tells you so they started a program at this place now five days a week cattle bells 20 minutes a day you guarantee 10 pounds in one month to lose a certain diet and then bonus really I just haven't been able to grab it on the road Thursday Friday Saturday but I'm home the next three weeks and I'm gonna work on it I'm gonna go in there you can either go at night or in the morning 20 minutes it's just it's great work you know it's great work for your body when you would you do it it combines all the benefits you get from lifting weights with all the benefits that you get from doing cardio you can get it all together in one movement it's just you force your body to do shit and if you do you know the workout that you're talking about right there that's a good work good work it's a very good workout and then I like how you're ending with the farmers walks I open up with the farmers walk that's a good way to one is with the farmers walk instead of I walk I get I pull them down I rest a minute pick them up and just walked as much as I can sometimes I make it to Burbank Boulevard oh yeah why not it's 10 o'clock at night I'm not doing nothing why not if somebody you know mug you by bang and I like doing them bro in the mornings I park my car in front of my house go on my truck I got the kettlebells in my trunk got to boxing gloves I got shin guards I got a yoga mats awesome because sometimes I'll go to fucking North Hollywood Park mm-hmm that's why I think I got I killed my meniscus or was that North Hollywood because I walk that thing and then do the kettlebells and they got that one hot corner over there that's always 150 degrees I don't know what it is about Hollywood Park that it's beautiful the walk is beautiful but there's a dip where the Sun even at night that shines even at night the Sun shines there in that corner well yeah I carry I liked it I like to do the kettlebells outside yeah and I do them inside I get anxiety I get hot I can't breathe I do them outside under the Sun I blasted my way from 9:15 the 10 o'clock my body's burning shit all day you know what I just got from my kettlebell what a bowling ball carry-on bag for an airplane because you can carry 50 pounds you take 50 pounds with you and check it so that check this fucking cannonball I throw it in there the TSA is gonna shit their pants they try to pick up this little bag it's that big it weighs 50 pounds it's a great fucking idea yeah check it you just check it they get mad at you but whatever our 35 55 yeah 35 is good look that Keith Weber kettlebell cardio workout that they sell it on 35 pounds you do it it's a tremendous workout I just you just keep going he just keeps going just over and over again all in the beginning first couple minutes it's kind of easy but then you get 5 minutes and 6 minutes and you're like oh shit you realize you got to do this for 40 fucking minutes holy shit things you think would be easier clean press with 35 pounds it's nothing right and not when you're exhausted when you're exhausted when you keep going your legs are on fire the next day barely be able to touch your toes so you can travel with one of those throw that video on and have a great workout but for most people what the most important thing is just building up slow don't try to get it all like I haven't worked out in five years so today I'm fucking running the mountain I'm gonna do click no no go light do a little bit of work today but be consistent that's the key be consistent like a little bit of work one day relax rest a little bit more work out the next day relax rest chart your progress and then what you said listen to your body look I could finally do a technical get up a Turkish get up no I technical get up in jujitsu I can finally do it after a year practice in hotel rooms five a day I would doing my right side and I'm a nut dog right you do know I'm retarded half what people know that I'm a little stupid I'm geeky you know I don't like I don't like being bad at something and since we got the comedy work that ethic I know that you could turn anything in life into something if you just keep showing up yeah if you just you know like for me to Jitsu has been I suck Joe but I can finally do the whole gym hip escape that fucking I'm a black belt in HIPAA escapes to me today that's what I do I'm a hip escape expert that's what I work on you know this games a huge bro fuck and when you learn how to doing for you know what I was doing and it salami taught me sometimes all just taught me in different and I put it all together on my shoulder and now at least I could pick up my ass and push it all the way back for me those are little things you know I wish I was better but I know if I keep going to jujitsu twice a week which is what my body can handle eventually I'll get something on bar eventually because I got funny with comedy I was no fucking to slip Magoo in the beginning I just kept showing up go you just gotta keep showing the fuck up that's half a life that's half a life and what gives a fuck how I'm not looking for a black belt I'm not even looking beat nobody up I'm just looking to go to learn Turkish get up I could do with 10 pounds the Turkish get up I'm up to this point where I put my arm down I put my knee up and I just go up to my elbow and I go down I do ten of those bro but I don't even go out with I've been doing a fake months kettlebells 10 pounds turkeys get a bitch but I'm still doing it right what would happen if I woulda took 35 you know me dog I get that I wouldn't be here right now my shoulders being my fucking halo so but at least I know this going in because because of the lesson I got from comedy that it don't matter though just keeps you yep dog keep showing some people you chumps stay on some days you don't want man for some people it's like me when we did comedy there was eight people who had a chance there was another six who were funny but they had day jobs because they were married who I had children then you had two people who do it as a hobby that every once in a great while they drove to a gig and then you got three people that just had mental health issues yeah okay so she showed up every week and they were nice enough but she knew there was something wrong there and for them it was the way this is for me with jujitsu I'm not looking for them me they're not looking to be on NBC all they want to do is one time in their life make somebody laugh how special is that that's huge and they go down and you miss those guys I miss those guys when my scenes in Seattle even here and then lay there's people that you see them and they're a pleasure to talk to because they don't want an agent they don't want to be on movies they're just having fun they work at Universal City in the daytime as the hope very there's very few of those most of those guys have dreams that just never manifested themselves but a lot of them never material I meant a lot of guys that bro they were proud of their job they just thought somewhere in their life that they could be a stand-up and they just didn't want to die without trying it right and then they did it and become addicted how many people go to jiu-jitsu it becomes addicting yeah stand-up definitely becomes Dick's and it becomes it becomes addicting and it's like addicts where you see those guys are scrambling outside they can't wait to get on stage and like even guys are bad they'll see a guy who's up there killing like you be able to stay on like man he's supposed to only be doing 15 minutes motherfuckers or 20 minutes like what do you care what are you gonna do you're gonna go up after Joey Diaz what are you gonna do you're an open mic ER and you're upset like they think somehow another thing I'm on the non-paid regulus but you're not getting up until 2:00 in the morning you know how it works this is what you do you're a novice a non-paid regular you get up after everybody else that's what you do if there's anybody fuckin crazy as that people should know this you wanna you were on a TV show and you were not a regular which by law if you're on a TV show you're allowed to go in there bump bitches even the Bell yeah I'm saying well not only that I showed up every night every night I was there I think this lesson I learned about this whole thing from you it was news radio on Fridays you got there 11:00 in the morning wardrobe stupidity laughter food and then they either clock your shoot you'd be strolling in there at fucking 11:30 bro I respect you for that to this day that meant more to me and you didn't need it $15 it's not like you had 19 kids you need the 15 fuckin dollars I'll tell you the truth being passed as a paid regular at The Comedy Store meant more to me getting on TV shit me too when I was on a TV show when I was on news radio one of the things I loved about you come to visit me I was like finally there's another motherfucker that doesn't belong here because I was I was always wandering around like one day they're gonna tell me to get the fuck off TV but until now somehow or another I'm on TV so Joey would show up I black come here man hey come on let me show you what this is just where they keep the food wander around the set Joey would show up at the set and Joey would be sitting they had an executive VIP suite and the VIP suite they had shrimp cocktails and delicious hors d'oeuvres and they had it catered a dude who you know had like one of those Mumford & Sons fucking facial hair things with a beautiful tie a thin skinny time he'd be like serving people shit and it would be all these NBC executives and Joey fucking Diaz with a leather jacket would stroll in and feast he'd be sitting there with a fucking paper plate with like 15 shrimps on it oh my god is that your friend can I ask you something has ever been a week

of those small towns and he became the man became a mayor there now he's on Facebook and I think I went back and forth with him at one time I thanked them and asked he says he still does Konami once a month in this town he went to like imagine the mayor's doing stand-up in your town yeah that's me be a mayor for a long time there's a term limits on being a man no cuz the man from North Bergen mayor Sacco has been there fucking at least fucking ten years to say is term limits on there you can't there's no term limits on Supreme Court justices right and no it was something that people don't like it's different in places in Ohio and Cincinnati the term limit is two successive four-year terms it's different in different places apparently huh that's got to be a thankless fucking job being the mayor of a town trying to keep everybody in order there's crime in this town mayor fuck I'm gonna stop the crime and stop people from stealing shit doing the bad did it might Island Jersey put cameras up around the city that set my communism why fucking come from the dog yeah it was on you in the city on the street you know Camden you know camera all that police officers anymore Camden is so broke there's just rampant crime police officers so you know if they did they'd just put cameras up everywhere everywhere it's um Robo Cop shit there they're like living in the future I got a secret for you motherfuckers I knew Camden was the real deal in 1978 I couldn't believe what I saw and what'd you say I saw anarchy I've been brought in one time on the street in a drug deal one time in my life cuz I get dragged on the street and drug me I was in Camden New Jersey they don't fuck around in Camden bro Pennsauken can then that's a complete different world I got robbed for a pound the coat I pound the weed I had to go answer to people that gave me money investors I didn't go pay these people back and sell weed I had to do what I had to do I fucked up but they robbed me man they sent me to fuck up Camden is the poorest city in the country and it has the highest rate of murder in the country no shit they got no cop on the street in animals and in New Jersey we played them one year in basketball and Dennis still I'll never forget there's a coach in our high school that's in a wheelchair he got paralyzed Dennis still went up to him to spit his fucking face dawg in high school when you spit in the handicapped dudes face Jesus you ain't fucking around you want to hear a crazy crime statistic Camden New Jersey has a crime rate of 78 percent per 1000 residents so for every 1000 residents 78% of them are gonna experience crime 78% that's like how much crime do you experience in Burbank 0% did you get 78 he got robbed by Dracula this fucking guy yeah he was probably really loud and it's not I know Camden I had never seen anything like that I had a buddy a basketball player buddy I was from the Pennsauken and I went down to visit his family once that left there of my fucking jaw dropped and I knew not to go back down I read all these Kansas statistics now and I'm like no shit that place was the edge of hell 30 fucking years ago I can't imagine what it is now yeah Matt Taibbi wrote an article about it I'm tweeting it right now he wrote an article about candy saying it's called apocalypse New Jersey a dispatch from America's most desperate town no jobs no hope and surveillance cameras everywhere the strange sad story of Camden population it's a good question what if it's like 14 people you know there's a lot of fucking people what surrounds Camden brother take a look for you uncle Joey whoo there's a lot of shit around New Jersey it's it's near Atlantic City right right right right it's I thought it was near Philadelphia - mm probably yeah it's across the Delaware River from Philly there's 77,000 people if you don't want to get fucked up don't go to Camden Jack don't buy weed don't do nothing I got tricked there used to be this gas station North Bergen went from called Putnam when I became after my mom died I had an inside guy and I robbed him once a month like a fake robbery you know saying we'd go hit him in the head he go down we'd take a thousand and all he wanted was an 8-ball he was a little half on the retardo fake robbery all tremendous I worked at Putnam fuel everybody from that high school worked at Putnam fuel and you robbed him to death until they fired you Ernie was always the shift manager Ernie had kids you look a fucked up building I love cocaine man me and my wife loved his wife was like 400 pounds she didn't work you know he had to bring the home fucking home and Joy's that type of shit he worked at a gas station they lived a terrible apartment but they were cocaine heads and I was 16 I had worked in a nice time I need 8-ball I'd already how can we do is how can we make this happen he's a fake robbed me all right so you know how many times I fake robbed Ernie about six times the fact there's a kid in Florida that has a story that I showed up his husband tonight with a with a diagram because you had a robbing the same way right you had to go around the building was cameras in the front in those days so you hadn't go around the back ring the bell when he come out he had the tax I couldn't be the same guy all the time that robbed them but you were gonna be fine you weren't gonna get arrested just take the walk with me trust me and he always told now whenever he goes to the Commish Coco coming home with him with a diagram and we're gonna rob a gas station like a football player because it was brilliant robbed Ernie once a fucking every six weeks look I had the KY where you had to hit him you got to kick him in the stomach his shit and like smack him so he would bleed and the cops he would say Ernie nobody gets robbed like this one what do you want me to tell you they know I'm a fucking idiot bro we would rob them once every six weeks and finally event that I didn't bring them the eight ball when that I just did as a boy you got pissed off at me that was it being around shady people like that like growing up around shady people gives you such a a different flavor to life just is an extra element when you look at the time it's probably little dangerous when you look back on and laugh there's simply I wish to work at this gas station I worked at a gas station for a little while and there was this old guy he should come in the gas station this old dude who had like one of those classic bald guys who's bald up top with the hair on the side looked like you know you see a guy like that you think he's like a normal guy probably know this guy used to drive this souped-up Buick and he was a total pervert and all he could do is talk about pussy this old man talking about pussy like gray hair on the sides of his head just talking about fingering chicks fucking chill he was a madman but being around that guy made me realize that like I see a dude like an old dude who's bald with the fucking hair on the side and I say well there's probably a nice gentleman like no old pervert driving a hot rod Buick finger and chicks realize you're around people like that you know that there's something else like there's possibilities there's there's a lot of different kinds of people in life and sometimes just cuz someone looks like someone that you've sort of already met before like oh yeah I know that type now you know you have no idea look at Ted Bundy that was how Ted Bundy got all those girls he looked like a normal handsome guy he didn't look like some IDI gain fucking psychopath with you know creepy little beady eyes weird strange lamp no he looked like a guy that you'd want a date Mike Harmon played oh yeah that was a girl he escaped from the jail and fucking Aspen through a window for a while I thought I was crazy talk because I lived everywhere with Ted Bundy lived Oh for a while I thought I was crazy I lived in Snowmass Village he killed the chick he kidnapped her from the Willowbrook hotel whatever in Snowmass Mellon and then we lived in Seattle that's where he did most of his damage that was cially didn't didn't he do someone Florida was at the end the dormitory that was the end I think looking up or something for a long time I'm like maybe I'm fucking crazy dawg yeah I mean I mean in and snowman I mean yeah he escaped from the Aspen fucking jail Ted Bundy that was uh that was a scary one that guy used to he used to pick up girls and take them for rides in his car and they realized there was no doorknob on their side they would go to reach for like the door to open it there's no doorknob he would remove yeah the doorknobs removed on the side of his car 2002 film Ted Bundy if you look at him he's a handsome guy normal looking dude is he still alive nah they launched them did he kill him yeah he was in a they launched them and uh they celebrated his death and all the towns we killed people they had happy hours that drinks the Bundy and shit yeah January 24th 1989 they killed him he was age 42 at the Florida State Prison he represent himself he was an attorney but no I think he was he was he didn't take the pass to something he did a lot of crazy shit man fuck yeah he killed a lot of girls man he revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until future vacation and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible he decapitated at least twelve of his victims and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment for a period of time as mementos on a few occasions he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept man he was their first kidnap they first got him in 1975 for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault and then he became a suspect and a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states fuck call at Colorado and Florida huh goddamn Florida finally watched him correct yep till the dormitory that's where you got University of Florida right Gainesville was in Gainesville or something like that yeah there's some there's a lot of those fucking guys out there man what what turns a guy like Ted Bundy into someone who would do that shit damn have you seen his Mort picks morgue pics yeah when he got executed yeah and it's like there's a color one there's a black-and-white one the problem Ward picks is for the fuck knows that's real yeah yeah I didn't look good shaves and said to yeah top of his head looks like a blob or something that's what they do when they're cooking you scary shit man it's just scary shit that someone could be like that you know well the fucker killed cats when he was six yeah yeah killed dogs shit tortured Michael Vick Thomas shit he fucking yes no he's bludgeoning women in their fucking sleep and rape and corpses what the fuck happens to people bro yeah that is the question that the fuck happens to people what is it about people the ass which can go off and then BOOM all the sudden your Dylan Klebold in Colorado shooting up your school what is it what what combination of chemicals and behavior and life or combinations of curve balls and shitty genetics and all sorts of different things cause someone to be that way his his Beatle was on display in a museum recently and they found in it they found a bunch of items that were in it and one was a crowbar garage garbage bags an icepick a flashlight torn strips of sheeting a knit ski mask handcuffs and a strange mask made from pantyhose what the fuck and in Florida as if living in Florida wasn't bad enough the idea what that guy running around imagine if Ted Bundy was alive today that big 90% of Nancy Gracie show Ted Bundy in Florida Florida wild fucking places you stand up to it was one of the wildest spots I was thinking that the other day like that that Hollywood improv the improv in Fort Lauderdale Hollywood Florida that fucking improv was one of the wildest clubs in the goddamn country as Brian counts favorite place to perform he's like they're off the chain of their animals I was just in there let's go wait would you do with what you do with myself but you bring anybody with you you don't know they were like oh you have to pay like 800 hours for a hotel for to bring a feature for the casino cuz they put you in the casino they don't give you a second hotel room no get him make him give you a dog like they have hotel room I fuck you know I thought it wasn't a casino was gonna be boring wasn't that bad it was pretty good as a matter of fact I had a good time yeah it's a fun great time I really don't have a good time if you're living around there that hard rock it's a decent I said no yeah it was great it's not like those places where they do they used to do king of the cage at and back in the band days did you ever go to the one of those with me no Eddie Bravo and I went to a bunch of them Eddie used to work for the Connecticut she was the post the commentator so we would travel sometimes to these these gigs were in the middle of fucking I mean nowhere these weird Native American casinos were the only places where he could do it because they had sovereignty over their own land so even though MMA was banned in California at the time they could still put on fights at these casinos that's when people started to wake up because it's like we'll probably make it this a week you have much fucking money these people are making because you would go to the middle of nowhere I mean hours and hours drive and there would be thousands of people there for an event all people we knew you know people we knew from jujitsu guys we trained with guys we knew that we're like tap the tap out guys in the early days and we'll go there and they'd have these outdoor arenas like this outdoor like seeded stayed most the time no cover over it if it rained the fights kept going they made a whole DVD called wet and wild where they let it rain it was fucking pouring out and in the middle of these crazy torrential downpours dudes were fighting it's the dumbest idea of all thought well couldn't but you had no traction at all you would throw up on she would fucking go flying because they had one of those old school vinyl floors if it was a canvas floor it would still be slippery but it would be less slippery but this shit wasn't canvas this shit was like like vinyl so it was like a swimming pools like slip and slide it really was like trying to have a kickboxing match on slip and slide dude knees get blown out fall on top of each other like it was like one of the sloppiest MMA cards ever but kind of fun because it's a piece of history I don't think they should ever do it again but it's good that it exists but I think this probably probably pull down from YouTube we put a video on her but it's funny if you ever got a boulder again though make sure though the rope is no robot into what is that's a cool mother what is this that place it's a Buddhist College really I went out of Monday I used to go to when I was fucked up in the head right I thought I didn't know what I want to do with my life I was confused after prisoner knowing I would go down Mondays and walk meditate I learned how to meditate there I went to a seminar I seen Allen Ginsberg there and you know it's all vegetarians fucked I went to a massage therapist and I was tremendous you know one time I able to love myself she stunk so bad but the massages were so good like a smile her fucking armpits and the humus on there was fucking hard but they were the nicest fucking people in the world and they always have a course that you'll look at and go huh what class they're teaching it like you know what man I was young right before commie I was frustrated I was married I didn't know I would go there I've ever taken like a humanitarian course you know but it was so I think now would be more interesting to me because now I've gained more knowledge I know the fuck I am right so have you ever go there again I never mention it to you my friend owns the cafeteria and it's a vegetarian cafeteria but every once in a while he's a Spanish dude he whips up some badass shit Lenny yeah yeah man he is weird how he took over it and I always forget to tell you about I don't know if you ever go back to Boulder but if you do check it out yeah I'll check it out even go on the web page just look they always have some fucking genius going through they're dropping bad ass knowledge listen if you want to see the stones you go to the garden if you want to see a good fight you got a garden if you want to see a smart badass motherfucker job balance go to the rope up really go to Boulder yeah boulders got some fucking you know we met look at bro they have elite martial artists too heavy lead MMA guys in Boulder they got a flow tank doesn't have a flow type they have everything in bold I mean that's an astronaut school so there's people who have it's amazing the quality of people I met boulders I judged mm-hmm that I was like blown away by now it's a great town you know when you meet a physicist and he meets a guy like me he looks down on me and Boulder those motherfuckers talk and then they take it back what you went to Yale you got a fucking master's from Harvard you know because they're fucking so extreme just because they're geniuses in that level doesn't mean they're nerds bro especially they moved to balls there might be hunters like a KKK racist because he was that eccentric Joe you posted something your day six geniuses who were perverts yeah what doesn't bro when you become that deep I would go to the rope and listen the Ginsberg is one of the guys I remember I probably went to four seminars there to listen to people who me and everybody had samples on who he was vegan but I grasp a lot of fuckin different things man that helped me you know I remember going there one time ago maybe the Catholic religion is bullshit the way this motherfucker was dropping it right they weren't asking you to donate they weren't asking you to join they didn't want you to be Richard Gere I know the Dalai Lama was going there Polly Lama is always swinging in Bolger or he used this somebody from that tribe goes to that Naropa now it's very interesting bro oh and I always forgot to ask you in your travels anybody ever approached you and Sam somebody from Naropa no it's so it's a Buddhist University look at what is college ready spell it na ROP a very fucking cool oh and even that I like the mind of a fucking thief named Robert University and they were getting through to me like I was like wow these fucking people are cool shit because we you you make judgment you're like oh this just cuz this guy went to Harvard or whatever he's not gonna be interested in smoking a joint oh this motherfuckers got a pound in this suitcase under the microscope you know like he grew into something you're like wow yeah um I went to an ashram when I was in Boulder they were they're an ashram in the mountains like a Buddha shop yeah just meditate up there in the mountains and kill bugs you know Buddhists are not supposed to kill bugs so lady had a bug spray I go what are you doing did she goes we have an ant problem I go wait a minute you know you're a Buddhist you're not supposed to be spraying fucking bugs like that's like convenient it's very convenient of you that you spray an ant medication or ant poison out you're not supposed to do that she is yeah well it's very unfortunate we really have you know cleanliness issues and this I go listen you're not supposed to kill fucking ants like that's half them like how about vegans that have cats guess what fuckface you're not a vegan okay if you have a cat and you're a vegan and you're feeding your cat cat food you're feeding your cat murdered animals you are buying murdered animals you yourself you yourself are responsible for the death of animals period fact Jamie Kelston all you fucking people that are vegans and post photos of your cats those cats are murderers that's the only thing cats do if you have a cat and you try to keep feed your cat beaten vegan cat food they fucking go blind they start shitting themselves start walking into walls they don't get enough protein you can't feed a vegan capitulation dad they can't they can't exist like you go to forums like vegan cat forums it's hilarious because post after post you see people saying well I've finally given in and I had to start feeding my cat regular cat food of course you did he's a little murderer you're catching murderers you're a person who believes that animals shouldn't die but you're contributing to those animals dying so that you feed your animal that kills animals do you understand how crazy this all is that highlights the whole hypocrisy of the idea of not taking life you take life everybody takes life like take like takes life life takes life whether you'd like it or not unfortunately it doesn't mean that you can't be a really good person and have a cat and only contribute to a certain amount of cat murder because look at these cats eating your next dirty monsters bread down but still dirty monsters at heart you you know the idea behind it is hilarious and I don't mean to single out the the reason why I did is because some of the vegans that I've run into who are these self-righteous fuckers will take pictures with their cats like look at you that's not being a vegan you're bi you're spending money to get animals killed that's a fact unless you're out there like unless you just let your cat forage for itself then you just live with a murderer you know you're a vegan who lives with a murderer but if you're a vegan around they're buying cat food guess what dude cuz I actually listen to vegans it's getting deep with you like it makes me angry we'll go to war with ya fuck is gonna war it's got a world war like Tony Montana Wars what we go to war against self righteousness that's what it is it's it's no listen they miss the big picture look at man when you work that fear factor I'm sure there was some really cool people and then there was some real fucking douchebags when we went to bowled let me tell you something man there was some lovely people in Boulder I meant brilliant brilliant and then again there's the people who are there's people out there 60% of these people that pick up a fucking hobby or whatever the fuck they call it taha me bro it's a social activity anymore religions have become a social activity you understand me nobody becomes you know somebody does something that's because they really believe in it they really want to do it not anymore dog not anymore dog people join something just to be a part of some it's a social whatever that's a lot of it it's it's it's it's associated as a social brownie points in every day yeah take the high ground I'm bored I'm lonely what am I gonna do I got three windows I might be gay I might save cats you know I was in Hollywood one day and I'm eating and there was a guy behind me and he was gay and I'm like this guy cannot be this gay Jimmy Jamie this guy couldn't not be that gay because nobody is that gay but there are people not that gay this guy was that gay like too gay like oh my

ass I'll take my car up into the mountains like you ever go up a Angeles Crest Highway Angeles Crest Highway off the 210 if you go off the 210 and like driving from like this studio towards Pasadena if you went up through the 118 to the 210 there's an area called the Angeles Crest Highway and you take it up into the mountains just a two-lane road if you go up there like five o'clock in the morning six o'clock at the mall gets fucking dead empty and bright when the Sun start to come up just drive just drive up there just drive up there and see the mountains and the hills and there's not fuckin soul in sight when you could do that when you can get on the highway and you see like one car a mile up and one car like a mile back and that's it just you three motherfuckers and if one guy going this way one go it's like relaxing it gives you a feeling of peace because you're so constantly concentrating on all these motherfuckers this guy next using a truck and this guy next to you is kind of weaving in that of lanes and this motherfucker in front of you is going too slow and it's like it's so much shit to think about when you could just get on a highway there's nobody it's a peaceful feeling you just go you forget driving is nice remember when you were a little kid you first got your driver's license and you're like whoohoo little kid but you know 18 whatever you first get to remember ledge of four-year-olds was driving like driving is fun like my six-year-old she's learning how to ride a bike so I'm teaching her ride a bike without training wheel so we're moving around showing how to do tight turns and stuff and she's having the time of her life and I'm thinking if I had to drive a bike in this little fucking house driveway I would be so bored but to a six-year-old it's like whoo it's so fun that's what it's like when you first start driving a car it's fun and you forget like driving a car just is a pleasure if you have a car that works right and you're out on a nice road and there's no one there the music's a beautiful view a beautiful view to look at it that's the thing that really gets me about Colorado more than anything is the sheer beauty of the landscape Boulder like how about evergreen when you're driving from evergreen down into Denver people know about evergreen every is a half an hour outside of Denver you might as well be on that mountain man TV show you might as well be one of those fucking dudes that makes their own would you you're up there in the middle of the fucking mountain 30 minutes from Denver beautiful I remember the last time I had peace of mind was I was shooting a Longest Yard and I was walking on Saturdays and Sundays and they opted they said you need to go home we'll stay I would stay in the hotel the hotel would be empty it'd be a couple of us I would stay down there and I would get the rental car dog and I would get on that road like go to Taos oh yeah drive to all those place I'd stop and get a green chile that's are hippies right Tao Oh hippies like turn the fucking car around 3-4 hours no traffic no traffic I just gotta know whatever road I don't know what it was that you ever do that drive from San Diego to Vegas fuck yeah that's a nice Drive that's that's beautiful when you go through those weird desert areas and you get to see those I went to the the Air Force Base I forget which base it is down there where the Blue Angels are I did the name of it but I had a drive down San Diego and then from San Diego I had to go across like quite a while to to get to this Air Force Base where they took me on a flight with the Blue Angels and you're driving through these desert areas where these beautiful rock formations and shit it's gorgeous out there just go as long as you

holy shit you're a little bit to me he didn't do it I mean Christopher walk is always Christopher Walken right Laurence Fishburne stole that motherfucker Laurence Fishburne stole that motherfucker listen I come to the conclusion that he's the best black actor now and I'll prove it to you you know when when he beats to check in the movie Tina Turner he plays a different type of black dude don't make me say it mm-hmm and then whenever he plays a completely different type of black dude but the opening of that movie he goes to King Tito's house and to buy the coke with Steve Buscemi and Steve Buscemi's will he call that shit weighing out the coke making sure it's good and fucking Laurence Fishburne is torturing this drug-dealing yo you play ball nuttin by looking at you you got a coke and he keeps torturing them torch them and then finally the guy you what the fucking drugs you fucking black guy I don't do business and he gives him the thing and the guy's about to open up the briefcase to check the money and he fucking slams he goes where's my motherfucking took which is classic and he finally opens it up and it's all tampons and he goes what the fuck is this to plug your motherfucking holes and he shoots him in the black bag comes to room service and they start shooting people that's the best opening to any fucking movie I've seen I forgot all about that movie i sat

we gave you money for a trainer dog I spent the money at Spago's didn't he have an island at one point in time tonight listen if you're into this shit cuz I'm into stupidity okay me and Joe Rogan chase Coburn on Sunset Boulevard I'm into those old actors they represented something different they represented Marlon Brando represented something completely different in my eyes this kid was from Nebraska this kid was from fucking Nebraska you know it'd be stuck on James Dean focus on fucking Brandon this guy came out here and just fuck people up and they hated them they hated him you know he wrote a hilarious fuckin letter to Charlie Sheen when he couldn't make his birthday party he wrote dear Charlie I'm feeling like a very large turd on a very thin stick I'm holed up in bed and taking everything from sled dog urine to Powerade power power D I don't know Eastern Indian vulva maybe won't work tomorrow if I feel the same that's what he sent him when he was thinking about not going to his party that's where you was out there they didn't want for the Godfather you know I had a push man for the Godfather I was crazy he didn't give a fuck and then he showed up they know the fuck he was he put the cotton in his mouth this shit and he just blew my little water then they gave him great no before that the game what's that movie did we cost the studio 80,000 he was directing whatever the fuck about the boat dawg yeah yeah anyway they went down there and they realized they get that they're like was Marlon Brando he's in the hut fuckin six fucking Hawaiian chicks that's what he married he was a crazy mother was crazy motherfucker and then he came back dog and he just he then he sent an Indian to the fucking Oscars to protest yeah the fucking American movies does this shit and at the end of his life he didn't he live he mean he lived on an island or something right did he do some point I think you live in Studio City I sweat yeah he lived around here it wasn't yeah he lived around here at the island he lost the island he lost the island but that was also a tragic side he lost his kids it was very sad that whole thing will happen well you can't imagine the guy like that would be really good at taking care of kids you know what he was really bad at acid I didn't realize it cuz I didn't listen I have to watch it cuz my wife watches the Man of Steel oh that movie yeah movie but I love Cameron Crowe but not good Marlon Brando cemented that role so strong that speech he tells him before he puts them in the fucking thing bro yeah that's we had to be Superman if your father tells you the speech if your father looking I tell you that speech you gotta be Superman that's it you're like that you just blew my fucking mind it was amazing he had a lease of an island 1966 he got a 99 year lease the island of this I don't know how to say this bitch te TI a are Oh a Tet dro but Tahiti government making him its sole owner 35 miles from the main island of Tahiti it's a group of thirteen islets small islands measuring about 27 square miles and surrounded by a lagoon fucking dude lived up there an eco resort Wow crazy man strange strange dude man you know there's a rumor he's a charge to read your script he's to charge you to read your script no like a view my studio said high boiling we have a script for you okay 50 G's he would bang you at every level that makes sense though if you're Marlon fucking Brando bang you know 45 to read the screen oh you want me to come off the island for I have her because your Ellen Ellen well that's when you're a bad motherfucker when they're willing to fly into an island talk to and if you wanted to fly him off it would cost you like triple to fly off the island yeah like oh no we want you to come to Hollywood show up with his crazy hat on but apparently he would sign up to do movies too it hadn't read it at all and would make them put up these big placards with all the lines that he had to say like right behind him as you just freeball it on the side I don't know I think that the Americans I think people itself sometimes take acting too sacred Zee you know mmm but if like if the Godfather the scene where he's at the table he's talking about if something should happen to my son he gets up that's what they said he was reading off the guys lapels his shit yeah but look at them see if you see him reading yeah at the end maybe 1972 when he was dropped by God the Godfather's gonna need to be oversmart hey tell you the boy you know me I get up at 6:00 I'm watch the news or something Godfather I gotta catch 10 minutes of it last night I watched the scene when he told what's-his-name he was out he was brilliant bro he told the constantly arey the white do it right he tells him when he goes were going to Vegas he just got out of the hospital he goes you know hear any smacks because no offense let Michael I'm gonna do this and he goes but I can help you Michael goes you're out he gets up and leaves he's beautiful girl he's beautiful so no matter if he was reading cards is shit you know we forget you forget probably if we forget because we were subjected to such bad fucking movies but I watched that movie again here then I don't watch him pieces I don't have the time to sit and watch three hours but it's been on HBO and I wants to see when he comes down he tells the Val cars are coming to my house tell you two vowels another one who's crazy you know tell you dawn what everybody seems to know and he goes but I was about to but you had to have a drink Hey to drink out of his hands because now you had your drink I get goose bumps I've seen that scene a hundred times I still get goose bumps bro well he looks at Sonny it flows that curtain down on that table he tells that dude look how they massacred my son are you fucking kidding me are you fucking kidding me yet good get the guy from mangling Gangs of New York he'll take that guy and break up and fucking half by his neck like a chicken at that time that dude was dropping it on you with cue cards whatever didn't matter it didn't matter he knew who the fuck he wasn't away in there you know what's interesting man Last Tango in Paris that's what's interesting then even a funky Bordeaux after that really yeah is porno-y say is a porn it was this close to pull it as could be they really look at that could look at the poster for it I'm looking at it's like nine and a half weeks kind of porn yeah it's him in some broad making out in this thing italian-american franco-italian romantic erotic drama wow I never saw that he's crazy that too he puts light bulbs in a pussy the original battery the traitor a recent American widower who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young betrothed Parisian woman Marlon Brando Moriya shrine Eider who's Maria Schneider whoa still alive alive and kickin nope died 58 2011 and Patti died in pati 58 not that old Wow you know it's interesting I was gonna say that some movies like The Godfather holds up perfect The Godfather could be in the movies today it would seem a little unusual because the way it's sort of filmed and framed and the music in it and everything like that it would be like it would stand out as being unusual but it would totally hold up but other movies from that era big movies that you really enjoyed from that era dog show French Connection you want to shoot it's really bad yeah except for the ball when he shakes everybody down Popeye doesn't he what the fuck is this he makes the milkshake yeah that's all really good but everything else the mechanic drags any Charles Bronson movie want to shoot yourself really it's brutal even even high high times holds up you know high mechanic try to watch The Godfather I never watch any of them your wife don't look at Jan Michael Vincent died for about 20 minutes he's an example of a guy who fell apart nobody know America doesn't know the beauty of a man because remember Jan Michael Vincent Lee kept it together Richard Gere was still been jumping down with fucking Hindus and fucking Baghdad whatever the fuck he was he's a Buddhist Richard Gere big time there would have been no reaching here cuz he was blond long he was about to kill it he killed it with the world's greatest athlete but when we were kids Nizhny he picked up the fucking weights and his arm stayed there yeah he was that he played uh but that was all he played a movie called defiance where he's a longshoreman and on the west side with Paulie walnuts or The Sopranos Danny Aiello and again they attack the fucking a gang like a Mexican Puerto Rican gang that movie was on HBO for a while but that movie that mechanic is slow as fuck when they go to Italy that slow is fucked through when they go to Italy he was born in Denver Colorado he's still alive Jan Michael Vincent still alive just amazing 69 years old with no fucking kidneys a liver that love fuckers just in that crazy though Last Tango in Paris chick Denis fuck Jan Michael Vincent pickled drunky shit gold teeth still kicking yeah man he's he's fucking apparently he's got some issues too he left Hollywood 12 years ago for a life on the Mississippi Delta that's where he lives now gas gotta be a weird ride man not everybody's cut out for that kind of movie star Tom Cruise type shit it's crazy is that Tom Cruise motherfucker is keeps it together pretty goddamn good I mean I'm sure if you talk to one of his ex-wives they would say they would tell you some horror story well people and fucking crazy outfits you know tell him about Xenu up on a planet pluton or some shit that's controlling Tom's vibrations forcing him to recite the doctrine of Scientology but if you look at like what he's done and the fact that he's still alive and kicking from go back to like what was that first movie just take this what movie was that big go from risky business to today in 2014 Tom Cruise is still knocking it out of the park as a movie star you know why I wrote Scientology beside Scientology he's as well prepared as you are as gay he's on top of his game you know that you can't be fucking around and getting 20 million a move you fucking around he's on top of his game you know what bro he's got some movies that you watch them and go yeah this sucks but go yeah he went from risky business and all a sudden he rocked against Jack Nicholson in that movie with the marine movie what's the name of that fucking movie oh yeah if you could man oh well that rock did that and then he rocked this fucking Jerry Maguire I mean he hit it out of the fucking park as an agent but dog when you watch that fucking movie where he plays the Hitman with Jamie Foxx oh yeah he goes into the Japanese bar it was Koreatown and he starts shooting motherfuckers look at his legs mmm what'd he shoot that's military that's military style shoot you just don't make that up here Scientologist so that means for three weeks before that he went to work somewhere he was beautiful that movie he was beautiful in that scene all the guys who've ever done those movies he's the most consistent like he does his own stunts his own race cars all that shit and you know what I'm sorry to tell you he's a tiny dude Ricky Cruz played his double and the movie where he said that was horrendously bad movie yeah yeah oh the Sunset Strip aleena Rockstar Baldwin and all those people I heard that was all they said was the kiss of death Ricky Cruz played his double his eyes and it by Hardee's is not I heard it's an exaggeration but not that tiny I heard that they actually build sets where it's bigger so he can stand on say yes well they did that with him and Brad Pitt when him and Brad Pitt did interview with the vampire Brad Pitt talked about how they would walk and Tom Cruise would walk next to him on like a ramp so like Brad Pitt would walk here and Tom Cruise would walk next to him on a ramp because he had to be the same height as him I bet they do that for a lot of movies though cuz I have these you know leads that he like the actresses they can't have what the actors being taller than him so that's weird but it's well it's weird that that hasn't liked him hampered him you know in any way he's still like one of the main movie stars he rocks the house rocks the house he rocked the house and this I'm telling you Joey go see this guy this guy you know have to some but there's some people of this field on DiCaprio that's not elope - he's crazy right he's crazy does it he does it to get that tenant big everyone busy yeah he said new dog shits broke right he can't control that CAA calls him guess what we have a movie about a bar you're gonna be great next you know he's tap dancing I'm sure while they giving them envelopes it's okay after he goes to the fucking screen in five seven see he's five seven and Ving Rhames is actually six foot but this is a good example where they're trying to make him look I don't think he's five seven I think that's a lie I think that's one of those Napoleon things you know everybody talks about Napoleon being short you know the Polian was like above average height for the time he wasn't short it was England fucking with them they would do all these jokes about Napoleon being short he was five six back then people were tiny shit so like five six back then was like normal size dude is this the same website you keep pulling up CollegeHumor I don't know if they substantiate all the other websites also said five seven really yeah five seven here's here's one with Tom Cruise yeah five seven Diaz five seven see how they're making him like they're constantly always making him talk even though like these people are weighted him oh so they're standing on something yeah like buckets and stuff yeah it says wouldn't be funny if he's actually six feet tall but this is just a giant troll that everybody's saying he's five seven five seven five seven yeah oh he's walking next to people well Katie Holmes was giant like what they would go out in public Katie Holmes was like legitimately like five ten right wasn't she no I think she's kind of a young girl all right what a girl oh she is she's five nine yeah but so was Nicole Kidman Nicole Kidman was big too oh say what's going on there's yeah well there's dudes who wear stuff in their shoes you know and she's Rogers big too right yeah Rogers he slung some dick dawg maybe whatever he did he figured out how to get all these girls to marry him this you know what we'll never get the full story because Scientology is so secretive and inclusive and you know so so culty but what a fascinating story that would be see like if I mean the rumors are all true if he really is a closeted gay guy that it has arranged marriages and they go on for 10 years and the women get all this money and you know he needs them because this is like the image that he's trying to portray that's a fast listen so a big place because I was thinking about their look at what happened honestly how many meetings could you go up and say to yourself I can make a fucking killing if I could get my phone to tape a beating of we don't seem like a Scientology party what it really is right it's like Travolta and fucking Tom Cruise bikinis guys it was somebody with sell a four hundred billion dollar bill II though well you know you're seeing that now with certain guys like this Bryan Singer guy that directs the x-men that this is the guy that is in trouble because his one of his ex-boyfriends was claiming that he was sexually exploited and they passed him around holy shit they have fucking parties let me tell you something no hate gave motherfuckers know how to party they know how if they know how to party these guys have this fucking - his photos pull up some photos of Bryan Singer's parties he has parties or he has a red lights in the swimming pool and they're filled with twinks this it's it's a twink soup and everyone is dancing around the pool the pools it's flooded by guys with no shirts on and they're all touching each other and having a great fucking time and if you're okay that gun that's got to be the wit look at this that's the way to fucking party why not what is everybody angry yeah what's twigs twinks twinks are like little skinny gay guys that look you know kind of like boyish that's life that's a type yeah super twink ain't super Twain but like look at this what is wrong with this this looks like a super positive scene to me I don't have any problem with anything I see here I see

while yeah directed before right directed a lot of movies like what like x-men did a lot of experts like two years ago right no he's done I think is that quite a few of them right hasn't he he's done a bunch of shit let's do Bryan Singer let's pull it up yeah isn't there's a like that one guy that was suing because he's getting because he was like the guy that got passed around by all the guys yeah but you know what man here's the deal if you show up for one of those things and you get passed around like what the hell I gotta get out of here this is a bad situation have you keeps showing up but you keep getting passed around then you want to write a book about it I don't know you could have left you got a co-star part you got fucked in the ass 82 times yeah that's it that's what you listen and I could see that happening in Hollywood it happens to women all the time guys they go to these fucking parties don't know what type of parties there are next you know they're in the Hollywood Hills that doing fucking roofies then doing blow and there's eight fucking young guys fuck and it happens have I been to one no it happens it has to happen little young guys for the confused

Bryan Singer because would I compare that situation like you bet yeah not Stanley Kubrick but that's who I should wear a bunch of old guys they're fucking yes and once a month they go to a house red band tells me to call a phone and say red devil and he sends you to a house in the hills a car picks you up you don't even know where you're going how fucking creepy and they take it to a house and

mentally no I was never listen I don't leave values that bad I got across the border to Mexico try to bring them over once that happens you're good what's Mexico is not nearly as bad crossing from Mexico into America that's nothing like that my fears I don't really well lead to cut you with drugs well I do drugs I won't leave this country because I need them I don't want to get caught somewhere by sure you want to smoke a joint in the fucking Africa right yeah and who knows what the laws are there what's the laws for weed in China I'm not good yeah lock you up they'll give you 80 fucking years what is already doing over there staying clean yeah yes he's definitely staying clean general Mao or whatever the fuck his name is chairman chef what do they give you for weed over there like what type of shit they give you a weed enjoy but as far as like sentence yeah I'm not good it's very bad come on yeah the weed in China is very bad weed North Korea's legal nowhere that's weird no bad in China they have listen yeah the fucking listen that the mob stole the idea from the people in China so I know they're selling coke or something not everybody's going to jail for 80 years in China let me pee real quick drug laws in China let's look at how illegal drug trade in China it's uh it's pretty simple China has one fifth of world's population large and expanding economy while opium has played an important role in the country's history since the beginning Oh since before the the First and Second Opium Wars the 19th century China's large loud matte loud large landmass close proximity to the Golden Triangle and numerous coastal cities with large and modern port facilities make it an attractive transit center for drug trafficking hmm what is the fucking opium war awesome let's go sounds like a good movie the First Opium War okay let's find out about the opium war Dan was in the 1800's it was fought between Great Britain and China over there conflicting viewpoints on diplomatic relations trade and the administration of justice for foreign nationals prior to the conflict Chinese officials wish to end the spread of opium and confiscated around 20,000 chests of opium approximately 1.2 million kilograms or 2 point whatever 8 6 6 million pounds from British traders the British government although not officially denying China's right to control imports of the imports of the drug objected to the seizure and used its military power to enforce violent redress so there's two two of them one of them was in this the 1800's there and another one was a 1856 to 1860 there's two different opium wars while we know I don't they give you a lot of time yeah what's a drug seizure treaties and conventions drug laws agencies okay let's see drug law enforcement yeah there's it's not good don't do drugs in China that's all right say remember um the Mickey Rourke movie there's another fuckin under under appreciated movie you're the dragon tremendous 1385 dog that was a great fuckin fuck yeah whoo yeah cool we want my money when cuz what the story was about basically what do the Chinese say you know what bro how long do you boil the fuckers gonna be fuckin us in this they can't catch us have you never read about the DEA busting the Chinese smuggling heroin yeah why is that really that brilliant that they've been doing it for sister beginning of time are they still doing it in Chinatown I don't know I don't know I heard it's a new work now but I know when I was growing up the Chinese gave it to the black guys the Chinese supplied the Jews disciple a Chinese supplied all the major outlets they raped them they didn't give him that cut they'd pay them a percentage wholesale then they went out cut it 18 times and on a $30,000 investment you made a half a million dollars bro wasn't that a part of that movie with Denzel Washington where his friend was wasn't a part of it was going to China and well he was take he was bringing it for Vietnam Vietnam but it was yeah with a shake or Liddy all those motherfuckers right on it all those motherfuckers we think they were doing everything everybody want to go to tour make tours of Vietnam they were body bags the government do that that was the CIA and all those heavy duties right that's a cheek old lady got in trouble well you got trouble for Watergate mm-hmm but it's knowing that he was over there said that he is back and shit was well there was so much money when you have so much money what they the the amount of money in heroin in the Vietnam era especially back then there was no Wikipedia and no Edward Snowden no Julian Assange you could hide shit pretty fucking easy and there was so much money to be made in heroin why wouldn't the government make it there I think their idea was like look we'd be crazy like someone's gonna make this money and if they make the money they're gonna control the resources that they get from that money they're gonna be able to have influence and power and do things to people with that money fuckin will just do it we'll do it the right way and they just just started selling heroin they just started doing it wait the whole night I mean that was one of the main reasons why we had a hard time getting out of Vietnam the amount of money that was being generated is that the truth oh yeah Vietnam and heroin is very well documented the Vietnam trade in heroin is a fascinating story because it's essentially repeating itself in Afghanistan nobody everybody buries their head in the sand nobody wants to admit it but the Afghanistan poppy trade like the amount of heroin grown in Afghanistan is a huge percentage of the world's heroin not just a little bit of Afghanistan money the world okay let's look what do you guess percentage of heroin percentage of world heroin grown in Afghanistan take a guess what would you think it is 70% okay percentage of world's heroin in Afghanistan I'm gonna say ninety let's say okay shut up dude okay let's let's find it is opium production in Afghanistan Wikipedia amounts to export value of four billion dollars Wow holy shit wholesale correct oh well I don't think you tax it well that's wholesale is selling it to me for an ounce or pound for whatever and be cutting in meat if it's 4 billion wholesale that they're the wholesalers they grow it they process it I come over and pick it up yeah I don't know I don't know how they how they work it's just amazing ok fucking amazing mm-hmm well it's one thing's a fact I'm having a hard time finding numbers well one thing is the fact that it's gone up well they're all saying that it hits record highs despite billions of dollars spent to combat heroin trade Afghanistan opium production hits record highs this is a 2013 the United States spent 7 billion dollars to combat opium production so they're they're stealing from both sides they spent 17 billion dollars and it went up it rose 36% Wow oh my god that's hilarious 60,000 US forces left Afghanistan down from a peak of $100,000 so they're what they're saying is essentially no matter what they do the heroin production keeps going up hmm weird it's hysterical who's that act that just died tragically which one the guy in New York all Walker Philip Seymour from heroin after Philip Seymour Hoffman they went and they said well I was gonna go down this city some fucking crazy commissioner and he was and put a cop and they got the guy that solved the bags and and then probably he rolled on somebody and once he rolled us that fucking cop got transferred vo Pia and that guy got fuckin thrown and that's it they can't go you know it's so fucking big the heroin trade and one part of it somebody normal who doesn't would say yeah we're gonna fucking combat it really really fucking heroin prices have gone down 90% of the roads oh yeah ninety by the percent in 2000 it was 70 heroin it's down to like you could buy $7 bags of heroin bro the 7/7 hours I could borrow $7 every fucking day guys $7 how but you just how crazy that's that's not but how crazy is it that one spot 90% of the world supply the world is 7 billion people how many people do heroin in the world the numbers have to be crazy when you add in all these other countries not just America and in Mexico add in North Canada add in everywhere the whole world they process their own I don't believe so they get the poppy from there they process at Mexico cuz Mexican heroin is that black car it's thick you gotta shoot it the shit that you buy in New York they have this white stuff you could snort it oh really and they tell you it's for suburban kids that don't like needles Oh snort Annette listen bro the heroin in New York is a sold to Spanish people in Puerto Ricans in the Bronx that down that as black people that's what the New York trade is wrong the heroin that sold in New York is too fucking 20 year old yuppies that do a blast they do they don't shoot it they snort it that's where the big heroin is so yeah you still got the old geezers that a fuckin shooting and their fucking will Seymour Hoffman shoot it I mean yeah you should have you have you tried the snorting it went what's the what do you feel how do you feel after I've never shot it I stole his frame and the first time it was I got sick I got really pukey and I got sick but after I puked I felt better and I got really high the first time I did it was like a pass out type mode like I I was thinking about stuff like I was thinking about he was playing music and I was thinking about stuff the second time I did I was locked up you did it in gentle gentle prison that time I did it you came off a dude's but don't know how'd it get in there visitation oh you swap spit there was my mouth head to the balloon I suppose good with you whoa not me I didn't smoke her a girl a girl her wife cause it's not worth it and that uh what that was was black tar heroin and what the guy did was he cooked it he poured it in my nose at this arrangement that nothing happened didn't work they're saying that 40% more poppies are grown in Mexico than marijuana now they're growing more heroin 40% more than marijuana the problem with the heroin the marijuana is that it's legal here essentially essentially legal in California California is right next door so Lansing is a nice people but they can't compete with what the fuck is going on Northern California they're very nice people or Southern California that bro anywhere there's still people in parts of the country that smoke that brown wheat that goes to Connecticut mm-hmm that goes to Boston that goes to Minneapolis a lot of brown weed there's still a little traffic left in that brown tweed but for the most part don't take no fucking genius to know listen then fucking young kids and oil in California they're about to fucking blow up the world what they're doing up there even after dams like we can't compete build water dams gone though hey you ever go to Amsterdam why the fuck would I go to Amsterdam I can go to Denver good good it's all over gentlemen don't believe the hype dish and they closed all the stores Mike my stores down at the end of the month the store next to his dealer what do you mean defined wellness went down all my favorite spots of why they just showed down now they went after landlords why would they do that why would they do that they gotta pass it just get it legal like it is in Denver Denver is making so much money hand over fist they did a CNBC show about it it's incredible there was a guy was a weed pen company says in two years his company's gonna be worth a billion dollars for fucking weed pens vape pens out people buying vape pens with no vapor to put it just to happen Connecticut New York well you can have legal yet you get wax now and stuff like that you get wax you can grind the wheat up there's a lot of them that you just grind wheat up and you pack but you gotta pack them every yeah like every two or three hits you gotta pack there those are silly but they have them I'd like to see what would happen if they take the legal marijuana thing to Michigan and try to see you know throw it in Detroit right yeah let's good move but people get high and then realize why the fuck we stayed in Detroit was the first two month or the first two months go to Kid Rock's house people who have been robbed on the way out yes that's the probably gonna happen Detroit they don't have to hire too much security because you know just you just see if people parked a car and walk over and I've seen in Hollywood there were stories in Hollywood people were robbing people outside of weed stores you know now these weed stores that are getting closed down the getting closed down by the DEA like who's closing them down by the city the city landlord what a place I go you had a high an attorney so for every day stays open he's gonna pay an attorney to keep them open and they just told me yesterday that the end of June they're done Wow but there's still so many stores so what are the rules where stores are allowed to be open and not open is it like you know proximity to schools okay yeah I know that divine wellness went down that was dead there were the edible cakes divine wellness in my eyes they always had something to kill a motherfucker they had the capsule dad auntie Dolores they had all the best shit and they told me they were moved to Canoga Park and this new company came in because well they were moving because they were 500 feet from the church there's a church right on Lancashire so divine wellness is moving in Canoga Park they moved to Canoga Park and then some other motherfucking gangstas came and said fuck it you're gonna have to shut us down I think it's the landlord in there said so and they shut down and reopened for like two days now what they're what they and they will walk so that would shut down the overall services are the future I mean look at San Diego they happen to San Diego it's all tricky though guys get set up and robbed yeah yes you see what I'm doing right now is I'm not smoking really man I do the tubes in the morning I quit the tube you know the vapor tubes I got Girl Scout cookies of a man and then by one o'clock I pop unedible you know so I could buy a box of fucking goobies mm-hmm I can have boobies or Milo send me a box you know that's the thing that I love male director so as you send them to copy you fucking license don't mail it to me she knows me you know she knows I'm legit so yeah I'm a big fan of the edibles anywhere it's like better haha up again so much I I sleep better I put this different water and my sleep apnea machine and now the edibles let me sleep a lot better it's very nice and if you wanted to stay constantly medicated you could be very functioning with a small dose of marijuana I saw some although I fucked up last way I got high before I keep punctured that's what that would be great no she even said something to me getting high before yoga do you want to really appreciate we get high before yoga because you get high from yoga anyway and if you get high and then do the yoga it releases some crazy chemicals 45 minutes passes before you even though you have like this not a hallucinogenic trip you have a body trip mmm you start focusing on your need and you can actually feel the blood going into your knee when you're high with the stretches Yoga is really cool that's what they say they do the hot yoga with weed right and it really kicks it up I've never done the hot yoga I don't know it's great now you just bring water bring cold water but the good thing about the hot yoga is it really warms you up for stretching because when you're cold it's very difficult to stretch that's why I like doing anything like real strenuous early in the morning is tricky you got to really make sure you warm up when I lift weights in the morning a lot of times I do I start my day by lifting weights I take a lot take 20 minutes to warm up 20 whole minutes of like light kettle book cleans like swings and cleans like light body weight squats stretching touching my toes moving around getting all the blood flowing because you got to think for eight hours or whatever you sleep for you're just sitting there while everything's just lying flat I mean your Bloods pumping and everything like that but there's no movement so everything's kind of stiff and weird that's why when you wake up your back herbs if you go to bed for like two seconds and you lay down your back doesn't hurt but when you go to bed for eight hours you wake up you like takes you a few minutes and then whatever that stiffen it is it's gone in half an hour so right it's gone in a little while got to warm the fuck up if you lift in the morning a lot of guys get hurt from that it's one of the main sources of injuries is early morning workouts you know that I have friends that have 7:00 a.m. jujitsu that sounds really cool at 9:00 a.m. - Jitsu like fundamentals that sounds cool but not for me it's okay it's a longer warmup I like 11:30 11:00 I'm doing other things I've walked around I think 9 o'clock my body but I would have a heart attack I'm really scared well I have a big difference between like if I have a kickboxing workout like 10:00 in the morning or a kickboxing workout at 7:00 at night goddamn 7:00 at night I'm on fire my real better huh yeah really yeah I like my shit over 11 o'clock 11 the wall I've done 8 o'clock for me to do jujitsu it is fucking brutal I'm out of here you know even if I eat dinner at 4:00 I can find no I gotta go like Friday at 7:00 I go to beginner jujitsu I hate it for so there's no misunderstanding it's exactly our ya know calisthenics we practice a technique we roll for eight minutes with a fuck out of it that's it what do you eat before you workout nothing he'll take nothing less I like if I'm gonna do a long Jiu Jitsu I'll take two shrim tangent X but I don't do the shroom text every time I like to space it out I'll I could tell the difference when I take a baby aspirin mmm then when I taste you take I see a big fucking difference right so if I'm gonna do something long then I'll do the shroom tech if I'm gonna do some way kettlebells like just a short kettlebell workout 10 sets of swings maybe three cleans three sets of cleans and a farmer's walk I just do a baby aspirin and immediately a protein shake with glutamine and then one and I eat shakers 300 calories I make them with water right the force you should get a little bit of sugar in there too a little bit of natural sugar in your diet after a workout yeah replenish your glycogen your glucose you WOM eat some fruit fruit is a good way to do it I do a lot of fruit yeah fruit juices with protein powder is a good way to do it after a workout but that's when you want to replenish like within 30 minutes but before I like fruit before I work out my favorite thing to eat before I workout is either oranges or pineapples because there's a lot of fiber in them I feel like I've eat like three or four oranges and then have a good work got an hour later there's no effects like no cramping no weirdness easy to digest you know pineapples the same way I eat like a nice bowl of pineapple like an hour so before I work out I never bothers me at all but you have the fibre from the plant matter and you have plenty of fuel you know plenty of sugar in your body but natural sugar you know but natural sugar you see when people have sugar if you have sugar from a candy bar or something like that that is the most unnatural form of sugar that human beings have ever created we figured out how to isolate sugar take it away from its natural plants natural fruits and vegetables and then process it and make it this weird thing that you could just add to stuff in white powder you know that white powder doesn't exist in a wild and the effect that it has on your body your body's like how are you getting so much sugar in this fucking thing do you have a drink you ever look at like if you have just what you know one of those powers those energy drinks or uh you know post-workout drinks hydration drinks look at the fuckin the labels of those things look at a fruit punch you all agree with drink fucking Red Bull you guys ever see me drink a Red Bull no you're not you'll have an espresso every now and then after me I like espresso after a meal too like Red Bull I don't like energy drinks I don't believe have enough energy but it's the sugar man the sugars and motherfuckers weighs 75 grams of sugar and shit you like that don't kill you that's terrible for you like you know I can't even taste a regular coke anymore it's horrific syrup dud yeah shit a syrup do you ever have that Mexican coke though there's a burrito place in Hollywood that sells those Mexican oh yea the bottles taste better it tastes better still not good for you yeah I drank enough soda for three fucking bodies bro there's a great documentary called King corn it talks about the effect of corn on your body and like how much corn they have like how much of an influence corn has because it's corn syrup is used in so many different products it's a fascinating thing we got to get back to eating natural foods you know human beings have gotten way off track we've made some pretty yummy shit with corn syrup and and sugars and things along those lines but people want to be healthy you got to get back to eating healthy foods there's just no way around it you got to eat salads you gotta eat fruits and for most folks eating meat is probably a pretty good idea eat some healthy meats but these fucking the the amount of power and the amount of influence that lobbyists and and these giant companies that that push corn syrup and put corn syrup and everything the amount of income that they make from it like the the profit generated from corn syrup is crazy corn syrup is in like 90% of our snack foods if you look around I just made that number up completely a fan by the way but if you look at like all the different snacks and different things that have corn syrup it's fucking staggering it's off the charts that's some terrible toxic shit and it's everywhere but tastes great they tricked you Joe Diaz they do trick there's a dude who's making I should say his name he's making all organic pot candies now he came by here the other day he's got a company called Scott like jumbo yeah Jambo organic Jambo I got to get you one of them they're fucking fantastic so it's honey d-doesn't with honey all organic ingredients no no high fructose corn syrup no artificial sugars no artificial sweeteners no artificial flavors he's like the first guy to do these organic pot candies and they're great they're great not too strong either they don't kill you they're like half of Chiba Chu you know where you don't get too nutty you'll probably take four of them craziest Chiba true that is so high demand there a month behind the production associate they're making cash sign - those little fucking helmet ones Oh people means the CBDs but the damn fucking little devil things really light you up like they're really scary I got people who have injuries if you have an injury take a look a cheap achoo a half a cheap achoo and then stretch out you'd be amazed at how good you feel you feel yours your muscles lengthening and loosening up you feel things listen up you need a half a decade you go to bed you wake up feeling loose in the hash cookies they don't happen people are making there was one company who had a in Hollywood it was 20 bucks with two tiny cookies but every time I hate those things dog a hatchling I realized that it was Bruce Lee it was even as easy because for the for the stiffness in your joints is shit I'm telling you when you eat and you eerie fur it's two different worlds Bruce Lee had some serious injuries he had a serious back injury at one point in time yeah injuries specifically for the injuries well for medical marijuana it's one of the number one things that people use it for what's the fate Louis CBDs yeah but the other one what star the woman when you workout you eat lettuce to take the acidity out of your muscles that's what it says a THC when you smoke it whatever you ingest it whatever it takes to whatever are your muscles after you worry lactic acid like the gases information yeah there might be a lot of bro science unfortunately but Bryan Callen does Bryan can lay some science on you and you know he's not really scientist I do it all the time go bro science is when you start reciting shit that you heard online bro the fucking the thing with THC it does is it pulls the lactic acid and then you google it and it doesn't do any such thing that's bro side what is that a blue ecig fuck Stephen Dorff you should do that god damn commercials Joey Diaz you you smoked that thing but you're done completely with cigarettes for a long time you don't worry about relapsing back to cigarettes or sucking on that no can you put that down you can't how long you can go without one of those three or four days no problem you've done that before pockets you loose but isn't that win you lose I tell you I like to always take at least one fruity drink at the ice house I can't do that no the ice house is great the bartender's are great they're great the waitresses are great you know man you know you go to the ice house I can go for a drink at the fuckin ice house when I'm up there the other day I was craving a beer for three days I walked around craving a Budweiser cold I crave cold Heineken why do you have one do you have one every now and then you don't like to drink I forget I forget to stop and get a beer so listen I will never ever drink and drive like you want to see me flip out let me have a drinking bit forced to drive because I know I can't keep them together in front of a cop and I know that I could never I'll have to cop to it my God how to pay my drunken I drank a drive like I would I'm totally against all that shit right I'll get stoned and fucking do ninety down the 100 because I could handle it but I can't handle alcohol well people think that being drunk and being high and driving a car are the same thing there that's ignorant it's not true at all you can smoke pot and do jiu-jitsu with no problem whatsoever no problem smoke pot and you're very coordinated smoke pot and something drops you catch it like your reflexes everything they're all there unless you're not used to it if you're not used to it all you're thinking of starting getting high Joey started making fun of me because we I forget what we did we oh I remember we went to the fucking Sunday brunch at the House of Blues remember they had that Gospel Brunch in that gospel yeah we all went over there and we were toasted to the gills it was like one of the first weekend's I ever got high and Joey Diaz like look at this fucking rookie in case I was going I can't believe a high I'm right now this is ridiculous I can't I'm I have to sit here I wasn't used to it I didn't know how to deal with it but if I was the same high right now I'd be fine because I know what that is it's a it's what you're doing is when you're too high and you're paranoid and you're frozen you're frozen cuz you don't know what it is you don't know what what comes next well is this gonna get worse am I gonna get more crazy oh my god how long is it's gonna last but when you're used to being high you're like I'm just high dude relax everything's fine you know what it is you know the worst it gets you know the best it gets you felt the full the full range of the effects but you were laughing at me I'll never forget we're gonna suck at rookie will you first get high you get so enjoyably hungry enjoyably like this simple like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich it's fucking filet mignon in your mouth yeah well I can you eat it with a bag of chips what heightens your senses right yeah it just says it's so you don't even breathe you just chew it like I have a bug giggling like I love to giggle bro a couple weeks ago I
