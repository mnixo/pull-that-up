you knock division 11 years I got lucky hell no you got lucky but I'm not saying that would have happened you would have stood around while they got jerked off but I am saying it's possible that a guy when you were 11 could have lied down and say hey you want to rub on top me or no and you would have been like what the fuck it's good to have fatty foods it's fun sometimes it's not it's not i don't believe it's good to miss out on all the pleasures in life because some people get hooked on them i see i think that's horseshit i agree like bacon is fucking delicious I'm not quitting I will never stop eating bacon it's not gonna fucking happen it's too good when I sit there and I'm chewing on a crispy piece of bacon this cooked maybe just a little too long but it's just crunching on my mouth and the saltiness and the sweetness of the pig fat that's just warm and melting in my mouth as i chew it down breaking down the crispy fact I'm not I'm not I'm not stopping never happening never knew if you baked bacon at like 4 25 honey whatever it is the perfect I mean it's it's translucent and it melts in your mouth and I swear to god of dick tastes like that my dad Abreu's knees I fucking love bacon I was telling Jim Jim's I telling you today I haven't had a cig days like that bruise knees I fucking love that taste well Rob wolf he's one of the Paleo diet pioneer guys are just a sort of genius fitness health guy he slow cooks bacon every morning he's like it's a ritual he gets that fat bacon from whole foods you know those big ass Bacon's dude and he puts on this like fucking slow bacon cooker and he's like as I'm getting ready for my day I'm going through my day it's smelling if the aroma is filling the house it's like there's a bunch of experiences going on oh my god damn these poor vegans he's poor bastard my wife my wife you know how like we don't have sense like a woman I'll have a scent when you start dating me like I shanna smells like strawberries at his mouth like bacon I had a Ida chick one time that smell like fucking Bologna I was like Adam Gaynor for two years processed but uh but my wife smells like bacon every morning she makes the same thing she's southern bacon eggs biscuits and fruit for the kids every fucking morning could call it's good call that's a good breakfast my house reeks obey I've even take my baking game to the next level when you go to buy your bacon if you buy it it like just a regular story they have the thick cut you don't get the thick cut that's spread out like playing cards like like fanned out get the thick cut that's packed in like dollar bills okay and then look at this you got to make sure that the beginning to the end of that thick cut is even you don't only dips in it go for fucking straight even that's the most amount of bacon you can get for your money I'm taking my baby i'm taking my baking pretty seriously to go to a butcher that's when you take it to the next level right I don't know when you're really taking the next level when you raise your own fucking pigs Hawk raise your own pigs get friendly with him they'll shoot him right in the head oh my god I'm gonna lean my head lights into your bedroom windows throw beer that's blah blah blah reading their crazy redneck crazy yeah worse fuck but that I mean and people it's playing on pop radio because it strikes a chord and I think some girls think man he really was in there you know he he really loved her because look at what he's doing on the other side and that's just that that's just a tricky little trap that we gotta transcend the least of my concerns my concerns is that there'll be guys that listen to it and think it's okay sure act like that for sure if the girl is so silly that she thinks all that he just loves him that's why he's all doing that shooting up the house shit you think he really wants to shoot up his fucking house just letting her know he loves her yes there's women who grow up like that they own fucking black iron they're having this conversation to their kid with a Marlboro hanging out of their mouth listen sugar your dad and I have very passionate relationship and I push his buttons and you know and he loves me and if he didn't love me he wouldn't fucking hit me and I know it all make sense to you right now but someday it will yeah that's it that's worried about that's this old paradigm that is a turn yeah in dire need of transcendence and the need is basically you know we have to be fully full I think Don Miguel Ruiz makes the example of you know create enough self love enough self satisfaction enough inside yourself that you don't need anything from anybody else your kitchen is fully stocked so you're not starving yeah you know a lot about your own kitchen with your own you know self fulfillment and then you don't need to eat any little burger that comes on the side of the road or so I'm hot dog from a stand whatever you can get because you're starving you got plenty to eat and that's I think the analogy that we need to have we need to be full in whole and we need to have standards as human beings we accept of ourselves like what you shouldn't accept from yourself don't accept from yourself that you're the guy that's going to be outside someone's house at three o'clock in the morning shining a headlight to their fucking windows and throwing beer cans don't accept that you're that guy you're not that you can't be that guy if you're that guy no one's gonna come to you for advice no one's gonna take you seriously your fucking dumb ass you're a dumbass child who gives in to every whim it's like someone who comes after one stroke every time I can't help it like you're a baby you're a fucking baby you learn some goddamn discipline yeah it sucks yeah you feel lonely yeah you get depressed go on tinder stupid find some more chicks they're everywhere people want to fuck they love it that's why there's so many of us what are you doing man you tell me you give this one chick EK get another chick go get another one stupid and he will too that's the thing do not have any friends not have any friends anybody talks you through it and goes doo doo doo come on let's go so what yeah people get so goddamn connected when they date they it's so fucking connected that they feel like you stole something from them who've been getting some pleasure from another entity I ain't tolerating it I'll sent us bust up your sleep patterns I'm gonna fuck with your beta waves so I'm gonna kick your fucking REM sleep right in the dick you fuck with me you fuck with my sleep I'm the type of fella fucks with your sleep tank yeah that's what he's doing he's a fucking baby you
