agree yeah there's no Kentucky fried turkey there's no Turkey stores no chicken stores ever there's Popeyes Chicken there's Kentucky Fried Chicken King Rene's Turk filet you know bacon for breakfast is is completely an invention of this advertising guy yeah he was hired by the company forget the name of the company but they're still around in some form that hired him to sell more pork and so he came up with this idea like bacon and eggs it's what's for breakfast you gotta like integrate it into the cultural traditions and ever since then it's been considered breakfast meat and boom meanwhile it's awesome so congratulations he was also behind the fluoridation of the water supply hired by Alcoa because they had all this all this um byproduct of making aluminum which is this fluoride and they wanted to flake what are we gonna do with all this stuff you know we got to find a way to sell it who could we sell it to and he figured out like oh we can you know it's good for dental it'll save everyone and get the government to buy it that's so funny we accept that man cuz like if someone comes over to your house and you're like in do you want some water and they're like yeah and you're like do you want me to add some fluoride to it chemical that kills you so yeah or it can kill you doesn't take a whole lot yeah like how much kills you like a couple teaspoons full no what you die with white teeth but is that real what's going on with dental hygiene versus I mean is it fluoride in the water that makes a difference or being conscious of dental height Delta hygiene it's made the difference in tooth decay and people well I mean talking to take you know you're talking to me I'm always gonna take it back to foragers foragers have amazing teeth there's this guy meat routes

glasses they were drinking out of her unsanitary and could be replaced by disposable cups Wow did you read this way put it up that's insane yeah and it was the beach not packing company that's the but the bacon he got right oh he got he got everything right mess dead on with the bacon yeah he also was behind the Virginia Slims thing like how can we use feminism to get women to buy cigarettes it's a feminist cigarette it's come a long way baby I bet that guy got laid like crazy I bet he was just a fucking Meister and he was Freud's nephew oh my goodness we had the benefit of psychological examination under his uncle he's proud of himself like he doesn't slightly he just died like 10 years ago interviews like happy his success ratio was amazing right no he hit everyone out of the park I've said there's more and I really mean this there is more intellectual debate in one hour of Twitter then there is a four years of college I mean there's far more conflict of ideas on social media now than there is in a college classroom because college classrooms are dominated and have been for decades by left liberals that's the discourse that goes on in there you don't hear conservative ideas you don't hear libertarian ideas you don't even hear some radical left-wing ideas it's this very narrow discourse that is pretty much only allowed in the college classroom and that's to me the most the biggest problem with the modern University there is no diversity of ideas everybody's obsessed with diversity of color skin color but no one cares about a diversity of diversity of ideas about real debate I want in my University to have a real debate about Big Ideas I want the best minds from conservatism and liberalism and socialism and libertarianism to have it out so let's talk about the big ideas and let's go for it and have the best people argue the points on their merits against each other why is it that there's such a narrow path of ideas that exist right now in colleges why is it just as tenure yeah I mean so what happened was conservatives basically dominated colleges until the 1960s and then the the 1960s generation of radicals had nowhere to go when they went into their 20s and 30s so they decided to move into the Academy so they all got PhDs and they became professors and they've dominated ever since there's also this system of tenure in universities which is supposed to protect academic freedom and what it actually does is it enforces intellectual conformity right because you have a lifetime appointment and you die and you control hiring right the faculty controls hiring who are you gonna hire you're gonna hire somebody who agrees with you who says what you think should be said so that's the problem with tenure right it sort of protects academic freedom but mostly it enforces intellectual conformity that's disturbing it's disturbing because you it's a priesthood yeah in a way right right you're a priest for life and who are you going to recruit into the priesthood a true believer that's what goes on in universities he would beat up Luke and I don't ever be in that ring that I know how to motivate Cubans yeah oh with with religion they're radicals maybe you do you just start talking about God I just talking about ogoun metal god of Cuba hold on gyoon and he's the one that he's the metalworker he's the fucking built when you go

machinery when you when machinery goes bad and shit like that you have to pray to Him he has all the weapons of metal he just shows up with melons nuts he has a metal acts a metal fuck and everything that's in learning that's why I would have busted him with that how would he just I would have got him through his head will go I hate that that takes over Jesus and cube that's what you were brought
