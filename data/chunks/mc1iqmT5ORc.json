hello freak bitches you know one of my heroes who's building a city in the Cayman Islands has named Devi Shetty he did great man yeah he's a he's an Indian guy and he did amazing stuff with you know he'll offer Americans heart surgery for 1/10 the price with the best doctors and that makes him enough money where he can offer a medical insurance to rural Indians for 25 cents a month so he plays this kind of jurisdictional arbitrage so now he's moving to the Cayman Islands and building what are called health cities ready to catch the wiving the the rising wave of Americans who are going to be dissatisfied with their health care and when a faster quicker and cheaper and will fly there and I've been looking at him as a guy that seems like he understands what seasteading would be he seems to understand the principles and he's applying them by using real islands and I've always fantasized if I could talk to him and get him to like invest in the sea stead and you know I almost peed my pants a few months ago where he was in the news and he said you know the best place to have a floating Hospital would be on a ship you know off the coast of a major American city given that we don't have that I'm gonna build one in the Cayman Islands and I'm like oh my god like there's so many people thinking along these lines like if we could just we have innovations and technologies moving forward and we have regulatory structures and governments holding it back and the world can't be held back the world has to move forward you don't wanna overthrow governments that's violent you want to innovate and compete with and embarrass governments the way you know Singapore and Hong Kong and the island man have done hit shows like that too I worked with Hickson in Texas I mean this is I was getting high so 29 years ago 30 you know Wow and just something happened to him in 7-eleven and he went on stage and ad-libbed about it too next night for two and I'm going I'll never be that funny as long as I fucking live I'll never be that for why am I doing this we were at catch a rising star in New York one night so Brenner goes on and this is I mean they love Brenner was fucking brilliant I'm yeah just he was a big act back then big fucking act so ladies and dear Brenda kills the fucking audience goes nuts okay so does his set go what he's like and Hicks goes on after him Hicks opens up with you know I was growing up and I used to watch the comedy on TV and I'd watch Robert Klein and David Brennan I'm thinking if these fucking guys can do it so can i that's his opening fucking joke then he goes into that Nancy Reagan that anorexic cunt assault so people are running out like there's a fire I mean he's just fucking cunt MH comma and he gets off stage I swear to god he walked up to me goes what happened what went wrong oh I don't know maybe the anorexic cunt trashing the guy that they just fucking loved and he was so fucking dark just dark just what you know what I mean yeah it's just like if you listen to now you go out that's all right but this is fucking 30 years ago yeah this is 30 years ago this shit was fucking dark you know Jenny would take a bit he would take a premise like you say and you know he could turn it into 20 fucking minutes he would bring shit out of like how the fuck did he come up with that out of that you're going what you know anything but Hicks was so fucking dark in his we were in in Texas this is true story so he his girlfriend just broke up with him he was going on with her forever so we're in a cab and he said she that cab driver I want a hooker in ten we're in Lubbock and loving it's a true story so old man so that made me shivers things about it what so so the cab driver said okay I'll take you to one plate and you go to their house so I was just gonna wait in a cab like so he wants you to first house and the lady open the door and look down goes you're a cop slam the door Hix who's back in the car but then but did it make some sense a cab driver takes him to another place she opens the door and goes you're too young slams the door gets in the car he goes I can't get fuckin hookers fuck me ten minutes the next night just brilliant fuckin on hookers that won't fuck this fucking brilliant I'm going unbelievable how fucking good this guy is the the amount of responsibility involved in influencing a young developing mind it can't be underestimated Jeff do you remember when you were a kid yeah I do like good stand out like yeah like like the Sun in the sky you can't see any can't see any star I can't see the other teachers in my head for the few good ones that I had yeah what an incredibly they could all be like obviously be great but I mean teach us yeah awesome responsibility yeah I had some great one so I had a few great ones there were just really good people that were smart and kind and they they profoundly influenced teacher in seventh grade that I had a discussion with him just me and him one day and I never forgot it we were talking about space and he was a really interesting guy you know it was a bad neighborhood where lived and I lived in Jamaica Plain which was like this um neighborhood in Boston just outside of Boston it's just is a real shit neighborhood at the time it's become a little bit gentrified now but back then it was just really sketchy very poor kids and there was a kid that was in my class I guess how 7th grade 9th is high school is 8th grade because it was right before high school and this kid was 17 years old in the fucking 8th grade I mean it was crazy because they were just it would they would be there for the beginning of the year and then they would drop out and this science teacher was you know in this shit school system but he was just genuinely kind curious patient man and he talked to me about space and and I'd never considered the idea that space is never-ending and he was explaining the concept of infinity to me and that there truly is no boundary and if you really in our memory said you ever really want to make your head hurt just stare at the sky and try to wrap your head the idea that it never ends and we had this long conversation about it Nick in between classes one day not even a long you know 10 minutes maybe but enough that I thought about that for years to this day I remember that guy there's a great Richard Feynman was this physicist a fantastic guy and he's told about his father that his you know he was pulling some wagon and he had balls in the wagon he said you notice when you pulled the wagon the balls stay for a bit and then they bump up and then you stop the wagon they keep going so he's talking about momentum and physics and all that and so like all kids he said well why why why and then he got to a point with his father where he said well why and his father said that nobody knows like why is there gravity I mean that nobody knows and I think those kinds of questions where you really stimulate your mind I think is a great idea I was telling my daughter a couple of I made two months ago about there's an old Spanish proverb that says ha habits begin as cobwebs and end up as chains way easier to break in the beginning then later on right way to put it it's a great way to put it Wow and anyway she just she just brought this up you know we were talking about someone she knew and and something that she didn't like that they did and she said yeah but they're still pretty much in the cobweb face so they can probably still change it Adam she's like well I even I didn't remember she's like oh yeah the cobwebs and changed things like she really said sunk in her and she's like five and she could remember those things that can really take you through life and give you real clarity I think that stuff is great and I remember those people who gave me those important lessons as as a kid you
