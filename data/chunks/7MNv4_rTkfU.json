three two one boom and we're live what's happening Joe what's up Mike Tom Segura now that man minutes yeah man by to say hi I can't believe you've never had a cup of coffee never you want something no that might be that might be the most outrageous thing about is that you've never had coffee your whole life I've never had coffee No did you just tea no coffee no one ever offered you a cup of coffee you never went to Starbucks no fatir from donut Wow what about like adults when you are miles and um that wasn't me getting rehabbed it was a little Starbucks because the means right outside of Starbucks you always hang on a Starbucks right but never for coffee you didn't want to try it never hmm that is that how about like like girlfriends wives like none of them ever like drank coffee at home I'm sure they have I never really my wife drinks it and you just nothing no nothing no no well I'm so drugged that did you think coffee would be nothing yeah yeah like it doesn't make any sense when when did you first try any drugs kid you're kidding what kind of shit smoking and drinking right then as I got older I tried acid how old were you mean first tried actually 11 Wow really young Jesus man wow that's really young Wow but when you were the champ when you were in your prime like when you wouldn't like when you beat Trevor Berbick were you doing anything back then its drinking a lot drinking a lot really yeah that's amazing will you go clean for camp or like if it can't you just for camping if it can yeah but outside like once fights over yeah yeah yeah you were the first guy that I ever use as an example of to break that old myth that you can't have sex before fights and I was like well that's out the window for sure cuz you you talk about it all the time you'd blow yeah yeah pretty much yeah your logic made sense to you like I don't want to think about it I don't want to be thinking about sex I'll just get it out of the way yeah and it's over what do you have to do have a feel for the next time six weeks and yes going to fight do you think that was a myth that it made you weak yeah I think it's a myth yeah doesn't seem to make sense it seems odd yeah and then they like whenever they buy you more so than you know disintegrate you yeah I would think they said that the Olympic you know where the athletes stay is just like fuck fest just panting so yeah also probably you want to alleviate some anxiety anxiety freaking out you're at the Olympics you know 18 years old and everyone's in amazing shape stressed out yeah when you were when you were first coming up and when you were first we like when you were kid dynamite on Sports Illustrated I'll never forget that man that was a that your era from like you know the the eighties the late 80s that era like it was a big part of my youth you know like you being cam and you being the chant was like it was a change of things because when Larry Holmes was the champ as a boxing fan I loved Larry Holmes like there's that cover you were 19 years old yeah it's nuts when Larry Holmes is a champ as a boxing fan why you still got that stuff man you just still get those yeah Sports Illustrated it's the Internet you can find it on you know that's how Jamie got it I had that Sports Illustrated but when Larry Holmes was a champ as a boxing fan I appreciated him I knew he was a great fighter I you know we would get together with friends and watch like the the Michael Spinks fight with Larry Holmes yeah when Spinks beat him for the title it was a big deal but it wasn't a big deal culturally yeah people didn't care as much but then you came around and when you came around all of a sudden everybody's watching heavyweight boxing if heavyweight boxing wasn't it wasn't boring again it was the the most crazy exciting thing in sports when your fights would go on it would be about should I pay for this cuz how long is this gonna last my dad never had it's really weird people tell me about the time they all chipped in yeah I know think about it like that you know sometimes when it comes from our realization of the situation I forget that I'm that guy forget that I train that hard and I became a fighter and stuff yeah that's what I was going to ask you like deep does it seem like a dream yeah pretty much like a blur because I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be 19 years old 20 years old that fucking famous it was a trip who can handle that is then can anybody handle that no it was a trip but it was just what custom model you know that was his blueprint it makes me write teenage superstar did he give you advice on how to handle pressure and fame and Oh depression everything but you know if there's really no ingredients on how to handle thing you know I mean we have to see what what Department of Fame is your problem and we have to work on that issue from there but you know no one's know how to conduct themselves under that kind of pressure no doctor it's at the level of Fame - yes like there's so many you realize there's so many levels of Fame and then Mike's is still just extraordinary where like people people walk away from their job like in an airport they're supposed to be at the cash register and they run out you know they leave their job to go say hi that's not you know most of the time you like oh that's who that person is it's a totally different thing oh where does that that's pretty weird fuck away from email creep might come in pick up it your mother take a picture my kid take a picture here take a picture I love you Justin I'm like whoa dude cool out but now you know anything this is just what it is it is stop it yeah I've seen you at the UFC before you're very calm around people when people grabbing at you want to take pictures you just just relax the UFC is all I think of everybody's nut yeah yeah it's a it's it's definitely a wild environment what do you think of beeps gonna do now but I think who could be yeah well he does whatever the fuck he wants to do that's what I think I think that guy's probably the best lightweight of all time he's a monster incredible he I think he's probably gonna have some fights at 170 pounds eventually if I'd imagine at 155 there's you know there's good fights for him Tony Ferguson it's a great fight for him I'm really interested in seeing that I'm really interested in seeing him going up I'm really interested to see him fight at 170 pounds look they from the fight well first of all tyron woodley who's the champ at 170 that would be an insane fight George st. Pierre if he decided to come back and make a big super fight that would be an insane fight I think 170 has a lot of opportunities for him but I think 155 does too they just have to figure out who's gonna fight him he's an international superstar now you know could be especially the way he smashed Conor Conor such a superstar already that the way khabib won and did it so dominant I think he's I think he's through the roof now I think when people when he comes back and people see the pay-per-view numbers of his fights are gonna realize how huge this guy is because he's so interesting he's very humble very very he's very polite very well-spoken a very religious guy lives with his family lives with his parents lives of his parents his family I believe yeah hope I'm not speaking out of school I believe that's true and obviously it doesn't have to for money he's rich as shit now yeah but he's just a monster the best best grappler I've ever seen inside the hundred fifty five pound division he just smashes people anything about John Jones though what in what way and his skill he's phenomenal incredible the best ever using distance he knows distance better than anybody he's a master at knowing when he can hit you and you can hit miss watching him fight you know he's back you just won just won the title again just find out Andy Gustafson yeah yeah a couple weeks ago yeah vacant title it was Daniel Cormier relinquished his title and it was like it's weird right a Cormier is the champ because Jon Jones tested positive for something so they stripped him and then Cormier became the champ it's a you know I think they'll probably fight again whether they fight again at heavy way like having really yeah I think Cormier and John Johnson for me wants to once keep going he says he wants to retire soon he's 40 you know yeah I feel looks good he looks great especially at heavyweight and heavyweight he's he doesn't have to cut weight he's got so much strength and - so agile he's such an unbelievable wrestler - I mean his wrestling skill his skill level and understanding of wrestling is so high so above mostly anybody find out find a gym John Jones he dominates yeah yeah that's how good John is John's dad good he's doctor I mean it just sucks that he's had so many controversies in his life but I'm hoping he puts all that shit behind him have you ever spoken with him about that never Bundys personal life anything when we met before and talked well you're a guy who's gone I mean when you went through legal problems yourself you you overcame you came out of it on the other hand I think would think a guy like him could benefit a lot from so it's just so difficult and so unfortunately they have to go do something yeah you know do you think so yes you know sometimes people they don't survive situations like that cuz they're so wild and they're having a good time too much in the party and head of the champ you have to have to come to an end that's tough if you don't bring it to an end bring come to his own end it might not like that yeah so you think Ferg I like him maybe getting in trouble was a good thing if only if you learn from experiences like that yeah you know I thought I was just a wild guy I was really a wild guys I look at myself now and I say to myself when I spent those trips in those psych wards and so what was that all about what what's wrong with me back then you know yeah really disturbed back then but you're somebody who got to the point where you got like it's really fascinating because I know you know you're a public figure so we you know I've been able to watch you my whole life you went through all that stuff and then you got to this point where you're a very self-reflective and you look at you are able to comment on it I don't think most I mean most people regardless of whether they're famous or not just still don't get to that point where they're able to look back and examine who they were and doing wild shit and ruthless honesty yeah that's okay reflecting yourself to discover who you really are yeah when you're twenty years old and all of a sudden you're the heavyweight champion the world in just a few years ago you were poor and now all the sudden you're the king of the world that's really crazy you know really I was unable to handle it I wouldn't expect that that was a really fucker puncher idea that Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's animated it's on YouTube now of you and him coming over your house in a limousine and you Ella it was a lion or a tiger tiger theme of the line for the tiger dude it is one of the craziest fucking stories I always when surfer people who don't know I got to hang out with you at one of my shows one time and it was a great I had the best time talking about everything what made you think you could get a tiger so I'm in prison at the time so I'm in prison I'm talking to my car dealer at the time and he has a he has some cars to belong to a friend of Mines esposa friend of ours and he's discussing if he doesn't pay for these cars imma sell these cars to someone and get some horses horses lions tigers I'll see you do can you give me some tigers yeah man how cool that baby because I had a bunch of friends because man that man you be in the Aston Martin or Ferrari have a tiger right next to you that would be cool right yeah give me some consonant then when I came home I had those Cubs right there waiting for me so you raised them as Cubs yeah that's that's how you were cuz I would see footage of you like fucking smacking them around and jumping on one of your Tigers and I was like holy shit and I had wasn't their bag that their mother the mother there baby now it never gets this is a crazy picture you and your underwear with a tiger on a chain that is that is one of the as dance right there that's you a peak crazy yeah insane yeah going through my mind made me think about my friend said Mike you can get some awesome animals I'm gonna give him hot for everybody does it though those are things about what's his face from narcos Oh Pablo asked you got like a fucking zoo yeah they all do it don't you get like that rich you're like just get some Adam that's right Jack Noah that's right Michael Jackson yeah the zoo and his back that's true yeah that weird shit like weird birds yeah I don't think it may be out of monkey or something he did have weird okay nothing Dane hung up there before at the Playboy Mansion this is at the end of his career if I can't well the thing years ago something that was pretty awesome yeah that guy man what a life he lived you yeah pajamas they're sucking his balls and he's 80 and shit no deep into his 90s yeah that's yeah he'd be really here's the thing that dude lived the lifestyle he was talking about you know a lot of people talk shit yeah you don't really do that he was really dark after getting dark too much yeah wait one other thing I got it cuz I got it run I wanted that going man I gotta go I gotta go meet the wife man oh yeah they'll do it I read one time cuz alright so for people that know I met Mike on a flight and it was a surreal experience you know like from from being a kid and thinking like this is Superman that's what I thought as a kid I just you know I mean like those well you see it as a kid - I think it's different like you're just like that is so nuts like these 11 second knock out you know is so bizarre periodically even to this day people come up to me and talk about the experience that they feel how many talked about meeting me through that true story is that true yeah mostly stories you know and it was a it was a surreal experience and you know we spoke on the plane and and then like well I thought we were done talking you know how I face forward and then he came back and like tapped me on the shoulder I was like oh shit like Mike's talking to me I'm down here like seat belt seat belt it in but then we land and and he was like oh where's your show and and and I go oh here it's here I gave him the number never expect to hear hits me up the next day and he's like we're coming to your show and I was like oh my god and I really did say like I'm amazed that you're coming and he said it's all love and I just said I love you what to say I I remember I called the the Pittsburgh improv manager and I go hey man I just go you're not gonna believe this but Tyson's coming to the fight tonight he goes Mike Tyson I go no fucking Tyson chicken yeah Mike Tyson's coming tonight he's like I'll corridor off a whole thing and you know and I didn't know he was at the show because it the show had already started I didn't see him arrive and we go back to the green after I did the show I walk up offstage and he grabs me and he goes let's go to the green room so he took me to my greenroom right like he was like and I was like fuck yeah and we hung out in that green room over an hour and just shooting the shit and talking and when I forgot like if the time had passed I opened the door the entire staff entire staff is lined up at the door to meet him like that's the effect that he has on the group you know like they're waiting in a line for an hour outside the greenroom and I you know we talked about boxing about life it was it was fascinating one of the things I really appreciated about you as a fighter was like that you really knew that you were putting on a show so that that's something that I feel like I miss you know there's there's no one that put on the show the way you did like you knew the people bought tickets and and paid for the pay-per-view and then it you know it's still like one of my great memories man it was a thrill to meet you so I just wanted to stop by and say sounds like you wrap it girl I do oh by the way did you buy seven Bentley's that were the same color no but I put around seven Bentley's before damn they're Rolls Royces I wanted ask you did give away one when you crashed it right yeah I was married at the time the Robin Givens and we were in some fast food chain we order food and she went my pocket I guess to get some money I'm about to pay for and she's had some fun condoms came out and she was mad so she got in the car and then blowww she crashed the car into another car that was just parked it blew and she hit somebody and she hurt their arm and then the cops

Congrats on that man that looks dope awesome them folks at about this is so awesome yeah you you seem to be really enjoying this like when you're talking to your partner's out there you're you're having a good time with this oh man I never thought that and the million years I'd be able to do this and legalize yeah when did you start like regularly smoking weed I'm since I was like 10 you though the whole time we were fighting you were regular smoking week well you know when your kid your mother gives you liquor and marijuana for you make you think that you're gonna go to sleep or something yeah really yeah that never happened in my house no yeah damn that's that's harsh liquor and marijuana see if you go to sleep yeah it didn't work I don't think so do you uh what what benefits you get out of marijuana like what does it do for you hey man uh if I didn't have a bad day yeah I'm really moody guy without it and it's just um he smooths me out still they think I'm a whole different person yeah on top of my game I'm ballin yeah I feel the same way sometimes it makes me nicer yeah yeah calms me down do you like Who I am I smoke you know I mean when I'm when I weed I don't think I'm like Who I am sometimes that's just the real thing yeah yeah I don't like that guy want to get away from that guy well you know I was talking to Michael Irvin once he was explaining to me that when children grow up in high stress environments that their genes are wired to have a propensity towards violence that they're normal if it's normal if it's around them all the time when they're when they're growing up and when they're in the womb yeah I agree when their mothers under extreme stress if they live in a bad neighborhood the and it's it's hard for some people like yourself that did grow up in an environment like that to ever reach where you're at right now just a place of peace and if you can do that through marijuana or whatever it is yoga meditation whatever it whatever you do to get there like we should be happy that you can get there that's what we don't listen I'm so grateful that um I embarked on this you know I've never been a person to this it's magnitude that this kind of relaxation is enjoying my time with you I was very up tighter than anything I was very uncomfortable with myself did you feel any better after you worked out when you were young like that absolutely my works out um you know what um the best thing that happened to me that retired from boxing is with me working out and meeting I was so intense with this my whole my whole objective was hurting people and wouldn't be the best of my ego took over and I'm like icing on the best living all this bullshit and the other with my partner Rob Hickman I happen to embark on this come across this thing called the toad and he familiar with the toad yeah well you're talking about his five methoxy powerful that fit right there yeah yeah and I came across that and um guys smoke this on I don't know this medicine drug whatever you want to call it and I've never been the same I look at life differently look at people differently and the experiment that can't even express really it's almost like dying and being real reborn yeah I had the exact same experience that's what it felt like to me to like you stop existing the five meth oxys uh there's two tell me what's the deal with the five methoxy is produced by your brain but what it is is it's DMT with an oxygen molecule attached to it there's a regular DMT is N and dimethyltryptamine and then five methoxy dimethyltryptamine is DMT with like a very there's a very subtle change to the molecule and that subtle change for some reason takes away the visuals you've done regular DMT too right yes regular DMT is rich with visuals very strained bright colorful impossible to describe visuals if and yes if inconceivable inconceivable is best way but I tried to explain it to some people my wife and I it's just I don't have the words to explain it that's exactly what I always say I've done a terrible job explaining it to everybody every time I've tried it just doesn't work but all those things they give you perspectives almost like you're dying you have you you're submissive you're humble you know you're vulnerable but you're invincible still in all you know this isn't that weird feeling but you feel like you're part of the universe when you're separate from your ego you realize this whole thing you're a part of this whole thing and this whole things and stoppable it's just it's a gigantic huge all-encompassing almost like a living thing I know John this is what I also realized to have to go into the experience you realize how insignificant you are sometimes without the ego yeah you know yeah that's why you're not really much that you really thought you were yeah you are and you aren't obviously you are in everyday life I mean you go places you have a dramatic effect on people you mean a lot you mean a lot to those people that you run into you mean a lots of the people that you love and that love you but we all do and when the no one's standing no it's all it's all relative no one no one is irreplaceable but everyone is special to someone or something and at least to themselves but we're all the same we're all part of this weird crazy gigantic organism that's the human race you know so odd that you say that my mentor custom Otto his objective was to think of nothing you're nothing nothing's nothing but the objective the job and then I was a psychological warfare you know nothing matters you're nothing nothing my only thing a matter that's objective and getting to accomplishing that objective by going to these methods of boxing do you ever stop and think about how fortunate was you ran into that guy till this day I really don't understand that though how did this happen so many people listen by the time I was born he was 66 years old by the time I was born yeah crazy so many people could you know can't even explain it it's a magnificent individual he was an amazing guy an amazing part of boxing and with a unprecedented grasp of the mindset required for combat sports that was the thing that always really stood out about him like he was a guy that was so he was so well-versed in the mindset I would listen to his his speeches that he would talk when he would talk about you and he we talk about boxing we talked about fear and about fear can be a calf ire can cook your food or it can burn your house down and you have to you have to control it and when he would describe it like it would be so enlightening he was such a man of wisdom that when he would describe things they would sink in they would they would they would somebody could say the same thing but they were with him he had so much life he wasn't any happy the psychiatrist he was the doctor the father the mother you know he was just all around that individual yeah and with an amazing knowledge of boxing and forgot like you it was almost like it was ordained and that's what always failed with nem for me to meet this guy cuz I had no way in a million years everybody sees no way you're gonna be Jimi too small yeah sure no way this guys are too big for you the greatest fight ever layer this and there's only famous achieve what he was saying and things he was saying was so gigantic in my eyes yeah yeah I mean when it all happened and it turned out that he was true and you have to absorb all this when you're 20 years old you know it's I would say this about justin bieber and i don't think justin bieber nearly had to deal with what you had to deal with your your experience was so much crazier because you were not just an incredibly famous guy you were the baddest man on the planet so there was like an aura to you everywhere you went people wanted to see you you know 50-year old men don't give a fuck about justin bieber you know no disrespect he's a great guy a great singer but it's not he's like young girls for young girls that guy's unbelievably famous but he's he's been famous since he was a little kid like when people hear amazing when people hear about him going and saying like of course he's going insane you have no idea what it would be like to be him and to be 17 years old and girls literally trying to break into his house to throw a pussy at him they're coming down chimneys they're flying in on parachutes doing anything they can they just want to be around him and you want him to be normal no one can handle that what kind of music you listening to I listen to everything that they do I listen to a bit I was in a lot of classic rock for whatever reason but I've been listening a lot of Kanye West over the last few weeks he talking about Kanye yeah well he's talking about a lot of crazy shit he's tired he actually talked about DMT in one of his recent song yeah you think he did that before I think he did oh man why no he's friends with Kid Cudi mm-hmm Kid Cudi's been in here and Kid Cudi's had some psychedelic experiences yeah once you go to is your thumb you don't want to do nothing else again well it puts it all in the perspective lets you see that uh as much as this thing seems to be important this is all temporary and you're a part of forever and it also allows you to become comfortable with death yeah yeah you know who said that Larry Hagman remember that guy Dallas yeah from jr. he did an interview with CNN and I Dream of Jeannie as well yeah that's right he sprung it on him on CNN once he was talking about how he did acid he took a big dose acid and he's never worried about death ever again that it just alleviated his worry about passing on wow this is that I felt the same way after well doesn't matter anymore yeah I think Deonte even more specifically because they think you might be the face to mine that way what caused effect on mine that way they don't tell it that it meant govision a yeah visualize everything they don't totally know they know that your brain makes it they know that your body makes it they should say if they know that it's produced in your liver and their lungs and there's some evidence now because they found it in rats that the pineal gland produces it which is like that's the third eye of Eastern mysticism that gland actually in rats they've proven produces DMT and they think it does so in people too you know once I did I wanted to do it again and again and again they say you shouldn't do too much Mike laughing I got you know grass what's going on here why am I feeling this way why did this in a weird way like humbled you I don't think you should listen to the people say shit you know too much I think you should do it as much as you want that's what I agree with - yeah if you can handle being like Tyson you can handle doing DMT issues thank you yeah that's what I think I'm going that direction well I mean I mean it's not something you do all day every day but you can learn a lot from it it's and it's it's very beneficial and very strange that it's illegal you know that it's illegal yeah notice that McKenna had a joke about it because your body's making it so everybody's holding we all have it you know it's illegal but it's like making blooded legal everybody and then why would he go to scenario deadly when they find these toes yeah yeah I've never experienced it from the toad of only watchin television a wit would the way they extracted grandma squeezes pimples and busting on the class of Maryland didn't take it off and he later hi yeah you they let it dry in the Sun they scrape it off with a razor blade yeah I've only had it synthetically made in a laboratory you used to be able to buy it online used to be able to buy like a fucking can of it like this big enough to get like a whole state high she's fired online it was totally legal incredible yeah it's weird it's bazan it is illegal well they would say not for human consumption I don't know what the fuck you're doing with it if you're not using it for human consumption but you used to be able to buy I've never felt anything like that before no nothing like make me not want to do any nothing else king of superseded that how long ago did it happen only around two months ago yeah did you write down what happened after it happened or did you record it no I wish I did yeah we should yeah me too if you like it goes away like a dream right and comes off you know you're so scared you know I love you yeah love everybody yeah so passed out yeah did you have a hard time letting go at the beginning else fighting I don't think stop wanting to stop now just jump stop the shit now stop in the growling hey I can't go for the ride dude it was like oh man like I'm dying things are going off them seen the Aztec things I've seen taupe I'm gonna seem weird animal but mainly it flashes it's like another chamber its boom flashing that phone yeah you've gone it's like the rock are you taking off room yeah it's beyond your imagination yeah death is inconceivable can you explain it to no one well I'm hoping that they start with psilocybin because I know maps there they're doing some great work with that trying to get these things legalized especially they're doing MDMA studies with veterans and people with PTSD and they're having great results they're moving in the psilocybin they would love to get psilocybin legal and it's up for ballot I think was in Oregon is that where it is it's up for I think Oregon is up for legalization this year and it may be eventually in California as well they made I think I'm gonna do a session it should be legal doesn't kill anybody it should be it's not a bad thing if they regulate it if they make it for therapeutic use and just set up centers where experts can show but they shouldn't make it prohibited for people to own it or even grow their own it's not a bad idea to set up places where people can do it under a professionals care a shamans care or physicians care that's a good idea but making it illegal is a bad idea because it helps a lot of people you know people think of it as a party drug they think you're gonna do mushrooms and freak out and go fuckin run around naked do my since I love mushrooms yeah well psilocybin and DMT are very closely related chemically all those really potent psychedelic drugs are very closely related they all break down in some similar paths inside your brain and give you that that weird ego dissolving experience that's once the drugs you do it most some ego enhancing right like coke yeah the baddest mother gone yeah you know you've never had coffee I've never had coke never never oh man yeah that one I ducked when I was in high school my friends cousin used to sell it and he wasted away to nothing him and his girlfriend would hang out in the attic never come out they would just sell coke and watch TV was bad like it was like a vampire bit him and he came up when she's getting that kind of vicious cycle as a rat yeah yeah I saw it I ducked it I ducked it early never did coke man was the first time he did coke I don't know I was kid I haven't well shit I get involved drug the early in life wow that's crazy eleven twelve yeah I was still living in Brownsville Brooklyn I first ate cocaine wow that's a crazy um listen I would never let my children have a ten-year-old daughter and eight euros I would never let them live the life that I live I would hate that I'll always fight for heart never wouldn't be an environment that I grew up in yeah of course well you know you have the benefit of having gone through it you know no one else could ever understand how how how difficult any of your life must have been for you it's got to be one of the harder things when you did that documentary it's a amazing documentary when you're very honest you're very honest and and you're very open about all your experiences and the one thing I took away after like no one can understand you could you could hear a guy talk like this I could hear you say these things I could see the videos of your fights to see the videos your experience but to understand the life that you lived it's impossible it's just a guess it's like your guess for someone like me from the outside it's just really interesting I look I think about this young kid from Brooklyn New York comes to custom ro at 13 12 you know you know something Oh son I have a little self-esteem this guy gives me this big fucking ego you know I mean I live but you know I live by the rules of that ego and I stand I've accomplished so much then a Dominator ego yeah you're yourself strong people yeah yeah this anybody could be a lawyer 200 pounds I'm staring you down this weird environment growing up that way you know cuz we have people we try to avoid fights you know mean Brian for my instance we avoid fights just to be able to see what you do a UFC guy you're a fighter this is what you do for a job a lifestyle that's really bizarre you were getting positive reinforcement from thinking like that for my first time in your life absolutely yeah I ever felt like that before we liked taking up a big drug lucious booming it felt like get him and then everybody telling you you great yeah you know for the first time in your life never understood that and you know what else custom model used to do with me he used to take me to a hypnotist he was a hypnotist as well he and I used to go in the the hypnotist motions what kind of shit do they make you do you know how they do it yes you relax you go under you totally focus on blackness nothingness right you go under and yes being the savage intelligent having no animal just working you're gonna do this you're gonna be a ferocious animal you're gonna fight put both hands to the body you lose your job you do this and ferocious fashion and they speak taller than we have I was younger and you were like 12 13 years old Wow so they're putting you under and just teaching you that mindset yeah whoa did he give you any advice on how to shut it off no there's no time no time I'm not gonna teach him the off switch just hit the gas that's what it was together asteroid these guys these guys in our way of you know me greatness glory it's one of the hardest things that many fighters I've and that I've watched over the years have the problem of shutting it off like turning it on and living like that and just wanted to be a Dominator within learning how to be a father learning how to be man my first my first lifetime with children and stuff trying to do this stuff man I felt so disasters thing it was just um I had no idea what I was doing - I had no idea who I was what arena I was stepping into it was just it was just disasters I find out I spent most of my adult life now I'm apologizing to my kids you know I mean yeah yeah I can imagine being fitted horrible father do you think they understand what the shit that you were going through they understand like I have no idea if I try to basically make sure that part of my life is empty now I live different life for my kids Ryan family now yeah well that's beautiful it's beautiful that you you you like Thomas saying earlier you have a lot of self-reflection you've managed to look at your life and and find out what's what has value to you what would helps you you always have to do self-evaluation I'm gonna strong believer in that you might have to check you you have to check yourself I agree yeah well especially a guy like you who's you know you're you've been checked your egos been checked your life has been checked you've had so many down moments as well as up moments you've had double the full ride of experiences never thought of surviving with my ego being chicken no idea that wasn't what it was about so you thought if your ego checked you would go away I'll be nothing with my ego Wow yeah well I mean it makes sense when you're going through all that hypnosis when you're 12 and 13 years old that's a crazy thing to do to a kid because no I did what I wanted to do it feel bad kick feet feel bad you could tell you know I watched a video of you real recently you were about 16 16 17 years old and you were sparring with some big guy who is a professional heavyweight and you were it was what was fascinating to me about it wasn't just watching move around when you were young and still learning but it was also you were upset at yourself after it was over you didn't think it went well and I was like remember you don't remember he's an interesting video man you were like I didn't go well could tell it didn't go well I was a thick perfection yeah that's what I was gonna say it seemed like it like you were obsessed that's my whole life they thought they would look at bachlin watch box to read about fighters about fighters fighters oh my god don't be a groupie that's another amazing imagine that you also knew Jim Jacobs and that yeah and fight library that I did with what films amazing this is pre VHS right people at VHS but not many and there's fight those fights weren't on VHS no way remember before like if you didn't if you missed the fight you weren't gonna see it again right yeah yeah and Jim Jacobs you kept those things on like a regular old projector type thing a myth you know listen to the voiceover on some of those old fights it's Jim Jake - yeah it's him doing commentary on some of the old fights that didn't have anybody study all these guys all day and all night he studied oh yeah he was through you that I learned about a lot of fighters when you would talk about Jack Dempsey I talk about different fighters from the old days I learned about a lot of those guys from you I went back and watched some of those tapes and now it's beautiful now you can just get on you too you see whatever you want everything see all of it but to go back and that's my way to my office and I can't wait I want you to come by to the ranch - and love - I'm in productive it's gonna be off so you said 2020 - yeah so four year or what is it yeah four years from now three years from that'll be pretty awesome yeah that's awesome well the plans look amazing you know how long you guys been working towards this Amy listen we have seen the property and then we purchased it and we were just um we're just overwhelmed with this probably I don't know maybe a year ago maybe no maybe a maybe years so you know or you can have a gym up there hey well I never thought but we will have because we have the Wellness yeah dude how great would it be if you taught like a boxing class Harry no no that's stuff we gotta hang out there and work out just a fun boxing class like hitting the heavy bag just something you don't have to get people beating each other up do you know how much people would pay to smoke weed and come where how to box from your smoke we do you smoke weed with people just regular folks yeah yeah yeah I was trying to get my wife to smoke with me now Chism's well yeah she's my thing she can't function during the day all right well if you I would imagine if I was a mother I would be very hard to get high cuz I get paranoid you know I'd be like yeah yeah at nighttime it's different smoke a little weed relax how did you ever do anything I did kickboxing and hyeondo tournaments I was uh I was pretty good at Taekwondo I won a bunch of state championships and won a few few national tournament you know you wanted to get physical in another human being and do this stuff you know you can't be in right frame of mind I want to do this stuff realize that I was not in the right frame of mind yeah and that's dealing with fear drives you insane yeah deal with that drives people insane I was insane during my career yes madly insane from fear yeah obviously I never went through anything like the level that you went through but for these full-contact taekwondo fights i was always scared and but i was scared before that I was I moved around a lot I was a little kid I was never very big and we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco when I was seven from San Francisco to Florida when I was 11 Florida to Boston when I was 14 or 13 so it's just always moving in new schools always dealing with new kids and I wasn't big and I didn't know how to fight and I got picked on and I didn't like it so I said I wanna I want to figure out a fight and so I started getting into martial arts and I just became obsessed with it I did it every day I started teaching I was teaching at Boston University I was teaching a Taekwondo course when I was 19 I was competing from the time I was 15 I just threw myself into it it's all I did every day I worked at the school I was there every day I had the keys I closed up I opened up where I in because of you because hearing about you and you you were running in the morning when you knew that everybody else was asleep that gave you an edge I'd go there in the middle of the night and open up and work out I just wanted to just have an edge you know and I listened to what you said I said that's a great way to have an edge I became obsessed with it but there was no future in it and then what happened was I went from Taekwondo to kickboxing and when I started kickboxing I started getting fucked up dudes are beating the shit out of me because I was realized like I can't keep people at the same distance anymore because I didn't know how to use my hands properly like I knew how to throw some punches a little bit from Taekwondo but it's not nearly sophisticated as boxing or kickboxing and so then I started kickboxing training and then I started realizing like there's no future in this like what am i doing I'm just getting my brains beat in you know and I'm hard sparring to the sparring was rough it was Boston style put the gloves on beat the shit out of each other figure it out as you go along so a lot of headaches and you know but it was it was hard for me to shut that that part of me off the part of me they just wanted to conquer the part of me just wanted to win all the time to figure out a way to be more intense more driven more focused but when I did stop fighting it was a huge relief like the relief part was worth the the extra anxiety that I got it was worth it just for the relief of not not thinking about fighting all the time not thinking about when's the next tournament when's the next event when's the next thing I'm doing it was just that wait well for you it had to be wait crazy because the money's at the wait it's the heavyweight championship of the world I always wanted to make my mentor happy yeah that's my goal to make him happy when he died was it weird not having a person like mine it was so man it was just um emptiness it was just and then people who we thought with our friends than that we say we're gonna be good to they have started when he died they had started going in for the kill you just wanna you ask me for means what seemed like you and Kevin Rooney had a good combination at the beginning when he died when when come we didn't know what we were gonna do they were thinking about getting rid of Kevin a son I was saying I don't wanna be nobody else right anybody was comfortable with Kevin in the style of the way we were gonna any one of you know let's just keep Kevin yeah and Kevin was a great trainer for me very well-respected trainer yeah it was a good relationship but the way it worked in the beginning and looked like but then like all things you know Kevin used to train me and then fight now finally than the caught no really yeah Wow Wow and this was all what was he training you before before cus tight as well well yeah how many how many years before costs died was he like holding mitts for you and if the couple but he knew you well yes did you watch our well did he watch fights with you as well did you what were you watching those funny noises know what to fight think once we um started training with each other we started watching fights together because your stuff that was the other thing to your style the way you would come out was so reminiscent of old fighters when you come out with no socks on black shoes wow that would think my mind I'm thinking about gladiator me - I would another thing I look at enough looking at stuff were you were tough man I know what you're saying I know what you're saying but you were when you fought Marvis Frazier on was that ABC war yeah little thing maybe she had fight I remember watching that fight going holy shit holy SH that was like being locked into a ring with a tornado that was wild a yeah it was the tough that was your peak that was when it was peak scary you know you were coming up and everybody was just terrified it's just a wild thing to watch man to be a part of it to be you yeah I wanted to make my mentor real happy though that's my main goal and fighting it's a powerful goal yeah did you ever try to go back and get hypnotized after all that's over to try to maybe calm down that part of your mind the no um I never did I had told I think help me out the total yeah stuff that stuff will help me out yeah did we'd help you out at all and pretty much yeah I mean but I have to do it every day I'd do it all the time right dude all the time then yeah if I went to another country and I didn't have my weed I'll be insane what a couple of days a month yeah yeah the rest the world will catch up eventually they'll catch up eventually it slowly happened and we were talking about it before the show started that just a few years ago if you smoked weed you you felt like you were a criminal like you have to hide though they look around man you look around that a cop still like that in New York I was in New York recently we had a hide we'd still illegal there I'm like how is this New York City so antiquated today so stupid just doesn't make any sense especially when like we're both high right now then man the kite it's fine everything's good having a nice conversation totally agree how many fights did Jim Jacobs have in that library I don't know thousands of me I watched thousand guys fighting in 1898 watch them all Wow who-who were standouts for you outside of the standard like obviously Jack Johnson yeah he was awesome too um he was just amazing he was ahead of his time fighting little guys like Tony Kevin Airy handy Armstrong Barney Ross guys like that Benny Leonard this guys are just they evolved buckling to the level where I can evolve to now they became they were superstars in that time who's that crazy middleweight who went up to fight Jack Johnson yes Stanley Ketchel that's right he's a bad head punch yeah he the badass then he got killed yeah guys I'm yes so this guy's good yeah he was a tough girl what are you gonna do about it beat the guy he'll be disrespecting the guy and the guy came back and shot him yeah Stanley kid threw the real wild and crazy guy well most of the greats were yeah wow that's a good feeling for anyone well when you talk about like your life and like the way you were living if you go back to most the greats like Roberto Duran he was a mother father's mom he's beautiful it was beautiful rhythm with it yeah there's so many of the greats were just wild wild people you know I think that that fear that breathed that out of you yeah but then there was some greats that were just real disciplined like struggling in Marvin Hagler's my best example for that when I was a kid growing up in Boston Hagler was the middleweight champion the world and I used to see they stop video him running they played it on the news he was running on the there was the dunes sand dunes and Cape Cod in the winter freezing cold with a hoodie on running screaming war whoa it was amazing Marvin Hagler made you want to just get out of your house and go running in the snow you know he was so disciplined that was the thing that I always got out of watching him wasn't that he was so wild he was so mentally strong he had an iron chin and his discipline was impeccable his D was just constantly training never out of shape never got fat always doing sit-ups and push-ups him ferocious animal right through the body yeah oh he was chiseled he was a machine that fight with Tommy Hearns one of the greatest middleweight encounters of a long time chaos I mean it's we didn't know what was that we thought I stopped the fight I thought the fightin the Tommy hands it'll be the winner is skillful as they were they decided to just smash just get into the setter and fucking fight there was no like Tommy Hearns could try to try to use his jab you know try to take him out you know Sugar Ray Leonard did their own that they weren't at their prime then yeah you know I wanted to see those two guys and their primers go at it yeah Sugar Ray Leonard went especially when he fought Hagler he fought higher smart to stay the fuck away exactly I heard the craziest rumor tell me if this is the craziest rumor that Marvin Aguilar like decided to bet on himself for that fight didn't knew that he was going to lose like they had it set up and then retired and went to Italy as a ridiculous rumor right I don't know what anybody did but I never heard anything like that he never heard that one no but he's the more one of the most interesting end of careers ever heard I'm rumored that he didn't fight the fight that he should have fight that he should have fought right you know I mean well the rumor was he went to Italy because the mob said everything yeah some thing he went to Italy and became a giant movie star but he's the only guy that I can think of in recent memory that literally went out on top had is unbelievably close fight with Sugar Ray Leonard a lot of people think he could have won that fight very close decision and then says that's it see ya I'm done everybody comes back come back you know I guess I'm at one time that's your whole life I won't think of I'm surprised I never came back that was just my whole life that's my whole identity yeah yeah I mean um but when you did retire and when you retired in the ring that was the most honest retirement speech I've ever heard a boxer give ever he's just like I don't I don't have this in me anyone swim in the air anymore just um that was pretty bizarre for myself you know this is what I base my life on doing I when I first started doing that I'm I dedicate my life to this stuff he has to see that it's not even no longer happened was pretty weird when did you know that you didn't want to do it anymore I'm knowing years before that bite was still being very successful yeah like when like what year like do you remember around when you start thinking it I remember probably around what the 2000 area so by the time that that's post Holyfield yeah after yeah and you just get it done too much I was just one of them running beating guys you know guys get hit something from gotta be so scared yeah what did what did you have in mind like that's the hardest thing right to swing from that to the next thing like how do you take how do you take this crazy exciting life oh no I fed everything let me if get high for a while and figure this out that was the plan yeah any party for a while I figured this stuff out what did you figure out that I wanted to do with things so I started my wife arranged for me to be this death being on stage that she created the Maya yeah that's a brilliant idea cuz you're also the first fighter that ever did that because many fighters have great stories but very few of them ever I don't think anybody besides you was ever put into it we were all just see if he did it man it's just amazing we did a monocle we didn't own we didn't believe that people want to see this though well like I said the documentary was amazing so people want to hear the live version of you talking about it and to see you live in person because the first time we did it the first thing we did on Broadway that is really that's sure about how it's going to turn out so we invited all of our friends we had taken they gave all our friends and people we love like names report them to the show and so when we started they started laughing but I left I ran to my right wife around let's do this baby what's going on listening okay you know I didn't want this show to be a comedy turned out to be a hard gritty show about a tough guy I made it to his toughness and he just came up with me talk about myself how much the schmuck I am you know he loved it I think that was part of it is because like they all everybody knew you were this tough guy but they didn't know that you could be so self-deprecating and have so much fun with it all you know that's what people loved it because yeah obviously they're doing a writing from a moving scene who's playing you in a movie Jamie Jamie Foxx he could do it he could do anything he could do anything anything that guy could be the fucking president United States he could be a pilot that goes to the moon he could do whatever the fuck you want him to do it yeah he could do whatever he wants he'll probably bulk up like crazy to do it absolutely really Wow yeah Jamie could pull it off Michael Jai White pulled it off huh Michael John why didn't do it like Gino I've done it into a bag laughing what he did I think he did a good job he I loved him and spawned he's a great guy do you know him well no he's a great guy great guy very smart guy very humble guy really really intelligent and a great martial artist too Michael Jai White there's a kill Kishen karate black belt is badly my fight do you fight in the UFC no when he was fighting there was no UFC around but he did a lot of karate tournaments and stuff it's very good I watched him train before he's legit very legit like I said real real good guy but yeah I agree Jamie Foxx man Jamie Foxx is on another planet he's just got this level of competence and skill and artistry in his singing and his comedy and his acting he could do anything he could play you he's gonna hang out with you for a while I don't know what he's gotta he's got to hang out with you pretty awesome he's got to hang out with you gotta absorb it right yeah are you gonna be there kiss consultant are you gonna be like bitch I wouldn't never said that I would like to say that yeah but for some reason they just um they have the Hollywood ways of doing things yeah I mean then we can come out hollywood ish yeah because some things they're just really wild they try to switch it to appear presentable right yeah they try to change the story and no one else I realized who when Hollywood perspective something that really just is just still unbelievable yeah unbelievable yeah well do you know that movie Foxcatcher did you know that yeah the roughly movie mm-hmm I remember that story of the young guy remember that yeah that Mark Schultz is Dave Schultz at Marlys Dave Schultz is the one who got murdered Mark Schultz is the guy who fought in the UFC here's what's crazy about that movie I don't know how much of that movies accurate I don't know I wasn't there but what I do know is the one thing that I for sure know happened they changed when he fought in the UFC Mark only fought the UFC once he fought a guy named Big Daddy Goodrich Gary Big Daddy yeah big black I wore karate ghee and then eventually got really key later in his career but he's a legend Big Daddies imagining them in the movie it's not Big Daddy and the movies fighting some white guy it doesn't make any sense yeah they just take changed who he's fighting for no restore achill event it's like if you for whatever reason they decided not have you fight Trevor Berbick you fought someone else like you fought Gerry Cooney for the title which I'm gonna be great they'd be like why would you change history like I hope they don't do that I'm not going to one i can't one do they do something like that have to be they did it with the UFC they did it with locks can be right but it doesn't make it any better that's what's crazy it doesn't make the movie any better to have him fight a Russian guy doesn't make me verify known right especially for people like me that are in the audience that go oh look look who's playing Big Daddy how did he do a Big Daddy Big Daddy stuff he took Big Daddy down it yeah they did whatever you wanted to him he's Mark Schultz he was a motherfucker of a wrestler I mean him and his brother were savages there were savages they were just made out of world the deal with that guy had they hooked up with that guy was really really rich and there's no money in amateur wrestling and these guys a lot of them are really struggling when they're trying to make the Olympics team I mean they're getting by barely they barely have enough money for healthy food and they need sponsors and sometimes to get sponsors like a rich guy who owns a business you know he loves the Olympics he loves wrestling maybe he wrestled in college and he'll take care of them get maybe get him some vitamins maybe sponsor him with the and then you know they have various people that help them with their training and their food but this guy came along and said look I'm gonna build a gigantic facility to create the best wrestling program and pay you guys all money to come and train here and they couldn't help it it's like they were poor they didn't know what to do I understand that yeah and he was a guy who was like a trust fund guy got all his money from his family and he was just some crazy rich asshole and he wound up shooting one of them yeah I mean that's what it is I mean the still lucky said the story itself he's fucking crazy enough the actual story they didn't have to change anything of it so I know they changed that part of it so who knows what else in the movie they added or changed or fucked with they fucked with something they didn't have to fuck with they were in Hollywood with it the way that they didn't have to do so it makes you you question all the other things that happened in the movie that's pretty bizarre so for you they can't do that your life is crazy insane I'm know what I was saying about the car we don't really want to do this stuff man I really want to go on the screen with my life and be severe with these people yeah I don't really need that I think about this and this cam has been ready to pop off and do really well I'm thinking really that we need this money you said I hurt you it's not gonna hurt you it's gonna help you anything helps you at this point you're so honest that anything that you've done in the past that you're embarrassed about or you shameful of it just makes it's just better this is better for you it's like yeah you made mistakes is people can learn from them these are beneficial so watching someone like you talk about your life is beneficial for people because you learn how you can overcome these experiences how how bad things can be for you you learn how bad you can fuck up and people need to see shit like that it's good for it's good for civilizations good for our culture I think so a plus a guy like you who was like I said when I was a kid you were the fucking man I mean you were the fucking man to have a guy like you be self-deprecating explaining and laughing about things it makes it even if it sinks in more it's like you were saying what we were saying about cus D'Amato that his wisdom is sunk in like he was the the gravel and his voice and the intensity in his eyes and the wisdom and his words it sunk in I remembered his quotes for years afterwards because he lives so much because he had so much and that's the same thing with you man when you when you're talking about your life experiences like people listen they take it in because they know you lived an extraordinary life so they better not fuck this movie up yeah really extreme extreme as it gets what's Mark's dream other than soldier those are the only people that live a more extreme life first responder soldiers firemen police officers yeah that's it I mean they they're seeing death and violence every day other than them you probably live the most extreme life ever who the fuck could relate to you do you ever get together with they're like world-class Pro boxers sort of no but the guy that do get him into the guy you talk about the veteran of this yeah maybe tell me with the hall man yeah I talked to seals about their time deployed surprised they don't think themselves out of those guys mm-hmm yeah yeah doc thanks well a lot of those guys are finding some relief in the same things you've known relief and they find relief in DMT and other psychedelics mushrooms I think that could be a great benefit to a lot of our veterans I believe that 100% so I don't know why they don't want to dabble in this stuff yeah what do you think would have happened to you if you got a hold that stuff while you and your prime I don't know I don't think maybe I want to be a fighter in yeah maybe I won't want to be a fighter damn deep DMT might have derailed it yeah I might want to love everybody ever make you feel like we come out of these I love you yeah yeah well my hope is that with great organizations like maps that one day people will be able to see things like everybody be able to see things the way you do and then we'll all have this understanding what these things are they're they're tools that can help us all these things including marijuana it's a tool to help us you could use it as any tool you could abuse any tool there is you can take a hammer and hit yourself in the head if you're stupid you could use anything but you could also use it you know and make builders have a beautiful house and with cannabis you can you could use it to make even makes you a nicer person it does makes you more I feel more vulnerable I have more of a sense of community I'm always hugging people when I'm high I want to hug everybody you know I agree it's a better feeling there yeah I mean it makes you it makes you feel kind agree I like feeling high what does it like for you to watch boxing these days it's not my life anymore do you don't watch it at all it did you watch Tyson Fury Wilder great fight I was in the air flying when they were fight oh really did you didn't watching the highlights or anything for some of the highlights yeah how crazy is Deontay Wilder power good stuff crazy rights because he's built so strange totally incredible with faith and chill incredible incredible and gets up and wins the rest of the round that's what's really incredible it's amazing amazing file yeah so you don't follow you know following okay um you know I'm that part of my life um I'm all right I got mixed feelings to that part of my life right that's tough but I don't like about myself and stuff is right I try to forget that stuff I'm on a whole different fight and yeah so even watching other people bar you Don only what's nothing I try to stay away what's possible so watching other people Vox makes you think about yourself when you were fighting it reminds you of it kind of yeah yeah oh we've got so much Nathan and I was the cool guys yeah right like who out yeah there's no one out there today that's got that mean vicious persona guys yeah you when you were in the ring doing a post-fight interview saying you wanted to eat your children you want to eat someone's children I'm never saying this is the craziest fucking post-fight interview was about Lennox Lewis right yeah the great it was amazing it was amazing for the story for the time I mean look what it was was when we saw Rocky three right and mr. t was challenging you know rocky and he would say all that crazy shit about what he was gonna do my prediction beautiful what you did is you took that just cranked it up to 11 and threw gasoline on it lit it on fire you just took that kind of ferocious shit talk yeah I look at some of those a long time saying yeah anyway it's a different world now my world feel different now do you feel when you watch that stuff that you feel almost like trapped by that past like that you have to acknowledge and you don't even acknowledge it anymore yeah I'm almost a little bit like I don't want to be involved wish that never happens yeah yeah but kind of had to happen for you to be who you I know it's because people are this is the real reason right people still people love that guy yeah yeah and people love that I didn't like that guy that much so I have my conflicting with people that like that guy me living my life that I am living now yeah well people loved that guy because that guy gave them a drug and that drug was excitement like you you turn on the TV I go shit here we go Michael spanks Mike Tyson here we go and boom oh that's what people wanted they wanted that excitement they knew some crazy shit was about to go down unpredictable you can't you don't no one knows what's gonna happen in a fight it's gonna be a right or a left is he gonna move right he's gonna move left how's it gonna work out you don't know how long could Spinks last you don't know and everybody was excited and that was that's what you brought people you brought people this this chaotic moment you slap down the money in the pay-per-view got at your popcorn and you waited for the rush the rush of excitement of the crazy days crazy days I hate to keep bringing your head back to that but just for me as a kid growing up during that time it was a big part of my you know my becoming an adult it was during your era your era of dominance I would look at my kids and I think why these guys are pretty much middle class kids they live their life to do what they wanted to go to college everything I whatever I would never want to put that pressure on my son that you have to be the total best you have to dominate everybody you gonna be the best that ever liveth this is put that kind of pressure that's incredible would never do that to though yeah it would never work probably I mean I don't think a kid that grows up in a loving household would support it yeah that's boxing for when you have nothing yeah we need to boxing when you have nothing because that's a lot of that's a lot of dedication that's a lot of pain there's a lot of aggravation you know really if discovering who you are but you must be able to take pride in the fact that your children don't ever have to do that oh and that's why I took the punches for they wouldn't have to do yeah I had my firm I have the son of 16 he wanted to be a boxer you're being tripped into your trips and also vacation you ever fight again I don't know buddy maybe I do fight some guy like me Manimal get on my kids go through that crap that's the degrading some guy like that beam on you yeah that's the thing is the fuel that you had the the the burning inferno inside you you can't replicate God you don't understand that they don't I don't know you know a lot of stuff from inspiring inspires a lot of success yeah you know yeah they don't have to deal with that kind of shame right right shame pain exactly feeling being left out feeling of not belonging and you know I do this I'm gonna be a buddies I love me yeah crazy feeling it's really amazing to get people look you wanna be accepted so badly yeah imagine that it's really accepted keep it a look at you you know I know what kind of minefield that left they either won't people just look at you yeah oh man yeah but it's beautiful that you could describe it that way now like you've stepped outside of it long enough do you recognize what it was when it was over coming however think I think he's thirty that man of the greater this guy was a god Wow I want to be like that you know this is crazy this is crazy that you can inspire the belief that you're more than what you are well it was also those feelings of conquering we're giving you the first success and good feelings of your life and the fact that they programmed you I mean that's something that I don't think a lot of people are aware of the the hypnotism the hypnotism and the the putting those thoughts into your mind which were hugely beneficial you could tap into that mind zone right before you competed they mean they they gave you a clear path they give you a clear path to use your fury with this like very analytical approach with perfect boxing technique and an amazing mentor with incredible knowledge and they just let you loose yep do the after yeah with the other than do the athlete yeah bad intention yeah being bad intention and have enthusiasm when you're fighting and love every minute of it yeah look at you getting fired up again yeah do you work out anymore no I Mack you away from that stuff you don't even like all that stuff you know spin class right no less stuff from reactivate to my ego oh really yeah oh wow I'm gonna get ripped off they react that's the thing about like extreme winners extreme winners that ego is hard in fact my ego i'ma lose like I'm losing candidate I lose everything what if you like go jogging can you go jogging no I do my treadmill working Stoke a treadmill that's it but if I thought the thing that I'm special if I get a glance a glimmer of that thing for me whoa yeah do you better than know I saw a video you hit in the bag recently was a couple years ago mm-hmm you still hit the bag still throw some bombs I do partly for the camera yeah that's what you're doing but I'm like damn you could still move you still have it in you right I don't know when it's in your body half it being to do this it feel weird but I was gonna get to when if you were standing front that heavy bag and you start rattling off combinations and people you start thinking like oh shit I'm actually Mike Tyson like I was that guy I am that guy who went through that I am the youngest heavyweight champion of all time I am that guy to destroy Tyrell Biggs I am that guy that knocked out Larry Holmes I'm that guy okay my guy I look at that guy for money if giving me a platform to help me forget about that guy Wow yeah it's it's beautiful that you have that that mindset it is because most people who've accomplished as much as you have they don't want to ever let the past oh shit let that go the thing go but do you know do you recognize that that's a beautiful part of your personality you had one of the most successful boxing careers ever but you don't want to you know nothing to do with it you don't want to we want to acknowledge it exist you wish it went away in order to arrive to that next chapter in life you have to forget chapter they came before you yeah and focus on the chapter ahead of you yes yes that's a great lesson and from coming from you that lesson I think is gonna hit home with a lot of people King fell yes honey 100 percent because you accomplished so much because you were the youngest heavyweight champion of all time because you're the baddest man on the planet this big hero for a lot of people like me when I was growing up to see you now say that's then I'm done no nothing I don't watch it I don't work out it I'm not I'm not even a part of that anymore I'm concentrating my life right now and I'm happy and I love people you know Joe that's really crazy but when you think about this listen you know being that person that guy that sent me the psych ward a couple of times it family took so many other places the prison is let me play through that guy's a trip yeah I had you in the underwear holding a tiger chance a trip man what did you go to the psych ward for it's been crazy violent probably felt about hurting myself or something crazy like that what do they do when they take you in the psych ward how do they treat you oh no same way everybody this is Mike you know but I mean how do they take care of you what do they do for you I mean how do they take my fucking pills those things are something yeah throwing you out because I'll be doing a zombie swag event yeah yeah that is what they do huh yeah just call me down medically pharmaceutically well you know what's going on we can't react to it change this and then once they got you calmed down enough to go alright you can go I don't know I don't think time for me to go I had to go what is a day in the life of Mike Tyson like now look what it was a typical day get up in the morning I go to my office my cannabis office we do deals and we get investments and I come home at five o'clock and I go see my kids left at the office later and I come home I'm away from my kids if really bizarre like we see a Newport Beach now that's not really um very now he's very upscale but it's very quiet yeah not like Las Vegas at all no one my daughter plays tennis up there so we pretty much um situated up there's not like I said baby can we move to Hollywood you know he has no clue Tennis Hall of a tennis requirement for here in Newport Beach so we stay here Newport is nice though it's a good place it's near the oceans got clean it's just different for me I bet yeah did you like living in Vegas though because always craziness and the fight did bring great parties do you go we had some great parties so you've settled into this business life it seems like pretty easily like you you seem to be enjoying yourself hey founder I want to do and if fresh start no I mean yeah doing a total you know me my main objective and anything I've been walking on and being am and father myself what it's all been because of a fresh start I feel fresh it feels newer man could stopping that could be in my way and it's just awesome feeling so this is from doing that one DMT experience you sent you into it one time but I didn't mean a many times that you know but yeah this really um I don't know what it is I'm trying to figure it out but I've changed but you don't figure it out let's don't know how yeah um I describe it for a lot of people it's like resetting a computer you reset a computer out of fresh new desktop and there's only one folder on the desktop and that folder says my old bullshit this is listen stop I'm saying to myself right now sometimes I'm wondering this new feeling I'm possessing right now if it I'm a real feeling this stuff really help i am i lying to myself again till the next moment that next feeling come to do some drugs but to be with somebody else what's really going on that feeling gonna come back yeah this moments that feel feel like I'm never coming back it can never come back if you decide that it's never coming back but you have to make that decision pretty much every day but you can you can never come back if you want or you could slip into the old ways that's what a lot of people do one of the when a lot of people fall into drug addictions relapsing when they relapse they're not physically addicted when they're relapsed obviously they're clean and then they decide to go back in it's because there's comfort in those old patterns because this new way of life is just they get anxiety they feel like it's a lot of pressure to stay clean let's explain it I hate that I always hated that all the way I never wanted to do it but then I do them again and never one that I hate no no I want you good things going on yeah doc dog vicious cycle it's real dark yeah it's self destruct dog yeah what about ego inflating and self-deprecating of the stroke it also alleviates you from the responsibility of improving 100% that pressure of like keeping it together staying sober you know being disciplined all that stuff once it's gone it's gone like I'm just fucking crazy I'm crazy this is just what I do I'm crazy and it's easy to fall into that trap and that's what happens to a lot of people who relapse with drugs I never want to go back to that again it's just a no-win situation that's one of the great things about marijuana that people don't understand they think that a drug is a drug as a drug they're all falling under the same category but you can use marijuana and just be peaceful and not chaotic and the opposite will make you think more about the consequences of ruining your life okay they sound ridiculous I got I got a foot in with the treatment she came one time for Andrew Golota I got um I had tested I tested for marijuana and they charged me $300,000 Jesus Christ finally $200,000 that's a lot of my where that money go who did it the Commission did that's what they did yeah that's crazy $300,000 for some weed in your system now you're selling it legally yeah I mean situation I'm just going with this bizarre world and see what happens it's beautiful man never thought you could do this sell marijuana no thought being that business I know at this stage of my life when it came at the right particular time I saw it online I saw Tyson ranch online I saw something on the Instagram or something and I was like that makes sense yeah yeah why not man in this day and we look everybody loves you why not why not go into business you never dreamt it but it's just a no-brainer people gonna want to buy your weed just because they love you I wanted to distribute all over the world too that's where it gets sketchy yeah there's spots in Asia you don't want to bring weed to know Singapore you can get killed oh yeah Noma that's that some parts of the world that they take yeah like I went to Europe to buy weed before I mean and it was um they were selling the plant they weren't selling the but they were selling the plant you had to buy the plant went to the plant develop and make but no it's the Wow selling the plants that purpose they wanted you to grow your own yeah does
