Davidson from the UFC is the one who I'm connecting me with the people but dude they've done a bunch of people now bunch of UFC people have staggering results yeah you're saying Roy Nelson did his knee or Cormier's Daniel Cormier Disney stem cells follow those guys at AKA i would just do every joint just even there's no prob like if he were the coach you beg just get in there and just do it but that's what ludwig did pretty much yep preemptively got both his shoulders done I think he did his hips too dude I can't imagine that fuck he's such a savage and the whole mitts for somebody like that like him like Winkeljohn should do that too like you beat the hakko to yourself Brandon Gibson all those guys you professional me older you need in that's worse than fighting yeah yeah for your shoulder joint health that's horrible specially if you holdin mints for some fuck for Jojo yeah come on well John Jones hits hard but like imagine like like like Travis Velasquez or travis browne yeah yeah palestro poster yeah especially ouster when he was on the sauce I don't know that that's true or not I believe its treasures all the problems I i believe it was proven I don't know you're saying this suspension is so dumb that drug shit wasn't stupid you know when I was in high school had to write a paper and the paper that I wrote was that you should legalize every drug and and I was all that sound be kind of thing I was our teen year old right I was all hyped up on on nwanne gangsta rap and I was like how in the fuck did eazy-e get it Uzi like he doesn't look like anybody that should have it was e that's true it's because he cancelled and the black market is the only thing that makes crime I'm like why do we have a black if they want to but that's the thing is like not everybody's all fucking excited about marijuana being you're all plots everybody's a fucking pussy you're out there like oh look at Wake and smoke a joint on CNN well guess what you still got fucking 500,000 guys that are locked up you should be protesting that every fucking day of pops really actually legal like in those states they should just be letting dudes out by the fucking dozens every minute that is true keep magic here in Colorado and you're in jail free slowly I'll be like what in the fuck what in the fuck and then how many of those guys are in there and then they fucking catch a real case in there because now you've got a fighter you're in a ride fuck it is horrible that does happen that does that all that shit should be legal the only thing that and and people like well they if they do just tax everything they just taxes the government but that's I'm the idea that the government gives a fuck the government it mean it makes more money it's not like if I can tax you who wants to buy weed I wanted how do I tax everybody I make them all scared and then I imprison guys for this illegality and then I can get the public dollars because lookit isn't it scary that we got these black and Mexican guys that are selling dope and we need to put them somewhere my stepdad and is his hit a business partner and architectural firm and they beat each other up one day should it be each other like he came home he had a black eye and he was you know in his 40s and I was a kid and I was like what first of all I was like I was fighting back down yes zero skills that's like this like what did this fight look like between because I knew his basic guess that dead or worse but it's like he's a good guy he's a bad person but I knew the guy fought with to him like that's even more ridiculous that that guy gave you a black eye cuz that has to be they automatically though they was so bad well it was a very complicated situation where they had government contracts and then the government lost money like there was like there was a recession and during the recession they canceled a lot of their contracts so these guys had put all this time and work and effort into these projects and the projects were pulled out from under them and all their investment was done super it was really bad and you know they all I'm sure there was a lot of blame on both sides and who knows what the fuck happened but it's weird when you see someone come home your stepdad guess it's got a black eye what huh like if I was Brendan Schaub it be like for sure keep your hands up next time for sure don't let him get that close to you oh my shit so my dad get in a fight when I was 12 I'm not making this up with whatever fucking cars right my dad pulls in front of him he pulls it from my dad he gets out my dad cuz you wanna fucking go my dad's like oh no like an old-school Irish like sir oh no I even remember being like 10 or 11 me like ah fuck man see the problem with that is Nick Diaz can actually fight like that oh my dad be as garrix off this dude is on it was about to throw him off the side of the highway I don't leather jack oh no did not fuck around when a guy stands out like that so that's doing the old-school boxing one of two things can happen he's trying to scare you off or he's so good with his hands yeah he just kind of roll out you like what's up dude you want some back yeah yeah we can do now is weird yeah situation I'll tell you what for reals man I'm mi dad yell the car like god damn it and then my brother gets out kicks guy in the balls from behind my brother's probably 12 at the time Jesus Christ my brother kicked a grown man and rolling out in the balls but that's when it gets really dangerous when that kid gets involved and the father becomes like super violent what little brown was doing what was well crying in the backseat how old were you fry like 10 or 11 crying in the backseat Berlin can't be trusted if she goes down Mary [Music]
