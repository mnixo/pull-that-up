hello freak bitches be more considerate or more kind it's about calling people out on doing something wrong and stopping that do you think the intent matters more than the 100% because I feel like we saw that a lot with there's a two big youtubers that were in the news or one was many was there was a PewDiePie yeah we were talk about that because I saw his response video and I kind of got sickened oh really by what's happening to him oh by what's happening I think yeah no his words well he was really crazy it was crazy the whole thing is insane they're making it out like he's a Nazi right and he's not at all know that he had made some some videos where he had told people to not be not season right not until like two - don't you know what was his exact words I don't want him to miss ripping I'm they it originally started with this whole fiber video that he did and then sighs were yeah so it's like a website where you can get people to do things for things originally for five dollars now for more money and so he went through the site it all started from this one video that got him attention he went to fiber and tried to get people to do ridiculous outrageous things okay good guy dressed as Jesus to say something weird he got these the main thing that blew up were these two guys they're like they're in like a jungle setting of some sort they dance they laughed they'll hold up a sign they'll say something and so he was like it's going to be hilarious because they're not going to do it right they're gonna be like thank you but no but they actually made a video where the guys were laughing and dancing held up a sign that said death to all Jews and and then said to subscribe to a YouTube channel right the whole bunch of a like someone else not he asked them to say death to all Jews so he wrote in as like a because in the same video he gets all these people they're like I'm not going to do the stupid ridiculous thing that you said when they actually did it the the big reason I feel like they did is they didn't understand what the words they were writing in the words that were saying oh they're from one of the country yeah what country were they from I don't know I'd have to I'd have to double-check okay so they just essentially wrote down the symbols they didn't really know how to even say that and so and there it is so there oh yeah and they're laughing yeah and so I think this might be from his explanation video but in the first one he's like why the fuck did they do it how do I can I even include this and so then that scent i got they got a little traction and then people started going through his other videos and they're like he's dressed up he's watching hitler and this one taken completely out of context of him saying that the youtube heroes program which was a program where people can highlight videos and i highlight them but mark them down for deletion because they're offensive right and so people were like oh that censorship that's you're talking about like obviously hyperbole it's like those are nazis so he made that joke in that relation and then there was one i want to say if it was on the verge or wired but then they go even further know like he's Leslie Jones picture on Harambee taken completely out of context because he was using there's this Microsoft AI BOTS like this chat bot and he'd say let me see Harambee is Jesus and either the AI was messed up or people had manipulated it where was putting Leslie Jones his face on it and he was horrified by it and that was the whole joke but they were saying that he he was doing it so this is clear like you saw him use the software right saw the error if you try and use the bot today a picture won't come up because now they are aware that that's what was happening right and so they took all these things and it was this like this crusade of look guys we're looking at this bad guy he's the biggest guy on YouTube he's the bad guy we're going to take him down so much taken out of context some things are not defensible where I can't I can't say it in the sense of like you say that words don't have power based on intent and I think there's a there's a lot of truth in that nothing words don't have power based on intent I'm saying that words should just convey intent right and there are times where a word there's times where like you see a friend you go what's up bitch you know you have a and you're both laughing and you're being silly and then there's times where you call someone a bitch right because you think they're being mean yeah I mean those two words exactly the same but one conveys a completely different intent right but out of this it was it was very obvious that they were trying to do this takedown thing and it blew up entirely in their face I think I saw it because I don't think most people are aware I mean there was a Wall Street Journal article right right which was where it where it got really weird because three people worked on this and they combed through hundred hours yeah I mean yes and they found like instances of him holding his arm out like this and they used that picture like there's a I mean that's that's weird it was very weird and then and then once all that came out that they were like well here's the thing about the context he's just like Donald Trump and it was it was an immediate jump to he's using the same tactic tactics as Donald Trump but it's it was just insane now he's very reasonable he didn't get a video response video about it and the way handle it was very reasonable yeah and he explained what he was doing what's going on and you know he's doing hundreds of hours of him playing video games and talking and be silly and if you combed through those and take these things again out of context and try to make it look like he's a Nazi that's a hit piece 100% it's deceptive it not indicative of his overall it's hard to call the body of work but what's call it a body of work right his overall body of performance that he lives online whatever you want to call it right his talking it's not who he is so for them to call him a Nazi and say that pudy pie has you know seven videos where he's done something about Nazis like people when they're doing these long-form spit ball improvisation videos like that and you're interacting with people you're going to say all kinds of shit that in the moment is legitimate but if you chop it up and edit it and splice them all together and then make a five minute montage of him saying Nazi like he's obsessed with Nazis and what kind of sucked from it was a lot of people think that oh there's articles about the downfall of PewDiePie I think he's gone up half a million if not more than a million subscribers since all of this happened right so he's gotten all this new support he's a temporary face for for free speech free speech and persecution but me Latvia didn't he lose some sanity a matter for him though he so I mean it sucks more for the people who are working on that project well what was the project so it was scare PewDiePie season 2 it was a YouTube bred series so they were I think they were about to go into production and and so then that got cancelled so YouTube didn't want to fund that and I said it he said it he understands why they would have to separate because then it becomes a story of YouTube and pewt or YouTube and Disney support an anti-semite right but obviously he's not an anti-semite so why would they back away I think because they were scared that the Wall Street Journal was like did you see all of this we're going to write this article how did the Wall Street Journal let that slip through that seems to me very response many of them are standing by it though many really yes 100% and the many are touting it as this victory because he lost Google preferred ads on YouTube which I will say I don't know how how he was still seen as family-friendly because I'm not family-friendly on my show his past two years at the very least not family-friendly and then drop by maker he doesn't he doesn't need his uh his MCM his company around him and the YouTube read series is nothing he's still going to make millions of dollars he's grown it's a good thing I feel like it now if you if you have mainstream media trying take a swing at you it's some of the best promotion in the world okay but why did they take a swing at him and why is anyone saying that they took down a bad guy I think that it's it's a big thing of them trying to label up and it's once again it's a problem with a lot of media is they're they're overextending right they all of a sudden start talking about this narrative about all right and the rise of white supremacy again in this country and then they look at this big guy and I like we can use him as an example we can be the heroes that expose this that do the takedown piece and they're not and they're not and they're like so driven for that that they then just they go well maybe that doesn't add up there it's an argument but we have the power we have the size of the audience we're good and it just blew up in their face so they were thinking they could get away with it even though it wasn't kosher I believe so what is their response so far do you know have you read anything about it as far as like fans or The Wall Street Journal oh they're pull chicks are they digging their heels in yeah and a lot of people started trying to find as always ad first aired on like the authors in the past one was like a joke from 2015 because and and while part of me would go well that's petty if the argument is that context doesn't matter then fine then then look at these guys what they said look at what they are saying now look the writers who of the aura of the article I think that been Fritz was one of the art of the writers where he made a I can't I did I never knew Jews were so good at frying joke from way back and then he made another joke about it was like a back and forth with someone where he said you know these racial jokes are so stupid and then someone said you know they hit everyone and he said well at least the black jokes are funny those ones those ones aren't funny and so people were like well if if context doesn't matter are you with scumbag right and and then people just dismissed it as or a lot of mainstream people dismissed it as like oh that's not the same thing how could anyone say context doesn't matter okay that's insane that is an insane thing to say is that literally what they said the context there was not matter what was it was one of the one of the people I'm gonna get though the problem is so many people have written about it right there was one article I was promoted and it said all these articles or all these people defending Felix with but context that's that's a bullshit argument and that's insane if you save it as I added a little hang time so everything exists in a highly edited bubble dope well ruin everyone's career if you're talking about a mathematician discussing algorithms yes context doesn't really mean that much because he's talking about numbers but we're not talking about numbers talking about words yeah we're talking about the way people express themselves and we're talking about someone who's generally considered to be humorous I mean PewDiePie a lot of his stuff is playful and humorous so if you're humorous and you're playing around and you say something that might be I don't even want to use appropriate it might be cur the thing for him to say in that moment to try to be entertaining right that does not mean as a Nazi right and to label him like that is incredibly irresponsible and it's it's really about I mean I'm not a lawyer but I would sue the fuck out of him right if I was him I would sue the fuck out of them for sure yeah because what they're doing is misrepresenting who he is as a human being and even if it's beneficial in the long run it's super dangerous to set that precedent well especially something in this in this climate where you say this is what he supports and whatever I've done isn't how do you know someone doesn't just see those articles doesn't see his defense and tries to kill the guy but why would the wall meet journal do something like that wait to jump back to what you were saying about mainstream do they have any real back my that pudy pie guy yeah in your place I get scared when everyone talks about about stuff in generalities right when I talk about and I'm guilty of it too when I talk about like all mainstream media it's not everyone you know right but there are I stopped doing interviews with mainstream outlets several years ago because they made everything about like I would talk about all the really cool ventures that were going into how our space is changing things up and it would always be turned into one comment that maybe was somewhat critical of let's say like a studio and write all become about that or if all become about like the money and and I was like you just fucking manipulating what I'm saying I don't want to live with this yeah and and so the point has become when the Wall Street Journal knocks on Felix's door after they they didn't apparently approach him for the original story you know like hey we want to give you a platform to tell your story like fuck you is that what they're doing now yeah after the story broke and there were all these people who came to his defense they they came to him now I'm not gonna that's what I think that's what the journalists should do right talk to the fuckin well so I would assume but not be after a journalist well so I think from what Felix wrote it was the Wall Street Journal they left their cards and that's how we knew it was when I'd recite them but why but that's not what I mean what I mean is a different journalist from The Wall Street Journal not to film a two-hit I don't know if it was the same ones I highly doubt hey we're super sorry we called you a Nazi in front of millions of people when we were totally lying yeah but the argument all of a sudden is that wide why should he do an interview with The Wall Street Journal maybe because they have a different audience but he has a his own larger platform where he controls the narrative he's not going to be selectively and right but he's not speaking to the people that the Wall Street Journal rest barraged him in front of but I would assume that they're also covering their ass by going to him and reaching out and giving him a platform they can say well we gave him a chance to respond when the facts remain he did say those things and they are valid I think I think if he was confident know if he should probably do what I've seen Milo you not let's do in the past where he had someone film at the same time so if they did misrepresent him in some manner but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter cuz they've already done it they've already misrepresented him in the article if they she has someone film his response I don't know I mean I mean just if he did something with them right if I did film so no I understand entire thing just so you can show but I'm saying it doesn't matter because they've already done the damage the damaging thing like how many people who read the first thing or even going to read the second thing right it might even be 30% so you have 70% people and how many people just read The Wall Street Journal and maybe a local paper and art online and aren't hearing all these responses and they go up you know they catch their son Oh watch me I'm watching PewDiePie oh you watch that Nazi I got to Nazi know he's not dad you hate everything like and now that kids doing meth to the rest of his life no I uh I think that it is sad right that's that's a huge problem with with a lot of the fake news or just news that's false is the the crazy salacious shit yeah if you then look at the correction half the time that gets like 20 times the shares you know why because it's fucking insane it's like did you see this did you see this thing and it's something that I've been critical of people I like in the industry critical of a lot of the mainstream guys I don't like it and it sucks because there's not there's not a clear answer do you delete the false thing and then it looks like you're hiding that information do you do well you should definitely delete the false thing but so if you guys my argument but then there's an argument that you you leave it up because you show that you were wrong if it's on Twitter you quote tweet it but that's still that still doesn't fix it because as much as we talk about bubbles and separation that tweet that promotion of a thing is separate from everything else in the world tweets are problematic anyway because 140 characters and it's very difficult to adequately explain some subjects in 140 characters but if you put out some information that's not true like this boutique I think right you you absolutely should print a retraction and you absolutely if you have it still up on your website the first thing you should say is this is all taken out of context and it's incorrect and it's not does not represent who this guy is and you should absolutely not have those writers do that again right I mean what do you fire them or whether you assignment who knows what they were asked to do this is another part of the problem where was this an independent saying that they decided to pursue on their own did someone ask them to do it was there someone who decided that this guy was a Nazi because that maybe they tuned in at the very moment who is doing something right and I like Nate me and some people obviously are very very sensitive to that kind of stuff so I think that's why it's important especially on an editorial team of some sort to have people with with mixed opinions because it's very easy to all of them get railroaded behind an idea of just like yeah look at these look at these seven specific things we're not going to say that it's out of context but look at this information we got this guy we got this guy dead to rights but it's it's all flimsy well again context right as soon as you even that is part of the problem with doing something like you do it's certainly part of the problem a podcast is if you're talking for three hours and you take these little snippets of those three hours out of context it paints a completely distorted perception of who a person is but that's also a problem with language in general it really is a problem with and it's certainly a problem with words and that's one of the problems with these quote magic words like that you're not supposed to say anymore whatever those words are you know you you you give the weight give so much weight to these words that just taken alone on their own they can get you in trouble just saying uttering the phrase as if it was a magic abracadabra I think it get you in trouble I think it's important that we stop trying to got it rhymes and it's not on purpose we have to stop just blindly hating we try and educate right I think that don't blindly hate educate in an anime that's a school special lady oh god that sounds like straight-up something from the 90s look at your board a lot don't hate educate yeah but I mean you [Music]
