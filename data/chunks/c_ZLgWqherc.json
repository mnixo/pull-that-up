the girag and experience is there are a point where you think like if you look at like your career like if you look at your future if you like we you say well k4 well if I get to this point I'm done no no no Bob you want to enjoy it well I stopped enjoying it for four years I fucking hated it for four years for five years I when I start gambling I'm a man I won't admit I hated it I'd have like little spells where I would be like I can't do any more I don't want to the pressure the fucking head fuck of it all the best and then when I get my money i'm maanna gambling it all I just uh you know I mean right these I can't do anymore and I can't keep bringing myself back up like Kimball which might not be a big comeback uh put your nice key you know keep it going through and just that you know Butterbean that Baalak just a lot of bad decisions i'm so i me as well but not just not bob just bad decisions just barely laughs well bad results i'm son caused by me right and some some just bad decisions I mean it's not just the Kimber fight was seen by how many people that must say there was a huge audience right eight million people in say six away I can't and most of people what they remember is that you came into the cage with a fucking Mouse living year you had a like a whole Mouse family it blew up right he popped in the middle of fights are leaking so hard that was the most fucked up ear ever seen on national TV no one had a more fucked up here my ears more famous than me I'm jealous I'm jealous of my end so we'll talk about that fight remember that guy that fought Kimbo with a crazy fucking ear oh shit Colossus yeah I'm not gonna be remembered fallout though for that no well you'll be remembered for your entire career sure know what I'm saying I don't know what I'm saying is I do remember yeah yeah at the moment people would say I'm the Kimbell you know what I remember I remember you had Kimbo inside control and they stood you up yeah yeah you know I remember that right nobody had the points I yeah I always said this time that Mac take your load more walk well not change ya fuckin pay fuck yeah you don't stand a guy up when a guy huh huh yeah Lee duxi was a corrupt organization corrupt when they changed the rules they told guys to stand up and bang yeah he told guys stand up and bang they gave them instructions and they made they made the referee stand guys up much earlier big country was fighting Andrei Arlovski and had him in a fucking side control position working a Kimura and they stood him back up I'm like you gotta be fucking kidding me Jake Shields they did that same shit when he was fighting Paul semtex when he's fighting Paul Daley same shit they try to stand them up early but Jake just attack attack attack and got him in an armbar he just went Jake's a high level black belt so he just went after it really quickly but you had Kimbo in fucking side control you work to get it you got you in a dominant position he was tired and they stood you back up shoulders bitches Joe Shaw said we did a radio interview you know everyone's on the other line I just finished training so I'm on the phone and one of no one was asking me fucking any questions and I thought yeah I'm just the guy came about to be so and then that could someone else to go show a question they said this is how he was holding the phone the ask our show the question I like the hey hey hey I just I had it ever sister just in case you can't visualize it and he said to him what would you do if James Thomson won and he said I'd hang myself and I thought wow that's the dumbest motherfucker in the history of MMA productions the the idea that you have one guy that's the most important thing in banking everything on him winning yeah those stupid eggs says if you kick that guy's ass it would have been awesome if they left you inside control would have been awesome just like it was awesome for him when he won they've been awesome for you then you know you gotta let the guy who's supposed to win win when you're trying to just be the most marketable you looking for the most marketable guy you're never gonna have a legit organization it's an organization this whole organization was it was essentially a corrupt organization that's that's what that is well I'm right in a might in a book at the moment because the blog's have gone so well a fault to herself I got fucking a lot beside looking back at the different stories got the Fed all drinking one I never everyone loved in a few more so I started thinking I've got fucking that dad lead exceed stories a very important story from martial arts because that made me angry I was watching that at home and I was angry I was like this is crazy and I love Kimbo I think he's an awesome yeah yeah he's a great character I'd like watching him fight he won a boxing match recently he's been winning a lot of boxing matches I love that dude it's not that I wanted him to win or you to win but I wanted fairness and you worked hard to get to that position and you were in a dominant position and they stood you back up and you were fucking tired and you got cracked and they did the same thing with big country when big country had arlovski down he was working for a fucking Kimura and they stood him up I'm like are you crazy it was quite ironic that I watched a big country and he was almost an exactly the same position as me when he beat Kimball I'm with you yeah yeah you know kind of not mentioned on on you know it's very close to the same position I mean the only difference is he went with the mallet he had a full mount a crucifix I'm spike you know which I'm sure you could have worked towards you had him on his back he was only gonna get more tired there was a couple minutes to go right the thing without five it's not that I think they should have stopped the fight though because he came back and he was ad me walked in the third round he dealing fucking hurt them punches and I was I was rocked - it's not that but they should have let sit he might knock me out I don't know right not me I might have took him down Rebs I don't know who would have won right that's the fucking the point of the fight you've got to let the fight you'd he coulda knocked me out make because I was I wasn't back one more takedown and he was mine well you take such a good shot you take so many shots that sometimes people don't know what the fuck to do and I think a fight like that like you took some bombs go and you were still there and it's like the referees like man do I rescue this fucking guy it's a weird judgment call and it's very important to have the right referee in a situation like that like a guy like Herb Dean he'll he'll let you fight he'll let you fight if he's but he will save you if he knows you're fucked ya know and that that I think there's a lot of fights where the referee airs on the side of caution and protects the fighter and in a case like yours you feel like you were denied an opportunity because of that right yeah and what I was saying before so I was stumbling but I was backstage and it just happened I'm Gary Shaw son that fucking shit yeah Carla's over the column oh yes garlic well seems like a nice guy who have a fucking dollar sign fucking yeah is it changed our son Shane oh the cover yeah well he grew up with the rich dad and he's Bowie yeah you know it's an interesting way to live your life but he came up to me and he said you got what's the hospital you got the hospital now and I got to go to the hospital yeah okay I turned to him and I said yeah it said yeah but he turned away oh you know because it was a lot going on so you know hey me I made a turn back I went you have to go to the hospital now I'm taking you now and I'm you really want me to go to the hospital right too much so then I went to the press conference instead and as I walked into the pass conference Gary Shaw was going we've just have to take James Thompson to the hospital the ads breathing to a number I'm someone caught into it and I was thinking a drink yeah I mean and I think that's something really that sums up their Korean words yeah yeah that's a corrupt organization that's horseshit they're pretending you were hurt more than you were to pump Kimbo up yeah Wow that's interesting
