hello freak bitches I've been watching some pro wrestling like that you have he totally predicted what was going to happen with his John Cena Brock Lesnar yeah I knew the thing a lot about it Brock Lesnar you played it out long advanced perfectly you knew exactly how it was going to go down and you're saying that it sets up something in the future oh yeah absolutely they offered me a full-time writing job I can talk about it now because I'm not getting it I'm not doing it but a couple months ago they offered me a full time job to move to Stamford Connecticut yeah after one meeting a meeting like this that was about an hour and a half at the end they go how would you feel about moving to Stamford Connecticut for a one-year job with the WWE writing on the creative side and I go I'm gonna have to think about that and it didn't pan out because I didn't want to move to Stamford Connecticut and working 9:00 to 5:00 even though it's really good money and everything but you would have to go to you drive to LA or drive to New York right I still do spot yeah which turns out it's just a 45-minute drive but I've been but the job is very grueling the WWE thing you know not it's not like a TV comedy writing job it's like a I'd have to answer to Vince McMahon ly good Tony Oh would you do get stoned before writing this idea do you think that's what I'm sorry probably what would you say to him well if you want to say well yeah yeah I'd say yeah I was stoned when I wrote all the great ideas that you like sir well you have a point you think Vince would try to get you on steroids um he'd probably get me try to get me to eat me every chance he gets he brought in Bryson this is from my ranch I shot this myself this morning yeah well it was a good money like serious money super serious money Wow sanely serious money you came close I was happy to get the offer I took it as a victory and I love what I do I love what I'm doing and it might be Cray I'll never regret it you know what I mean I don't know i think you regret it right now I'm looking at your eyes so ya know it's kind of a dream job for you yeah sort of but then again what I do is sort of a dream job too and giving up this dream job for that dream job would be crazy you wouldn't have to give up this dream job I'm telling you it would grueling creepy job unfortunately trust me if it was if the word on the streets is man writing for the WWE's the coolest you can do anything I would have taken it and I would have lived in New York and it would have been amazing I would have traveled to Stamford 45 minutes every morning on a subway and so we were living in Stamford yeah it would have been amazing and I would have had any it could have it was stupid the amount of money yeah you don't want to live in Stamford you know the problem with Connecticut is it's not really a state it is a state but let's be honest ladies and gentlemen you live in a highway between Boston in New York yeah absolutely it's like they put some houses on the side of the highway and they call it a town but that's what's really going on there's not nothing's being done there nothing's being made there what do you got you got the Glenn Beck show in the WWE that's your entire state economy yeah of course there's some other things I'm just fuckin around don't get oh don't get all fuckin i all stanford ii on me don't get like all attached and proud of connecticut connecticut pride we got a fucking email Joe Connecticut Pride Connecticut sucks you know it sucks and I know it sucks there's some great houses there some nice neighborhoods crazy neighbor I have my friend Tommy jr. one of my best friends lives in Connecticut he tells me it sucks I trust him it's not a good spot when I used to drive there from Boston to New York I would always think like why are people stopping here yeah WWE but a lot of people like you know David Letterman lived in Connecticut and drove into the city to do his show that's how he did it yeah but he's like reclusive you know mmm he likes being he needs to be away from everybody he's weird like that and you're not you missed her out going on that City partying it up at night yeah doing a little blow in the morning pep you up her ass for sure you know me show up on the campus convince the paperwork that you wrote on the plane over there yeah tody this storyline makes zero sense what kind of storylines when you plan it did you I know you did I know you thought about it absolutely absolutely I wrote I wrote a great storyline where you know Brock Lesnar and in this past WrestleMania he beat the Undertaker and the Undertaker's had a streak at WrestleMania he never loses at WrestleMania he was 21 and 0 all-time at WrestleMania 21 years he had never lost in this match against Brock Lesnar it's sort of it was sort of set up so everybody just assumed the Undertaker would win then in a stunning move Brock towards the end of it ends up beating the Undertaker for the 3 count you want to see something funny look that up reaction shots of the audience that okay but this audience was stunned people just so I know what else you're on that audience a fucking simple card trick oh come on what are you talking about listen code Road you're fucking doing silly shit okay it's all planned out it's obvious it's not obvious it's definitely not if it's planned out why would it be on what was gonna happen I know what's gonna happen at some peach oh that's not be a revenge that's not the arena's not everybody in the arena was offered a full-time one-year writing job with the they don't know what's gonna show you an expert and pro wrestling essentially I've watched my whole it was sort of like my replacement for not having a dad when I was a kid like I would just sit there and watch these these storylines and these guys do all this crazy stuff and I'm sad well I'm sure it was my dad replaced totally bummed me out mmm Superfly Snuka was your dad pretty much Superfly was one of the biggest things I mean that's what I was doing off of couches in my tighty-whities when I was a tiny little boy Bob Backlund I remember Bob Backlund them the creator of the crossface Chickenwing which is a great move man like fucking time of you invest in this you should get paid by this I should seriously consider seriously consider taking that job uh no I would say no to anybody else but you you like that shit so much you've always got those fucking books around like he read books on the business of pro wrestling we're on a fucking plane and I look over there's people reading his self-help books some folks are reading novels Toni H is gonna fucking book the sex and politics lies in headlocks the unauthorized bio of Vince McMahon what the fuck are you doing reading awesome it's about a guy who took a joke of a show and turned it into a billion dollar enterprise and wrote it all himself and it's the main you should look on pro-wrestling dude you should write a book a love affair pro-wrestling i love affair from towing Edgecliff i was listening to um to uh the opening Anthony show which is no longer the Opie and Anthony show now it's a dopey with Jimmy Norton I don't know well they just called the Opie and Jimmy show but whatever um they had this guy on and he's an author he's he wrote that a card movie with Kevin Spacey he's written a bunch of a bunch of different books his name is Ben Mezrich Maz rich and he was talking about Russian oligarchs and about what happened what went down in Russia during like the fall of the Soviet Union where seven to nine people soaked up 50% of the economy of Russia yeah seven seven or nine somewhere in that number like no more than ten people literally had 50% of the Russian economy and they were just killing each other they would like kill each other and take over their businesses I'll give you had a competitor if like you were coke you would send your army over to kill Pepsi and then you would just own Pepsi - Wow it was the total complete wild wild west and I don't know if he's written a book on this or he's gonna write a book on this but fucking a man listen to that shit was skit I bet he has written a book on I should find out what the book is Ben Mezrich Ben Mezrich interesting I wonder what the direction of the economy and the trends in everything were before that exclusive group of people took that over because it's you know it seems like we're sort of in a way heading that direction with our stuff the top whatever percent has such a crazy amount of money compared to the rest of everybody yeah well it's close you know we're pretty bad but apparently it's nothing like Russia like the these Russian oligarchs they just dominated they just figured out a way to completely dominate the entire economy of a giant country I mean it's listening to him talk about it was fascinating the shows different now that Anthony is not there but Jimmy Norton is so fucking interesting hysterical and you know an obese doing great job with it too it's still a good show this guy Ben Mezrich was fascinating fuck Russia man is crazy they were talking about Putin but what a gangster Putin had to be to come back and lead the country after he left like he led the country took off like they imposed some sort of a term limit came back like no term limit in buck oh he's back again like he's this is the second time running the country like he installed some sort of a puppet dictator or a puppet leader when he was gone and then came back and he's a former KGB agent like what the fuck man you know there's a guy that a professional wrestler named Risa that actually puts Putin on it on the Megatron on the titantron every time he comes out and really gets the crowd riled up Oh Mother Russia I promise I'll defeat my victim for you and it gets the whole crowd to hate him and then I then a guy comes out and he rusev usually wins they let the Russian guy win because it drives the crowd crazy and then you think anything can happen after that my favorite thing is to watch you respond to me talk about rest what's wrong with you you would love it and wrong with you I wouldn't love it you'd be amazed I'll bet you though I bet you if I showed you a statistic of UFC fans being WWE fans I'd bet you'd be shocked because before the UFC was all over everything one of the only outlets that and by the way I've been with the UFC since the beginning you know what I mean like I mean like watching it since the hoist days since hoist and shamrock and all that and that's because it's it even though it's two totally different things UFC is obviously an extremely you know the crazy sport and WWE is completely entertainment with you know some injuries from time to time you know the it was an outlet for anybody that wanted some crazy stuff WWE and UFC fans I bet there's a lot I would bet you that I'm just gonna wait till you're done talking this is it this is my this is my closing statement here it is I'll bet you that at least 70% of UFC fans have been or are WWE fan at some point 70 percent I love when people throw a statistic around where they have done zero research just a random number I believe seventy I do it all the time by the way yeah 79 90% a fan no I did they look it's not the goddamn same one of them is real one of them I didn't people battling for their life yeah most difficult contest absolutely another one is some weird fucking jerk-off thing that stream guys do when they sit in front of the TV and pretend they don't know it's fake right Daymond no I know it's fake everybody knows it's fake you don't want to know you shut that part of your brain off when you watch it you like like a lizard I went to a meeting to take a full time writers job I know it's fake even even if you wrote it you would still be there while it happened going I can't believe it I can't believe you wrote his ad Undertaker you would thought you would have your fucking script in your hand and you'd be jumping up and down spinning around in circles I can't believe Brock beat the Undertaker oh yeah real incredible worlds collide oh yeah I never got to finish so I wrote a thing to wear Kane The Undertaker's brother wrestled Brock Lesnar at this WrestleMania coming up in seven months or so and loses but Undertaker comes back tombstone pile drives Brock Lesnar and they walk off together amazing swan song they wave to us hahaha yeah when when you come up with a move for a guy to win with do you take into consideration at all the health of the person trying to attempt that move it's tough you're right yeah it's tough because when Brock Lesnar did that shooting star press flip through the air and landed on his head I've seen that yeah I've seen that everybody seen anybody like who knew about Brock Lesnar was researching him very likely if you were going through like Internet videos and stuff like that you'd run into that video of him flipping off the top rope and landing on his head all 300 pounds of them landed on his head bang and kept going yeah crazy I don't know how the fuck he lived I know if you watch that it looks like he's a dead man yeah lands on his fucking head yeah there's some stuff that just can't even there just probably an inch either way and he's he can't move his legs and stuff but he survived it walking music is so powerful because you could psych out an opponent with walking music if it's done properly if it's some if it's some subtle crazy stuff you know no you can't a little bit little bit you can wrestling you look around what is that can't believe he's playing that is that Phil Collins I can feel it in here you think I believe this is my song who took my song I don't think if you're and if you're fighting in the UFC and you come out first you had your song let's say your songs like a seven on a one to ten and then lights go out and Phil Collins in the air tonight does come in you're not a little bit like fuck I wish I would have picked this you know guy he's already got he's already got one on me it's already laying at one blow and that's the intro you are do I need to call Vince McMahon right now you think like a fucking pro wrestling fan and I say that with all due respect I'm not I'm not hating on it but you think like you you take enjoyment in that stupidity I know I do it's entertaining as hell Vince why are you slipping this is the man's going to turn your organization around you're them either and they should call you the mastermind and they should make you a character as well I agree you wear the glows gold wrestling shoes that's your whole outfit it's shiny gold I'm the mastermind good to be here in Vancouver Oh what's wrong you don't like my plans for the future bear I can feel it what is it about all that stuff even though you know it's total 100% horseshit what is it about that stuff that's appealing to you the entertainment Joe if you watch one of these things you would you would see what you liked about it you would have a few favorites and and know you would know I'd go fucking crazy and I'd watch lions killing gazelles on television because that's real that's what I do I'd grab my laptop and I'd be like yeah you watch this fake shit all day I need real I need real I can't get entertained by fake but that's what TV shows and movies are they're fake no no they're not fake sports are real and that I understand and this is sports entertainment it's not okay it's not we're not nobody saying it's really when you watch Game of Thrones and you watch a guy get his head cut off you know what it looks like yeah looks like a guy actually getting his head cut off it looks real yeah when I watch wrestling and I see a guy get hit and go turn to the crowd I know that's bullshit right it's offensive to me yeah it's offensive yeah and the idea of other moves that happen that are amazing no no no yeah they're all offensive oh no I know they'll take athleticism total off but they're offensive because I'm so aware it's so in my face this is not really happening I can't be the guy in the gold suit holding up the script jumping around a place going The Undertaker lost the streak has been broken that's what you would do you would freak the fuck out I wouldn't run around I wouldn't do that I would if you were hard if I had a gold suit I would do that but I don't have a coat consider doing it Vince is fucking up really needs to make you a part of it I told Tony when immediately you should do it and I can't believe you didn't take it Tony cuz that is like one of the biggest things for you for you because you are that trying to negotiate doing it part-time from LA that would be awesome that would that would be best for both sides because I wouldn't get burned out on it and they would have awesome great ideas that are hip and cool and I would have been able to do what I wanted it hip and cool whenever God says my ideas are hip and cool I'll go hmm are you sure it depends what ideas he's talking Undertaker has a scarf but in the hip scarf it's a scarf with little skulls all over it like he's a pirate he's drinking a Frappuccino I never saw this one caring yes Undertaker has gone Metro metrosexual Undertaker maybe if you changed maybe all sudden Tony starts working for them and every character becomes gay and it turns out that there's there's someone who's sprinkling gay dust over all the other competitors you know there's a locker room there's and it's he's turning that's that's a plot that Tony comes up with he turns the entire roster gay it turns out there's an openly gay wrestler and he has gay fairy dust okay we'll sit in like a leprechauns ball sack lady red killed a leprechaun and turned his ball sack into like this are you ready for this sure him what if I were to tell you that there is an openly gay wrestler that blows dust in people's faces and his name is Goldust no fucking way there is like their guard this is real yeah dude this is in the WWE Dustin Rhodes a third generation wrestler what's going on his dick that's gold dust power David you've heard of horse power that's like related to Dusty Rhodes yeah yeah how'd you know about dusty Rhodes yeah I used to be eight when this shit made sense thank you this guy's real please I need to see more I can't believe I invented a guy that already exists yeah you could you should be writing this that's him entrance out the girl takes off her wig and row and he's Sykes's a moment he flirts with them in the ring and shit like blows and kisses and they get all riled up and then he can beat him with shit cuz they're like all day I'm not gay get away from me and he's like oh yeah come here beautiful and I think to the WWE should hire Michael Sam as soon as he's done with the Dallas Cowboys the openly gay NFL player yeah I don't parent he's not good enough to make the team and just bring him for the practice squad they need to bring that dude into WWE and actually fuck a guy on TV well him and Goldust yeah but Goldust is faking it I could tell look at my gosh tre yeah he's super straight is super straight I you know part of me says it's animal cruelty at the the biggest part like my gut reaction I look at that should that be legal Wow though that's kind of a fucked up thing to do it's kind of a fucked up thing to put razor blades in the end of a chicken's foot stick them in a cage and another chicken they fuck each other they should just do fake chicken fighting so you have a gay chicken come out in the blonde wig and all right guys I lost you on that I've got to be real chicken I just can't believe his gold guys real I came up with a guy who blows dust know is that you named it dusty road yeah but I don't know that he exists and he's got a brother named Cody Rhodes who just made the jump to being Stardust which is the he's like the he's like another version of gold dust except now they roll together so he's good to know now Stardust is more like just like about the cosmos and like wow I just can't believe all the magical things oh yeah he's high yeah so he's like a stone stone to the gills oh that's so funny except he's just out on it you never know do you think it's possible to Tony he gave me the like Pro Wrestling yes oh I know for a fact dude I would know I know the exact match is the videos that moves the everything that would that would interest you see too much real there's some crazy submission moves that no no no no no that's the last thing let me tell you something that's the last thing you want to show me don't that'll get me angry I'll be like that wouldn't work right no defense here he's a hip escape he can get out of there nothing drives me crazy er than like a fake submission move in a movie that shit drives me nuts you know I stopped watching Dexter because fucking what's-his-name from third Rock John Lithgow John let's go have this chicken a rear naked choke in a bathtub and he killed her that way and I was like oh my god that's the worst fucking rear naked choke I've ever seen that's so fake she's not even read I'm done and I shut it off I walked out the room and discussed I never watched another episode of Dexter again Wow yeah you can't show me a fake rear naked choke you fucks that that makes me angry that's like if you were watching a jimi hendrix biopic uh you know uh not biopic but like a UH one of those movies where it's a fake like an actor plays Jimi Hendrix I guess that's a biopic right and some dude didn't know how to play guitar he's like don't you like now you're not doing it you're not doing it at all you're not playing guitar that's what John Lithgow is shitty fucking rear naked choke did for me the only reason I think you would maybe like it in the future is that you like you know UFC so much in MMA and jiu-jitsu so much and Tony gets it together with a bunch of people and watches it a lot of them watch it as a joke where Tony I think takes it a little bit we all watch this a joke guys like I'm not buying my joke I just see and recognize what's entertaining about it and I do like the ideology of stunning an arena of people sometimes that happens it can happen sees of you had to look at the reaction to the doheny is a three-hour like job interview for you this is like your audition tape they should fucking hire you they should figure how to create again I need you to pull this up we're at where are you Vince listen take the needle out of your ass and hire this guy you're crazy not to you should have seen the looks on these people's faces when Brock Lesnar beat the Undertaker nobody thought it was gonna happen oh my god what did they do Tony imagine if on Saturday the fuck is wrong with you and nobody thought it was gonna happen it was amazing it was fake as fuck dude but nobody thought it was gonna happen a lot of things are fake that nobody thought was gonna happen Tony Oh Charlie time son imagine if that guy who filled in for that shit's gettin around on Saturday and he took on delecia imagine if in the miracle he was able to somehow land a punch on Dilla Shawn beat him the place would have been I mean while it's sort of weird cuz that Sacramento and that's Dillashaw his hometown but I'm just saying like in a neutral field that would have been stunning and everybody would have known that they just witnessed history Tony that would have been real right no it really Taylor really had a limit it really knocked out a professional athlete two guys who've trained to fight their entire lives right it's real right all right I understand you you you're so crazy you by the way the stuff is gonna sell insurance here you know I know I understand where your concerns are but let me just show you the details of our policy you're a crazy person no I'm telling you right there's millions and millions of WWE and I'm telling you why maybe hunter s Thompson was just a couple of decades off when he was predicting the end of the world those guys I mean it's not easy it for example Brock was furious when Vince told him that he wanted him to beat the Undertaker that day like in real life like the bet he was and you were there to see it no but I talked to somebody who was oh I bet he was honest with you it's not like they lie all day every day hmm Tony's gonna talk to some people let me tell you well I'll tell you what Brock was actually mad he was really mad he read the script introduces bullshit I'm not beating a fuckin Undertaker some of the guys that work unlike the technical side for the UFC work for the WWE I heard Brock was crying that's right it's Brock went to the hospital with the Undertaker cried so hard II dehydrated him after that match they had to give him an IV to replenish his T V thought he killed the Undertaker from that concussion was bad bad it was real the concussions are real you can't classify dashing uneven bio as a real concussion okay probably faked a concussion thank you the daughter take the Undertaker to the hospital he's got up Obon even on the day it's a real boo-boo folks if you don't think it's a real boo-boo I'll show you the fucking bandaid on it are you getting my for your own believe it's like your pictures up my four-year-old yeah he's a boo-boo it is a boo-boo it needs a birthday honey there's milk he's not even bleeding you don't need a band-aid I want to bend it okay well band-aid make you feel better we'll get you a band-aid did took the Undertaker and put a band-aid on him he's wearing a fucking bandit Antoni hench grew up in a gold suit holding the script I can't believe it's a real boo-boo she's jumping up and down in circles and Vince McMahon is standing there shaking his head you call her a purple I'll fucking pent up with rage that's how I wrote it oh my god it's a boo-boo look at the band-aid it's real it's a real band-aid ladies and gentlemen if you doubt it what else do you like that sucks um see what else do I liked it sucks hmm I guess I play fantasy football I don't talk about that a lot well fantasy football is at least based on fucking football right she's a real game yeah people are really trying shit really happens but nobody knows what's gonna happen in real sports oh my god isn't that part of what makes it exciting you fucking weirdo same thing about the w/e bullshit you don't know what's gonna happen haha you don't know what's gonna happen you predicted it right 'red know the writer knows what's going on the writer knows it's not real it's like a play do anyways like a plot of musicals no I've been doing is gayer than musicals how about that that doesn't make sense sure does this dudes are hugging they get all sweaty they're laying on each other they're N and it's not real okay ha ha ha ha ha I mean after musicals guys are banging but you know I don't know if they're banging I don't go to those things I'm not in that world you've seen a musical right yeah I've seen a bunch of musicals not that is anything wrong with being gay by the way but musicals are gay they just are it really is that it really is unless it's a humorous musical yeah even then it's even then he made someone kiss his ass right uh that's someone else that's a Photoshop but that's not the real who is that guy said that it's a fake guy they're probably one of you out there just go look for it that's the thing about the Internet man there's a photo of you out there somewhere someone's photoshopped a dick in your mouth yeah who are you kissing an ass or you doing something ridiculous and over am I staying but why did he do that there's a challenger why did he do that why he pulled his pants down and made someone kiss his ass on TV probably that sounds like something he would do but he did you know it why are you pretending you didn't wash that one it spits I think it I think that was over like 12 13 years ago something like I weren't there yet huh no I I can't remember I can't remember I'll believe it I think you've been mark that may have been doing that maybe I'll do that Harry admit don't you guys kiss his ass look at that is warious it's like fuck your brother backyard wrestling kind of game look how many people in the audience though that's insane plus it's been winning the Monday night cable wars for over 20 years think about that for a second every Monday night at wins every single month they pulled TNA though they pulled TNA from Maya from Spike that's Vince's competition what's the problem with TNA I'm just not good not everything terrible they're just completely no what's an ass it's not even in no no that's what it should be bright but it's not it's not even in the same ballpark what is it well they used to have like a lot of MMA guys would do it like King mo was in TNA and rampages in TNA it's not good no no what's wrong with it bad writing bad everything could you go over there maybe ma'am yes oh no no you don't turn down the WWE TNA listen you could be the fucking mogul what if they give you a piece of the action what DNA said listen we heard you on the Joe Rogan podcast we like the way you think about wrestling I think this organization that still has some life and we're willing to willing to cut you in on this give you 10% of the action I don't own 10% of TNA I'm pretty sure 10% of the TNA wouldn't even get me what I would have made with the wwa you son of a bitch yeah they just lost me video didn't have a TV deal huh yeah they're done and maybe I'll get picked up by like lifetime Vince McMahon beat Ted Turner what is Ted Turner CNN CNN TNT TBS he threw Ted Turner at open checks that he would to just sign any wrestler back and they were having Wars on Monday nights they'd go against each other Vince WWE on the USA Network and TNT had nitro and Ted Turner said whatever we need to do to beat Vince McMahon I will write the check to whoever so they offered they bought Hulk Hogan they believe this he believes I was there I was in the room no I didn't say I was he said he was willing to spend whatever it takes that sounds like a plot like a plot in like these are two different no I'm tuck this is where it's real this part's real that's the problem you've cried wolf through this whole podcast I never said it was realest about them repeating that it's not real and money I'm agreeing with you and now you trying to tell us that the boogeyman is real that's what you're doing wrestling's real I said that is gonna write it how much did Ted Turner spend millions and millions to buy good the guys that were already developed from the WWF he bought all their biggest guys hoodie bar Hulk Hogan Macho Man Randy Savage you know Macho Man Dusty Rhodes I know Macho Man slim-jim fan right snapping Dusty Rhodes he bought them all and how did it do they ended up winning the wars for a bunch of weeks in a row they did yeah it turned it yeah for like a year in a row and but then Vince uh bought Mike Tyson and made him referent match at WrestleMania with Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels and then it dominated the rest is history that's it one move yep
