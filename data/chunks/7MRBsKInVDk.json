3y cheeto Santino why that well I'll tell you when I first moved to Los Angeles I was playing this basketball league with these kids from East LA it was like the only connection I had in LA with he's like a couple of kids that I knew from Long Beach and we would go play ball in this league and then afterwards we'd go to a bar and just get shit-faced like just blacked out out of our mind 22 like every dime we had was going to booze and party and so we were partying and I'm wearing basketball shorts like white people do when you play basketball and all my Mexican friends you know they wear like whatever they had on the floor that morning it was like jeans and you know whatever there was no never basketball shoes for them and we're sitting there drinking and this dude Pavo his buddy money looks down at my legs knee goes dog I got a fucking ask you a question player like did you have fucking orange leg hairs dog as I could have known you for years you've never seen that he's agnaldo get so gross dog it's nasty to look at bro it's kind of like if you ate a bag of Cheetos and you wiped the finger dust all over your fucking legs and she got cheeto legs long so that she don't think so then all these dudes all these fucking all these homies were always like cheeto it was just it just stuck so hard that when I got Twitter and Instagram I was like I have to have cheeto as my shit like I have to embrace crazy names race the cheeto man Wow yeah that's a good time for orange haired comedians the two the greatest of all time have orange hair it's wild because uh I've always been such a massive fan of burr I mean I can't preach him enough I think I think I do it I dick ride him so hard I think many people I talked to her like alright dude enough like I get it you like him but I do man I've always loved him and and Louise changed the game in a totally different way they're both those who do support I'm shocking burr right now is he's doing something real special yeah he's also a man's man an unapologetic man who thank God oh there's so few yeah it's such a hard time to be a guy yeah you're not allowed to shame on you say that if you say that people like boo yeah I know it's so hard to be a man with all your male priviledge low cisgendered males complaining but hard it is I said judged folks I know Jade harsh least white straight male I'm the literal enemy public enemy number one right now yeah I walk around you are the enemy you're automatically a rapist and a misogynist and an egomaniacal money-hungry driven bad human being it's so it's so fucked up this is how ridiculous it's gotten there was an article oh they're still complaining about being a man there's an article that I just read that was advocating that women should never go to prison those likes let's stop putting women in prison yeah see if you could fight woodman titles it was the idea was that women are suppressed and they already represent such a significantly small portion of the US population that really therefore heinous crimes don't then they don't deserve the same punishment as other people that have heinous crime heinous crime with the number of women hit men would just go through the fucking roof right my god they couldn't be arrested yeah oh my god so much more so much so so much domestic well that's like saying okay so if you're said if that's what that if that's the articles trying to say then then say any other repressed group in society then then minorities can't go to prison anymore well they that's the same logic they represent a much larger percentage though so the thing they're saying about women is they're so few women in prison already yeah and women are like a lot of their behaviors due the fact they've been suppressed by men okay oh my god well it's just the idea of us being on two teams is so crazy yeah the penis team and the vagina team yeah it's that simple shirts and skins it's that simple right that's it you're all all people on your side are good all people in our side are bad you know how fucking crazy that is it's insane that well that's what I said like not to sound like I'm plugging my special but in my special I talked about I was shot in Chicago where I'm from and at the time there was a lot going on in Chicago as there always is a lot of cop shootings and I think there's a big up there's an immediate uproar of like fuck cops and I hate that because I've cops in my family and you can't just blanket statement an entire thing just like you can't blanket an entire race of people sex class of people and say you're all the same that's the same thing as saying like every top is a bad person like are you out of your fucking mind agree millions of police officers that are great people you happen to hear stories about bad humans that happens in any industry right and in honestly if you look at it statistically like the number of bad cops versus the number of cops and then you have to break down the number of interactions cops have with people it's stunning have you met long they're awful people are fucking awful can you imagine every day you but imagine how awful they are if you are a professional enemy yeah they know that you're just a person just like them so you're pulling this guy over this guy's done a crime you know he's gonna lie to you you're in you're the enemy and you don't even know this fucking guy you don't even know him you don't even have a real beef with him but now his whole life is on the line right now in this altercation you never know if he's gonna shoot you you never you never know there's so many videos online there's the most one of the most terrifying videos of this cop pulling this guy over and the guy was some Vietnam veteran who's a real fuckin killer and he wind up killing the cop and they show him killing the cop on the security camera the guys trying to give this guy all the all the room in the world's like sir please get back in your car sir please get back at start sir put your hands down sir sir put the gun down sir and then it gets to the immune he's he's trying so hard not to be a cunt and this guy shoots him and kills him and you're telling me that other cops haven't seen that video yeah you don't think that they're terrified that they're going to be the next guy that's on some fucking YouTube clip the two comics are talking about on my podcast because it could happen easy every time you pull a guy over your life's on the line and the stress of that is ungodly and we expect them to manage it like robots we expect them to be like no person we've ever met right were they just no problem no stress if you you're a fucking accountant what is the worst shit that can happen to you once you're in the office printer breaks almost nothing is life threatening no Microsoft Excel crashed this morning everyone's going crazy in fucking accounting but you're not beat cop Jesus Christ look it's the same way with uh you know I know this is this is all this has been said but the way we treat veterans and shit it's like you know I grew up with a kid who was a really close friend of mine that killed himself a couple years ago was a veteran and I think the expectation of the return to normalcy is not only ridiculous and insane request but it's just so illogical that that's a that's not approach it's like do these people can't come back from any sort of combat and and just be pushed back into the real world like well you're good right you're good do we did you turn off the switch when you landed at the United States yeah there's just a little toggle in my head and then I'm good now I should go get a regular job I guess and the just the lack of responsibility we have probably taking care of those people crazy the lack of emphasis on psychological recovery on giving them coping skills mental health man that's the biggest issue in the United States I say that all the time there's so much lack of help for mental health dude you see it so constantly in so many different facets now I think it's coming out more because of the internet because you see you know violent crimes and and and you see where mental health has kind of led our country now there should be a bigger focus on it I had a psychiatrist in the podcast yesterday Kelly Brogan who she wrote a book called what is it called the mind of your own a mind of your own its neighbors all that we talked all about these psychiatric drugs and when they prescribed them and why they prescribed and what are the side effects and how easily they prescribe them right and how so many of these same exact symptoms can be cured by exercise and diet and they don't even advocate that right and she's talking about like how incredible it is like her coming from a background of Psychiatry being an MD going through the whole training thing writing a book about it and you realize like oh my god they're just doping people up yep because it's easy fix man they want short term short term solution as fast as you can working out an exercise sounds like such a it sounds like a marathon yeah and they just they're like give me the theme in the 40-yard dash like what can we do to get them in the 40-yard dash and I like here take this pill and that that changes everything just a disassociative quality of these pills are so dangerous and we just hand them out not we obviously you and I are involved but someone's not as far as the audience knows we don't do it imagine if you're a guy right now work at first pharmaceutical company and every day you read the news you see some fucking mass killing of please don't let it be on our shit righties don't let Pfizer every day is like rolling the dice online hoping it wasn't some guy on one of their drugs she was talking about how the numbers of people that have commit these mass killings that are on drugs they're on psycho psycho active some sort of psycho pharmaceutical drugs she's like it's crazy it's like a hundred percent yeah well let me get let me let me give you something this is how powerful that world is I probably shouldn't say this but I'm with you so I don't really give a shit but on the only one thing I wasn't allowed to talk about or not talk about Bob specifically say on my Showtime special was about accutane I went on accutane when I was a kid do you know this drug you know that said citria it is but it's unbelievably unstable okay it's caused a lot of suicide people got real fucked up from it so it caused a lot of chemical mental reaction that they didn't anticipate for youth youthful you know kids under 18 with underdeveloped brains used to sign a form to say I can die from this medication there's a risk of death that was a real thing for pimple medication but on the special show times lawyers called us and said I can mention the company but I can't say the joke I said if you don't know what accutane was it was developed in the 80s and the 90s to kill acne and then people and they they were like we can't say that I was like why can't I say that's a that's a fact and the guys the lawyers were like they're a massive sponsor Jesus Christ that was the crooked that was the control they were like the first of all I thought Showtime didn't have any sponsors how CBS is the SIA CBS is their mothership it's Viacom right that was my thing right yeah that was the only thing that they were like we just can't say that which I should respectively removed because I was like I didn't need that piece anyway but I was like that's so weird that they are that meticulous about this one small thing because they wanted to cover up the fact that people people used to die from it people wanted kids who are or the most insecure point of your life you got shit all over your face and you just want to fix it with a pill because you want to feel better about your life you're already so vulnerable and ugly and weird and they're willing to risk their life for it but this company won't recognize that that was a thing what what numbers of people died of that I mean there was at one point I did I remember when I was in high school there was like three kid it made national news because was like three kids in a row committed suicide it was a consecutive like three young kids boom that committed suicide and of course you can't just attribute it to one thing I'm not saying you can point a finger say that's what it was but there's enough evidence surrounding things like that that made the company put more legal action behind release forms for when you take the drug nowadays I think it's I think there's different levels of it you can't give to people under under 16 or a certain age because of the strength of the medication Jesus yeah because all I wanted to do is not be ugly anymore so what did it do to you you know what's funny man it cleared my skin up and I never had to take it ever again I know people that did it two or three times and uh it it gave me a lot of joy because I felt fine again I had so I had such bad acne I say I had such bad acne when I was a kid that I made me not believe in God I was like no nothing exists I'm alone on this earth and I was I felt like I was the ugliest person to ever walk the planet because you felt so so this thing it fixed me so to speak it made me feel like everything was good again which is so gross but that's how like shallow we are as kids because you're just like so vulnerable around your peers you're like I just want to be I just want to be normal when you're like sixteen years old if you have a horrible acne attack it fucks your head up fucks you up you feel so weak yeah like you're so at the mercy of this I mean obviously ooh poor white cisgendered man worried about six how could you know what I understand there's worse problems look at that there's this this is a list of the side effects of this miscarriage miscarriages birth defects increased internal skull pressure bone mineral density depression psychosis suicide aggressive or violent behaviors acute pancreatitis unknown in quotes cardiovascular consequences deafness hepatitis bowel disease excessive bone growth night blindness sight loss you can just lose your vision well then you know you lose your vision you can't see your acne anymore so I guess that's kind of beginning a

think it was oh my god she's touched my Zets I'm so disgusting I think about it to this day it's crazy it's crazy it sticks with you dude dude it was so devastating at the time I just like I'm like because I was attracted to her she's very cupid I always felt like she was out of my league and then she's all sudden she's touching my face and my gosh she does it's I remember we were going to like a family function of some kind and I'd obviously just picked that something on my stupid face and my little brat sister was like you're bleeding Oh out of my face I was like I'm a mutant you feel like you're like blank get me and hide me in the back of the car the only thing what would change it for me was exercise yeah yeah once I started I started like really heavily working out it kind of went away like towards like 17 and 18 but I was 18 it stopped but man before that 15 and 16 it was bad well I played sports all through high school so that was an issue because it was always sweating and it was making a man exacerbate it made it worse and then in college all I did was work out and didn't play a lot of active sports so by that time it was all cleared up and I was fine but in high school was just like I did everything to make it worse like everything possible everybody would get a sunburn to kill theirs it's remember that yeah well look at me I guess it's in the Sun I just would get I would get cancer and get worse skin that's a like in the summertime I remember that was like oh like oh boy it's gonna be sunny out this is great I can cook off some of these disks uh-uh get a Sun up these it's yeah man I had a buddy of mine growing up I mean I cannot complain because my buddy had it real bad yeah he was one of those guys that was like he's his everything his neck was eye-opening pockmarks his face was covered in pock marks and the poor kid was like barely hanging on right he's like 15 16 years old you know it wasn't like genetically gifted to begin with and also he gets hit with this hailstorm on his face I mean his whole all of his skin was just fucked and there's nothing they can do about it once that happens no unless you want to lose your colon you want to take a but it's not even that it doesn't smooth your face out no no no way they can smooth your face I once you have those scars all over the places they have to fucking sandblast you yes surgery yeah it's crazy it doesn't look good huh no no you can tell it's fucked ya know I feel like I'm lucky that that it worked cuz I had friends where it didn't work and it was like oh god that's just that's like if you were my friend who just got hit with the hailstorm like you would think like maybe for that guy be worth taking a chance at suicide yeah why not yeah so crazed if you're gonna do it do it cool you know you never know you never know right you just rolling the dice you might be that one of that one out of a thousand people that goes completely fucking insane once that stuff hits

having cysts and liver cysts and shit like that inside of you like this dude I have I have a cyst uh when I was in when up Jesus uh-huh when I was in college I can't look away it's fucking insane no that's what I'm saying I'm in the sunken place dude I can't fucking look away this yeah it's uh it's very interesting when I was in college dude I thought I had nut cancer I thought a testicle cancer and I went into a doctor this is insane I want to do a campus doctor and he feels around in my nuts and he feels the bump and I'm trying like two days he I started sucking my cock and he was like I'm gonna get that nut I'm gonna get that there's only one way to get it out he said to me this is no shit he goes it's a buildup of semen a fucking doctor said that and I was like really he goes do you have a hot tub I was like there's one in my complex look your cum he goes go in there and jerk off in the hot tub he told you to jerk I swear to god he tell you what time I 1001 I want you to look up he said it was a military time actually yeah he says yeah he said at 2022 I want you to come extra cream on July 3 time you're talking about a guy Jerry mom you telling him how to do it during military 90 22 I want to watch no dude this guy said it was a fucking I'm not kidding said was a buildup of semen my dad flew into town because he was concerned because I was like dude it freaked me out I was a guy this thing on my nut we went to the best doctor we could find and the guy was like I should fucking have this other dude like get his medical license removed he's like this is buildup of semen is completely incorrect this is a cyst on your testicle it's not he's like it's benign it's you're fine but the fact that that someone on campus doctor told you that that's a real medical professional it was probably high out of his mind eight out of his fuck I would Arizona State so he was fucking lost yeah it was just a dude they found that morning in the bus that doesn't even make sense to me and I'm I don't know medic maltreating know said it I was like there's no chance send in video that's what it was he's like take a video of it that's what I want you to do I want you to take your nuts and hold them over a lamp so I could see through your nuts and then take as many pictures as you can no filter I'm gonna bring in a couple other boys in here young boys filter have you seen that have you seen that movie tickled have you seen that documentary tickled I have not but it keeps getting recommended so I'm gonna have to watch it it's unreal it blows your fucking mind how these guys were tricked into this it's as simple as young actors being like you gotta you gotta just make a living can can you let another guy tickle you on the internet for five minutes for $100 and these young kids were like dude I've had friends get hit on by guys during casting sessions like just all just straightforward like like if you want to fuck yeah like I've had friends like literally get propositioned I've had a few friends get proper slice of a pair of very famous yeah very famous people that are like you come to so-and-so's house no one will know nah I'll say anything but as a end up in the public eye people think they're straight there's such a leap man when you're a dude and you're straight and you're like all right like money is that really that is that is the crazy leap like I honestly absolutely firmly believe that prostitution should be legal 100 percent it doesn't make any sense you can decide to fuck someone for free and we all agree that nobody got hurt but if some for some reason there's something wrong with like someone paying you to jerk them off you're like what what's the hires you imagine do you imagine if fucking Tiger Woods if Tiger Woods could have had prostitutes this would have never gotten exposed do you think if that was prostitution was legal and it was kind of not a faux pas thing in society do you think he would have never had this moment of collapse in his career I think it would change the way we look at sex if prostitution was legal like net right like it's it's so illegal and it's been illegal for so long that if someone male or female has someone pay them for sex you're a whore right it's a label right away but we know for a fact that there's gold diggers like gold diggers are real but they're not even hidden their blatant blatant yeah they just say right Internet that you've seen that if you've seen that Instagram post where the there's these really hot like Instagram models and then it shows a picture in the next box of a bunch of guys that are like in their 60s with giant guts with great hair on their guns it's like those Instagram models in Dubai this is who's paying for those tricks ice yeah of course that you we know those people exist there's nothing we don't care it's like look at her she got it good for her that like that Dan Bilzerian guy you know him yeah that's like his that's his MO well sorted he's a good-looking guy too yeah but these women that are around they he knows what they're around for and she they know what they are around yeah it's a it's a fucking mutual D it's a deal I think the best example of it was J Howard Marshall and Anna Nicole Smith a total and Anna Nicole Smith married that 90 year old Uzi was an ideal chair she uses she was just giant titties and big ass just out there brilliant it was amazing it was amazing because it was so blatant I had a whole bit about it in my act there is right she set the tone that's setting the fucking downs that that's the gold standard of gold diggers right yes oh come on he's marrying her there how is that not prostitution that's one of the funniest things way to go back to that photo Zubin honest ace look at how unhappy he looks it's remarkable this guy's so fucking old he can't formulate a smile when he's marrying a woman someone his age and I think at the time she was a lesbian so she was just eating pussy and hanging out with him and she had to do like marital relations with him and when she would do the marital relations with him you know she was like time to go to work what is she what does she got to do he can't fuck what does she got is just how suck his dick just I suck him exclusive maybe did they have i agra back then no I don't think so I think they did I think we came up with the the time line for Viagra maybe they came up with it for him it was all his research money there's gotta be a way not that close to Mary and Anna Nicole Smith you piece of shit make something keep my dick hard for an hour and a half after 10 billion dollars in not a long time won't you listen to me you son of a bitch God are so crazy I love it good for him look get off yeah my body yeah go out with a bang or at least attempt an attempt at a bang is he dead yeah he's dead as fuck what do you shy of happiness die to be in joy he died enjoy the world blast him in his final years but that's legal it's totally legal totally marry someone and have sex with him for money as long as you marry them and then get to steal all their money it's like a small transaction like if he could just pay her yeah like for J Howard Marshall a multi-billionaire type character Betty 100 grands not out of the question it's nothing one one evening for a hundred grand seems like a worthy proposition because this is this if he this is someone told me this recently we were talking about this this is amazing the difference between a million and a billion because I think in America we just kind of like we don't even think about it you know just hear it you like billion oh he must be a billionaire you know I'm sure someone Joe Rogan dudes to God be a fucking billionaire dude here's the difference if people don't realize a million seconds is is how many days would you guess a million seconds I've done this before and I always forget it do you know a million a million thirty days that's a great guess okay is it it's 11 days that's good most people are fucking way off so it's 11 days million chance yeah that's good a million seconds is 11 days how many days is a billion seconds how many 31 years Jesus 11 days - 31 fucking years Jesus look at that so when some trillion seconds is 31 thousand years when someone tries to fucking say like they understand what a billion is you're like you have no fucking idea what a billion is a billion is so beyond far away now as far as it's been explained to me and I've never researched this at all so I wonder if you could find this out someone said to me that when you look at the richest man in the world like they look at like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and all those George Soros all the billionaire characters that they're not really the richest men in the world that the real richest men in the world are the Saudi guys and a lot of these oil guys but they're their monarchs and they they don't have to disclose their wealth they never do it's not like they're the CEO of a corporation they're the head of a royal family that they owe no government any indication of what their earnings are so this dude who knows one of those cats was telling me that he's probably a trillionaire fuck me and I was like what I go that's real and he goes yeah I got I didn't know there was trillionaires he goes it's very likely this guy might have access to a trillion dollars because the only thing that we know is our famous billionaires we're infatuated with our billionaires that we kind of have as these social icons you know like the Zuckerberg zand these guys that are like they did something that we can recognize these Saudi families that have had that money have had that money for a fucking long time it's not new money this is old bit they had they had hundreds of millions 50 years ago right so now it's only accumulated into billions of I mean they own well what what the UM that guy that the Chinese billionaire that um what was his name he just bought the Basquiat oh we have it was Japanese Japanese yeah hundred million dollars that we just were talking about that what shows I was bill burr yeah dude 110 I think it was I mean and he owns another one that he got for like 57 that 57 is nothing to him that's like it's a flick guys insane who's this cat we're truly in fucking dollars oh my god see oh my god the royal family is worth a staggering one point four trillion Salman bin Abdulaziz al-saud pictured is the current king - that's fallen on a whole new level son that's this new shit 1.4 trillion oh my god who is this guy the roster the Rothschild yeah for sure that's probably a bunch of those little scoundrels running around taking a piece of that pie but it's a so a billion is a thousand million yep thousands of 700 trillion Oh the Rothschilds estimated between 1 billion and 700 trillion Hey how about you do a better job I could do as good a job of estimating is that no shit Lamar probably a kazillion it's like when you ask a kid how much a car is and they're like eight eight dollars and you're like yeah it's like eight dollars that's how much cars are eight dollars hundred dollars yes exactly it is a Mercedes how the fuck could they have such terrible like gap in there their guesstimate that's got to be good let see those kind of old families that have been around for that long you know that they hide money yeah they don't fuck like when they say X amount of dollars it's because that's what they've been told so many sources I used to know that you know the guy this guy George Soros do you know that is the guy broke Manhattan the name because everyone brings it up when they talk about like anyone on the right side like Alex Jones - the George Soros is making the marijuana stronger he's known it for mind-control I take it once a year I smoke marijuana to test the efficiency I like he's the gauge I'm gonna do it for America yeah I will smoke he says he's function once a year he said that during his custody trial that's it once that says once a year to test his one Dex potency that's George Soros or Soros so I six I party with his kid one time 25 billion two billion a party with his kid one time at the one of these Hollywood things and I've never seen someone so and I'm like I say anything negative about him and I just never seen that kind of money firsthand I've never I never known a billionaire I've never been friends with a billionaire and this kid was so lucid it was almost as if he's not living now at all he's just kind of go it's just flow he's so floating it's like whatever happens happens I said were you staying while you're here he's like with these guys I guess I was like what do you suitcases and shit here in town from New York like are you not he's like nods fuckin I don't figured out I guess bounce around a little bit so I I think it's just like there is no there's no groundedness when you're that rich it's almost like I don't know I can do anything all the time forever there's no source of repetitive yeah yeah I don't think it's a good thing for ya it's so bad it's it doesn't seem to work out I mean I would think the only way you would get a kid through that is you gotta take him to sports or something you got to get him involved in some adversity he's got to lose at something yeah a lot if you loo if you lose that shit you start to understand how human you are when you're like oh my god there's so many people better than me at so many fucking yeah dude cuz when you're given everything you never lose you never see you never heard no there's no negative in your life it's just kind of like how do you get any sense of fuckin you know any normalcy or anything grounded in your hands when you're like yeah we need feedback yeah you need to know

and this poor little fuckers went he flew right into the window dunk sorry 30 laughs every time I said I was gonna go out and then woke up and then flew into another window full speed dunk out cold so I thought he was I thought he's probably dead and my daughter's going oh no is he gonna die ago we don't know honey let's let's put him outside and hopefully he'll wake up fucker woke up he did yeah I woke up like five minutes later like shook it off Raziel away like imagine that was a person that thing was going like 30 miles an hour right into a window dunk little tiny bird to just he got ko'd but then got up and flew away came back for another round no came in the house that was weird I was at a buddies I was at a buddy's house at this like party in a fucking hummingbird flew right into the house like right through the double doors I was stuck in the skylights and it was panicking because they didn't know what like it wasn't willing to come down so I was just fucked up enough that I was like I have this idea give me a fucking huge pan the biggest pan from the kitchen and pour sugar and water and it heat up the sugar a little bit so and put it and I put the pan up to it I got on a ladder put it up it started getting in there to drink the sugar water and I slowly took it down walk it outside that's some wizard shit my was wizardry did I was fluff Erica magic hands that's very smart you ever seen them in slow-mo man they're so bizarre they're fucking their wings are moving so fast unbelievable it's insane it's beautiful to watch man oh man I was in Costa Rica we went to this place that had a had some sort of sanctuary for the hummingbird sanctuary yeah do you know what it is yeah is it I went down to Costa Rica just last year so they have you know you can they have these feeders so you just hang out by them and take slo-mo on your iPhone and you see the thing floating around your head there it is right there I mean they can just hover it's so quick like how did they evolve like this it's so strange like no other bird makes that phone that weird sound when it goes by you huh it's like they have little wings but they move stupid fast how many how many that how many per minute does it say like how many uh I know their heartbeat is insane their heartbeat is like there's hundred times ours or something like that they're so cute they don't seem like killers at all no right they're just out there eating pollen and shit right look at that look at that that's incredible do they bugs like what do they eat well they have their little tongue that's sticking right but isn't that like going for like nectar and sex for nectar yeah this is gonna have some facts for us hummingbird lay one two three eggs several times per year eggs are about the size of a jellybean oh that's not good facts I want to know what they eat yeah I want to know that kind of shit look at that nose there's the craziest beaks - look if that was a giant bird you'd be like what the fuck that's pretty sick did you see what that just said you have an extra set of eyelids and they can see ultraviolet oh that's fucking amazing whoa that beak is crazy that beaks like a narwhal horn like it's so tiny we don't notice how crazy long their beaks are dude that's the other thing I haven't seen there's no consistency of colour between all the birds do you don't I mean like usually most species have a similar color pattern is there a bunch of different kinds of hummingbirds oh they do insects powers SAP SAP tree sap pollen and insects so they're omnivores interesting that birds are a trap dude there are some of the most unique animals on our planet really 15 ordered them I really ignored Birds until I saw my first Eagle in person in the wild it's crazy right yeah if I saw it I was with re we were in Alaska we were in Anchorage we're going fishing we're salmon fishing like dude that's a fucking Wild Eagle yes Eagles stand there on this branch just looking down on us I was like what like you start realizing what they really are like well that's like a murdering dinosaur bird that flies around it snatches fish out of the water dinosaur fish yeah it's chilling we were catching these fish to do their with this big the salmon these these powerful fish and this ego comes down and grabs it out of the water with his talons and flies with it it's fucking awesome dude I started tripping out on birds after that just being deemed being near them in in the in the wild and seeing them move around it just seems so different than seeing them in the zoo they're so fucking hardcore their wing spans are so amazing to me when they open up how fucking huge they're whenever you see one in person you're like that is way bigger than I thought what so it's a view back to a much more ancient style of living thing you know I mean it's a view back to dinosaurs and they're starting to realize more and more dinosaurs fossils are being found with feathers fucking Birds isn't have you ever seen a moose in real life oh you have shot a moose that do moves right there whenever I go whenever I go up to Canada like a viewer in a Banff you know where that is now Berta yeah I know whether that's dude that that has the biggest moose I've ever seen in my like I've seen I've seen moose when I was a kid but nothing like up in northern Canada dude I mean Butte the size of a fucking School Bus I mean it's so big I think people think they think they know what a moose is because you're like yeah I think it's like a cow or something I mean dude they're massive massive they're so shocking it was twice the size of our car I was like get the fuck out of here that's a moose yeah they're so big it's insane and if you run into them like you hit him with your car you're fucked you're fucked they would riddle wreck you that was a grown up in the Midwest to died here people getting bad car accidents with deer all the time these guys in Canada there is no stories about it you die you hit a fucking it's not like dude you hear about Mikey fucking hit a deer it's like you hit a moose it's like Mike's car exploded Shh mike is mike is dead a deer will fuck you up though there's ah do you mind who lives in Oregon a guy on the highway in neighborhood hit a deer the deer flipped over his car and hit the car behind him fuck and went through the windshield and killed the guy really the first guy was fine huh the first guy was fine the car the deer flipped over his car like as he hit it it went flying through the air and then it landed like right right on fucking into this guy's car and killed him the craziest shit I ever saw I was like eight years old my dad driving on the fucking Dan Ryan in Chicago and a car the middle of the lane was under the fast name was on a construction a car went over the fucking median onto oncoming traffic and hit another car oh geez like a hundred yards in front of us I watched it fucking happen it was the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life it was like the afternoon I don't know if he was fucked up or what moved right over the median right into another car she and you saw the whole thing i watch i watched in heaven i mean it felt so fake when I was a kid I remember thinking I remember getting older and asking my dad if it happened because I thought you know in your childhood sometimes you're like did I see that in a fucking thing and that wasn't real you know and you formulate these different stories in your brain as a kid because you know that line of what's real and fake when you're so young but dude I I can't forget that happening was crazy that is critically hit another car it was almost as if like magnetic it fucking head right head-on Wow that was wild I think those Fast and the Furious movies have fucked people up when it comes to like what you can and can't do in a car do they jump a car from like a building and shit to another building and live that's fucking insane I mean there's a lot of dumb kids out there that watch those movies they gotta be like yo man I gotta give that a shot has to be someone who thinks that the like that's what's gonna happen when they get behind the wheel brahmam to be the best ever I never even drove yet but once I Drive I be the best like an over dog I watched that movie all the time people just want to be cool they want to be looked down shit spin that wheel oh do you ever watch those fail videos online of people showing off like showboating in nice cars that's my fate that's one of my favorite fishing yeah they're always like some guys like some guys I spin the wheels dude some guys like a fucking GTR Zach are scared right just right into the fucking wall next to him Justin out crash right away that's just dude it's great I love to see that shit I love to see people showing off and then right away they're fucked I love that shit nothing funny or any videos of that now to me this um it's almost like if you have a camera and you're pointing it at the guy you're kind of haxing them cuz he's saying man I hope I don't fuck this up cuz it's gonna be on every internet site - everyone's Twitter account Instagram page it's like you're kind of like putting too much pressure on them your accident is now shareable yeah your mistakes are now everyone's joy that's the world we're in now your fuck-ups could be if somebody's great Monday you know come to the New World it's brilliant it's a crazy new world man didn't exist was never like this yeah you didn't have to worry about someone seeing your fuckup how old are you 33 I'm 49 when I was a kid we didn't even have like when I was a boy back in the days no youyou heard stories but somebody fucked up somewhere over there to say I did that ya know that's all that's all there was one guy in our town killed someone in a car and dragged this guy around like he got the guy stuck under his car and he just kept driving fuck did he not know he was under there or he was like fuck it I don't care I'm going to prison they don't know they don't know if he was drunk I don't I don't know I don't know when he got caught either but it was a story it was in the news I remember it was in like I was delivering newspapers at the time so I saw it like in the newspapers that I was delivering it's so weird to have known someone and then know that they ran over somebody in a car and then dragged around yeah I didn't know him well but he was like one of those guys in the town I figure he's a little older than me but he was one of those guys that was always kind of hanging out with a nice car yes I'd like a nice Trans Am I was just gonna say and iroc-z was about the yeah his family had money and he ran over someone and dragged him around there was always this thing about people whose families had money like the rich kids get away with it what was it was a weird thing to it's like we knew that they were like a little off like you always knew that the rich kids were never like a complete human right they're always like a like there was just a few of them they were just a little like if you knew they're rich there's probably a lot of kids we didn't know they were rich and they are rich but it was they weren't fucked up so it didn't come through right but the ones that wanted everybody to know they were rich like they always had designer clothes on right and they always had the nicest shit and they always had like brand-new cars like when they were 17s guy had a brand new car there it's almost like there are a little bit animatronic like there's something robotic about really rich kids where it's just kind of like super super high functioning in a very like disconnected level because they're so unaware of what it's like to not have yeah well I'm watching these shows my kid that we went to see this Diary of a Wimpy Kid yes I see a funny movie man there's some funny shit in there I laughed hard a couple of times that movie yeah I just went cuz they wanted to go yeah but in this movie one of the things that's like it really strikes home is like everyone is struggling fucking kids like everything is falling apart always constantly right and because of that it's kind of got a fun personality like he gets checked all the time as soon as he gets cocky he gets crushed again right I guess it just keeps happening through and there's a whole series of these movies but like that's not happening to that the rich kid that I grew up with know much about that's why probably when he hit the guy in his car and had the guy stuck under his car he didn't know what the fuck to do yet I mean he just thought he's gonna get away with whatever he figured just he figured I just gotta get I got it I gotta get away yeah clean the car there was a kid I went to high school with that had a hit-and-run and didn't and they got he got away with it I mean obviously I didn't know it was his kid I went high school but he got away with it for a long fucking time it was such a public story that a famous NASCAR driver at the time painted her name on his car like fine so-and-so's killer cuz it was such a fuckin big deal this girl that was hit and run and he came out years later this is crazy he was peeled pilled the fuck up he showed up to her sister's house and admitted the whole thing to her sister and was saying he was gonna like run away kill himself whatever and she cleverly she spoke polish she told her husband to fuckin call the cops and was trying to call him this kid down in the meanwhile telling him to call the cops and they finally caught this kid before he could fuckin off himself or something but he killed this girl on a hit-and-run and thought you and got for what it's worth got away with it for a long time in but he was probably not a bad person he just was weak at the time and it haunted it up for yeah he had out fuck crazy right that's a mistake that if you make goddamn did she like that happen like like from from your area of where you grew up like do you read stuff now years later that you hear about fucked up shit from back then that like has it gotten exposed now like needs teacher like these teachers I new ran a fucking prostitution ring that Duty just came out in the paper the teachers did teachers do to shop the old shop teacher his daughter the shop the shop teachers pivot dude that's insane who are the girls the girls were high school students no not high school students they were fuckin just like girls in the community probably girls that went to high school and graduated but other girls that they were pimping out from the school they were pimping from school what school was this this is out in the suburbs of Chicago Wow here's the question if they did make prostitution legal they set up just like can go get a massage and go have sex with somebody yeah how much would that change like the notion of marriage relationship nobody's getting married ish yeah that's it it's over it's over it's only a law that's keeping like what percentage of people married I mean you you said it before when we were when we when we touched on this prior the reason that we make it okay is because the church gets involved right so if the church says it's okay it's like my dad was a drug addict growing up my dad was was in and out of prison my whole life when I was a kid and my mother divorced my father when I was one so I don't really have any recollection of any of that so I don't have that like damage that people like my dad I got divorced when we were 16 I didn't see it I didn't know it but my mom came from such a hardcore Irish Catholic world that my family the older generation didn't approve and was like you can't divorce this man that's against our religion and my mom was like he's a fucking terrible person to me I have to get out of this relationship and now she was just they were both young you know she just wanted to make the right move for a baby but the church has so much influence on certain parts of society that my grandmother was like almost disowning like but that's such a reality for that generation that it was like how could you what do you mean divorce I mean that's like you're you're you're going to help like that's it you're done so my mom had that kind of fuckup in her brain of like that that's how much influence the church has over marriage and coupling and it's crazy it's fucking crazy it's unbelievably ridiculous that people succumb to that it's so crazy it's controlling and well that the Catholic Church in particular is one of the weirdest ones ever not so strange it's this the insanely high percentage of people that are involved in child abuse yeah I mean what other religion has that connected to it like that it's none like not what the Muslim is the biggest in the world right the biggest religion in the world right I think it is it's not Christianity yeah they're they're probably toe to toe either way you don't hear about that so are they covering up shit it's not the same thing the thing about the priests and the priests being forced to be celibate and then spending time with boys like the that shit has always gone bad yeah forcing guys to be celibate bad forcing guys to hang out with boys bad awful someone something is weird weird shits going to happen if there's no parents in the room dude when it when as soon as you deprive someone of something they are going to have it they want it immediately then you attach to it the ultimate power that comes being a representative of God yeah like you're wearing a priest outfit to a little kid like that kid will suck your dick do anything you say you know what's going on he's a baby ooh it's fuzzy so dark dude eats our daughter control and when you find out how many of them yeah that's the thing is it's not just one it's not just ten like the more you hear the more you're like dude this is not a fucking accident these aren't coincidences this isn't like a conspiracy that this is a fact that this is rampant and it's crazy it's crazy because it's still happening no they don't talk about it's like it's you know well how about that benedict guy the pope that had to resign they found out that he had been involved in the moving of these cha masters from one place to another place keeping them clean clothes the story down shut everybody up and then move that guy to another place and one of the guys went on to molest a hundred deaf kids what yeah molested a hundred deaf kids and he was put into that position by this guy who wound up being the Pope 100 deaf hundreds deaf kids it's horrible fucking awful it's hot there's so much involved in it there's so many people that covered shit up there's so many different versions of these stories so many stories thousands and thousands of stories that people molested by priests yeah I mean it's crazy and if you bring it up immediately you get people defending it no no no look you're exaggerated like I've said this before I can manage if NASCAR drivers fuck that many kids maybe shut down just shut the fuck down but because it's the church we're like well Lissa you know but there's good things too they're working for God okay it's crazy that any organization can have a history of fucking kids we're working for God is God side job fucking children because it's not whatever it is it's not working but we forgive them Willy it's not all bad we don't want to break the whole thing up definitely don't want to do that no stealing is not bad fucking a kid is the same as like some minor bullshit infraction in society and thousands thousands of cases maybe even millions of cases it's so and then still you have these world leaders like Trump met with the Pope the Pope is all bummed out Trump should be like I'm bummed out to be next to you motherfucker what you represent you're mad at me cuz I'm pulling out the climate Accord what about all the kid fucking bro did you bring up the kid fucking he's been fucking kids that's a dog that's why you do a good Trump have you seen the pictures of Trump with the Pope yet hopes totally dissing Holmes rail bumped the Pope should relax you should slow his fucking roll you're part of a giant kid fucking ring yeah yeah who do you think you are yeah you're getting cocky because the billionaire guy who tricked America into voting for him yeah is uncomfortable do you know what the but you know what the thing that bothers me the most is the church is all about fucking the community and the people they don't pay taxes on all this great real estate they own tons of it how come they can't house homeless people are sick people in those how churches all day long while they're there that's free property yeah I don't understand yeah I can't believe I got is this trumps like my hair looks good good hair day it's a good hair day Pope you like my hair touch it's real I got a done dead the guy that I use went to Tony and guy the hair stylist school the color of his hair is like the color of every retired Florida golfer in his seventh fucking so gross he's got this weird bowl and great thing going on it's like he moves it around a little like some days it's like a darker Brown some days it's like a blonde like blonde gray it looks it's just likes and he's getting it worked on it's what I'm saying like this is not the color of the hair now what you do one of two things let me be clear about this either you work on your hair or you don't work on your hair okay so either you dye your fucking hair or you don't dye your hair it's one of those two things how fuckin when you dye your hair be consistent you can't go gray and then be blond again then be dark-haired it's too confusing to me I need to know what kind of a person to you like how much you working on your hair what's your level of haircare how much time you spending putting that together every day does did Donald Trump changes Eric of course it was like an obvious of course he did he's changed his hair color it goes he's moving it around his hair is probably very gray at this point he's in his seventies there's nothing wrong with that what did you think about all this Kathy Griffin shit she's ridiculous it's fucking insane she needs friends why are you doing it it's just it's a hundred percent attention what a bullshit culprit edgy she thought she was being edgy and she probably was talking with the wrong people and got the wrong idea in her head and went with it and had no one like you around to go what the fuck are you talking about that's the president and it's a person yet too human yeah you can't you can't pretend you want a murder room Isis style and hold his head up to the camera like a hostage video that's fucking crazy I think it's just it's it's one of those things where both both parties both extreme left and extreme right are at such a heightened version of what's happening that people are becoming blind to like logic yes 100% logic is like what's gone yeah you would fucking never if somebody did that with Obama a holy shit ugh oh my god I mean the fucking world would stop spinning there'd be so much chaos from that it would be fucking it would be an insane thing to see that happen well look it's just that's not any one solution like that's not a real so like holding up that head is not a real solution like killing anybody like that to taunt not only that even if it's like the worst person the world cutting their head off and holding it up like that is fucking barbaric we wouldn't even want that from Osama bin Laden if we found the the video of Osama bin Laden one of the seals held him down and cut his head off and then held it up the camera we'd be fucking extremely like what are we doing why don't you just kill him kill him like we're not them shoot him we're not we're not torching them we're not trying to terrorize all these other people we are not going to become what we're afraid of right right I mean that's what she's doing by holding that head up you are becoming what you were afraid of you're becoming a monster you're yours your dread face you're not even emotionally attached the fact you're holding up this bloody head no what kind of nonsense false imagery is this like you don't really think that you don't really feel it is it art like what is it is it art that's what I am sure that's what the argument from from rush sake was it's an artistic piece with wit with a photographer who's but it's about a real person it's not Medusa you just thought like a dragon's head you're holding up it's just crazy if it's your own head it's your own head you can make a funny state trying to make a statement sure but it's like what are you doing you're terrorizing that person if you're that you have I know everybody thinks that the president has to assume a certain amount of mockery and I agree that he does sure I agree everybody in any position of power like that is gonna you're gonna have people coming at your course but there's a difference between that and advocating a brutal assassination in terror video that's bed removal that list yeah it's not that's not no one's going to be sympathetic towards your idea and in fact you're going to empower the people that are opposed to you because they're going to think oh these people are these crazy ideologues who want to like literally promote the murder and torture of someone cutting their head off the whole thing is crazy but it's just it's something that people do with they're trying to get attention and they're trying to entertain or trying to be shocking they just it's good it's a continuation of trying to be in people's frontal lobe you know it's like people in Hollywood at some point just want to stay in Hollywood and I feel like that's what she does a lot I want to stay I want to do something controversial on the fucking New Year's Eve host that she does or whatever so she can stay in Hollywood it's such a this great this great director one told me that the sat is never that imagine if this is a if this is an actor and and as if we're the Sun and and you know the Sun and the earth and moving moving around one another just like an actor in a spotlight it says if the spotlight has is on the actor at some point but when it moves away if the actor tried to move towards it is when it becomes sad when it shifted out of your line of sight when when your work and your progress has shifted as if your time perhaps may be coming to a close as far as it's worth when you are continuing to search for it there's nothing more desperate and more obvious he's like you can always see when someone's hunting for it again it looks sad it looks it looks desperate it's also contrary to the very reason people like you in the first place like people like you because you're doing things they enjoy exactly doing good work you're doing good comedy you make it a good movie whatever the fuck you do making a good song that's why they like you they don't want to like you because you're trying to get attention yeah or that you're trying to get people to to just what I mean what is that I mean what what what do you get out of holding a head like what kind of a tent do you get like yeah well yeah I think oh girl like yeah we're with you fucking kill him like you're there's people that do think like that and they could have easily been right there might be left they could have easily been right it's a it's a way of thinking and you get that way of thinking and then you program yourself you get locked into this predetermined pattern of behavior like all right wing people like a giant percentage of them have like an established series of of opinions about certain things that we count on because they're the right right like like AB or Shannon or even it used to be gay marriage or them there's always a bunch of them that are just climate change is one of them like it's like halfway there maybe 25% of them hardcore on the right where is the left climate changes almost 100 percent accepted right without it without question it's weird I gotta these these ideas become right or left ideas who logged them into the database of which side do they belong on it's talking points people on Fox News start talking about it people agree with it they like convenient things that's a cycle it comes go don't worry about it but we need his jobs and then they run with that and it's a toll it's this is this predetermined pattern that people just love to fall into man it's weird it's creepy this should no longer be separation of just permanent party it shouldn't be you're always left and always right that's so fucked or too vulnerable yeah I feel it myself I feel myself the urge to be a part of groups I do it all the time we all do we all do that's a that's that's that is nature and habit right you everyone wants to belong to a community that's why fraternities exist that's why when you join a gym you start to eat in the moment you will join a gym you start to see people repetitively that you know and you it starts off with a hey what's that guy you see all the time then it's Nevada oh yeah man and then it becomes a relationship you create because it's communal because oh we both do this thing we both enjoy I see you often we do this thing we create tribes we love haciendas we like to be a part of our little tribe and when it gets infiltrated it you you become vulnerable you feel like you the walls are weakening it's almost like when the word gentrification gentrification really just means a tribe's area has been compromised you know it's like this has been this for so long when white people or people of privilege or money move into anywhere they're trying to overtake that tribe that's why there's so much backlash that's why people fucking get so angry about neighborhoods turning over quote-unquote because they're like what can be ours that's it's such a fucking delicate thing because you're like you can't stop that you're never gonna stop that well not only that it's there's a game being played and you're part of it because you're paying rent yep and there's a game being played your part of it when you're working you're getting paid for your time during that now you have to decide what you're gonna do with that time yeah and you might feel very stuck in this game that you're at right now were you paying this guy for rent and you're working for that guy and he's giving you a certain amount of money and it all kind of like evens out at the end there's nothing left over but you're still playing a game this guy's playing the game too but he's been playing it for 35 years this game is I buy houses right and I sell them to white people and I'm gonna keep playing that fucking game because this is all legal and this is why you pay me rent stupid it's a fucking we know the game but the game is I'm 30 years ahead of the game than you right and you know I'm a 70 year old guy with a fucking pocket protector filled with pens and I've got a bunch of apartment buildings all over the place and I flipped those fuckers there's a lot of those guys out there like this gentrification thing I know it's uncomfortable people they like we're losing the old neighborhood like let's go back to the fucking teepees let's go back to the cave we lost the old caves man we're not saying what you moved out of the case it's gonna happen no change shift things change you can't hold them back you can't decide no we want this neighborhood to stay shitty you know or we want this neighborhood to be all Puerto Rican well listen sometimes this doesn't work that way some people die new people move in do you really care if Swedish people move in your neighborhood you know we're losing Chinatown what do we do are you gonna be okay yeah is it okay if they live here or people there's gonna be change it's gonna come and go you can't control it right you can't control it based on nostalgia this has always been East Harlem fat finest savaii place we have to keep it like no we don't know no one has to do anything I do love East Harlem famous lavake place I will say you know what that is I'm searching for a word it was like that that happens like when when restaurants closed and people get furious yeah so one doesn't have to fucking keep the restaurant open stupid I was just up in these chains I was up and Seattle on these guys these Costa Rican guys I started talking to at the at the Fremont brewery we're telling me about this great Caribbean food place up the street and I said what makes it so great and he's like you know it's just the recipe because the guy that used to own it was this great this Cuban guy just a brilliant chef and he got sued for illegal wage wage garnishing these illegal employees I couldn't speak English she got sued so the city shut him the fuck down some other fuckin white rich guy came in bought the recipes from the guy to help him out with his lawsuit still runs watch just as good like it can be done if someone does it correctly he bought the recipes he was like the mistake I think when people buy a bar or buy a place they think they're buying the place now there's more that there's more than just the the brick-and-mortar there's more to it than that so he knew the food success was because of this got the way he did it you can't just like it's not just a Cuban restaurant or a Caribbean restaurant he was like I want to do it exactly how did it so he paid for him for to give him those recipes so he could just the recipes just to show him how he was cooking and she cooked that he paid him for the recipes not know the rest of the details but that that is to get it back to where it was and this dude from Costa Rica was like still the same I fucking love it wow he's a couple of white guys that are back there now he's the same food it doesn't doesn't mean that I don't appreciate people that live in these neighborhoods that are being forced out you have to get a new place to live and you can't afford it you can't afford to live in the neighborhood anymore because people are buying it up I get it I understand that it sucks but ultimately it's probably good for everybody it's definitely good for the neighborhood the neighborhood's going to get like these nice houses now and people are going to move in they're going to have it's going to be more value if you did buy a place if you did take the risk and bought a place that place can be worth more money now right I know maybe you couldn't buy a place I know it's hard to buy a place when I get paid I get it but you don't have to do that right I know you feel like you have to do that and they can come up with a bunch of excuses and you everybody would argue all day long about white privilege and you're lucky and this and that but the bottom line is you're not in a cage alright if you're not in a cage and you're out there doing something you could figure out a way maybe it's a month from now maybe it's six runs from now to transition into something else figure your way through the maze right we don't all start the same spot in the maze no agreed couldn't but don't ever complain about your spot in the maze just figure figure your way through that thing now you're in the mace yeah it sucks definitely hard not easy keep moving keep keep moving don't jam this up with your tears you fuck keep movin you don't understand capitalism and that's why I'm a socialist okay just keep moving though you don't you know just talking too much you're not moving and go do it yeah there's not enough happening here that's complaining about other things happening I get it I get it it's not good the climate change agreement is a terrible thing to leave it's a bad thing to leave his own daughter told him not to leave but I never liked Krishan so we got to get out of Paris she did she's owned his own daughter was like this is a bad idea this guy's crazy he went he and science he is perfectly out of his fucking mind he's going against science like the scientists are saying hey we've got to reduce emissions 100% we're polluting the air we breathe ruining the very air that we need to exist on yep no not true don't agree we buy it we bought new air there's so much air have you ever seen how much air there is maybe he's doing this because he's about to move into position to use one of those gigantic building sized air filter things maybes gonna have a Trump air filter air filters and set them up in every city you could all go back by diesel trucks no one's gonna care anymore we're gonna clean that air nice it's kind of like a theocracy Jo see that movie so I never saw that movie dude it was that kind of thing where the future is like they don't drink water anymore they'd be convinced by this this like Gatorade type drink where it's like this is better than water and people like gotta be to everyone fucking drinks it the big fans feel like it's better than water if you can convince enough people what it is people get on board regard blind faith I'm trying to talk about that on stage right now about blind we have so much blind faith like I had a fucking I would the gas station to get this thing I had a brownie was like a power like a you know protein-packed brownie or whatever I just trusted her that's all real I don't fucking know it's probably just a bullshit ass brownie but it's a pact with protein yeah if you actually got the real statistics on it yes probably got what yeah there is craved it's got electrolytes it's brilliant it's cruise what was the name of the stuff what was it called is it say what it was called the Jude the juice it was like but it looked like Gatorade it was like or they were watering their plants with it and shit nothing was alive anymore but out of a sink would come this fucking Gatorade type looking drink Bronto that's right Bronto the thirst mutilator yeah what your thirst that's hilarious I need to watch that movie click on that picture uh to the up just all the way over set down at the net left that one yeah look at that that's what the world has become that makes sense you see the size that Costco yeah that's hilarious that could happen totally that's all totally possible have you been watching this Handmaid's Tale no what is that no have you no is it on Hulu man which is look written I want to say 20 years ago it's Elizabeth moss is a star of it it's essentially about if World War three broke out and we became like an ultimate police state and there was like a sub government that took over and we went back to essentially biblical times when women who were fertile were used for the rich as handmaids for making babies well dude it's fucking trippy as shit whoa you gotta watch it bro you know it's based on modern time yes it takes place in modern time as if World War three broke out I don't want to give you too many details but then we're under a police state so these handmaids these fertile women who are of lower socioeconomic status they must wear these things and abide by their masters which are the wealthy one-percenters of the world who own these fertile women because their wives are infertile so they must repopulate this new community whoa dude it's fucking right up your alley it's insanely good but as a book that was written meanwhile that's a total possibility well that's why I dudes getting so much love in fact some of the parallels in the show of what's going on in society now and some of the commentary because this was shot prior to the election it's so specific I mean that's why people are falling in love with it cuz they're like this is creepily real like it's almost you know III think with what especially from a for what I've heard from women's perspective you know like taking a little fear of women's rights being removed as far as things like Planned Parenthood or or what-have-you the choices of your own fucking body I think there's so much echoed in the show that it feels creepily real or it's like you could one day just go like they do in one of the scenes without giving anything away it's like all the women are fired today well you know that Iran of today is nothing like Iran of like the 1960s no have you ever seen like the difference between Iran then and now no they became when I think when it was when the shot took you know when the Ayatollah took over because the Ayatollah was a religious figure and he took over and the change of the country I'm terrible with Iranian history so if you're listening this and you're upset that I'm getting it wrong how many Ronnie look fucking pissed essentially they used to dress like much more free yeah look it's like much more westernized looks like it's like the 70s oh look mid seventies yeah I look like 70s United States I mean and then shit changed and now if you go there today I mean look the Middle East is with a shining example of what is possible in 2017 as far as I know what her shirt is there ah I mean that's that's you're dead if you don't know big old school check out chocolate chocolate yeah yeah bwa right she began slaying for now they have to cover their head I mean they have like religious scarf laws and you know what's really crazy is they're better than like Saudi Arabia I mean it's audial rabia's what you can and can't do today I mean you're essentially like a second-class citizen if you're a woman below I don't think there's they allowed to drive now they changing that oh no I mean I know that some people that are trying to change that there's some people that are progressive over there that are trying to change that I think there's straight property man that's what they view a message straight numbers the idea you have to keep your head covered you have to wear those those robes and the garb and and then this women that are trying to say that that's a source of empowerment there's a bunch of crazy people out there just like there was always Uncle Tom's like during the civil rights movement and just like people are just there's always going to be like black guys for Trump it's always contrary and you're like really yeah there's always there's gonna be women that say that I wearing the how do you say to a job hijab by saying job yeah she that's uh it's empowering for women the fuck it is you have to wear it's a religious symbol of oppression how could you how could you I understand being born into something and not knowing any other way I do understand that like I get it too right but at the same time or born into and being convinced this is the way that it should but when you see freedom of the world when you see the freedom of the world that we're all born fucking naked and free to be these things I don't know why there isn't a little bit more of a clique that goes why do these women in other places have more freedom because because of the goal of any sort of religious fucking constriction is questioning right so if you question it you're automatically fucked but if you question it enough where you research and you look and you find out and you learn I would assume you would become enchanted with the idea of being free of just wanting to not have someone fucking tell you where you can walk what I can do that makes sense but when you connect an ideology with with God and with the idea of the lion right that's the ultimate that's reason to stick around like the end of the day it's clothes clothes are made by people if you're telling me that God is saying that you have to wear some kind of clothes and not other kind of clothes I'm calling bullshit yeah who's the people you're not talking to God he's never talked to you and told you to wear that this is crazy and when you have an ideology where you're trapped into dressing a certain way or wearing certain clothes or wearing a certain emblem or some sort of a symbol you're trapped by the mind of a human being yeah it is the mind of a human being they've created a pattern that they want you to not deviate from whatsoever I want you to walk around like this we're going to cover this you're going to wear these and maybe have one of those on your neck and maybe a certain amount of beads that symbolizes your you're single you're not bullshit yeah this is somebody this is by a person this is some cult shit to gain hundred percent has nothing to do with God like you you would be serving God more to be free and naked like that God created you if God is real make it didn't make clothes god is evidence stock and Levi's God's not making burkas God would like you to be naked if there if that's real if God just lets or wear whatever the fuck you want because it's all there for humans to wear right like if people are making clothes they're making clothes for people they should be able to wear whatever the fuck they want if I was God I would say yeah that makes sense where where would you like stay warm you know sure don't die I guess yeah yeah I think the only reason is not over your hair why this is nonsense this is people talk someone said that a person said it we believe in it well the priest must trust like a wizard why why is he have to dress like that no one dresses like the Pope anymore why is the Pope dressed like the Pope since I fucking get the suit off someone loved wizardry so much they were like I gotta we gotta fuckin keep that we got to keep somebody in that I always think that when I was a kid and I'd have to go to church like why'd he have to wear that stupid fucking collar sewed selvan so silly to me it is that collar he has to wear that collar so I know that he's real I'm the one oh he's got the thing on he's got the priest collar look at that who that Pope he's got wings like got luck he's in a fucking he's a window yeah an MTV Video in the 80s what is that that once put that one sponsored by Red Bull is that blowing in the wind is that what it is that's the answer man that's his way in the wind the win catholicism was one of the and this is what I was raised in sort of look at there's a wizard wizard hat show just for you look above my favorite hey why is that any more outrageous than that fucking thing that I say Cher yeah that's even more weird look at that the giant crucifix look at his fucking hat oh my god they're so silly they're the silliest people the fact that anybody says yeah yeah yeah that guys keep that picture up there don't change me that clothes there's no fullscreen with that what in the fuck are we looking at here geez this guy's got a three-foot-tall hat on it's all gold and studied in ornate like wouldn't you think that God want you to be humble if you're a servant of God you really supposed to be covered in gold look at his gold fucking pimp rag I represent God with my nugget ring look at that nugget kiss it this is a Persian rug draped around his shoulders if I can this elaborate work on that robe thing that he's got on it's so preposterous the idea that God would want you to dress like that you know I always think of when I see bit like big elaborate things like this is at the end of the day he's gonna like take that off to take a shit and it's like so sad too like we take that off and drape it on the ground you don't even when he said ax Adan his lower back like a wedding dress wipe did a terrible job of cleaning up so the the bottom of it has a little shit stain on it but he's still the Pope so he's bringing it up to the sink and he's trying to wash it in a sink and it's just sort of want wet and brown it's trying to get that little shit streak out of the bottom of his thing we call him the poop okay but don't say that it's respectful to my beliefs your distress if this is what you believe I believe this guy is the fucking guy who's talking for God come on man I'm not saying there's no God what I'm saying we have to be very wary of people just people and cults and people and the patterns of thinking and behaving that they want you to engage in this is what we're looking at here this there's two people holding this guy's fucking coat these two guys who are dressed like gay Matadors like giant gold encrusted gay Matadors and they're holding on to his cape they're fighting the devil and they're walking with him as he walks around with his giant staffs of magic he's got a wizard's wand it's a goddamn Gandalf wand he's dressed like a wizard and he's got a staff like why isn't that glowing why isn't there a lightning bolt going from that to the storm cloud that looks like the level of cape bitches way above the other guys like that's a graduation for them to be Cate bitches real bit that's a big deal cape bitch is a huge position these guys is to Kate bitches the guy in the left while you annoying his fuck I bet he tells a lot of long stories play gets the Pope alone he's like you know I just wanted to tell you about my cousin and his uh that he's a saint in the Lord and you know I think right now he's not getting along too good is this the first pope that's okay with gay marriage isn't that what he said yeah he's gotta say he's the first one that was like whatever he tossed out the throne - he's got a normal chair does he yes that's kind of cool it is kind of cool but I think that was probably a joint effort Dilek loves a PC move it was a politically fucking crazy doors behind me there's a thousand kids back there waiting to suck your dick okay we got to make this right though we're gonna get early damage we're still gonna do plenty kid fucking wait what if you saw the Pope through wave chair and got one of those like the medicine balls to sit on you know I mean like you started he started really getting he had standing desks and shit he started getting like corporate America what is that what are you showing me here Jamie is that the popemobile the new one already the popemobile the new one doesn't have bulletproof glass anymore the last Pope was like I know they want to kill me I'm hardened look they don't even need glasses all the way up cuz his back arches over so much he doesn't sit up straight so I don't need a high glass it's like a child window I wonder if that is different colors of glass because I would imagine you want to keep the headshots from coming down from the roof totally I mean if someone's gonna shoot that dude but this guy doesn't even think anybody's gonna shoot him and he's like if someone's to shoot me they'll fucking shoot me do it it's done yeah he's exposed is it a Benz it's a benzo huh yeah you think God always really loved Mercedes more baby Jesus loves G Wagen kid like the other old ones of Ben's - the only proof one I bequeath my son a mercedes-benz boy there's nothing says faith like driving around in a bulletproof fish tank right I mean that just shows you you really have a belief that God has a plan can run flat half-inch thick steel plate lightweight Kevlar armor God three-inch composite plastic clasp it was with an explosive Jesus Christ it's five tons that's ten thousand pound truck that's crazy fifteen miles a gallon that's very efficient that is really zero to sixty six seconds what's its quick turd wait a minute how's that even possible that's a little bullshit get that fucking thing on top gear run a stop sign a stopwatch with that that's no way that gets zero to 60 in six seconds we're gonna race the popemobile versus king of saudi arabia's mobile that's a Larry dude you sound like the guy from UM not Top Gear it's like fifth gear or something yeah yeah yeah I got it yeah one deal what's the other one that's who I fell did you sound just like that's a creepy the popemobile something I like about British car analysts oh dude meat so much well they take they take the piss out of everything I like how self-deprecating there when they shit on cars it's my favorite Jeremy Clarkson's the best it's hilarious the way who shits on things are so much fun and I just like to see fucking friends dump on each other on TV yeah that's fun to watch people dump on each other well especially in this day and age that would be considered bullying yeah bullying their friend that's really rude to pick on him like that yeah they just go after each other cause it's fun show yeah I probably they have a beer afterwards it's official it's fucking fine they were playing characters like James May would be captain slow yeah yeah I love that ship there's a fucked up when they canceled that show Jeremy Clarkson punched some producer and they canceled the show and fired him if you ain't knocked out a tooth or some shit like that oh he's drunk that's what happens you gonna hang out a big crazy drunk dude you want to talk shit don't tug shit talk shit get hit that huh yeah guys are all drinking that's how it goes down guys at a bar fight yeah six the most normal thing happened and it's all guys afterwards the other guy accepted it it's just they fucked up yeah why can't that be the end of it I don't know man and they have a new one they're doing now and Matt LeBlanc from friends is on it no he sees a car guy yes oh wow a giant car guy and at night he's a nice guy yeah I don't know anything about him but I didn't know that comes off like a good car guy it's not that he's bad it's just that god damn Jerry Jeremy Clarkson is a fucking icon yeah he's a maniac icon he but Matt LeBlanc is uh is he a car collectors he loves cars I don't know to what extent but he definitely loves cars he knows how to drive - he drives on the show like he's driving a Porsche 911 our he can rip it he knows what he's doing that's good yeah he can drive it's so he must have some experience real track time experience but the guy Chris Harris who's on it he's been on the podcast before that guys he's my favorite he's all the guys out there that are reviewing cars now and he knows so much about them like he really understands I think the the geometry the physics behind like the suspension they can tell you what they've changed what they've improved yeah what it feels like and what's being lost in this that's always impressive to me to have a bevy of knowledge like that my dad's worked in the automotive aftermarket industry for so my stepdad was my dad but what does he do dude for years and years he worked for the ever famous Turtle Wax car wash he was the president of sales for Turtle Wax while towed away and then now he will standard the gold standard and now he works but the turtle fired up the shell fired him fuck them and then he works for this company called Haynes who's out of La out of Britain and they they are one of like the last remaining companies that makes zero A to Z manuals on hand building vehicles Wow so if you want a hand-built kit cars or you want to literally build a car from fucking scratch most of their sales go to like mechanics auto body shops but they're also they own the rights to fictional how do I say this they otherwise to fictional mechanics fictional mechanisms that in our film world are real like the fucking Millennium Falcon they own the rights to how to build a Millennium Falcon from scratch whoa and they sell that manual that's a real fucking manual you can buy that fucking crazy - this crazy yeah they have that for a bunch of cars kid cars are pretty wild took kick cars I was always fascinated with my buddy's dad used to build em geez all the time and let us fuck around in him and I was fascinated with mgs because he he loved him I mean he was dope English kit car that was for sale really recently and you would do it by it and then once you got it over here then you had to put an engine in it yeah they'd sell it to you with no engine right you got about you will you build a first and they drop it in there zdenda but it wasn't that it was a different it was it wasn't a total kit car like you start from scratch you attached a suspension right it wasn't that it was like they would sell it to you as a as a car with no engine and then you would have to put the engine in it's a dope oh that's a trade name it's like it's right there but there's so many so many blocks I could there's only so many blocks I could fit in that framework right yeah yeah you would get like a parameter you know like a v8 ls1 or something right and try to put it in there god damnit noble noble that's what it's called noble car it's called a noble that's a dope looking car man and and guys I think they're just you know you don't have a certain amount of horsepower could take but I didn't think I don't think it had the drivetrain either I think you had to have to add the drivetrain as well I think essentially was just a frame and the doors and all that shit they must have just been parts from other third party car manufacturers and they got whatever parts they could put them together you built that and then the engine is what from anywhere at all I think you'd have to just know how to do it I mean there's a whole market now where they buy engines and then they put them in older cars go by like one of the big companies it does it is a company called icon and what they do is they take a like a 69 Bronco yeah and they strip it down they put the car back together again with a modern suspension then they take a 2017 Ford Mustang engine and then try the Bronco yeah well so they put totally modern brakes totally modern suspension Bronco engine what but the Bronco engine is a 19 you know a 2017 for Ford Mt it's called a coyote motor it's a really high-end high tech motor it's a really nice motor so you have like this old-school car so they have like kits like they do that with LS 100 LS maybe you and I talked about this someone was saying that they were taking classic mutt Ford might have been doing this themselves where they take classic Mustangs and put new Mustang engines in old classic Mustang bodies no we were talking about that you and I were talking about that there's a guy who's got a page on Instagram where he did it and it's I think it's I think it's called gt500 super swamped so he's got a someone had a Shelby Shelby gt500 yeah from 2012 and he put that body of a 1969 car over the 2012 car fuck so it's the best of both worlds that's it right there it is so beautiful it's so beautiful wow this guy nailed it and but he's only done one car I said it was like doing it I thought there was a company that was doing it but apparently just this one dude who's done this what does that run for to say what he selling this for I don't think he's selling it no he just wants to fucking show you shitless he should sell the fuck out of that thing he should sell the fuck out of that look that would be where I had a 2012 gt500 it was a great car that's another one now that's a different color oh it's different car look at that look at that helping a friend sell six am I say 33k oh that's a beautiful car well 33,000 miles is nothing that is nothing that's a beautiful car god those things were classic those 1960s Mustangs are some of the most beautiful shapes ever and to take that and put a I think 2012 the gt500 a packed 550 horsepower yeah almost 600 isn't that crazy this won't be in the future that like in the future like no one's going to have a lot of these current cars now are just gonna go by the wayside like there's only so many cars that will stick around as classics from the you know early 2000s era yeah there's not going to be any like driving yourself in a hundred years no it's over like that that idea is fuckin dead don't have court that's a noble yeah that's it right there in that a dope car kind of it has a Ferrari body a little bit right of sort of like like an old um more like what is the car I'm thinking of the Lotus or it used to look like that yeah the Lotus yeah that's why like the loaded the cool lotuses of like wow look at that oh that's a newer one huh Wow that's holy shit right that's a that's a digital image we can't hear you you know website is really cool that where's the sediment Italy right is everything out of British I think they don't have airbags or they didn't have airbags yeah cuz you get one eighty five doesn't that doesn't look like an airbag to me that just looks like a steering wheel you die you die I guess yeah competing is you're complicated yeah fuck it fuck that airbag thing I would I would want to find out like now that I'm like it might have one actually I never dare back not so horny horny affords it I think that was the problem I think they hadn't gone through all of the FCC what is it hoots what would be the what is that the name of that now I can't think the FA not the IHSA safety mode yeah I Ches a yeah that thing's fucking really sexy looking looking that's all that carbon fiber in there god those seats look amazing let's see that that ebrake is up but it doesn't look like it stick that's just what you put your in your asshole oh that's where you get photos oh when you moved up is there one up front - can you suck one while you fuck one on you can't be greedy that wouldn't be noble look at the inside of that thing because you go back to that cock hole see there's no that that's all push button there is no fucking second no manual no manual transmission that's what they're all using now those exotic Italian cars and everything anything is paddle shifts now I know well look at that steers do you see this I had this this was for a thing let me show you I'm really bummed out the new NSX look at that fun thing huh I rented that for the shoot that we were doing all that's beautiful that's the old magnum p.i Ferrari man no that's a couple years later I was at 355 GT yeah

one was down you know Ferraris one is down yeah I'm stead of up reverses up but one is down two three four five but that thing was so much fucking fun look at that that's right I forgot that they had it backwards yeah I was backwards 1995 was I think the year that Ferrari somebody wrote Pontiac Fiero dope Pontiac Fiero do you remember when they used to have those kit cards we had like a Pontiac Fiero and put like Ferrari bodies on the outside like a fake Ferrari body yeah that's it it's pretty great as a which work somebody just showed me uh got about lamborghini countach it was like there's something year anniversary and they just re-releasing the Countach is do you remember those cars yeah - that was what I remember thinking and that was the only car that I ever thought was worthy of

silly no smiles at all not happy not excited about it yeah I took a deep breath cut my tie on I just gotten complicated no I just gotta think about what my life is going the best part about it is to do this movie or to do this fight he had to go to old school methods and move to the fucking woods and carrying logs around and running this night chopping down fucking trees dude that's how you get in shape fuckin a man shit man change the woods the Adrian are gonna leave you long I'm gonna go out in the wilderness gotta go out here chop some wood I gotta chop wood then I'm gonna fuck you and then I'm gonna go whoop ass I'm gonna carry a log do this No oh shut this off for it die shit I can't do any more those movies are great though dude so fucking great a window into time I know a return when it was okay to be ridiculous in a film yeah man now it's everything gets checked in balance so much that everything is like has to be proven by the studio back then if that was an idea I'm sure he was like what if I'm driving around thinking about the fight make a music video they're like great we got an extra hundred grand to burn this week let's fucking do it I'm thinking we have a time-lapse of all the shitty moments of my life Oh things were didn't work out can you guys show first time family mother died about we go back to the first time I ever kissed Adrian okay yeah Rach we have some of our own scenes planned mm-hmm what the fuck I know my people he does though me he's still taking action movies he's kicking people's asses in his in his 70s dude you can I tell you the one but I did a fucking benefit I did like the stand-up at a better benefit for Tom Arnold for this thing this charity he runs and sly was there because they're they've known each other for years and as I got off stage I walked past him and I didn't want to like you know I don't want to be like hey and fucking call attention but as I walked by he goes very very good okay that's fucking awesome like that's enough for me dude very very good I interviewed him once for the UFC there was uh something was going on he was some movie was coming out I forget what movie it was but he wanted he was fun he was easy does it what about this I don't remember I don't think it was he's the England other-- movie I forget what movie it was but he was super like self-deprecating and easy to get along with that's how you stay fucking on earth man said something about his mom that someone yelled something out like someone like had called him yelled some I goes oh there's my mom she's up there like he's quick but he was like a genuinely nice guy like just friendly easygoing like one of the biggest movie stars in the world in the world but like was like hey what's up what's up how you doing it was pretty cool I liked it that's what we were saying before we jumped on that the level of of what Fame means to be an international movie star now has changed so much that like while I was in Japan and I'm in Japan I bring up my Instagram because these young Japanese kids are want to like see my social eeeh and he sees the blue checkmark of the verified shit and he's like famous famous and I'm like no no no no no no no no I was again they give this any fucking asshole now and they're all like laughing cuz they're like what what'd you do and I'm like a comedian comedian and their faces were kind of like comedian and one guy goes Will Smith and I go yeah Will Smith that's exactly exactly right but then since that's the level of when you say what's famous around the world you're like slide when you say like who was a famous and I don't know if we have like I don't I don't know if the rest the world knows as many of our stars as they used to it used to be you were an international star and that's what made you a megastar now it's kind of like you can be famous here in film and not really be known at all over there I mean you could then but there was so I feel like we were pumping out international stars at one point they were like just a bevy of international action stars you know I mean that just became in that era of sourcing Egger sly even like we're talking about john club and damn before this Seagal like all these like well it's like all these mega international superstars because the action movies were so big now we put that into fantasy film so now it's guardians the galaxy now it's any superhero movie that's become it but I miss the world of like why can't we have an action movie that isn't a comic book hmm where does that go yeah we would need it would have to be like someone you'd have to be the rock but that's not Billy he could do it he could do it but the white why doesn't it exist maybe people don't want those movies anymore fuck why not they have to have some sort of a metric they're judging this from right like when they're making these movies okay I think it's because they made a couple of action hero movies I I mean they made a couple of comic comic book films and they did so fucking well that now we have a bevy of them because they know that there's such a big market for it so I can't imagine you wouldn't want to see another diehard type dude yeah why the fuck not why haven't they don't read on diehard they did say there you go yeah but they redo die hard why did they didn't redo it they just kept they're still doing it though it's oh it's being done right now yeah I think they're even making another one or who the die-hard got Bruce Willis get the fuck out Bruce Willis has not kept himself up it looks like you throw a punch his shoulder would blow out fuck fucking out I really hurt I mean unless he's been working out since I last checked 2013 and then it says future right here it's all they started in 2013 oh that last one came out was it t did I try to do a TV show is that what about what's waiting members are making another one read it was a die hard in 2013 what with Justin Long I think was in it wait his daughter what yeah God come on I'm fucking that doesn't sound at all familiar but if you had to tell me to and I'm a Bruce Willis fan I think Bruce Willis is the shit I'd love if you had to tell me like when was his last movie I'd be like oh I assume he's just popping by Agron shooting loads all over the place I don't know what what is his last fucking movie a minute die hard a good day to die hard Wow and who's the guy Tuesday is that Kevin Hart no who's that dude I've never seen that guy in my life I was just a guy that was on set did anybody go to see that would I get an IMDB four I've ever said on Rotten Tomatoes Wow wait we can you go to Box Office Mojo and look that up we look it up on box office mojo acts Office Mojo there was go back sorry go back to the previous page witness box office mojo it'll tell you like budget and I'll tell you what it made here in international look at that down there it says you know well the 92 million box office it made three hundred and four million is that what it says wow so it fucking killed it is great we probably all all over see all foreign sales yeah go to box office mojo it'll show you so maybe he's like one of the few guys left that can still do that yeah you know like Steven Seagal still sells a ton of movies oversea fuckload they do those straight to you know straight to video straight to DVD CDs Duty makes tons of money internationally sell the movie before he even makes it do you know that you know he's a Russian citizen I know I love it right that's hilarious he's sticking around there you go Russian passport there's a look there's the proof it made sixty-two million here inmate 237 overseas Wow international superstar did get paid get that paper Bruce pay but Bruce that's amazing what do you think he walked away with oh he took ten up front to make it he probably got a ton of money I don't know how it works points he's probably got thirty thirty million out of that maybe I was balling out of control Bruce hit us up dude yeah he's good friends with Dom I rera is he yeah those two that's so funny I would love to see it just them two in a diner having a conversation I know right sis Bruce Adama rare JAMA rare still doing the dead dude I fucking love him he did a bunch of episodes on the Showtime show I did he yeah dude fucking so awesome that they got like real comics man the Showtime show looks great man I love how authentic everybody looks and the hairstyles they killed it and it went with real comics you know magical you knew on Eric Griffin Juran fucking Dom Earl Skakel does a few Poppins on it oh my god I'm drum drawn such a blank there's so many other guys that like came in and left Julian Gold yeah that's aw look at that man that's crazy Melissa Melissa constantly feel like an extreme amount of responsibility while you were doing this because you're doing a movie that's based on the most important comedy club in my opinion ever yeah TV show but yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you do in a show yeah we did so the pressure was fuckin yeah man I felt the pressure the responsibility was fuckin huge Wow we premiered last night and it'll air this Sunday and Jim Carrey said some amazing things man yeah that's our cast photo that one that you clicked that one yeah did it feel weird to be on that I mean it must have been like I can tell you from the bottom of my honest heart it was the most important thing I've done so far Wow dude I mean we were paying homage to the world that that we love and respect so much and it was a big effort on Jim's part in his producing partner Michael Aguilar to like tell real stories a lot of the stories that people see if you watch the show and I hope you do come from Jim's real life two dudes from Boston move they live in a fucking dudes Closet in West Hollywood and they used to be a guy that would jerk off and watch Jim change nothing chief Jim put that story in the show man he wanted all these little grated but there's a great moment about joke stealing in there and fucking huge fistfight that breaks out that was real from Jim's personal life about guys used to come in from the fucking radio from talk radio in the you know in the morning they come to the club at night come to the store steal shit the next morning comics would fucking hear it yeah that's a real common thing yeah man that was always going on you know what else was going on a big one was writers for sitcoms would come yep same shit and they would watch people do sets and then they would wind up putting their their bits in like even in fucking Seinfeld kept like Kevin James signature bits got used on Seinfeld after he had a bunch of meetings and then they came to see him perform a bunch of like top writers came to see him perform in an NBC showcase he's like when Kevin was getting a development deal and they came down and watched him and then like the next season his muffin bit was on a Seinfeld yeah it was like what the fuck man well nowadays they fucking they're blatant they tell you like I tested for Saturday Night Live and you sign a form that says these characters can be used after the audition whoa and this is crazy I'm not calling out anybody or saying anything but they did there was a character ended up on the show that Vanessa Bayer did fucking hilariously that I did something similar in my audition I was like damn that was really good let me so u qo audition you have a character your audition with yeah I did this character this fake they can steal that they own that now yes your dish when you audition you surrender the character fuck you man yeah you sign a piece of paper that's crazy they're not even giving you money and they're stealing your idea idea when you get there that that's the respect that the SNL has earned in the comic community you you don't you don't have that respect it's crazy that's stealing your stealing well I sign the form man oh my god dude that's so awful I signed that because you can almost taste it you know they're making you sign something saying we're gonna steal from you totally that's insane we're gonna steal from you we're not gonna pay you anything we're gonna use this thing it might be a fucking Mike Meyers movie someday and you have to say yes sir may have another take it in take ass I dig it that's so crazy I took it man I took it it was a wild process but the fact that some hugely successful business wouldn't want to compensate people for creating those ideas fly you out to to show yourself off even if you I mean even if you just don't hire them but you like that character you this should be like an established eight yet to pay for things but I mean that you know and my whole thing is like I'm not saying what they did was what I did but it was it there was some similarities in in the nuances the character that I thought were either just you know a confluence of great ideas but it is hard you think about that stuff you're like Mars is that close to what I did because you know like we set back in the day like our show shows people were blatantly people have been blatantly stealing in comedy for fucking ever it's been like the beginning of time and especially in the 70s which i think is what we tried to show was like they would steal these radio guys and fucking show up again and be like hey like it wasn't like it will make it a you happen on buddy I told on fs1 your shit jokes from last night we always we always promote you ever you're in town yeah yeah like I'm really I'm really lucky that I didn't grow up in a generation where you didn't get paid in the sense of like when I remember hearing stories of guys that would go on the road and then get fucked out of a check you can get fuck still really get fucked yeah I've heard of people getting fucked Geordi Joey Diaz had an experience about a year ago well Joey's gotta fuck with - yeah he called this guy up and started screaming at him and said listen you know you don't fucking pay me he goes I'm gonna tell the whole world he goes I'm gonna have all my friends tell the whole world and no one's gonna fucking work here anymore that's it yeah and he wound up getting paid but it took him a while to get paid there's a lot of club owners are still doing coke isn't that fucking insane I know a guy I know exactly round him every time I'm around him he's coked up no he's just living it like the old days but here's the thing they never saw it has been a part of it from the beginning of time yeah like from the beginning of when I started doing stand-up there was a lot of club owners that were on coke and they just have normal yeah they partied Knicks comedy stop in Boston it didn't never happen to me because I was never a coke guy but they would offer you if you wanted to get paid in money or coke not kidding imagine any other industry they would pay the comics in cocaine like Lenny Clarke has told me about in great detail and said I'll just take the coke I guess I'm guys took the coke can you do a half and half can you do like an 8-ball and these guys were selling coke and running comedy clubs that's kind of brilliant and I mean there was it was total organized crime shit it was all organized crime it was just like at a level where it was acceptable wasn't like they were killing people but they were selling coke yeah but coke was so okay that I was like man a second dude no one's totally captured the crazy days of Boston I was a kid back then so I got to see it really from the outside and it all started before I even started about four years before I started it was at its peak in like 84 yeah those guys were maniacs out of their minds maniacs hammered every night on so like Mario Joyner was talking about it last night at the store yeah cuz he was hosting the show that we were doing and Mario Joyner was like they would just go up there and just get hammered and just be killing it's crushed a killer blacked-out crushing blacked out drunk hammered it was a different was a whole different groove man now you have to be on your P's and Q's man now everyone's got to be real tight I feel like the majority of people in comedy the longer I've stayed in comedy the more I see people sober now I think a lot of people it's just not people are a lot more clean people working now than people who party I think there's a lot of people that realize the consequences of partying yeah you can only stay on that fucking train for so long because you look at the great ones that got derailed whether it's Katt Williams whether it's Kinnison the great ones that have been derailed by cocaine there's a little is a ton of them that we know of the cocaine one gets you it ends in a bad way you go bad your creativity goes away you get paranoid you get tired your act diminishes greatly like Kinison in my opinion is with the best example he's the best example of a guy who at one point in time was just arguably the best ever for like two years non-stop good just a monster that a mono and a thing like no one had seen before like there wasn't a Sam Kinison like an archetype yeah it didn't exist nah he was this fat guy been fucked over I've been married twice and he just would come out this giant fucking this big energy this this thing I got fucking human storm of comedy but then it dropped off so radically like Ari was talking about the other night like if you go and watch his stuff after the second special it's like it's too the second special is a big drop-off the real shit is is CD or it wasn't a CD Warner Brothers wouldn't even make it a CD because it was so homophobic they kept it a cassette for real his cassette louder than hell and then his HBO special and don't watch anything often the HBO specials what I remember fucking seeing as like one of the things where I was like this is insane this is like a fucking madman who's hitting all the marks you know yeah it's like a smart madman yes a genius but he but he didn't it's but he's not but he didn't miss it was weird it was like yeah it's like watching something someone do something brilliantly in sports where you're like everything worked perfectly it was like all the stars were aligning for him to just chugging on this train of crushing that was crazy shit to see man and it was like during the Reagan era where people started to get a little button-down yeah like that was like we went from Carter to Reagan right so we go from this hippie peanut farmer from Georgia that couldn't get the hostages back from Iran to this movie star with a slicked back hair and oh this is like there was he was a part of that yeah I mean it was a part of the whole country was fucking crazy at the time and Kinnison came along and he sort of embodied the frustrations that a lot of people felt the timing was perfect perfect but cocaine got him like he wasn't the same guy after after that special there's this giant drop-off in the amount of focus he put on his work yeah well because you become complacent and you also like I think the more money and fame you get I think unless you have sense sense sense of groundedness and humility around you like friends to be like dude you got to fucking change your game you're fucking up you're slipping you're not Purdue you're not producing anymore you're not writing you're not developing you're not changing who you are as a comic and if you don't have that around you if everyone around you is like more fucking coke dude more bitches bring them up that's all purchase that's it no I agree on the train crashes I don't know Katt Williams but I'll tell you what to this day like pimping chronicles pimp Chronicles and whatever that special is that he did that is a goddamn genius it's amazing it's amazing and apparently he loves to do whoa I don't know but I just wish he would clean up he's one of those guys I look forward when he puts out shit yeah cuz it's so fucking different crazy just wild yeah he's wild he's real I mean it's just he's a maniac it's fucking heroes all slicked back and sweat like a pig he paused a special to change his clothes cuz he sweat so much genius that's how you know you're putting work sweat through his clothes to get your money when did a change it came back out and kept crushing that's how you know you it's fucking near we put in work yeah and that was like after he had gone through all those canceled shows and all the craziness and like onstage and yelled at a heckler right five minutes then left and everybody wanted their money back and they booed him and shit still came back and crushed yeah he's fuckin good it's that goddamn cocaine though get some gets everybody everybody that we know that never made it I mean how many guys you know that we're funny that never made it they started doing coke a shitload of dudes a shitload not just coke too but just anything anything anything I mean as soon as they got into the party world the hard party world of like yeah coke it's gotta be coke it's cuz it's just it just can't just snags people goddamn and then they disappear man who loved coke must hate my podcast like he's always shitting on coke you don't even never even done coke bro that's right about Rogan dude I like him but he's like a bitch about coke dogs let it go bro a Dolittle coke I do a little coke every day apparently that is the best way to get girls to have sex with you though like if you've got some cocaine it's a it you got to be in the right place when people need cocaine not allowed to say no they just say yes they just get crazy and they do coke I guess it's like a super inhibition lowering thing you know I think the idea is so fun that they're like he can get coke like anybody can get weed but it's like he can get coke you're waiting at the house for the god to show up guy guy shows up in a Lamborghini with that fucking music play in the background there's no easy way inside his car puts the ebrake on yo man I got your package give them money you you hug like a little bit too violently like a little slap thank you bro hug you know that slap the back hug yeah cuz you know that you're dealing in some seriously illegal thing that guy knows where you live - how's your sister man she's good bro thanks for asking no shit no shit of the coke man no doubt good shit oh you're the best you next time

the drugs though too when you're on that Molly you can't escape the beat how many times you done ecstasy this is Oh ecstasy I've I've done two or three times two or three MDMA because two different things right I think MDMA is ecstasy but the old ecstasy that we did in high school was definitely not what it is now no it was like whatever pill they crushed together of shit from the sink they lie to you fuck yeah that was bad shit he got lied to in Chicago MDMA was MDMA the first time I ever did it was in London and about ten years ago that was the first time I ever even heard of it because it wasn't Molly didn't no one said Molly but the guy was like Andrew this guy who live next door was like - I've got these fucking MDMA dude you've gotta try it and I was like all right whatever the fuck is big like Jamaican British dude I was like all right dude I'll try this shit we went down by the beach and watch his concert and I was like dude how do I get this all the time he was like it's limited supply but I've got more for you we did that shit for like four days straight I was like this is the most fun I've ever had and I just stopped doing it for years and years and years and I tried it again one more time that was it never again I only did it once but it was spectacular it's amazing the comedown though is too strong the comedown was devastating I was like this you get do you get hard crashes when you do shrimps or no no you don't crash at all no I mean I feel weird sometimes I but I'm always so belittled not belittled so obliterated by the experience it was like I'm trying to process it they're like I'm barely aware of my physical state I'm almost like eating just to like just cuz I have to I have to get calories like sustenance should be in my body I mean let me just figure out what the fuck just happened you know it's always like oh yeah I knew I knew but I didn't know I kind of I needed to see it but I crash my crashes were for some reason they used to be fucking terrible I used to come down off mushrooms and I would feel fucking mezra was it always every time we did it almost man did you ever think like maybe the one thing that does happen apparently is that sometimes people grow mushrooms and oddly enough the mushrooms have fungus that develops on them and you can get sick from the fungus and then sometimes people say they have like these they have these almost like hangover like feelings because of that I have read that I've never had a hanger I mean I just I just remembers a lot of the crashes being like a fucking bummer like I was like this is for some reason acid was the first time I ever did acid was had like I felt like even when I was off of it oh it was great I didn't really didn't fuck with me yeah I did acid for the first time last year like was it last year six months ago something like that did you like it yeah yeah but it didn't um it didn't it didn't crash me I felt weird when it was over I didn't lie just it I was just didn't wanted I just do I did it I didn't want to do it again I remember doing it being like yeah I just didn't want to do it again they say the thing about ecstasy those if you take 5-htp you got to take that shit like while you're on it because it helps rebuild your serotonin so it balances it out yeah yes the building blocks for serotonin take that and it'll uh it'll help you boost yourself back up when you come through that's because once you come through because it gives you this giant burst of serotonin you feel so wonderful but then it depletes yeah it takes a while before it spools back up the 5htp apparently can help mitigate that that sounds like printer ink yeah it does take the 5htp I guess that's so funny there's like a science and I'm staying fucking healthy while you're on drugs I know when I first started doing drugs it was like figured out did mightyou your lip off you get a drink applesauce home remedies like that you have menudo uh menudo is the

Hollywood yeah who could say anything and be like this is how it is and Studios were like uh-huh your show was called I Love Lucy having Jesus was it couldn't have been any other way you know I mean for her that's like she's like I am a star I'm going to be the star of the show I want the fucking intro to be my face and then show Ricky Ricardo I don't even know Ricky Ricardo's name how about that who's that Ricky Ricardo guy what was his name as uh exactly so I'm saying that's so embarrassing I do know who it is but everybody knows who Lucille Ball is what's that dude's name I honestly thought it was Ricky Ricardo doesn't know that man you bro that TV name does your nut is okay I got it I just do but I knew that I knew that I just forgot it you're allowed to forget shit like but I wouldn't forget Lucille Ball fuck now mmm can't good goddamn show back then and that was back when a white girl was a lot of data Cuban Cubans were very white back then well that was the only kind of cue yeah the only minority she could date on TV yeah like if it's like if she had a show called I love Mexicans and she was dating a Mexican guy not accusing guy no humans are like from Spain it's like a Spaniard it was it was thought of as a different thing desi desi arnaz a handsome bastard back then he was man I think he ever banged Lucy Oh no disrespect they were married I'm saying do you think he banged her though no no carried in real life and then they work together on TV they were they were look at that Wow the heyday back in the day man you ever watch old TV shows just to just to get a glimpse of what it was like to be back in that era my fuckin old man loved Andy Griffith this is their favorite fucking show in the history of television my parents watch Andy Griffith every day oh they're obsessed a blood shit my dad loves that shit they long for nostalgia he just thinks that like that's such an iconic period of time when like comedy was pure and clean and the jokes were about in life situations that were you know there's a town drunk and there's a town whore you know I mean it's kind of like everything was such a setup but me on behind the scenes they were just as freaky back then if not yeah you don knotts used to used to stick the cop baton up his own ass right before they shot every day are you sure nope look at that picture that's the baton going in his ass that ladies laughing mine did you ever hear the fatty Arbuckle's story nah Fatty Arbuckle was the big comedian from like the 1930s 1940s and they had some girl that they were doing something with and someone put a bottle inside of her like an inner vagina and it broke and she died fuck yeah she died yeah there was something along those he was on it there was a bit where it was like we're gonna put a bottle in your head see I think so I think they were partying oh I think they were going too hard and Fatty Arbuckle was a huge star at the time yeah and when that woman died I don't know if he was I don't know if he was convicted he got charged with manslaughter yeah but was it whether or not he was convicted I don't know if he was convicted but his his career was over and then it all dried up for him I don't even know if he did it you know I mean I'm not really sure he was probably around for the party most likely yeah hotel room you know she sneezed in the bottle broke Larry Arbuckle was charged manslaughter endured not one not two but three trials for the alleged crime not going to go into the nitty-gritty of what went on in each trial but try to imagine the mismanagement and publicity akin to the OJ Simpson trial and you'll be getting close well then he should have got into it I mean who knows I don't know Court TV yeah there was no court TV coverage but there was a thriving tabloid press and no shortage of bombastic rhetoric the assistant prosecutor for one of the trials Minton Milton o un became known for his florid damning description of Arbuckle's lifestyle to wit a Babylonian feast was in process in progress there the defendant had sumptuous quarters with his friends food was spread wine and liquor were served and this modern Bell Johar I don't know what that means bell Shahar Belshazzar Belshazzar Belshazzar sat upon his throne surrounded by his lords and their ladies there was music feasting singing and dancing how do you know we there yeah he just said above he didn't want to fucking get in details and he explained a bunch of shit a modern Belshazzar however the last king of Babylonia thundered amidst his decadence this is some game of Thrones ask doomsday stuff right there that's a that is an interesting thing that a prosecutor could do back then they could make that sort of like ridiculous description of the events that took place like you weren't there yeah you just say that you actually do not know you actually do not know that this is what happened it's a bit of big fish story you know so did he wind up going to jail you know how many people have stuck bottles up people's pussies and they didn't die and they went will they read that story I did it this morning if you got like one of those Mexican coke bottles was real thick ones those are hard was her heartbreak you'd have to find and throw her against the wall or something yeah if she had a pussy that was so strong to break one of those bottles they could probably endure the cuts too oh yeah so I got the dents that it killed his career he third trial he just pretty much lost left Hollywood or he's shunned by Hollywood and could no longer find work isn't that crazy that he was acquitted right he got off he was acquitted and it's still yeah I guess back then that was it it was it son and there was only one machine you know there was no internet back then nope you could have he couldn't had a YouTube page made his own YouTube page you see uh Fetty are bogo put out a special on seeso man it's pretty good it's on epics it's not gonna sell to Netflix in five years how's it working for Showtime it was good it got good shows man they did me right I will say doing this special this Friday and then the show comes out on Sunday so it's like this weekend they're gonna they're pairing it together and I fuckin they were great they did great by me man I can't fuckin say anything negative about that the network is the shit right now billions is good for them they still kicking out shameless people fucking love shameless still bloodline I mean there's a bunch of fucking really good shows you showtimes resurfaced as of the premium cable network that it's what wanted to be for a long time yeah I did a Netflix special in 205 and in 2006 Showtime aired it they've put together some good comedy specials well they have the Netflix and Showtime we have to have some kind of deal because a lot of the times your Showtime shit ends up on Netflix they do they buy out the rights of that that would be smart you know if they did that that would be smart well they can move it's good move for everybody you know I mean and I hope they also have it available like we it's easy to watch online know where the make it with very few hurdles to be able to watch it online because you got to give it to people man at some point well not only that more people find out how good it is more people watch it you know whether it's your show or whether it's your standup yeah you know the more stuff that gets out there the better it is right absolutely in this crazy day and age I hope my idea you've come along with the Golden Age of The Comedy Store you know that right it's fucking wild man yeah the boom this is the boom right now we're going through it is the bubble gonna pop I don't think so because there's so much there's so many funny comedians that's the guys like yourself guys there's a lot of guys out there that are really good and that are coming up that are really good there's real good comedy going on I know it's crazy I think it's breeding really good comedy I think because there's so much great competition there's so many fucking good people I think it's breeding to people to be stronger and stronger mmm some see fucking guys when I'm like goddamn are getting so strong well it's like you see really good stuff around you you know you show up one night in Chappelle goes up then Chris Rock goes on after him and like you're seeing this stuff on a regular basis and they like the quality of the comedy that you see it's very high and so guys coming up the one you know when I first started the store 94 was a dead zone it was just a terrible time it was like right after the Kinison boom it ended Kinnison left there like 86 yeah you know and then by the time I came around eight years later Kinnison was dead and the place was weird nobody wanted to be there it was weird you know was weird there for a long time and especially in terms of like talent coming up you know the talent coming up back down was just like it was really poor this is the best you've ever seen it since you started there percent me it's not even close free some guys say was even better early on does they say was even better like in the 80s they said like before like the Kinnison error like dama rare especially he says that like there was a time when they were doing three shows in the main room two shows in the o.r and they were just rotating just yeah we're pretty close to that I was just gonna say that's weird that's we're knocking on that door that's my cue to close two shows in the main room all the time on the weekends help we do two shows in the o.r all the time on the weekends and sometimes I've done four sets in a night there where I did two shows in the main room one show in the belly room and one show in the or that's fucking Oscar a see the belly has developed itself into like a real fucking great room Wow there's just so much creativity and fun going on there that's what it is but you know I'm an the improv is not bad right now to the impro has been really good too it's like calm and he's just like experiencing a cool little bump yeah it's wild I think people don't know how lucky they are in LA it's wild and people people live in LA and they're like yeah how many guys are on tonight it's like well they're all gonna be fucking amazing so stick around because everyone you're gonna see is gonna be a fucking good comment consuming a couple that suck sure it's a few sure it's gonna be a few there's a lot of comedy tourism to people coming here from Ireland Scotland yeah that's why is what's strange like we flew over to watch the store like what weird I hope that I hope our show helps that to Seattle helped to push the idea of the store being just another fuckin iconic piece that people don't know about you know for people they don't give a shit about stand-up when they see this I think it'll be more like oh fuck that's kind of cool I'd like to go see more of that shit now are you touring are you going around the world what are you doing um right now because we're kind of waiting to hear what Showtime says if we're gonna do this again I have to fucking cancel about two dates but next week I go to Austin cap city then I go Chicago Denver just for laughs in Montreal Raleigh so I'm torn a little bit here into the summer but if we have to shoot again I have to cancel a bunch of different dates no kidding huh Showtime waits till the first episode airs to release any official announcements so when is the first episode air Sunday baby so if it does well on Sunday they make a choice right then and there takes about you know it takes a whatever a little bit of fucking manipulation time of them deciding what they want to do but yeah usually shortly after the first so they talk about what's gonna happen so did you get a chance to watch it we did we saw it last night last night was a premiere for like internal for critics and shit now is fuckin happy Jim Carrey said some fucking amazing stuff he's executive producer of the show for by the know if I said that earlier but he said some fucking really dope shit man he said how much this meant to him and how how people don't really fucking know some of the true history of what that world was like to perform prison for no money and that that where there was one there was one way in was Johnny Carson it was like you get on Carson it was like you were fucking on the moon dude Wow and he talked about how a lot of critics I guess got you know they got episodes a couple weeks ago and he said a lot of you guys have been saying the word dark it's not a comedy he's like we never sold it as a comedy never once did we promote it as a comedy it's a fucking dramatic show about the world of comedy is that funny sometimes yet there's some really funny fucking moments on our show but it's about the world that exists it's about what it's like to be fucking 23 and hungry and poor as fuck and trying to get pussy and trying to get stage time and trying to figure out what you're what you're doing who's beating you and it's just about fucking life the life of a stand-up the life of a hustling hungry angry angsty jealous fucking stand-up because we all go through that shit dude I'm excited I want to watch it right now it's fuck dude I really hope people enjoy it I think the first episode was powerful as shit we have some dude that the pilot is insane we have Robert Forrester Kathie moriata from Raging Bull Melissa Leo is the matriarch of the show she she plays Goldie who runs our comedy club who is a variation of Mitzi but right you know she wouldn't say that we we're on our own space ari Graynor michael anger ah no there's some fucking just bangers on the show people that are they act their mind out that are just fucking really good man and I'm jealous you I've said along with those people and I'm like fuck me these people are really good actors that's awesome yeah Melissa was that melissa was the best worker she want to fucking Academy Award man she won an Oscar for the fighter so it's like being around a fucking human that won an Oscar is crazy Wow it's as well because I never see Moriarty was in changing ball man yeah she was also in the Dice Clay show yeah everything that was it was the name of the show bless this house less his house yeah that's right she was his wife Alfred fucking Molina you know him Alfred Molina he's the shit he's in it too I mean we have Dave they pulled out a few big names but you always want to act or do you want to do stand-up or join people Oh when I went to school I went to school to to write to do journalism in English and I knew I wanted to write and perform but I was a pussy about performing in school so I did a few plays because I really wanted to be onstage but I didn't like the idea of plays I just wanted to get on stage to like get my comfort level up and then what and the training wheels yeah dude and one of the fucking one of the teachers pulled me aside one day and she was like you know you could actually be a good actor if you didn't just fuck around when you got onstage and I was like well I I really want to fuck around on stage she's like well then why don't you go do that for a living and no shit I was like I'm gonna try and I knew I wanted to stand up so bad and I move when I moved to LA I started in LA and I was like I'm either gonna sink or swim and I just start what year to that you're 2,000 at the end of 2006 I lived on a guys fucking lazy boy in Long Beach and I used to drive up my buddy's truck every single fucking night I'd drop him off at the casino who's a professional gambler I drop him off the casino take his truck because I didn't have car money do fucking mics go to the store and you know get intimidated learn some lessons and then fucking drive back home pick him up and we fell asleep could get a burrito and do it all over again that's wild man so you started really coming in the store when I was gone yeah he's like 2007 you weren't around but your legacy was there you know I mean like it was like we all knew those that came before us some of those that we talked about but it was like I was right there when you were when you had kind of left that left that world a little bit but it's wild because it was like I hated the store when I first started to 2006/2007 was fucking awful the people above us I didn't none of the older comics were that fucking nice the vibe was negative as shit there wasn't a lot of crowds the open mics were fucking brutal they were miserable they barely got watched you know it's just so many negative things about that place at the time that I was we were going through it and then it slowly kind of turned into this you know what we've seen now which is just fucking amazing we see now it's crazy pull into the parking lot it's jammed the hallways a jam of people they makes me smile from fucking ear to ear heared right isn't it weird like it's a different it's weird I swear I've been there since 94 minutes never been like this this is a totally different thing it's just you know what it still does to me this is the truth you kind of get desensitized to shit but seeing my name up on the fucking up on the board when it's a packed night it still gets me like I still get excited I'm like that's fucking cool I'm a part of this moment in time and comedy at that fucking Club in my opinion the club it's just something else man there's something powerful a shit that's sometimes I walk to the club because I live in the neighborhood and I like to walk instead of drive because it helps me get out of my brain and every time I fucking walk up that you know and I see my name up there there's like a fucking overwhelming feeling at the moment I see it it's like this is you know soak it in a little bit because it's fucking doesn't last forever it's nice to have a place that's like that to like to just have one place that stands out as something that means more than just a comedy club it's like it's it's it's an iconic thing yeah there's there's something about that place like we're at the store it's bigger than comedy man it's it's it's big it's like a it's something but it's something big it's something fucking special man well Pauly and I were talking about this and I told them that your mom's one of the most important people ever in comedy period like ever one of the most influential humans in the infinite comedy world in the world of what we know today a stand-up comedy yes Missy sure like without her like stop and think about one other comedy club owner has had the kind of influence even remotely similar to what she's had I would know none of the above I mean I mean I guess the only person that you could bring into that namesake maybe Budd Friedman from the Emperor maybe because he did evening the improv the monocle and everything that but I don't think in the hardcore sense it's not a clothes won't be the same no but but but yeah what she did was shape and revolutionize the business that you know today she knew how to do it to leave it up to the comedians leave him alone and then also give him hard spots they never make him work for him work for that was that's the best part about that Club you think someone's funny good put him on after dice or put him on after you know whoever the fuck it was at the time that was killing see how funny they are after Richard Pryor exactly yeah see how funny they are after someone just destroys you just got to go up to this wasteland of the audience that's such a testament about that Club to that's what they've always done you die I feel it plates of shit in that place is no way around it following everybody following anybody I filed prior for five weeks fuck when when Pryor was in a wheelchair so they would have to carry him to the stage it was it was dark you know be really funny if you had to go on you had to carry him off and then do your set like this guard it started from the crowd carry a legend yeah it was uh it's that without that philosophy that she had that make you work for it make you sink or swim yeah so important because if people that we know to this day that are scared to have tough spots and we know those people totally they will they see something like Joey Diaz in the lineup and only I'm gonna go for a drive I'll be back in a little bit they'll let somebody else take their spot and they come in and they say oh is he up oh I miss my spot come on next I thought you were just here would you go yeah you hit from Joey Diaz motherfucker the only way to go up after Joey Diaz is to fucking is to just ride that like yeah you gotta ride the wave you know you have to enjoy him you have to have fun I fucking love watching it yeah but that's what I'm saying like the problem with comics when it comes to those sort of situations is you see someone killing and for some reason you think that's taking away from your ability to be funny yeah weirds the opposite yes they want you to win with someone let them know that you're there to win again instead of well I can't fucking follow that I'm not gonna talk about what Jose is gonna be disappointing don't get your hopes up yeah oh well good I'm glad you set yourself up yeah it's looking you also should be going up a laughing like it should be fun that something happens to some comedians along the line where they stop being fans of comedy like why did you get into this in the first place didn't you like watching it right it wasn't gonna stop watching it now that you're a pro that's crazy it wasn't because of uh all the billions of dollars that you thought you were gonna make you know I mean nobody got in was like the I can't wait to make so much fucking Bank on this shit yeah no one's getting into comedy for that although it can be done you know sure Kevin Hart it can be done but that's not why you get into it but it's like what we're talking about earlier it's like people that are trying to get the limelight yeah it's that weird depressing thing first if someone is just like I'm just trying to do my best shit just turn it trying to put out my best my best stand-up product I just want to pump out what I'm proud of just hammer that bitch just one fucking one shine um Klan head does the does the Showtime special have your your rock bit the bit on the rock it's on it's on Showtime right now on the South by Southwest to tour that I did they do the fucking behind-the-scenes at South by Southwest and I did a bit at the showcase for South by Southwest and I put it up on there isn't in your Showtime special it's not dude it's just on that how is that possible because I did that first and Showtime put that up and I know what I know I should have done it again I know oh that been so good I should have done it again motherfuck I thought of you actually that's really I thought I was like god I should have done that Joe I bet you fucking Joe Joe what I said I should have told against so many people about that bit that's a funny bit but beauty is it links to it so it's on Showtime's they can watch my other set and all that stuff that's another 15 minutes that I didn't put in my special that I did at South by oh really yeah oh really likes get that shit on YouTube yeah somebody want rank wait on what hey wait those are the strip things I know things around at
