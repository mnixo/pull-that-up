three-two-one Gregory Joseph sober October's over but uh we could we were allowed to smoke cigars during silver October for whatever reason but they do get you high they do give you a nice little but they do yeah it's weird that that's like thought of us being a sobriety thing is it really I mean if you're smoking people smoke cigarettes when they're sober yeah all those fucking AAA guys right those guys were always those guys will tell you you can't have a non-alcoholic beer which I do I haven't done a I've been out of drink it'll be fuckin 30 years next month that I haven't had a drink didn't you have like one or two when me need I may need I had some Scotch that's a weird one right I had like I didn't get drunk but I had like a few shots did you like feel weird about that I've been all those years I think I felt so weird about him being dead that the whole thing felt surreal anyway and I haven't really haven't had the desire I can't say had can't have the desire it's more of just like you you feel like there's times where you want to just do what everybody else is doing and just chill out you see everybody getting more mellow and relaxed and social and especially if I'm in a situation where you know it's a bunch of people I don't know that well maybe it's your kids friends parents in a nice glass of wine took the edge off dude dude but she did the the couple glasses of scotch and then you didn't go right back to it alright you became a 21 year old drunk Greg again right well a lot of us do with my father and he was an alcoholic and I saw I saw his depression the guy the same depression as he does and I felt I felt like when I drank it wasn't always for fun it was a lot of times it was like dealing with feelings and bullshit like that and so I saw him as a nun the guy who was unfulfilled in a lot of ways and I saw the alcohol was a big part of why his life wasn't but it would it could have been and I just sort of feel like you know maybe maybe I could drink but maybe I can't why fuckwit know why fuck with it I'll tell you what ma'am I just got done with a whole month of being sober and then I had my first drinks this weekend I felt like shit no kidding felt like shit yeah I had a couple of glasses of wine went to play pool and I was having a hard time focusing on the ball like three glasses of wine yeah that's all it takes three glasses of wine I'm having a hard time seeing all right it took like cuz everything's all just a little off it took like an hour before my liver processed it enough where I could play pool well again do you think you just lost your your tolerance tolerance yeah for sure yeah I mean I never never been a big drinker anyway but it was interesting doing sets that's what's always interested it sound like a shot before I go onstage I always like to do a shot of Jack yeah we're going to say just whoa music for you a little bit of whiskey Wow big show just one shot yeah yeah Brian Regan one shot of frozen peppermint schnapps before he goes peach schnapps it gives you like this yeah yeah but it's not necessary no no it's definitely not I mean I did a lot of shows this month stone-cold sober but it's um is it weird though the human condition that we're born with this set of you know this brain and this these neurological pathways and this relationship to the universe and the people around us and that we want to whether it's smoking pot or drinking or taking opiates we want to change the natural state of our brain yeah isn't that fucking weird because it's all we talk about all people talk about do what jus last week dude we got fucked up I changed my brain I made myself dumber all week and I made myself dumber get a bunch of stupid shit I should have never done stupid shit yeah because in our natural state we don't do goofy shit enough right but then I learned when I quit drinking that I could be just as crazy people didn't realize I quit I've been hanging out with my same friends in the same bars till 4:00 in the morning we'd go to a wedding I'd be the last guy on the dance floor first guy on the dance floor and I just was like you know this doesn't have to change me you know yeah you can just enjoy fun you just enjoyed fun it takes a little bit more of I think you have to sort of break through walls a little bit more as opposed to just the booze does that for you yeah but you can still get there dad's a good way of looking at it the one one thing that I found it affects my writing marijuana is like steroids for writing oh my goodness really free like oh my goodness yeah yeah just dude this weekend soon as I started getting high again I'm fucking my notebook full no she was crazy ideas yeah man half more dog shit first yeah yeah half of them at least have them half would be you're doing pretty well it's pretty good right yeah but I got a few that I'm like oh there's something in this there's something in this one definitely something in this one so is it like after the show you get high and then you ready where you do it during the day well I didn't do any shows this weekend because I was in New York for the UFC and I had some friends that I was gonna see why I was down there my friend Tommy so I was playing pool with him uh-huh and Hinchcliffe came with me to he plays pool too I just decided to not do comedy this weekend I'm like I'm here for the UFC I only get a chance to see Tommy it's like one of my good friends from fucking 25 years ago more 28 years ago maybe yeah I might know him for almost 30 years I've known him for fucking ever you know we've become old men together yeah but uh you know we get together and play pool too like 2 o'clock in the morning I haven't had a chance to do that forever I don't really get a chance to do it once a year when I see him so I decided not to do any shows but just while we were playing I was just getting all these ideas generally I like writing at night when everyone's asleep that's my favorite time to write I like to come home from the store and I sit around with the laptop and they're just writing mm-hmm just force myself to use right for an hour so just just write just freeform just get it all down yeah I have a subject to start I don't try to write like in joke form I try to write like essays and then I try to extract ideas out of those and then turn those in the material yeah yeah that's the way to do it it's like it's like I I see this thing called the writer's way which is this great great way that if you're not just for writing but just to get your creativity flowing and one of the things you do is you get out of bed in the morning and you don't have your coffee you just take a piss you don't have take a piss you can shit like if you want a shit you can shit you know loud - you're allowed to shit okay as a matter of fact I think that probably helps a lot No oh yeah you don't want the shit inside we're trying to write also what better feeling than your anus like Reap uh curd after delivering like that it's just a little halo over the log floating in the water yeah and then you sit down and you write for you write three pages non-stop you don't let the pen stop and then you go about your day and you get out it's amazing what your subconscious will get out when you just keep the pen flowing and like you said a lot of it's garbage but within it there's gonna be a couple kernels that are good yeah that's how creativity works with me I mean I'm not I'm not a consistent hitter I'm not a 500 hitter in terms of creativity yes if I get half half is amazing have to be maybe 500 is amazing yeah you know most of its garbage yeah sometimes I go back and just like just it gets frustrating reading so much shit I wrote yeah why what the fuck but I know what I'm doing like when I'm writing I'm just trying to see if I could dig some out yeah I'm just like I'm out there with a metal detector yeah do you do to do it you know all right some guy just found some fucking incredible ancient treasure using a metal detector really yeah see fine see if we can find that Jamie Shh yeah yeah I want to say fuck what era was it from shipwright no no that was a different one that was that was a guy yeah that was a crazy one - a guy found a fucking shipwreck that was on the beach that was exposed by a crazy storm like a storm came along and it pulled away so much of the sand that a fucking shipwreck was there yeah those guys they're walking his dog he's like um what the fuck is this this is a boat yeah yeah that's crazy I hear it is it's what is that three million pounds is that pounds war horde of six thousand gold artifacts from 650 ad uncovered in Staffordshire field using a $2 metal to pound metal detector a metal detector for $2 Wow is that pounds of euros what is that one I think that's pretty compounds so from 650 ad so 650 years after Jesus is murdered shit look at that shit look how gorgeous that is still get the fur on the top we're looking at a gold helmet this really intricate carved gold helmet with a fucking like a mohawk a fur mohawk look at the detail I wasn't corroded at all in that salt water all those years yeah that's pretty amazing where's Staffordshire was it it said it was in a field mmm right this wasn't so this wasn't salt water oh my God look how beautiful that shit is that's amazing a scabbard boss oh man you know that what a boss it what is a boss a scabbard boss what does that mean which is part of an anglo-saxon horde found by Terry Herbert Terry's ballin right now yeah Terrell Terry what did Terry do did he sell it I mean do you keep snot you got to keep some of it are you a lot what happens they're sold to museums for 3.28 five million with the funds were split between them he use a metal detector Oh in the field of farmer Fred Johnson also they split it him and Fred split it out so they both got a million and a half not bad but sounds two dollars it's not the same take a second buck 20 so he's super born yeah eighty percent of the items identified were fittings weapons mostly swords and research believe it's remarkable so many were made up from gold Wow 9 pounds of gold included were 50 incredible rare gold sword pommels as well as parts of a golden helmet fucking-a man the golden ages period of anglo-saxon england literally this was a period when gold was suddenly much more available and was converted into beautiful objects for the warrior elite wonder why was more available what what makes gold more available did they figure out how to pull it out of ground or something they hadn't started grabbing it from other countries yet I guess that was their own local gold look at this in the quotation on and look at this collection includes his believed a battle shrine with a processional I don't know what that word means processional cross suggesting Christian emblems were used as Goodluck charms for battle on it is a quotation from the book of number which reads rise up Lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee boy yeah when you'd love to hear people talk back then yeah right it probably was so confusing like Game of Thrones they talk like us but they didn't talk about Jess yeah they had some weird lingo back then well the game of throws is obviously fake but it was supposed to be a long time ago right yeah and I'm sure they research I mean everything about that show was so authentic I'm sure they went back and tried to find the way people spoke at that time well not really the record is not really about a time it's about a Fantasyland well it was I think it was the War of the Roses it was based on which was I think around the first century wasn't it yeah but they got fuckin the dark knights and yeah white knights or what oh yeah no they mixed a lot of it to get King but I think there was a point where the where the the the British Empire was divided into whatever it was five or six different oh yeah that we're all fighting for the throne apparently no they're gonna do a pre-cool now like those guys that were not gonna do it they were gonna cancel it but they're gonna do it now I heard it got canceled yeah I really got cancelled yeah but there was just something a couple of days ago that said they're they're doing preview hundreds of years before that's about the Targaryen 's that's awesome fuck yeah get back after it you fucks come on gang and give me anything the thing about that show is they kill everybody so they could always have new people yeah they fucking kill everybody remember the red wedding holy shit here you go HBO finally issued a statement on the canceled it's canceled thumbs down what's sorry what what do they say what's their statement they're bringing back Arles so they need space that's why you want an Emmy ladies and gentlemen that's right it what is the statement do they have a good a good excuse what could they're good excuse me we suck and we hate money just as they decide not to move forward fuck out of here well part of the problem is that who's the guy that wrote all the they wrote the books that it was based on and he wrote the first George Martin George Martin wrote all them until they got to the last season at last two seasons and then he ran out of steam and that's why they weren't as good people say that last season wasn't as good as the rest because it was the the two show runners that it did it I thought the last season was excellent up until the last episode last episode was kind of like how do we end this yeah let's meet the guy in the wheelchair King yeah let's make him gay - yeah it's just come on man yeah you know yeah they didn't they didn't you know and you think about the last episode of any show is gonna get a lot remember how much shit Seinfeld got for the last episode cuz they didn't do anything and Game of Thrones did the same thing they've they punted yeah they didn't go for anything right yeah the beautiful thing about news radios last episodes we didn't know it was our last episode mmm it was the only time we ever thought we were gonna get picked up ocean that was how many seasons five the ratings were good yeah last season we're like we did pretty good yeah day like fuck it's over why probably cos filled with dead yeah you know and love it's came back and love its replace to fail but how many seasons was that just one yes the final season yeah maybe I mean who knows it was also the problem with the news radio was news radio was not owned by NBC okay so it was one of those shows where that we moved at least eight times during the five years we were on the air your time slot yeah just always moving and this before the internet so you couldn't tell people it's not like you could tweet hey news radio is gonna be on Monday at eight o'clock but you don't give a fuck because you have a DVR right just DVR right no was you you found it when it was on yeah if you were lucky and they didn't advertise that much you know I was like this radio moving to Friday at 8:00 you know it's like it just wouldn't move around we moved all over the floor was it inbc NBC yeah do you ever have a good lead-in sometimes one time we were on the Thursday night which was the big Seinfeld and friends and we crashed it yeah we were like number two in the world is that how they launched you where that no no no I don't remember how we launched I don't remember but I remember one time we were on Thursday and everybody was so excited maybe on Thursday we'll be right after Caroline the shitty yeah I used to call Caroline say yeah it was a few of those shows like the single guy like what is this and you walked on forever because they were owned by someone or not either NBC or someone who had a deal with NBC Warner Brothers or whoever it was you know that's the weird thing about like television shows you can last forever if you have a good lead-in and there's someone good after you because people just slackjaw it and keep that TV on yeah all right that's how it used to be at least now I think that models kind of out the window no now they take that that sweet spot after their number one show and they try to launch something they'll put something they like in there to get it legs and once it's good they try to create that and want that to be the lead in for another show it's like you fuck it's like baseball managing baseball right well who the fuck would mean like who's watching TV with commercials now like who's sitting there and actually watching TV with commercials like how much time do you have and do you not know that there are so many shows that you could watch that don't have commercials yeah and you could just watch those and record that one and then come back and watch them when it doesn't have commercials or fast-forward through the commercials yeah or just get Hulu yeah we pay $10 a month and watch the history of television from pilots I go back and watch pilots on Hulu that's the fuckin greatest dude the taxi pilot I just watched recently I forgot about taxi the taxi pilot was so fucking heartwarming it was oh my god it was about Alex Krieger had a daughter that he hadn't seen he was estranged from and he was basically like a deadbeat dad and it was about him reconnecting with her and the second half of the episode was all of them in a fucking New York taxi driving down to Florida so he could meet his daughter nowadays it has to be like all right what's the simplest most basic storyline that lets you you got to get to know each character each relationship to great two or three great act breaks there's so much criteria that go into the structure of it there's no room for anything where's the diversity where University def diversity where's the inclusiveness right inclusivity was the message was yeah yeah yeah you can't just make a white well you mean he kind of can Curb Your Enthusiasm is still that HBO yeah but the network's haven't done much well the network's did cool stuff that's like the office 30 rock was kind of interesting well the dumbest thing in the network's for sure are the presidential debates the fact that they take these people that are running for the most important job in the fucking known universe and they we're out of time thank you thank you mr. senator Thank You mr. senator we're out of time thank you miss congresswoman thank you thank you mrs. congresswoman you're out of time right all right yep in 80 seconds - just fucking spill out as many words and get your point across and try to go viral yeah yeah and the worst part is then you got like the the the also-rans that are like on the edge of the they got the last podium on the left the guys like the mayor of Dayton and he's trying to get headlines by taking a shot at the real candidate hurts the Democratic Party hook you know she just makes the main guy look bad because he's so they got us they got a window down the field I think couple people just dropped out bait O'Rourke just dropped out shocking yeah I thought that guy had King written all over him at the beginning at the beginning he never did but he was this guy that he got hot from running against hoody run against Ted Cruz in Texas Texas of all places he's running against the guy who's a fucking you know arch-conservative mm-hmm and he comes out is is bleeding-heart liberal and almost wins and it's like all the sudden Texas is not a red state it's starting to become like a purple state Purple's a good word for it well Austin's very weird right Austin is this super blue area hmm in a red state yeah but it's also got a lot of cowboys and guns and barbecue yeah it's such a great place fuckin great place this is one of the best places on earth yeah really is and people figured that out too you go there and the fucking traffic is absurd yeah you're like what why are you all here yeah oh you found out it's awesome there's a there's a great place to shoot pool they're called the Jackalope Jaqueline jack-o'-lantern Jackalope and it's just like you just go in there and fucking everybody says hi hey you want to shoot a game let me buy you beer excellent great fuckin music on the jukebox and I love that place yeah it's not well they're a little yeah I mean they're kind of aware that it's supposed to be kind of cool so they act a little cool like you know keep Austin weird those t-shirts by the way if you wear one of those fucking t-shirts those keep Austin weird t-shirts you're a part of the problem you're not weird you know you know weird and you're if you're selling them you're a piece of shit you just you're fucking it all up you found this spot you're fucking doing those those Hollywood lights you know when they have a premiere yeah yeah I'm ruin it let's make a documentary about why it's cool when I first started going there though man I was just stunned I was like what a cool fucking place people are educated and aware but also southern yeah they have a southern accent a Texas accent but they're also educated and very friendly and open-minded it's a very unique place and great fucking music yeah there yeah I'm playing I'm going to cap city oh shit one of my favorite clubs it's great the only club I did this whole year like on the road oh no shit really yeah Wow I just said I'm going there yeah cuz I was about four or five months after my special and I just put together an hour that I could kind of go on the road with yeah you know and I'm like this is good let's go to cap city bang out two shows a night yeah yeah it's just a great place man it's a fun place like I've had so much fun there yeah like that that Club is just it's got fun soaked into the floorboards hmm you know it's like just a fun it's a club where I mean so many great comics that perform there and say they got good taste yeah you know yeah they curate good shows I mean they get they get all kinds of comedy like Maria Bamford will be there one week and the next week it'll be fuckin Doug Stanhope or something like that it's just you know they're all over the place but it's not downtown though that's the only thing is you got to take a little uber into town it's about yeah five ten minutes out yeah but it's at nighttime it's fine the real problem there is rush hour or they have a real rush hour now yeah they didn't have a real rush hour ten years ago yeah ten years ago you get around in Austin there's no issue I think it's where young kids get out of college now and when they used to go to San Francisco now they go to Austin yeah there's a lot of tech startups yeah there's a lot of the tech business yeah I mean on it's there too there's a lot of shit there on it's there yeah unless you move on it on it Jim's there as well hold the factories there everything's there yeah you go there much nothing often ya know maybe once a year no board meetings you have to be stoned stop looking at your watch so check in your fucking phone check out my Instagram yeah let's see if anybody posted a good Epstein didn't kill himself me Oh fucking Epstein man what a story what a story and so now what did they say that it looks like he was chin more dead yeah his brother hired a real fucking autopsy guy to check it out including that guy Michael badan from that HBO autopsy show that guy said he was murdered you know who dinged um you remember that show HBO autopsy now it was a great show that was on basically pre-internet well you would watch these wacky fucking stories of like people that got busted murdering people by this this one really good autopsy coroner and this coroner dr. Michael Baden one of the ones I'll never forget he took this one lady he was in love with this lady and she died and he stole her corpse and had it in his house and it put a tube where her vagina was and he'd bought cases and cases of perfume because she was rotting in his bed and he would just douse her and perfume and keep fucking her dude and he put a tube in her vagina so that he didn't collapse well he put a tube there so he could fuck the tube he put a fuck hole in this dead lady's body yeah yeah oh my god dude and apparently it was like the smell was insane yeah like horrific and this guy one of the I think one of the ways they were suspicious like why is this motherfucker buying cases of perfume yeah but he put a mask over her face and you know just like just the fact that it used to be her yeah was enough all right forget his deal I think I want to say he was a doctor that was and she was a patient of his and he was in love with her huh yeah just some dude who just had a fucking major fuse blow yeah it just goes to show you don't know who it's gonna be it's it's not just some derelict on the street could be your fucking doctor Oh doctors are just humans man yeah they're just humans and a lot of them have access to drugs because of the fact that they're doctors there was a book called dead doctors don't lie and it was basically the gist of the book was that a lot of people are dealing with mineral deficiencies and that mineral deficiencies were will it's by a guy named dr. Joel Wallach it's a controversial book and his ideas are fairly controversial but they're not controversial in the sense that like in animal husbandry in in agriculture animal agriculture people are very aware that you need to supplement the diet of a lot of animals with minerals like for instance like so some of the places where I huh they don't they don't bait animals right these are wild animals that are in these giant ranches but when they have like there's a place in Utah that I go to it's like 270,000 acres huge place but every you know fucking mile or so they scatter they'll put these mineral licks and it's a mineral lick so that the the deer and the elk get minerals in their diet hmm because animals like desperately need minerals and sometimes they don't get enough of it from their diet and particularly from foods where the the ground is deficient in minerals like when you like say if you have like if you're growing corn mono crops is what they call mono crop agriculture you grow in corn on like fucking 700 acres just growing corn well when they till that land like every year that that land has less minerals like you're not supposed to grow the same thing in the same place forever right and the places that are doing it right they do what's called regenerative agriculture and there's a real good argument for that's one of the reasons why you like it's good to raise grass-fed cattle in these areas because the manure from the cattle actually is a great fertilizer it was good and you and also you know scraps from food fish and different things you need nitrate you need nitrogen and that nitrogen is very difficult to get you know when you want to put it into the ground for fertilizer and all these other different minerals phosphorus yeah all kinds of shit you have to add that stuff to the soil yeah because the topsoil has been so eroded from continuous over farming and that his contention was that most of us when even if you're eating like you know vegetables and you know you're getting stuff at the grocery store you're getting things that are mineral e deficient they're not optimally mineralized that's word I don't think but there's not like so I take colloidal minerals it's just a liquid form of minerals like minerals that come from there's a type of water that's like very rich in mineral water that it's called glacial milk and basically what it is is the runoff from glaciers that it carries an incredible amount of minerals in it to the point where if the water actually kind of looks kind of milky and you can get that in some places some places and on earth people their water actually looks like that because it's got so many minerals in it yeah these people have like dark hair and the you know there's health benefits are attributed to that right I'm not smart enough to know whether or not that's accurate but there's definitely some benefits and health benefit to taking minerals right people go to mineral spas I mean it was always the that was the miracle elixir elixir yeah do you see any minerals are taking glacial milk yeah freshwater meets glacial milk in Iceland look at that that crazy damn so that stuff on the right is just fucking overwhelmingly packed with minerals they just bottle that Shin I think you know you probably could get too many minerals too I mean there's always like the balance what is it what is a good intake like I don't take shit I think sometimes I take vitamin D vitamin D is good especially for a white fellow like yourself you're not getting enough Sun right right that's why I take good and that's it d3 that's all I take d3 is very good I take B I take D I take I take multivitamins I take what this call it's a company called pure pure encapsulations and they have a a sleet pure pack it's very nice because it's real simple will pack it I take not a sponsor take this packet just bring them with me on the road open it up and just take those it's just and then I also take there's a there's a company called athletic greens and they make a really good supplement that I pour into water and it's very easy and it's got a bunch of different shit vitamins and metals that is a sponsor yeah that's good that's good too because it's its whole food based it's not there's nothing synthesized it's all based on food but I think you have you really should take something you know I mean it's so hard to make sure that you're getting all the vitamins that you from your food especially when you go on the road yeah on the road it's you know unless you know you're getting a you eating a really good organic restaurant we're getting high quality vegetable high quality meat right it's hard hotels have gotten a lot better man in our lifetime hotel food used to be garbage how about Airport Airport from the airport food's gotten great way better got lemonade's in there yeah you can get real food at the airport yeah yeah I'm that's a that's a big issue man it's a big issue for people that go on the road because you know you're on the road like three four days in the road eating fucking jack-in-the-box you start feeling like shit oh yeah and then if you're I mean comedy club food in 50 years has not gotten any better it's deep fried chicken wings and except comedy magic club comedy magic second club food give you a fucking serious restaurant steak there you could go there and eat a legit excellent dinner Oh what am I saying yeah yeah yeah I've had plenty of dinners they're very good right they do have good ice houses good burgers too yeah ice house was very good burgers uh-huh um but comedy magic love's probably the tops you know it's good to is hilarities and cleveland they got The Pickwick and frolic restaurant upstairs yes I was a restaurant I was just there really yeah we went to see Jessie Mae means Santino Jessie Mae was playing at hilarities and we were over at we were at this arena so we came down and saw Jessie Mae and I had a prime rib it was fuckin yeah it's good right very good very good Nick Costas runs that place since you've got food poisoning no oh boy yes he did we don't know where he got it I'm assuming it was the vegetables I mean that's a lot of times where people get it you get it from things aren't washed properly you're gonna sit out like they say that a large percentage of food poisoning cases are salad yeah I could see that as handled wrong not washed correctly yeah you know a lot of people when they get e-coli they get it from salad because the runoff from animal agriculture runoff from the shit animal shit gets it yeah water the water get some of this the lettuce or the spinach is a big one spent a lot of people well that's why if you go to a third world country you don't trust the water stay away from the salad oh yeah that's the first thing I say is don't eat lettuce in a third world country good point Yeah right like meat is meat right as long as it's seared on the outside you're golden oh yeah look at Anthony bar Dan would he would Chris go to fucking Vietnam and go to a street meat shop where there's no running water and he just gobble down some fucking whatever meat you know what meat it was well they used to drink wine when people would travel to prevent travellers illness mm-hmm because they didn't want to drink water cuz if you drank what look he found out fucking a pond somewhere and he try to suck some water out of it yeah like back then it wasn't a lot you mean you got to boil it that's it yeah you know nowadays you can get they have a bunch of different things you could do to water if you find it like you could take water out of a fucking elk wallow you know in an elk wallow and now it's like a puddle that elk piss in and they wallow around in it and they get their scent on it especially when they're running when they're having sex with the female elk they get in there and they piss all over the water and they roll around in it and so you get this muddy puddle and sometimes hikers like if you're on some serious fucking Trek you know you're doing like the Appalachian Trail or something like that yeah water scarce you can't find a creek you got to take the water out of an elk wallow I have friends that have done that and you throw it through some filters what they do is they'll take it and they'll throw it through filters well they'll put it through a biological filter first so there's like a filter that it's like a pump but the problem is with those those pumps can get clogged up because they're basically taking the sediment and they and then they're filtering it out and then you get the water afterwards it still tastes like piss yeah because there's piss in it you're drinking piss you're just drinking pissed it's not contaminated with something that can kill you so then a lot of times guys even after that it takes something called a SteriPEN you ever heard of a stereo stare is short for sterilization pen and it uses some kind of light foot pull pull up SteriPEN feet I don't want to say this wrong but utilizing some sort of light some sort of forget what kind of light what is it UV light UV light and you you keep it in the water for a certain amount of time it just nukes everything kills everything but still that's amazing tastes like piss so you drink and piss yeah you definitely drinking piss so a lot of times guys will take like they sell these different there's a SteriPEN so that little thing with that light you spin it around inside your your glass of water and depending upon the amount of ounces a certain amount of time but it's not that much time shockingly it's like 10 minutes and sometimes guys even throw iodine tablets in water too like the whole deal is just kill anything they can fuck you up and just get over the fact that it's gonna taste like piss and then they also take like there's a bunch of companies like it's a company called Mountain ops they have stuff that like you throw into the water to make the water taste better own if you drink a glass of that if you saw a female elk and she started presenting you'd get hard you get hard as a rock I think you'd probably want to suck and helps dick you probably gave four out no no it's not gay if it's an animal oh yeah right yeah interesting it's um yeah they should get those into third-world countries some version of that to help people drink water yes yeah yeah well they definitely do they definitely do get filters and different things like that into certain countries you know where we're involved with fight for the Forgotten it's my good buddy Justin Ren he's got a charity where they build wells for the pygmies in the Congo oh wow and through this podcast and through this company a company called the cash app they've raised thousands and thousands of dollars and built a bunch of wells they're in the process of building them now and we've donated a bunch of money to that's amazing it's very cool but yeah my point being this motherfucker was just here last week and he's got a parasite they can't even identify yeah and he's had it for six months and he gets so fucked up like sometimes he works out and then he gets to the point where his his body turns pale and he starts shaking and shivering and they have to get him into a shower like yeah dude they don't even know what it is like they think do you remember what he said it was they think it was a type of parasite intestines like Lyme's disease recently yeah everybody a few things yeah what have you had no idea they think it's in his brain whatever it is yeah and he's been on heavy heavy heavy antibiotics and of course one thing that comes with heavy antibiotics and particularly something called cipro is you you don't just get sick from that you also get your ligaments become very very lacks and they get weak and a lot of people that come off antibiotics for a long period of time they are subject to injuries like athletes when they get staph infection they put you on this heavy dose of antibiotics but all your ligaments get weakened the end up tearing your ACL okay you know Terry he's got both of his shoulders are torn and he thinks is probably a connection to the antibiotics that he had to take to deal with the staff or to deal with whatever the fuck this um this infection is that he's got some very very strange parasite the heat goes so deep in the Congo it might be an unidentified parasite and it's part of the problem is that he's basically like a fucking lab rat right now and he's got malaria three different times not once not twice three clubs yeah fucking malaria three times did he he didn't take the anti malarial stuff it's still well here one of the things he got it and then he said the anti malaria shit is so bad and it's it's it's so rough on you that some people would prefer to get malaria and get it treated huh and what was the stuff that he said that you get there's a toxic sickness that he got from malodor and what the fuck was it called I think that word melodium alodia --m there's a type of anti malaria medication that they give to particularly soldiers and they find that these guys it's fucking incredibly toxic and they found it in his brain they found that he's got he's suffering from poisoning from this anti-malaria medication Wow he was on like really high doses of this shit too if you live somewhere like that you're supposed to be taking it all the time constantly what the fuck you know when they built the the mmm the Panama Canal they went down there the French tried to dig it for like 50 fucking years and they drew it and like flies from the Millea they didn't know was from malaria they had no idea what was going on they just knew people were getting sick while they were trying to I mean the scope of that project at that time was insane I mean they were hand digging a fucking canal from I mean through like thick jungle in the middle of the country in the middle of the country and they were just people were getting sick and then they would and eventually France after 50 years said fuck it and then they just left and then for some reason we bought it we're like we can do it throw it down there MEF low Queen methylene that sounds like a queef she metal cleaned so we show up and they realize one billet for some bits pellets bailed out and I put it up put it up there again so we get a mellow queen meth flow queen sold under the brand names larium that's what I've heard of her medication to prevent or treat malaria it's used to pretend to start a potential exposure and continue for several weeks after potential exposure and then people get sick off of that stuff yeah doesn't it that's definitely okay it seems wrong like the name team trip doesn't it that's what I looked up I know but it just didn't seem right to you it seems wrong to me I don't know so I'm sure it's right but it just so we go in and some genius goes it's the fucking mosquitoes it's we're getting an infection from the mosquitoes so they've simply got rid of standing water they just started finding they had teams of people every day would go out and they find puddles and they would get rid of the puddles and the milady they went from going like I'm telling you one out of three people was dying trying to dig this tunnel and they went to almost nobody dying do you know malaria has killed some insane number of people we looked it up once I think the rumor is it's killed half the people who have ever died every have been killed by malaria Wow yeah that was what I had heard I think it's less than that that they can that they can definitely determine was killed by malaria but nevertheless it's a daggering they're humans those little dirty mosquitos yeah I think we can get rid of them right yeah they're trying to do that they're trying to genetically engineer mosquitoes that don't carry malaria and then they're also thinking that you know this is really dangerous really dangerous that they could just get rid of mosquitoes period but the problem with that is man you don't know how all that shit's connected and what happens if you get rid of mosquitoes so that the beetles take over the beetles start carrying diseases they start biting people like what morphs like a mosquito wasn't always a mosquito this must be understood right a mosquito at one point time was a single-celled organism just like us and then it became a mosquito and found a really good niche right it's like this fucking mosquito business is the shit right yeah it's like fast food yeah I can't go wrong mosquito business is awesome sure they fucking go crazy yeah all they need is a little bit of water and any living thing that they can take a little fucking drop of blood from did you ever go to my when I rented a house and Encino did you ever go to that place I don't think so the thing was before you moved out here when I first moved out here a Wraith have rented this house and Encino nobody lived in it for a couple of years and the the fucking pool had not been taken care of so the pool was green like the Hulk's dick okay and I looked in the pool and it was little things were swimming like schools of fish and I was like what the fuck is this and the pool guy goes Oh bro that's mosquito larva I was like what he goes yeah he goes we gotta kill this now before you literally infect the entire neighborhood with mosquitoes like there was fish no swimming well like filled with mosquito have you ever seen mosquito larvae no it was so disturbing I was like I got to get a hotel he's like no no we can kill we can kill it but they had a poor like fuck if they drain the entire pool and poured out ones and gallons of poison in there they just filled and I couldn't swim in it for like six months or something I don't know but it was so nasty you could see this little fucker swimming yeah like schools of fish that's amazing like little schools down there Wow No water yes standing water man that's all it takes that's why you gotta have a fountain you little fucking bubbles running through it we are so so lucky when it comes to bugs out here right now we got no bugs no bugs what we got we got termites that's the only thing that they're they're fucking insidious yeah we built a fence around our house took like six weeks they put it in and and six months later there's fucking like little university shavings from the vet powder on them I'm like you motherfuckers brought termite infested wood to my house I know it's in my house all set the wood yeah might say yeah can you sue I'm probably I'm not really a sewer what are you just a guy who gets sad when things happen don't say that I'm Irish yeah I'm an arsonist I find the next project he's gonna do take it down so they brought wood that had termites in it yeah for sure well the wood had fucking termites in it contact the contractor yeah I don't even remember this was like 15 years ago whatever it is fence still there yeah but it's like I tried to screw something into it the other day it wouldn't hold the fucking screw it's like powder underneath the whole thing needs to be ripped down you could run through that fends like the hole yeah yeah we're not keeping anybody else the hi-c guy meeting at my house the kool-aid guy right hey kool-aid remember that yeah ever happened the kool-aid guy they just stopped that campaign that was a huge campaign he ran through the fucking house everywhere yeah kids were his sitting there boy I'm thirsty yeah picture with a face on it runs right through your house you kids want a fucking bucket of sugar with some water in it boy was that delicious though oh yeah I had some kool-aid a couple years ago I ate at this place in what's that shitty town in California Fresno there's a place called goddamnit I followed them on Instagram it's a soul food place in Fresno trying remember Paul's kitchen is that it chef Paul's cafe dude you know sometimes you're in the road you find a place that's just fucking off the chart yeah but if you're in Fresno ladies and gentlemen chef Paul's cafe I fucking give it two thumbs oh shit five stars full-on soul food like fucking collard greens ox tails like phenomenal food and they also had kool-aid ah okay well obviously I'm going all-in I got to get the kool-aid to I hadn't had kool-aid in probably a decade isn't that a sell food thing kool-aid I don't know is their menu thing yeah they had a bunch of crazy shit on the menu but that's it right there but you know it's a great restaurant in a sketchy town yeah Fresno sketchy as fuck I mean you got like like we were driving down the street there's like homeless community Skid Row style look at that food dude seriously chicken and waffles yeah oh my god their food is so good their fried chickens off the charts but the oxtail I had oxtail there's chicken and waffles oh that looks good it's so good man that place is amazing and it's just super super authentic like down-home like real hearty comfort food there's that kool-aid right there baby kool-aid on the menu I mean why not man just get all the flavors when you're at a place like that right don't drink water you asshole get all the flavors get yourself some kool-aid get yourself some kool-aid well that's what Red Bull is isn't it's just kool-aid Red Bull has taurine in it and taurine is actually originally from bull come really yes taurine is a stimulant that's derived from bulges and Hitler used to actually take bull come I think I found that out from Tom Popeye was I who told how someone told me that and we googled it I was like what like they figured out a way to synthesize it but taurine is one of the actual ingredients in bulges yeah so people used to take bulges as some sort of a stimulant I guess here it is Heil Hitler oh hi Hitler medical records show fewer are Adolf a cocaine addict and was injected with bull semen to help his sex life he also took steroids he took a lot of testosterone he suffered from flatulence known to break wind during meals with his generals no they all ratted him out I wonder if you say to a guy who's killing millions of Jews that was offensive yeah but smell is offense and your farts are worse than what you've done right you guessed them your guys on us now well he was a vegetarian too Lizzie yeah if you eat a lot of vegetables again broccoli farts yeah they're famous oh yeah because your body's breaking down all that fiber yeah yeah I think it has something to do also with the the vegetables are breaking down faster than the meat if you eat meat and vegetables and they get caught in your intestine that's where you get pockets of gas the meats blocking it up for minting yeah steaming up creating gas yeah dude I've been farting phenomenally I enjoy farting do you and my wife laughs at it thank God we wouldn't still bring it over oh yeah you don't even let her know it's coming no it's it's an it's I will walk in the room with a fart because she laughs at me I don't know what it is she thinks it's funny every fucking time I fart yeah she is and she farts she wishes she could fart as much as I do but when she does she lets me know our family does the whole family for son farts at the dinner table we all laugh yeah we're very open about it but do you think that that's gonna carry on to his next relationship I hope so I hope so too but it's hard to find a gal that's down with that I think you got to make him down with it you see easy man you start with a little one and then gently you just you know if they smell you take it in the other room but if it's just a and you know your cycle usually know what's in the tank same time the Fritos ones sometimes you don't sometimes you think you're floating an air biscuit and you let on a bomb yeah yeah yeah whenever I'm getting on a plane I try I try to get a few out before I get on the plane when I'm on that that ramp you know it's weird this is really strange I mean really strange and not a lot of people are aware of this when you are around certain smells like if you're like say if you're butchering an animal okay we save you shot an animal in the field and you're hunting and you cut it up and you the smells that come from that animal will be in your farts even if you don't eat it Wow it's weird no shit it's weird and I I recognize this but I was confused by it and then it was brought up to me by friends that are hunting guides in Alberta my friends John and Jen the rivets they've got this guide service and one of the things they hunt is bears and bear is delicious but you have to cook it right because you can get trichinosis it's like pork same kind of deal but they smell like they're their guts and like when you're butchering them like a lot of times people use what's called the gutless method it means you you take all the meat out without opening up the gut cavity because if you do get that stuff on you like it's but specifically if they've been eating something that's rotten the smells horrible that smell comes out in your farts and one of their daughters canceled school she stayed home because she was farting so bad she was like I can't go to school farting like this yeah I will be a pariah but I smelt it she farted someone's like did you have bear yeah like if I've shot a deer in the field and you're you're it's called quartering it you got it you take out the heart and the liver you eat the heart in the liver you take out the heat a quarter it you take like the the limbs off you take like the legs off and you take the meat off the back it's called the back straps and the tenderloins you take all that stuff out and then when you fart you fucking smell that animal in your farts Wow and this was addressed actually by my friend Steve Rinella on the show of meat-eater they were trying to figure out why like they're like okay this is a real thing right like everybody talks about this like how is it getting in you you're smelling it and then somehow another those molecules come out giggle all the way through your body from you smelling it and breathing in that air and comes out in your farts and you smell this horrific like gut smell sounds like a good game show you know you go into a room and you come out and the contestants have to guess what animal you just call lamb I wonder if that's the case I mean it must be the case with fish too like you catch a bunch of fish you got them and then you probably smell fish farts when you're farting you probably smell like fish but the weird thing is it would make sense of your eating it right if you cooked it and ate it that would make sense but this is I'm telling you this is farting when you've had none of it yet you haven't eaten any of it but your fart yeah you smell it I think I fart I think you fart from getting nervous also like if you're a nervous person I think you fart a lot that makes sense right your gut starts building all the juices and stuff yeah here's farts can fight strokes heart attacks and dementia side that's that girl she farts at your face you don't get a heart attack babies get a hot chick and the study has proven that farts can help your cells to live what what sulfur hydrogen sulfide there you go is well known as a pungent foul-smelling gas and rotten eggs and flatulence it is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a health care hero with significant implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases you imagine if all those weirdos that pay women to fart in their face if they're on to something right those women are heroes those are the most confusing porn videos I've never seen that what guys are like laying there at girls like you looked at fart you dirty bitch and they fart in the face yeah mommy give me that fart mommy and they fart in their face oh it's so fucking it's so confusing it makes me shut my laptop and walk around the block that's fuckin great I've seen a bunch of those you never see anyone else no I've never seen it I'm just trying to figure out who the first guy was that had the balls to just go like smelling a fart and going I think this is it I think this is my you know for some people it's its feet you know right some people it's farts Wow if that's a thing with guys farting in the face the sump some people like a lot of weird shit like I had this girl on the podcast back in the day and it actually made me sad talking to her her name is Ciara Lynch remember her um cuz like I was like what what she's selling her piss she sells like toenail clippings dirty socks dirty underwear all these guys and then she humiliates these guys they want her to humiliate them and the the worst she treats if she's what I believe she refers to it she's a very smart girl very pretty too she refers to herself as a humiliate tricks like it's like that's her business right she bought a fucking house like she's wealthy because of getting these guys to buy her shit and piss yeah very strange I think I got a new nickname for my wife but I I met this prostitute in Lake Tahoe she had come to my show and she was like you know in Nevada it's it's all legal and so she I go what's the weirdest client that you ever had and she goes well I don't know if you're ready for this but I met this guy and he lived in Colorado and he had been in in Nevada liked her said she said she's up for anything sends a jet to take her to Colorado oh Jesus they go to Denver to some five-star hotel come up to the suite Presidential Suite and they come in she's like I have no idea what this is about and he goes now this is gonna be weird but it's not gonna hurt you just go with it room service shows up guys got a tray he's got four plates of hamburger meat uncooked just hamburger meat tips the guy leaves and he says what I want you to do is take this meat I'm gonna get naked and you're gonna take handfuls of it and shove it up my ass five pounds of hamburger he just stood there and she kept stuffing it up stuffing out no erection no sex no touching her and then back on the jet back to Nevada so he's a wealthy guy you you paid her a ton of money oh my god [Music] I'm surprised but I'm not surprised like if you said would you bet your life that there's a guy out there that sent a private jet to get a prostitute and take her to a nice restaurant and then paid her to stuff hamburger meat up his ass if you're wrong you die yeah I go yeah pay nothing right a million monkeys typing you know I mean I'm not I'm not I'm surprised but I'm not stunned right I'm not like no way I don't believe that yeah I believe it well and the the the funny thing is like I don't get the sense this guy is on a chatroom talking to other guys that stuff ground beef up their asses this is his thing right that's his this as a personal he's got so much fucking money that his mind just goes to places and he can indulge it he can just go yeah I'll try that what the fuck man and talk about getting diseases oh yeah well there's just an outbreak of is it salmonella yeah from ground beef I think someone died yeah one person died a few other people have been it's been they've been recalled Hey hmm yeah you can get Salmonella anally for sure it's raw you gotta tell your doctor fuckin a what happened well have a seat let's start for the beginning when I was a boy first time started getting hard-ons I sat on a cheeseburger and he said do you think these guys if I shove solid food up my butt would I gain any nutrition from it first of all here's the thing he's answered by Andrew Lee doctor of acupuncture hey fuckface you didn't go to medical school stop calling yourself a doctor doctor of acupuncture is so weird it's like I'm a doctor of comedy yeah you know what I mean all right you practice acupuncture you're not a doctor they don't go to medical school did you know that I didn't know that doctors are doctors a doctor goes to a medical school it's hard you to study you have to do your residency you have to get your fucking degree at a medical school not chiropractors they call themselves doctors yeah but they don't go to medical school at all right at all and they can fuck you up they do those on your neck pull that up so we could read that so answer is things can be absorbed through the membrane through membrane what see this is a separate thread showing you that's people have asked this no I'm saying but listen the way he writes the answer this is how a chiropractor writes it versus a real doctor things that can be absorbed through membrane will bypass the liver when taken through the anus through membrane will bypass the liver through a membrane okay for example various drugs can be taken as through the anus in order to be easier on the liver this is how chiropractors right yeah CCI is writing this is not a guy went to medical school now as the liver no longer needs to filter the drug which makes the drug half as potent and is also hard on the liver this guy's asian how do you know that what's his name Andrew Lee yeah I did not know his name when I said he's Asian I could tell by the way he was right alcohol can cross the cell membrane and thus absorbs very easily into the human body oh how about this my friend his wife is a schoolteacher in Utah and they have a problem in middle school because kids are taking tampons and they're soaking them and rubbing alcohol and stuffing them up their assholes and they're getting high feel yes one kid found out about it but other kids did it and so they had a problem in their fucking school where kids were putting tampons dipping them in rubbing alcohol and stuffing them up there but shout-out to my friend Huey and by the way I don't know how many millions of listeners you have how many people are now gonna do that a lot 40 40 40 40 been going on for a while yeah apparently I didn't know about it until three weeks ago I bet it feels good um nice and cool fine feels good a little bit you know what if you got hemorrhoids oh yeah I'm sure people like that I'm sure there's people that cut themselves and pour alcohol just to feel a sting yeah the definition of a drunk asshole don't be a drunk asshole especially when you're 12 they're fucking warm it's probably so they just they're so desperate that's a good point maybe yes don't you talk number Kitty Dukakis oh yeah she was sober and she can aftershave right it wasn't you have to shave isopropyl yeah that sunk is bright well he kind of was on the way out it it was that and when he sat on a tank with the helmet on yeah that was people like what are you a soldier are you in war plenty of a helmet yeah we're not even at war you piece of shit hey hey Mike Dukakis remember him he was like who did you run against a wasps a Bush senior's wasn't seen yeah yeah yeah I think that was a landslide yeah people weren't down with that it's interesting how some things sink some people like that Howard Dover guy has got to be so fucking confused that Donald Trump got away with that grab him by the pussy thing when all he did was scream remember that guy Sock'em song come fuck look yeah it's helmet with a fucking sticker on that probably sunk them too why say Oh Mike Dukakis in your helmet bro are you gonna go fight for our country get out of here son look at him now you see the picture of them now hammered look at them president go to the one picture above that with the red face look at that how's them fucking Pleasant that guy is like if we did a gig for dick Doherty in New Hampshire yeah if you and that guy will be at the bar yeah you fucking guys is fine well you know I was almost president my wife my fucking wife she's a drinking rubberneck Oh hon this is aftershave no aftershave fucking Aqua Velva my fucking my fuck it suck it sent me a fake head of hair though yeah oh we see the governor I believe he was governor of Massachusetts yeah yeah right who's the governor Massachusetts now weld is it weld or maybe I mean bill was a Republican right yeah that's unusual right David we've had a couple of Massachusetts Republicans like fuckface the Mormon what's his name Romney yeah Romney fuckface Charlie Baker Republican he's a Republican - that's interesting that is interesting well you were talking about Texas in Austin yeah and Massachusetts is a Republican state Boston as a democratic city but it's such a big part of the state that it's like what Austin is to Texas and also like Minneapolis to Minnesota yeah I guess so huh like where would you think the Republicans are in Massachusetts everywhere outside of Boston well I think it's a lot of defense contracts there's a lot of defense money there and I'm dynamics right right I got tricked they tricked me they did I posted one a video is boss town dynamics they were all Bo SST WA dynamics and it was a video of like robots shooting guns and they're kicking the robots and it's hitting these targets perfectly every time like oh my god we're fucked but the thing is it's not that far removed from what the Boston Dynamics robots already do those fucking robots already doing backflips they do backflips yeah they do like parkour they run and jump off things hang on things and then this one was a fake video though was it CGI I think that's what they do how do you trust anything anymore Jesus Christ well we're pretty close to not being able to trust anything and yeah because with those those deep fake generators mm-hmm where they could take you like they'd already done videos with me where they have audio of me saying shit that I would say like a bunch of shit that I would say but I never said it about like chimp armies and all these different things yeah yeah there's a whole website dedicated to that it's just weird man yeah and it's gonna get weirder and weirder with the the stuff that they can do with you you've you seen Kyle Donegan's yeah fucking page yeah crazy god yeah oh my god and his the stuff that he does that's my favorite that's really really funny is the stuff that looks fake it's like he does the Face Swap shit from like the Instagram filters or snapchat or whatever it is but he did a bunch of stuff cuz he was doing a pilot for Comedy Central and thank God they're too fucking stupid to pick it up cuz they would have ruined it cuz he was showing me one that they wouldn't do it was Caitlyn Jenner having sex with Trump he was showing it to me I was crying I was in the greenroom cry goes yeah Comedy Central said no to that one okay what yeah look what they like no it was too edgy yeah they wouldn't get involved in anything trans yeah yeah right right come on that's all I was shocked that on the roast that that she came out and said the shit that she did that was like that was excuse the pun but that was ballsy what did she say I think she still has her balls she says that she still is addicted oh really yeah but she came out and said I love that expression she has her dick welcome to 2019 yeah but done again I did a show with him on Saturday night and he came out on stage and he put he put a laptop in front of his face and there was a big screen and he was doing the characters for the crowd that he usually does like as Instagram oh yeah I've heard he does this yeah it was great how does he do that he just has the video plays I guess the computer is videotaping him and sending it I know it ran through the house threw something in the house system because it was a fuckup it got fucked up Oh but it still worked because he was we were doing a gig at the store on a Friday night and he was supposed to be on right before me but they were like actually let's have Kyle go on after you because apparently his whole thing needs a big setup confirms gender reassignment study but and she confirms gender we hold on put the Becca says Caitlyn Jenner confirms gender reassignment surgery in 2020 interview ok but the problem is she just did an interview recently she said she still has it hmm what is gender reassignment surgery if I could wave a wand over you like a like you think night you I hereby announce you have a vagina I have a vagina yes alright now have a vagina okay I mean look and they're just hopping you on the head with your penis you're clearly a man and you could just say you're a woman why can't you say you have a vagina we're gonna play make-believe let's just play make-believe all the way yeah fuck it yeah because look my friend zubi he was a guest on the podcast he claimed he was a woman for a day and broke the woman's world record and deadlift what did he have to do to qualify not as a woman yep do anything he just you know identify his woman yeah I mean wasn't were you to say that he didn't identify his woman you fucking transphobic piece of shit and I feel bad now should Jesus Christ Greg Jesus we've known each other I just feel I believe I didn't know that you have this in you is my childhood big enough to get canceled I gotta get a little bit more famous and then it can happen yeah I'm more like me who pun God now I think pull up I think that Caitlyn Jenner still has his dick heard it was their fight with a guy that that became a woman and they'd beat the shit out of a woman um you mean MMA boxing or MMA yeah there was yeah she had a few fights the problem was not that she had the fights which um I would never advise anybody to fight someone who used to be a man I would say who probably got a lot of physical advantages that's not gonna show up in the weight class like because they're both 135 pounds there's a fucking difference I don't give a shit what anybody says there's a reason why this woman world champion cyclist is breaking records so I women deadlift these these women weight lifters who used to be men are breaking records like by giant numbers I mean giant numbers in powerlifting and they all they have to do is just say they used to be a man and now I'm a woman this is it oh she's a woman you're a piece of shit if you say anything different there's just but this one was fighting her name's Fallon Fox and she was fighting as a woman even though she being a man for 30 plus years and in fact even had kids at a kid and then just transitioned became a woman didn't tell anybody said it was a medical issue it's none of your business and then beat the fuck out of two women and like beat them like domestic violence like you watch it you like what yeah then she came out and then it was like this big hubbub I got caught up in it because I said it was nonsense so excited I said it's worse than nonsense I'm sick it's bullshit it's a hundred percent bullshit and I never never been attacked harder hello I shouldn't have brought it up yeah it's fine look I fucked that's a hill I'll die on yeah that's a hill I'll die on what you guys are out of your fucking mind yeah I think you're out of your mind with track and field I think you're out of your mind with weightlifting you're out of your mind with all those things but if it comes to fighting fuck you fuck you you think a man or a woman of the same thing you are out of your goddamned mind if you think all you have to do is get a little bit of surgery take some hormones and you're a woman now and you should be able to fight women imagine that's your daughter and your daughter is getting pummeled by someone who used to be a man fuck you it's crazy yeah it's crazy it's unfair to the female athletes you know women they're real women real women are getting fuck yeah real women are training their whole fucking lives and you know what they're what they're sacrificing to be the best woman out there and then to compete about somebody who's got testosterone that just puts them at a whole different level physically well here's the deal I know what low is a testosterone but it's still there it doesn't know it lowers it significantly but the gains that they've had through growing up through puberty with testosterone and being X Y chromosome having the structure of a man those are undeniable and they're undeniable by the world records that these trans women are winning they're beating men I mean they're beating women but biological women by giant numbers like is it tracked someone sent me this the states that allow people in college and in high school to compete as the gender that they identify with without surgery or you don't have to you don't have to have surgery in a lot of these places they are dominating dominating its dominant trans people trans people are winning these things trans always always male to female never female to male female to male aren't there something no chicks are like like saying I identify as a man let me get in the NBA and fucking post it up at 40 against LeBron it's not happening it's not it's doesn't go down that way with what goes down is men who want to be a woman become a woman and then want to compete against biological women and in every single case the biological women are getting fucked over because if a woman say if a woman was thirty years old and she decided at thirty years old she was going to start taking hormones and become a man and compete against men she would be fucked but if a man does that he's got the benefit of having testosterone in his system for thirty years and then transitioned it becomes a woman and there's there's no denying there's a gigantic advantage if a woman was gonna compete like say if she's gonna compete in track and field and she's 30 years old but for all of her life she's been taking steroids her whole life she's been taken just just steroids gonna get a man John a thick neck and fucking shoulders blah and then she gets off of it just gets off of it for a couple years and competes against women's just throwing them around a rag Donna people do like she's a cheater she cheated she took steroids for 30 years just cuz she's not taking him now doesn't mean she's not a cheater hmm well that's what's happening yeah it's but it's worse because the bone structure and because it's it's a natural testosterone your your fucking puberty you're going through puberty with testosterone it's crazy it's crazy it's fucking crazy and it's almost even crazier if you didn't go through puberty so how about if you're a trans person and someone decided when you're five or six years old that you're trans and so now what someone's transitioning you before I mean somebody have a great joke about that like you don't let a five-year-old pick their outfit why would you let them pick their gender like you you can't let a kid to say what they are and what they aren't kids are a giant part of what a kid is is you're so easily influenced by your environment right so easily influenced it's so easy to convince a kid one way or the other and you don't know what's happening right in their home and you're asking this child to make a decision about their biology your talk about in terms of starting to take drugs yeah I mean the idea of doing that to a little kid to me is fucking bananas doesn't make any sense yeah we're Lee in this weird fantasy world right now where people want to be so progressive and they do they want to be so open-minded they don't want to be transphobic so we're letting people say and do absolutely preposterous things that don't have any logic that don't make any sense in terms of what we know about biology does it make any sense and particularly when it comes to sports particularly when it comes to your life you're a grown adult I don't care I'm happy for you if you live better as a woman you feel better as a woman you're a woman to me congratulations I don't care but you're competing against men you can go fuck or at competing as women rather you can go fuck yourself you're not a woman in the sense of you don't have double X chromosome you didn't grow up as a woman you're not a biological woman if you want to be treated as a woman that's fine but you can't just decide you're a woman and now you're gonna break World Records and fucking deadlifts and you're gonna you know run faster than any woman that's ever lived you're gonna beat them on button bike races you're gonna break World Records as a trans woman you're crazy what happens to all these regular women that didn't get the the advantage of growing up through puberty with testosterone think getting fucked over that's the reason why we have men and women's divisions in the first place mmm this is weird cop-out that well there's always it's not fair in some sports because there's LeBron James haiti's LeBron again you know there's Mike Tyson there's there's these outliers who these freak physical specimens yeah yeah there are but they're men versus men there's freak physical specimens and men but when you go so far so far over that when you when you take a biological male and they're just breaking World Records as a woman you gotta go come on we're entering into this complete nonsense area yeah well this is just progressive thinking this ideology taking to the extreme yeah yeah and I mean I don't know what the answer is because the women if they do start taking testosterone then they obviously can't compete against women legally any longer no so they're they're sort of in limbo I don't know if there needs to be a third category trend of athletics the trans categories that's the perfect answer yeah that's the perfect answer I don't I don't think even if the women take steroids if it would be fair I don't I don't even know if that would be fair because they're still not going through puberty like you would have to mean first of all there's not a lot of data on this there's not a lot of data in terms of a years and years of competition where they've studied athletes that have been trans versus athletes that have been biologically female versus athletes that are biologically male but the only there's a lot of studying on this this is people going with the current thinking and the current progressive ideology where they don't want to be criticized they don't want to be called transphobic they don't want to have articles written about them or people call them terrible names and talk shit about them mmm and it's such a small percentage of the population and it's become an issue that is being identify reasons you know it's it's something that is like like my kid is a college now and like every class you have to say your name what gender you identify as pronoun you want to be referred to as do you how many fucking people this is affecting was there five in the school if that if that it's I believe the current number of people that are trans in this country somewhere around 1% is that what the number is do we even know what's fine now I'm fine with all of it up until it comes to sports hmm I mean if you just if you want to identify with a them you know you want to be a very person though I might fuck up occasionally because it's odd yeah I might make mistakes if you want to be called Caitlin okay hi Caitlin I don't care I don't care right but with sports you can fuck all the way off 0.6% okay that's hilarious it's not even one half of a basically half of a percent mmm and Elizabeth Warren she's getting shit because she was she was supporting trans prisoners having the right to have corrective surgery in jail and of course people had a field day with like the amount of money that that would cost and it's like she should just say pass what's your opinion on that yeah Elizabeth let me talk about the economy well let me talk about healthcare yeah that's not a good one but that's one that I guarantee if you sat down talk to her about it like this is this is an ideologically based opinion that's she's probably looked at there her demographic which is progressive left-wing you know she's a woman she's running for president and a big part of her being candidate is the fact that we would like to have a woman president particularly people on the Left they look fucked up with Hillary Clinton it didn't go well maybe Elizabeth Warren's our gal yeah she seems to talk well she's strong Cimmerian yes maybe she's the one maybe she's the one well well she's got to support that because you want the whole Democratic Party otherwise someone will fucking snatch up those people in an independent category Green category yeah like fuck it I'm voting for Jill Stein because she's a piece of shit or Elizabeth Warren's a piece of shit and she won't she doesn't address trans rights yeah there was a lot of third-party voters in the last election they belong the election I was one of them Jill Stein Garry Johnson yeah he did my podcast I don't know shit yeah so I said what was his deal well he didn't know government guy anything he was sunk because he didn't know what where Aleppo was uh-oh I remember him yeah like people were considering him fairly serious uh-huh hmm maybe I'm serious about Gary Johnson he seems fairly reasonable what we could use a reasonable guy and they asked him what do you think we do about Aleppo he's like what fucks Aleppo yeah that's a city were a lot of bad checks out but did Trump know where Aleppo was he doesn't have to he doesn't have to they they could say what are you gonna do about Aleppo he probably got where's Aleppo Syria oh well that place is a mess yeah I wanna go with that I think we're done with that I think we cancelled them so Aleppo is in Syria right so where does I think that's what it is yeah it was almost like a trick question yeah you know because fuck yeah he didn't know but who does yeah who did I got all the people like just fuckin dude he doesn't even know where Aleppo is I didn't know where a leper was yeah I didn't know the question either yeah obviously I'm not running for president well we're kind of hoping that that person knows this shit we don't or they tell him when he gets in there but that's the scary thing about Trump is that other leaders will have advisors around them that they trust right tell them stuff but Trump doesn't seem to read the whose own interests in that he's not interested no no they booed the fuck out of him at the UFC Oh were you there yeah because because I heard from one camp that they cheered and from another camp that they his son said they cheered for him listen a daddy I took my fucking headphones off just to listen and it was 18,000 people go his son said they were chanting USA maybe four people behind him were chanting USA the rest were saying boo si you know what Donald Jr said yes you'd probably say that too look they booed the fuck out of him yeah I'm sure some people clapped yeah I'm sure but if you had a if you had a bet your money on it like what was the greater percentage was it booze or claps it was fucking booze yeah dude I took my headphones off uh-huh I was right there yeah how's 50 I could hit him with a rock he was right over there yeah boo yeah I'm surprised he showed up after what happened at the World Series the same fuck if they happened a week before um maybe he figured cuz it was DC it was because it's so liberal in DC I probably figured cuz it was at the fight yeah cage fights I mean you know also he's friends with Dana White and they're good friends apparently like there were there's a picture on Dana's Instagram of him and Donald sitting in front of the television watching fights they're watching the prelims before he went out Deana watches some of the card in his greenroom listens to the commentary and you know wants to see so because like there's a lot of moving pieces involved being a President of the United States and also the president of the UFC a lot of moving pieces you don't have a lot of time to sit through the entire pay-per-view while you're there so Dana sits in the back and he watches a lot of the pay-per-view card on the screen in his in his office or in his greenroom so he was back there with Donald sitting on the couch and he put it on his Instagram just watching some fights it's just him and Trump sitting there that's hilarious yeah Wow his watch my friend Corey Anderson damn knockout Johnny Walker so look at that watching fights like what you think Dana Dana White's been to fuck like this kid khabib ask him where did my father visa send location yes his father can't get a visa yeah ask Donald bro come on did good free kebede give you got forty six thousand likes on that walk into master square garden last night with Dana White for the big UFC championship fight was a little bit like walking into a trump rally plenty of Magha and KAG present what is KAG oh okay great energy fantastic job Dana headed to DC and then to Kentucky for the big Matt Bevin rally okay well look for sure some people cheered for sure for sure for sure some people waved at him some way the people look some people were psyched to see him look if I was in the crowd and I wasn't hammered and he was yeah be like what's up okay yell at him I'd say Hyde wave at him but the reaction like when he walked in it's a lot of booze yeah but that's just fuckin gonna happen man he's a controversial character mm-hmm you know like anywhere he goes he's gonna give it a look it's fun to boo yeah it's fun to go fuck you it's fun you're gonna do something when you see somebody you're either gonna cheer you're gonna boo yeah me got Secret Service all around them there's there was a lot of noise man a lot of noise but a lot of it wasn't it wasn't like fuck Trump fuck Trump there was no chant you know this place is where he can't go right look if he went to an LBGT rally I would guarantee yeah that's a place where he can't go right even if he's Pro LBGT with his his policy that's place were they gonna dignity like pretty universally hate him yeah where where would you say he can't go where where wouldn't be a good move I think any kind of a woman's movement like oh yeah yeah me too marches yeah what if you addressed like when they have those women marches were all wearing the pussy hats and walk down the street and they have a little speed they set up a stage and he comes out to address them starts grabbing her buddy's hat grandmother pussy at what what what will possess someone to want that job I mean look if you wanted to have the the best-case-scenario answer it's like I want to do a good job and make this country great and do but what do you think really it's ego I was watching Andrew yang on some morning talk show on Sunday and he's he's walking down the street with his wife and it's a Sunday he's got his fucking kids and I'm like this is your Sunday he's got followers with his name on his butt like strangers with Fitzsimmons on a placard walking behind you cheering on a Sunday wanna be home I don't watch a fucking football game play with my kid make a meal but these people every day they work at 16-hour days where they're speaking saying the same shit and they're saying we're we're winning it they always say we know just say I am be as fucking selfish as you really are I'm waiting more people are liking me than those other people mmm it's a bad job it's a bad job that no one should have it's a job that should be a giant round table of geniuses should be deciding the fate of the country yeah and they all should be on mushrooms they all should be on ego dissolving doses of mushrooms so that none of them are acting in their own self-interest they all should have zero financial investments in anything that has anything to do with any decisions that they make like they should have to give up all their stocks they should have to absolutely make sure like like Trump is able to have all his businesses be run by his kids which is kind of hilarious yeah but then he makes decisions that would benefit his businesses that are being run by his kids and as soon as he's out of office he get she jumps back in and takes over again was just like yeah it's what do you thinks gonna happen when they get his taxes cuz they're pretty close they're pretty clear it's gonna go to the Supreme Court now the the last court said that he has to turn them over and what they're doing is they're going after his accountant instead of him that way the accountant will be liable as opposed to him personally because he's never gonna do it but if you're if you're fucking you know Harvey Altman yeah in company yeah you have to you got to do it you're not gonna go to jail for him right you sewed up with Michael Cohen right you go to jail yeah yeah there's no pardons you're going to jail bunch of went yeah yeah quite a few people are in jail Matta for Jana jail Brill jail yeah like like you can't see anybody locked SL jail it's not gonna matter when his taxes come out it's not gonna matter it's nothing none of it matters he's got his file the only thing this election comes down to is whether or not the left can get people to show up because his forty six percent or whatever percent are into him they're fuckin there on November fourth next year they're showing up you know it was crazy Chris Rock went on stage right after he won and Chris Rock said you don't know that motherfucker he goes let me tell you something he ain't leaving he goes he's gonna be the president for a long fuckin time he ain't gonna leave mmm and I was thinking like what does that mean like you have to leave yeah like if he loses you imagine if he loses and he doesn't want he doesn't believe he lost well he's already said he won't believe it he's already said that she was gonna be a revolution he's yeah he's you know he's laying the groundwork for could could be ugly including it the impeachment which would be even worse than him just not getting elected if he was impeached can you imagine what would happen I don't think he's going to get not impeached if he was he's being impeached yeah if he was convicted it was if he's convicted and removed from office it would be crazy yeah but I don't think that's gonna happen I think someone explained to me was a Kyle Dunnigan explain to me how many people what's that no not Kyle Kyle kolinsky who's my favorite online political commentator very wise guys left-wing guy but like he calls it like he sees it he's very educated and very aware of all the pitfalls that that is plaguing the left and the right and he said that you would need all these Republicans to vote on it in order for him to actually be impeached and they're not going to they're no they're just like 22 Republican senators that would have to flip yeah then so far they have zero they're not gonna flip now the nerves are not there they're more interested in their party than they are anything else yeah you have to the Republicans they have to stick together they especially in this time where you know look what their I'm not a Republican but if I was I would be extremely concerned about censorship in social media which is a real thing censorship of Republican ideas and conservative ideas is absolutely a real thing and is it's it's not just real it's accepted as being the right thing to do by certain organizations I mean they've been caught on camera and hidden camera talking about the ways that you can silence conservative voices you know this is not like these when you look at social media platforms they're essentially the best way to get ideas out there right it's even better than broadcast news because if you put something on Fox or CBS or whatever how many people are really gonna watch it is it a thousand a million I mean how many people watch it but if you have a clip that goes viral that clip on YouTube or Twitter or where are Facebook wherever whoever that could get 30 million people 40 million people way fucking more than is ever gonna watch you on television they've kind of accepted that on late-night television like late-night television is kind of accepted that what they're looking for is these clips these moments these clips that almost act as advertisements for the show yeah you know where it's James Corden fucking making people sing in this car that kind of shit they're trying to get these clips that go viral because the show itself you mean I mean I don't know how many people are watching a few hundred thousand at the most right it's nothing in comparison to a lot of the like like what's that guy's name that's the famous makeup kid that he's a gay fellow James Charles that guy's videos on makeup get way more fucking views than anything that happens on Fox News and that's a fact yeah anything that happens on MSNBC and that's a fact okay social media is way more potent than anything else and comes to getting a message out and for sure conservatives are being discriminated against on social media by social media platforms well what's weird about it is that when you think about social media coming out of Silicon Valley which is famously winged the election was really swung by the Internet in Trump's favor you know whether or not you want to call them BOTS that were set up by Russia or whether or not it was just they were a well-organized campaign they just they were really smart and very sharp about videos they put out yes they have a thing now where they put out a lot of memes that they encourage people to make memes about yes there are all over Democrats are so far behind the Republicans when it comes to using using it but you're right I mean if you if you ban certain people from Twitter and from YouTube that censorship yes it is censorship and even if you're not banning them from those platforms if your shadow banning them if you're making it very difficult for be able to find them which is real it's a real thing that you do they they they you know the the way your poet like if you have a post on social media it doesn't just go up in chronological order anymore now it's affected by an algorithm so I might see your posts or I might not see your posts in my feed it's dependent upon what I like and what I watch and what I see when I go to search like if you look at my search feed you know you see you see people beating the fuck out of each other and girls doing squats that's like my hope my search it's all like like it's it's the most cartoonish version of me pop yeah yeah it's all like big bull elk screaming and dudes getting head kicked in a muscle car doing a burnout that's my fucking that's all oh you could look at my Instagram search and that's all affected entirely by this algorithm that figures out what I like yeah and then also recommends things to me like in terms of like there's a lot of sponsored things on Instagram like oh oh how could you times I could yeah off to Google and it's because it's it's targeting me it's found me it knows that I search for certain things I look at certain things these are the sites that I follow these are the things that I interact with so let's sell them something and it does the same with you it does the same with Jamie does the same with everybody so they can in certain social media platforms use that algorithm to discriminate so they can decide hey this fucking guy keeps chirping on and on about hillary clinton's war crimes and all this we don't need this guy around okay we don't need this guy and all of his fucking right-wing bullshit and alls make America great again bullshit so will shadow ban them and so they can shove you into this category where it's very difficult to find your find your page and it's very difficult for your shit to show up and a lot of people have seen their views drop drastically their interactions drop drastically because people aren't seeing this shit anymore right Andrew Santino had that happened to him no shit talk to someone talk to someone on the phone that told him he was shadow banned and he's like what does that mean they're like well it was it's because of a post that you made he was well what post is it they wouldn't tell him what post it was what kind of post would it have been is he political no he's like I'm not political at all but you know he's a comic and he says ridiculous shit yeah and he's a redhead and so people probably like you know look at this guy this super white looking guy who says a bunch of ridiculous shit get rid of him yeah off of his head ya know I had this guy weird fella I think is his handle on Twitter and he used to he used to say stupid shit he was goofy whatever he you know I would interact with him a little bit and then he emailed me at my site to say that he got banned from Twitter remember what remember on Halloween when a kid showed up at the White House and Trump and Milani were standing there and Trump put candy on top of the kid's head instead of caning it to him it was like a really ridiculous like this guy can't even just put candy in the fucking kids bag he's got to put it on his head so it was like it something that became a meme and this guy just wrote I wish the kid had kicked him in the shins thrown off Twitter for saying that hmm it was a woman named Megan Murphy she's what's called at Turf do you know what terrific yeah trans exclusionary radical feminist and she she is one of those radical feminists that don't believe that a trans person's a woman and she was arguing that these people don't have they shouldn't have a voice in women's issues like you're not a woman and so this is her opinion and some people think that that opinion is transphobic some people think she should be allowed to have that opinion while on Twitter she wrote a man is never a woman they told her she has to take down that tweet so you know what she did she made a screenshot of it she took down that tweet and then she posted a picture of the screenshot and then they banned it for life you know who's not banned for life Oh Jay Simpson yeah double homicide armed kidnapping and hate to the world yeah hate where the world is your friend OJ with football pics hey Twitter world he's fine but this lady who's just said with her words a man is never a woman which biologically is correct banned Wow do you know what else you get banned for damn you know you will see a band for for life what dead naming do you know a dead name what's that if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce really and for life no she is for life damn ridiculous this is where we're living in this is this political ideology world this is the reason why someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks she has to say taxpayer money should pay for prisoners some fuckin mass murderer who decides he's a woman now to get this transitionary surgery transition surgery yeah reassignment surgery whatever you want to call it look I wish there was a fucking pill that you could take I wish it was a place we can go where they zap you like the place where they turned Bruce Banner and the Hulk that turns you into a woman Oh legit 100% bonafide XY or DoubleX chromosome woman I wish there was I wish there was so this is no argument yeah the argument is in changing someone but not really you know like you're still your chromosomes and you're your biological makeup and then forcing people to comply so it's a thing of compliance like you're supposed to not bring up the fact that this person used to be a man look if your name is Greg but like my friend Aubrey okay a perfect example his name used to be Chris but he tripped balls one day and decide you want to change his name so he changed his name we all just call the mob right now I don't call him Chris anymore he was Chris for years I knew him is Chris for years and then he became Aubrey I'm like all right man you want to be Aubrey now your robbery I don't give a fuck but if I called him Chris would I be dead name yeah all right all right but you know what else is weird is that like the same mentality that says this says that a white kid who grows dreadlocks and dresses in urban street wear is culturally appropriating yes many many of the people that would sing think that yeah including there's a there was a movement that they had a band I think most people abandon it but it's really ridiculous for a while where they were yelling at white girls wearing hoop earrings because they were saying that this is a Latina thing you're culturally appropriate than that but it's not like then if you historically you got to go back to ancient Sumerian vented hoop earrings mm-hmm so you are you from Babylon hmm are you are you from Mesopotamia no then shut the fuck up because you're culturally appropriating if you have a Korean phone in your hand yeah guess what that's culturally appropriate those Italian jeans culturally appropriate yeah who made your sneakers huh China what the fuck are we talking about culturally appropriating is one of the dumbest fucking things because that's what cities are they're melting pots of awesome cultures and they all get together just is if you're a fucking dude and you want to dress up like Bruce Lee that doesn't mean you're culturally appropriate it means you're a Bruce Lee fan and it's kind of cool you're admiring that and so you're you're trying to take it on it's all woke it's all woke culture it's this culture of compliance they want you to comply it's all that's what it's about more than anything it's getting people to change getting people to listen to you and do what you want them to do I want you to stop wearing those fucking earrings I want you to stop wearing dreadlocks meanwhile dreadlocks the Romans were fucking dreadlocks dreadlocks are not necessarily a black thing although most black people like you if you do it's more rather black people wearing them than white people but there's white people have had dreadlocks forever so you can we've all seen dirty hippies with dreadlocks yeah I go to a fucking Grateful Dead concert it's a lot of dirty white people with dreadlocks they're not trying to culturally appropriate they're trying to be dirty hippies with dreadlocks yeah they're they exist they're real to say that that's cultural appropriation it's fucking crazy it's create you we all appropriate we all do we all do is you you use if you are in the United States in 2019 you're a part of the the greatest melting pot the world has ever known and to decide that you can have some of that but you can't have other parts like come on man stop good luck on Halloween Jesus Christ I read this list of things you shouldn't do on Halloween it was like don't put a feather in your head don't put don't even tattoo don't put a tattoo of something that would identify you as Native American or Asian yeah I don't have Asian letters tattooed that was a thing that people used to do oh is that a thing you shouldn't do now yeah you can't do that anymore I never was a fan of that to begin with Obama bro you didn't brought he meant give a speech that's not excellent was great yeah yeah it was excellent he's telling people like we're looking to cancel people all the time the end this is a perfect quote that he said the world is messy and it is messy here's what we got to stop looking for things that make you angry and just try try to let things go and just be nice to each other and dialogue yeah these people want to just talk and have you listen like I saw a woman coming out of a fucking restaurant the other day and I was walking in and a t-shirt said I did I don't want to hear her men stop talking I don't want to hear from men and it was like I'm sorry did I do something to you have I have I not raised a beautiful daughter and been a loving husband and a great son to my mother and a great friend to a lot of women and mentored many female comics that I bring on the road with me and hired when I was head writer on TV shows that I'm hired and and it's like don't fucking put me in that category how about we talk about do you have an issue with with you know what's going on with you personally with involving me let's talk about as a human being run one as an individual but that's that's the thing they're denying the individual and they're making everything binary it's you and them it's and them it's one in zero it's it's not if there's no room for nuance yeah there's no is no room for the complexity that is the human race yeah this idea like men should shut the fuck up I don't wanna hear from white men that's another one I've seen that shirt I don't want to hear from ya that's it's all nonsense it's it comes from people that want compliance this is the the whole thing about what culture is people that felt like they've been pushed around they felt like they've been bullied they felt like they've been maligned they haven't been treated fairly and now they want to turn it on you and they don't give a fuck they don't give a fuck of you if you're white man I don't give a fuck what your opinion is shut your fucking mouth and they feel like they can say that because this culture and bow in Boldin's people but letting people get away with nonsense by letting people say things like that like walking away like if I was owned a restaurant someone walked in with sure like that I'd be like get the fuck out of here just like if you walked into a shirt with a shirt that said black people should shut the fuck up yeah get out right get out get out do you really think that you have no room for black people talking get I don't want you around your mind is rotten you're thinking a terrible way go cleanse yourself go yeah go take a fucking meditation class or something figure out what's wrong with you but don't don't bring that toxic energy around people it's stupid yes criminal Tory well it's half the population and it's like I understand that women have been they've had a different experience than men black people have had a different experience than white people these there's issues that need to be addressed and corrected and enlist me in that yes I'm perfectly willing to don't force you right to comply yeah you know there's an there's a giant there's a giant issue in this country that is like like skirted it's like it gets addressed but then it gets it gets ignored and and that is what do they do with all the communities that have been forever affected by slavery like what about all those all those when people talk about reparations it gets dismissed like it's not you I didn't do anything it's not you it's have to do with you you didn't do anything you never owned a slave I never owned a slave we didn't have anything to do with it but there's no denying that there's parts of this country that are forever affected by slavery and then afterwards by racist laws those redline laws oh yeah reconstruction and Jim Crow all that yeah okay never really been addressed never been addressed in terms of a correction now in terms of like reparations you give people money I don't know if that works like if if I thought that by me paying more in taxes and them giving reparations we could ease the tension racial tension in this country I would be like okay that's all you have to do but it's not all you have to do right because you're still gonna have these communities that are forever affected until something has been done to correct them like I'm not in favor of giving people who were never slaves money as reparations but I am in favor of giving communities money mm-hmm and figuring out a way to rebuild them figure out a way to map them safer by schools school lunches Community Programs getting people off the streets that are involved in gangs and drugs and all that stuff like I've said this a thousand times but it bears repeating the best way to have a great country is if we're a team or if we're a country we're supposed to be a team right we're a community a giant community of 320 million people what's the best way to make it stronger well you have less losers that's the best way well what's the likelihood of you becoming a loser if you're in an impoverished drug riddled crime just ravaged area well they're highly it's highly likely that you're not gonna succeed in that area unless you are some person of unbelievable character an unbelievable will and fortitude and you're raised by people who did a phenomenal job essentially in a war zone right if you live in the south side of Chicago and you look at the murder rate and the south side of Chicago and you compare it to the murder rate in war zones they're pretty fucking similar right so essentially these people are being asked to do their best and and come out of this war zone and pull themselves up by their bootstraps other people around them are not in a war zone if we're community we're supposed to look at that and go hey how fucked you stop this thing from being a war zone how do we stop this yeah how do we how do we do that with Detroit how do we do that with Baltimore how do we do that with all these impoverished areas that that should be addressed well it has to be looked at as our problems yeah their problem you know we are all living with the ramifications of inequality you know it's affecting us on a daily basis whether it's crime or whether it's you know our gross national product would be much higher if more people were educated and more people were proud of their work and yes and so there's there has to be there has to be pride less less losers more pride more identifying with progress and you know I think if you if you if you live in a certain culture in this country there there isn't a pride in succeeding right there just because you haven't seen it right more opportunity and this includes poor white cultures like I have a friend who's from Kentucky and he tells me about these fucking people that live in these coal mining communities with a coal mining community the coal is gone and the community shut down people are hooked on pills and he's like you have never seen poverty like this he's like you've never seen it we're like every one of the communities on pills every one is surviving on like below minimum wage and everyone's a criminal like it's just everyone's poor it's just horrific did you ever see the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia now holy shit oh I think it's a johnny Knoxville documentary did he put it together it's amazing it's amazing for all the wrong reasons because these are the trashiest white-trash people that have ever lived and they're all on pills they're all turning tricks and doing crazy shit and and robbing people and shooting people and it's like everyone has a fucking story that's like you're like Macaulay Culkin from home alone like what yeah put your hands in your ears like what the fuck but those communities exist they exist big and it's so hard to get out it's so hard to break free like we as a community as a giant 320 million person community should be concentrating on fixing those spots it as much as we're concentrating on fixing problems in other parts of the world yeah I understand the logic behind going to these other parts of the world they're fucked up and trying to solve these problems before they affect us before they come back to us that's the logic I get it but internally inside of our country we were not doing the same thing we're allowing people to become violent criminals by never giving them a chance but never giving them an outcome or never never giving them possibilities other than what they see around them not giving them an out any opportunities and we treat it as if they're supposed to be we're all supposed to be even we're all supposed to be on this even game mm-hmm no some people got one shitty card and some people got like five aces it's just yeah there's this documentary they made about public school in Chicago I forget what Oak Park I think it was in it was called America as me and it was like this 10-part series and it showed the experiences of the white kids versus the black kids because it was an integrated school but you were seeing that the black kids were lagging grade-wise graduation rates and they just went in depth and you saw that a lot of the black kids were dealing with single parents they were dealing with being fucking evicted some of them being homeless or just not having the resources like you know the white kids are getting SAT prep classes and you know they're getting extra help because they've got a parent that's not working that can pick them up from school and drive them to a tutor and there's just all these things that you're seeing one side is getting foster and the other side is struggling and it's the same fucking school so it's not it's not as simple as just put good schools in the community but there's got to be mentorship programs and there's got to be the outreach program community outreach has got to be they got to get preschools I got to get kids in there at a young age so the parents can work and there's good nutrition that they say that the studies that show preschool the difference is long term of how people come out of there with those extra two years is astronomical makes sense makes sense you prep them for it early but it's the thing is this is where a concept like democratic socialism actually makes sense it's like people think of democratic socialism or anything where you say that we're at socialism they go oh you're gonna take money and give it to lazy people this is the that's the worst case scenario right but man if we're community if we're if we are a community of human beings you got a we've got to help the people that aren't doing good there's got to be a reason why they're not doing good it's not that they're inferior there's they have inferior choices they have inferior opportunities they have an inferior situation mm-hmm and it's so hard to get the mass of people behind giving their money to some sort of some sort of a program that does take steps to fix this you just don't hear it well you know they had the jobs for a you know FDR and the New Deal they were able to start people want to work people don't they want to get a welfare job they want to feel good about themselves and they and you want to be busy all day you know sometimes I'm not suppose I don't work for a month you know I'm between writing jobs maybe I take some time off from Stan I get I don't feel good about myself terrible I mean imagine that times year after year and generation after generation and for you it's a choice look if you want you can go on the road at any time yeah but that's not a choice for a lot of great for a lot of choice they're just fucked and you used to have the the the funny thing is like the factory jobs you look back on them Inigo those are like really shitty jobs you know I grew up in a factory town and it was like people were not enjoying it people were getting fucking drunk and high and just getting through and now we're looking--we're harkening back to like that it was like some Golden Age of great work like no you know they were Union jobs which was great but let's shoot higher you know let's get where the factory jobs aren't coming back probably the real question is like some people some people don't have aspirations so if you took someone who's already gone through the school system and you know like oh we're gonna get jobs for people yep that's not good enough well you gotta fix the people that are fucked up yeah you can't say like like an 18 year old person is not a finished product a 25 year old person who came from a fucked up neighborhood and has got all sorts of mental problems and probably PTSD that's not a finished product yeah you can't say we got a job for you well because they're fucked in the head you know they've had a deal with their friend getting shot they have to deal with their mom being on crack like getting them a job is not not enough I don't know what the answer is like obviously we're just two white guys talking shit yeah right we don't have to worry about this this is not our concern but if you wanted to if you wanted to fix if you were a person like say if Greg Fitzsimmons became president how do you fix that how do you how do you even make steps to fix that because I haven't heard anyone come up with a plan maybe there is one that I haven't heard but a plan where it makes sense where there's a long term proposition to try to take these communities that are just habitually engulfed in crime and violence mmm just consistently like throughout the 60s and the 70s and and fix it mm-hmm and turn it around like at least try well there's a gap the gap between the rich and the poor is growing ever since the 80s it's gotten just out of hand you know the the amount the top 1% have 50% of the money or something like that and it's just and everything is set up structurally for that to continue to divide more and more right but are they playing a game right they're playing a game called capitalism and that game they're dominating that game and once they get the money then they keep the money and they pass that money down to their kids and they keep the money how do you change that I mean we could all play that game right like we could all invest in stock market we can all just really focus entirely on making money or should we not be able to like how do you stop the 1% like these bankers and investment people how do you stop that and how do you stop that in a way where it doesn't seem like you're you know you're changing the rules of the game because some people just psycho good and completely dedicated to only making money well you're not changing the rules because the the estate tax was there from day one the founding fathers wanted there to be a very large estate tax they wanted to avoid what happened in Europe which is these building up of these families that are wealth and so these kids you know so I think we need to go back to right now it's like thirty five percent or something like that and wealth over ten million dollars if you're a couple they need to go back to really taking that money back because Anu and what was it though put it into schools to start with I would love that if there was like a real logic to how that means that's been right right yeah that would be the problem is if it just went to a bunch of like it's just if you just went to a bunch of government programs that don't seem to make sense and they're like poorly structured yeah that money gets wasted that would make me sick no I think it has to be job training programs it has to be helping small businesses grow with you know low cost loans but you know they think about these kids that are inheriting a billion dollars what are you ever gonna contribute to society as opposed to if you were set up with you went to a private high school you went to a great university you went to a graduate school all of it was paid for you had nannies you were given tutors you should be able to go out and make a good living now yes you don't need that billion dollars right and you will feel so much better if you make your own money yep so there should be enough money left you know I'm not I'm not saying take away everybody's money when they die but I'm saying that there's a grotesque amount of money that needs to be pulled back that's one way of at least putting a chip like chip away at it that's one way right that money yeah what's another way what so unless you want like cops or police to occupy these areas like how would you ever stop like at this point in time how would you stop places from being crime written it have to be like a multi step program where you would slowly but surely implement it and try to slowly but surely chip away at all these problems yeah it's not something you're gonna fix overnight because it didn't happen overnight you know right right now there has to be great leadership and there has to be man that you got eight years you're you're president you've got four and if you're lucky you get eight no I mean local leadership and - you know city councilmen and you know mayor's that are really looking at the community and figuring and each one's different feel like if it's that way unless it's federally if it's that way like you're gonna you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already yeah you know because just by virtue of the fact that crime ridden and that this is the in poverty-stricken these are communities that already don't have any money yeah low tax base go back to talking about farts yes when I fire bump I really bummed out when I when I talk about people that live in poor neighborhoods that don't have a way out because that is one it's one thing that really freaks me out like being stuck like the feeling of being stuck I don't know I mean I don't know what it is about that feeling but it's just you see people in in I was in Colorado Springs once and I saw this homeless couple and they were begging for money they had a fucking baby they had a baby and it was outside and it was kind of cold it was like October and I'll never forget that I'm seeing this homeless couple with a baby and I'm like fuck they have a baby and they're homeless god dammit yeah like that that kind of shit freaks me the fuck out yeah like people who are just doomed you're stuck like you're stuck your parents are homeless and you're a baby and usually the pant one of the parents are both of them is mentally ill I mean most homelessness is caused by mental illness no you have you have addiction which is usually somebody self-medicating to begin with if you got to that point you're usually self-medicating something and it could be a number of things but you know weed there used to be you had institutional you had people that were institutionalized because they needed help he had mental hospitals yeah you're places where the lowest in our society the most vulnerable we're taken care of and those were closed and those people are on the street now that was during the Reagan administration yeah now in LA we now have typhus yeah they're right literally medieval diseases try making a commercial oh this is back there's so many homeless people in LA they think it might be as many as 70,000 people every night 70,000 people that's what I heard 70,000 and there's not a fucking single plan that makes any sense to deal with that yeah how they fix that well part of the problem is that the you know it's just gotten so expensive to live here you know the real estate has gone through the roof and so people are people that were living on the edge you know paycheck to paycheck all the sudden you're fucking you're out you stay on as many couch as you can until people say look you can't live here anymore yeah and then you're in your car and you know trying to get now you got to get to get back into housing you need to come up with a first last security deposit mm-hmm where the fuck you getting that where are you getting that effing Utley happening in some cases and a lot of cases is just drug addicts - right people who are addicted to drugs yeah well one of the things they're finding is that like I work with this group called people concern in LA and they they're trying to get people into housing with transitory housing where they can at least get a shower get some decent clothes we can go in a job interview and and get started where you don't have to pay that first first last and security deposit that's great if you're not mentally ill right you know if you're mentally ill it's all the showers in the world are gonna fix Robert William a poor bhaiyya but that dude now you know that guy's the guy who comes to the Comi store all the time very nice guy there's a perpetual open mic er I'm kind of funny got some good one liners but he's got something wrong yeah those people need to take medication every day and when you're on the street you're not getting it and what they require is that you go to a certain facility every day to get your pills they won't give you the pills right these people are fucking they don't know where they're sleeping that night they can't show up at a certain time at a certain place yeah so they need to have played and one of the things they found also is when they give people housing it used to be contingent on you staying sober and now they're finding that no get them off the street if they're still using you try to work with them you try to get them into counseling but you don't throw them back out on the street because they're using ìgod fixing people dude fixing people so fucking hard like I did a part cast this weekend with Artie Artie Lange yeah he's been sober now for nine months oh yeah yeah he's fucking great his eyes they sparkle he's a lot it's great he's right there with you his stories were hilarious best storyteller out there oh my god dude it was so fun yeah and I was just thinking like you know I was so happy to see him so happy to see him sober crying laughing and thinking god dammit I hope he hangs in there yeah I hope you know I hope that you know they were talking about fixing his nose but you know the doctor was like look he's gonna be on pain pills if you fix his nose they're gonna give him medication like it's too soon yeah yeah he needs at least a year of sobriety before even thinks about doing that but even then you're taking a guy who's a bonafide attic self-professed attic and then you're gonna give them drugs yeah come on I know you can't do it can't do it no and that's got to be some painful surgery I would imagine you'd have to have something now you can take it yeah yeah you're all right meditation can be as effective as any painkiller if you do it right baby I doubt it I don't think so I bet painkillers are way better now people are addicted to medication meditation right they're addicted to medication not meditation now I'm happy for I'm really happy for already and I've seen him you know I've sighs saw him before he went in and he was a fucking mess yeah really bad and he had been doing good like he was on crashing the two years that I was there and he would come in and the guy was always on time knew his lines improved his face off was always fucking great and then you'd hear that he'd gone off again and he was just like man can't you just fucking you're so much to offer so smart so talented but he's also a wild man that's one of the reasons why he's so funny cuz he's so impulsive and mild you know and that's just who already is yeah but goddamn he's alive right now he's alive and kicking and his fucking eyes are sparkling yeah like you talked to him he's like eyes right there yeah he was so funny yeah god damn he was funny it was just so nice to see him and hug him and when someone has gone through hell and back like that like just just to know that he's still there yeah it's so nice and like you know we've lost a lot of people you know we know a lot of people were gone that were really great people and really funny people just not around anymore mm-hmm they fucked up Geraldo and I mean you know Mitch Hedberg yeah you just keep going down that list right right you know yeah and it's like it is it's that wild they have to find something to replace I mean Lenny I heard Lenny on your show he was fucking great I mean that guy not that he was ever like a hard addict but he's been sober for a lot of years and he found ways to replace it and still be a fucking madman yeah you know he plays golf like a fucking madman he's ever yeah as funny as a funnier I would say oh my god he's so funny on the podcast yeah he's just rapid-fire yes in his sixties yeah you know he's a wild man yeah yeah I told him to start running I said a lot of addicts they start uh these are views he was I never got that run as I never I ran a little bit I never got that fucking run as high I'm like think you got to run a lot you gotta get in shape and then you do it a lot and get used to it yeah the high doesn't kick in right away they sent layers you got a shed first but it's goes back to what you were talking about earlier but so many of us are looking for a way to twist our consciousness to do something to to take you out of whatever the fuck the normal sober consciousness is yeah what's wrong with the regular sober consciousness and I mean I'm saying this I'm saying this is somebody who struggles with it yeah I feel all the time like reaching for something yeah you know even if it's like I took CBD pills this morning just because it changes me a little bit it fucking you Louie had a little gift you know I'm on the road I'll smoke a little pot why I don't know I just need to be different right now I need might head to change right yeah well I think it's the monotony of existential angst ooh it's just like wearing you down you know you look in the mirror you see a few more lines a few more bags the skin is just slowly giving away from your skull slowly and we're not gonna win this race no one wins no one wins this thing and that just wears ya sometimes you still want to think about that you have a couple of drinks you don't think about anymore like it hammered you know see the fights you go to see a game you go to a concert you drop acid you do something you hit on somebody you would have done that I would have walked up to that fucking hot chick and told her a joke no way with all the drinks yeah ladies let me buy you a drink come on I can remember trying to hook up sober half after being drunk for so much of my life and then getting sober and then trying to hit on girls and like go to bed with a girl while sober was weird I was looking at my body like look at this shitty body I didn't care about my body when I was drunk I'd walk to the bathroom naked walk back like dick flopping around but once you're sober you're like this is really odd I just met this person I know it's and that even sex like what is that like you're trying to get some sort of a rush out of that you're trying to escape yeah I know you're trying to both of you together yeah we're doing something leaving this plane you know you're doing something you're trying to try to escape whatever this fucking monotonous existence is together you're seeing her face a woman that an hour before was sitting in a bar maybe smiling and thinking to herself oh is my fight does my smile feel fake or should I be smiling more right now all of a sudden she's screaming is she her eyes are rolled back yeah yeah both of you are yeah and then afterwards you got to deal with each other that is the weirdest thing ever it's like when you really think you're into someone and then you come and you're like oh my god I gotta get out of here how much of it is chemical it's such a fucking trick yeah and women are like ah you just did that you just pretended you liked me so you could have sex with me no I thought I did like you I was I was tricking myself to like I really believed it if you you know if you say a lot of shit that you don't really mean just to fuck some that's a dirty move but so many guys and I've talked to so many guys who echo this you really think you like that until you come hey and then you look yeah and then whatever was kind of cute before now was annoying and grating on you it's probably the same with women they probably like thought you like they liked you till you fuck them and then you're hanging around talking and farting and they like yeah get this guy out of my fucking apartment right hey look it's biology yeah that's the ultimate trick right you you are when you're having sex with someone especially if you're really aroused and you're they're really hot and you're really into it and they're any of you that is a drug yes it's definitely a drug yeah it's your your oxytocin's through the roof all your fucking pheromones are flying around you smelling each other and you're aroused all your sex hormones are fucking blaring you know and it's all it's the number one thing oh yeah that's it I mean there's the orgasm and then what's second what's second in the list of great things that you can experience physically a runner's high you know you know without drugs just that you can naturally experience it's pretty up it's pretty up there yeah yeah there's not a lot of thing well you it's also the the that it's difficult to procure hmm right it's difficult to get someone who's really attractive to like you yeah right I mean that's a reason why you and I are funny Yeah right it's be honest like why are why are most men why do they have a sense of humor they have a sense of humor because girls like that mm-hmm it's a big it's a big one like you can kind of jump through a lot of Hoops do you skip a lot of steps if you're funny yeah if you're a guy and you're funny cuz you have to be smart to be funny see girls like oh he knows how to be funny yeah you know and if they're not funny but they then you're funny you can make them laugh they're like yes bring this fucking comedian with me everywhere right and I always have my own little show yeah and when she likes you because they like oh she likes me because I'm funny that'll get funnier yeah I'll work at this yeah I'll be good at this too when I was in sixth grade me and John your Zach used to do comedy routines for the girls at lunch we had whole fucking routines like you know like Marx Brothers stuff and Muppet Show shit like whatever worked tap dancing for those girls I mean like Vicki Batman and reg they loved it so funny and I remember that feeling back then because I was the skinny little kid with red hair and freckles no chicks took they just cared about the guys that were good at sports and all sudden like I'm getting laughs and and I just remember feeling like this is what I want to do this is this is what I need to do yeah you found like you yeah yeah so there's that right it's like when guys see a car like a brand new Mercedes in a commercial and there's a girl with long legs and high heels and she's leaning against the car like oh my god is that girl come in the car if I get the car while get her yeah I need to get her it's hard to get one of those you get a girl with long legs and high heels and beautiful lips and she's looking at you like she loves you that's so difficult to find it's so difficult to get most the time those girls they look up they walk right by you look you don't even exist look at that if I get that watch that watch there's a girl staring at that watch you love that watch oh gotta get that watch yeah and that's like what's used to sell most things like how many things in America in particular are sold by attractive women yeah attractive women in ads attractive women like that we associate if you get this Lamborghini attractive women will be more drawn to you because it's difficult to get a Lamborghini right this guy can get a Lamborghini that means he's got $300,000 to throw on a stupid car that's probably gonna break down yeah jon hamm doing those car ads women fucking they want to get in that car with Jon Hamm Matthew McConaughey it him look at that house he lives in I'm gonna be in that house I just eaten if I meet him he'll love me I would put a couch over there though shrubs inside the house fix it kind of a modern painting it just needs a woman's touch then then he has sex with me he's like I got to go oh but I thought but it's your house we're forever yeah the ultimate biological trick if they forever dead that's what's gonna be really weird like if you look at aliens right one that what's the the iconic alien they have the big head they have these little boy like bodies long fingers no dicks yeah there's nothing there right because that's probably what happens in the future yeah the future we all figure out listen we are being tricked left and right by our dicks and our vaginas and our sex hormones are talking us into nonsense well we could just be enlightened yeah and we could travel the galaxy together but we got to get past all this sex stuff it's biological sex stuff and you can you could have an orgasm in your own brain yeah with your list new phone iPhone 72 yeah and just press the button and they get that out of your system good now we don't need sex anymore yeah and we don't need our mouths either we need to talk with our brains just you know big giant head what tiny slit for a mouth mm-hmm it's like remember that Woody Allen movie sleepers and they have the orgasmatron oh and you just pass it around and then you'd have an orgasm and then you move on that was it you mean you think about how much work is involved in trying to get an orgasm like how much energy people spend and then the the seduction right you meet someone at a bar can I buy you a drink okay want me to light that cigarette can't do that anymore but that was a thing right yeah like light the girl cigarette mm-hmm buy a drink oh he's so charming Oh Oh thinking maybe dance is a mating dance let's dance watch me shake my hips I'm gonna look to see her dance a guy who doesn't know how to dance probably sucks in bed yeah that guy dance dance hey it's time to breed I'm gonna breed with a conqueror a man who could dance and knows I don't light a cigarette he could kill somebody for me he's big he's big and he knows how to think he knows that we got to get out of here troubles brewing oh he's a protector I wanna get in his nice car you can drive fast whoa whoa mom he lives in the top of the hill oh he's got a good spot we could see the enemies coming from yeah so weird people I mean that's our business is like getting people to like us right there's a big part of what our business is our business is like saying funny shit so people like us yeah and other people do different things like some girls they just work on their squats you know just go to the gym a lot so the people like them more elastics out more get more attention all right no some people are just funny some people they acquire things some people acquire power respect influence yeah I watch this nature special on the what are those animals that hang upside down in Australia bats no they're like furry they're furry and cute Wallabies know that it bounced around fur you what they're called bum bats no they got they've got him I got him here too I think but anyway this motherfucker is on one side of the river and he can hear a mating call from the other side of the river and he's slow as shit sloth sloth I thought so this lot here is the female sloth and he fucking me and I don't know where they get these cameras from but they watch this guy go down the tree across a limb into the water can't swim for shit there's fucking Rapids he makes his way well cuz he could hear that gets across climbs on it takes like two days and then he finds another sloth and he climbs on top of a couple shakes of the head this bitch but now he can think I can thank you know Jesus she want to eat my fruit it's my fruit bitch she wants to talk about that star that was shining last night because that was entertainment back then but but it's a even weirder dance for a girl because a girl has to figure out whether or not this guy is gonna be around right she's gonna let this guy shoot one inside of her and then what if she gets pregnant and now this asshole she has to rely on him and what is he gonna be around he's a sloth like she can't she like there's a gonna be a lot of time or she has to dedicate to taking care of this kid maybe she can hold that down a full-time job maybe she can but there's a lot of fucking resources that need to be dedicated towards raising these children is someone gonna help am I gonna be doing this on my own like women have to be really fucking careful really careful imagine if guys got pregnant every time we fucked mmm oh my god yeah how did you joke about that the abortion would be an app on your phone because it would like if we got pregnant the fuck out of here oh yeah yeah morning-after pills would just be on the bedside table every morning there'd be everywhere they give them to you at hotels like they leave mints on the bed yeah chocolates yeah we've fucking Plan B pills there would be no kids zero kids there to be two of us women love children they're nurturing or capable yeah we're like some women but some women don't want to get boxed into that either yeah which is and some guys don't want to get some guy look I love being a father I know you love being the father but we all have friends ative later a bunch of them that have vasectomies they don't want to have kids fuck that yeah okay it's okay it's all okay there's plenty of great it's great that you know you don't yeah I mean I don't even know if you know you don't because maybe you think you don't because you haven't had it mm-hmm I mean a kid will change the way your fuckin brain works yeah and a lot of times for the better it made me a way nicer person yeah way nicer and made me way more considerate of people's positions too because I used to think of people always as being static like oh this is Greg he's 52 he's always been 52 this woody is I mean I know I'm gonna talk to him right now right now I look at people and I go Oh Greg used to be a baby he was a baby like what did how did what what what weird circumstances befell him what fucking weird pitfalls and traps and weird things entered into his life what weird people fucked him over what weird people lied to him stole from him what how did he get to be this bitter person right now I hate to use your name it you're not that's I realized halfway and I've created a scenario that's whole unlike you but you know it's I think of people now in a different I used to think of people angry people used to think of him as I'll fuck that idiot but now I go all that fucking guy he got got fucked over yeah he got fucked over that's most of them Nast of them got fucked over that could have been me me easily tore just have a bad chemical makeup you know some people are just fucking ADHD and think that they're not caring friends they don't remember to call you or whatever it's like that guy's trying to get his shoelace tied yeah yeah yeah or maybe he's OCD and he can't wait to wash his hands again or maybe he's got an Alzheimer's uni can't remember whether he washed his hands you don't mean this most people are trying their best yeah and I think a big part of what's wrong in this world is that we're dealing with a lot of communication that's not face-to-face a lot of a lot of it whether it's you know he said she said shit we're like you know you have a problem with this guy and then another guy tells you he said some shit about you what are you saying fuck that guy you said that I'll tell you what really happened and said instead of like you being alone with that guy well what happened what do you think happened well what I think happened is this and that and you're like well that's definitely not what happened because of this and then he's gonna go oh I didn't know that well I didn't wanted I didn't want to fuck you over I'm not trying to fuck you over hmm well I thought you were okay well now I understand why you were behaving the way you were behaving well it's we're men here let's talk you know I don't like I don't want any enemies I want friends or let's yell a little bit south yeah let's figure this out but so much of today that is excluded from the formula so much of today is people dealing with emails like how much can be like I had to put out a fire between two friends in an email recently one one person was upset upset because they thought some person was doing something shady to them I'm like no no no that's not that's not what happened like okay let me explain I'll do my best but the whole reason everyone anyone's having this conversation is because you guys weren't talking in front of each other mmm-hmm you know and then there's this wonder like how's that guy what is he saying about me when I'm not around what how does he feel about me does he feel like he got over on me does he feel like he did he fucked me over did he disrespect me so much of it is like we're not supposed to communicate any other way other than like you and I are doing right now look at each other in the eyes I know you're not full of shit you know I'm not full of shit and we get to talk that's how people are supposed to be in a little village where you know you just if you had a problem you talk to that person and if you were a shitty person if you were acting shitty everybody knew you were shitty yes and you got a little bit ostracized for it yes yes definitely there was correction and gossip was healthy a little bit gossip with good was good it was like going hey that's Bill he rapes yeah that's the gossip today this guy likes to get five pounds of ground beef stuff up his ass I don't know why do you need to fart cuz Johnny over there he'll give you five bucks if you fucking throw it in his face he likes it what yeah he's gonna beat off while you fart that's it that's what he likes he doesn't want you to touch him just fart in his face and then kick him in the balls he though he's feeding I'll watch those videos of guys that like they like it can't say that I mean they really get kicked in the balls like hard stop I from that guys get their balls stomped with stilettos that's a really common thing stomped a guys lose testicles yeah I know a guy who lost a testicle cuz he got kicked and he didn't have a cup on and he was sparring just like he's like I'll do one more round so he spars and he gets slammed in the fucking sack with a shin and he's testicle burst burst these guys are just letting some chicks stomp on him with a stiletto heel yeah I was fucking around with Dave vada one time and I was in like tenth grade and we were wrestling around and he reached down and grabbed my balls really hard and SQUOZE I'm like a fucking nut he was a little bit of a nut and I remember laying on the ground for like ten minutes being in like the most severe pain I've ever been in my life dude I thought it was sterile for a long time cuz he getting kicked in the ball been kicked in the balls at least a hundred times hard by black belts like I've been kicked in the balls dude like many many many - were they trying to kick you in the balls oh no you clash yeah like say if you're throwing a kick with your right leg and I'm throwing a kick with my right leg when we throw them at the same time and you just we're moving weird sometimes it just goes right in the sack yeah sometimes a kick will deflect you know like someone will be hitting you and you're trying to hit them in the chest but inadvertently they catch part of your leg and it redirects it right towards their balls cups don't really cover your balls that's they do new ones do yeah they also there's a new well there's a company called Diamond MMA and I wear their cup when I do jujitsu and it's a compression short with all these straps built in and this cup that it's got like a like a more flexible foam rubber rubber on the outside and then a very hard rubber that covers the like the outside edge rather and a very hard rubber that covers like those sack and then and then the dick and then it fits very snugly to your body and you could you can get kicked in the balls pretty hard but wow yeah it's a it's a giant improvement yeah but when I was a kid we didn't have that now we had a cup that slid into a jockstrap and a barely held in place and one time I was in a tournament and I got kicked in the balls so fucking I was pretty sure this guy did it on purpose he was he was a mean fuck I was fighting this Korean dude he was very good and very mean and I'm pretty sure he kicked me in the balls on purpose because I punched him in the face on purpose right afternoon I was pretty sure yeah but my ball my cup slammed into my ball so the cup did worse than protect me and then not protect me it actually became a weapon against my ball right so the cup slammed into my ball my ball swole up it was awful it was so it was what were those cups protecting pretty much your shaft but not your balls they do protect your balls a little bit under the ideal circumstances like something comes at it straight on and it hits the cup it's way better they hit the cup than it is to hit your balls by themselves it's definitely better but take a bicycle helmet they made Taekwondo cups that we used to wear on the outside that we're even better because you'd wear them you'd have your your pants on your like your gay pants and then you would put the cup on over the pants and it was they were like more sturdy and they would tie on they would hold them in place and it was a little more material there so it was like it would cover your your junk better yeah but still sack is it's a fucking terrible design it is a bad design outside dangling in midair just waiting to be hurt you ever sit on your ball oh yeah yeah oh yeah you ever cut your dick in a zipper no never no Oh Mike we're underwear officer Donna have the gun fucking commando before a dick in a zipper yeah it's like the crown no the shaft somewhere in the the side of the shaft I caught it in the zipper and it was bleeding oh no sex for a while after that because then you have to explain yeah like what's on your dick fucking cotton zipper you fucking liar you fucking liar you're gonna give me a disease you're such a piece of shit that's why they invented but button fly yeah probably right yeah I think button fly was first was it yeah I think the old divas I think they were all button fly they hadn't figured out zippers yet yeah like zippers like a list guess when do you think they invented the zipper I want to say like the 1800s yeah I think the I thought the original Levi jeans had zippers don't think so now I think they're originally I think that's why they call them the original button fly yeah right like 500 ones ya know 501 jeans yeah button flies I remember dry humping I was a fucking dry hump or in junior high school man machine dude I would go all night I would get it I was I was gifted and you know you g you try to get your cock right right in the middle there right in the spot and then I was perfect and I remember one time I'm getting a scab I got so raw I had a scab on it Jesus yeah did you nut from dry humping a couple of times but I was pretty restrained well you got a if you dry hump the right way to do it is with silk pajamas oh no underwear right you see guys I could go back in time be able to talk to my old sub hey dickhead fucking corduroys why you showing up at some girl's house she's in eighth grade dad answers the door why are you wearing silk pajama pants I'm just really into so reading a lot about trade China and is Irene here she comes down were you wearing underwear you piece of shit what huh you think I'm stupid I'm married I have children

grab a tittie you were so happy I can't believe I'm hold on tit outside the shirt I was yeah now rageous yeah you're so happy like this is so much better than not holding at it yeah this is as good as it gets and then if you if you were a girl I felt bad for girls back then because how annoying would it be that somebody's just what happens know what we're talking about that you're just grabbing their tip and you can't stop like your she's got her bra and you wedged your hand under her bra yeah and he's just grabbing just squeezing yeah that's not pleasurable for her no definitely not but they did it maybe she did liked it maybe she just liked the fact she's naughty yeah hmm so no I couldn't fathom that girls were enjoying fooling around for a long time I really thought that they were just do being nice dude I couldn't imagine that girls like boys like why do you even like me yeah like why do you like boys boys are so gross yeah you know I remember being a kid thinking that man I'm so happy the girls like boys but I don't understand mmm he doesn't make sense like why would they like us it's we don't have any of the good things that they have yeah they have tents have to get wet we're ready we're dirty and gross they were makeup we don't they we're gross we're stupid and we're dumb as fuck if we are dumber too like the whole process of men developing and getting testosterone and going through the whole cycle of adulthood it's just a fact that women mature quicker they're smarter at an earlier age so when you're 15 you got to have a 14 year old girlfriend cuz you have 15 year old girlfriend she's like you fucking idiot damn gotta get someone smarter yeah if I get someone smarter like if you're if you like how many guys who are 18 have a 17 year old girlfriend a lot
