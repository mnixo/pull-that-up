loads yeah come orrible I don't know oh let me know next time you're in a steamy on it you'll be all right right next time you today takes a minute a test and mood this make a video good probably a lot of YouTube forms blah ya know if you just all you'd have to do is just I would come on the desk and just dip your finger oh my god and go like that that's all you would have to do no that's it would be ng I guess it's over it's over that's what you you two would break I'm sure you got the curdled kind where you could just pick up no my loads are very normal turtle time this shit took attract you a lot of water dude oh that's true water really healthy my loads of quite fluid tastes like garlic and this is like back at the academy my alpha male crew right here imagine if dude we're like chicks where I was women have a certain amount of eggs and then that's it it's over imagine if dudes were like that we have a certain amount of odds you know and go see you like checking you look up hold your balls up the Sun see like where your load line is no charge a lot of people that way so did a lot of people that have blue balls that's for sure yeah I can't get can just go pay my loan this have the worst halo next day girls be like come on give me some loan worth it you know I should become it's like a gambling a rational thing guys would go and go to trickle they'd go tantric we squeeze it down never really orgasm if that was a tip your dick and like a lighter oh if that was a case if that was the case guys would have more power and getting laid there it's true that on the girls side of it you know like it's easy for easier for a girl it'd be a whole lot easier for a guy if you only had so many listen if we all fucking band together we can make a strong are you hearing right this yes does it start this right now it's a podcast podcast is powerful yeah it's have a dick union yeah it's hella right here yeah take back your loads save them you know George important they're not a valued right now in the equation but dammit they should be stop wasting them the game radiant the key ingredient in making people oh man without the loads you got nothing that's the problem though it's like that would be like starting a fighters Union like that's not really gonna happen you know but dudes like fuck them yeah that's that's what dudes would say when it comes to the dick Union if we all got together and said listen we're gonna we're gonna we need to make our dicks more valuable okay we need to make it harder to get to let's work something out here boys the first ones are gonna sacrifice big time and the ones that are starting this thing because now they're the only ones not getting laid you start this whole trend you know same as with the fighter union you only one not getting paid I think you're right though it is really target it's hard it's easy to say oh the voters are lazy or whatever they should be honestly like you say they got real lives to live and they haven't got time for all this stuff and that is a really big part of why we want to make it simple you know we're assuming that people want to spend less time doing this stuff not more time right and I think a lot of the kind of organizations and people that have tried to get people you know mobilized you know civic organization and kind of that kind of thing you know it's worked to a certain extent with some people but for the majority of people they just don't want to do it they they can't do it actually they're literally too busy with things that are higher priorities like their kids in their family and their job or whatever it may be hobbies doesn't matter it's stuff that they choose to do and that's fine that's their life and we shouldn't kind of require that you have to spend ages figuring out this political stuff and that's why we're trying to make it really simple for people but based on quite a lot of complex what technology allows you to do you can take quite a lot of complex data and information like we're doing with the campaign finance records where it's literally hundreds of millions of pieces of information and we're boiling it down into one piece of information which is a score like where is this candidate on the on their scale of liberal to conservative whether they sit and where are they on each issue that's what we're trying to do to make it really simple isn't it sort of analogous and a way to what we were talking about about the amount of people that you can keep in your brain Dunbar's number yeah is that if you lived in a small tribe if safe we all live 50 of us together in some small village somewhere we really wouldn't have votes about gay marriage and we really wouldn't have ghosts about exactly there's be a million different things that would never be up for vote and if someone really did start micromanaging everyone's lives you be like hey you know mike is an asshole we gotta kick him out of this fucking tribe this guy's trying to get people to wear purple and you know where certain Nikes during different moon cycles and make tribal rules and rituals and make all these things standard and you know for whatever reason he doesn't like men sleeping with men like he's got some weird thing you know he believes it's part of so true I just so agree with that one of my favorite things that I'm one of the these experiments that happened was in Holland I think I'll get that right um in Europe and they did this brilliant experiment with traffic where they in a town I think it was friesland or something like that probably got that wrong where they literally took away all the traffic signals all of them everything right they took away traffic lights they even took it we know stop signs everything even though the markings on the road so they took away the white line in the middle of the road everything all gone and their theory was that without that kind of external rule making and kind of stuff going on to tell you what to do people would have to kind of relate to each other as other people and just figure it out amongst themselves so they would you know have to sort of look other people in the eye and and sort of work it out between them and they found they had this brilliant effect which was that accidents fell 20 the traffic improved the traffic speed was lower but the traffic flow was much better it just worked all around all the kind of things that you try and do when all these people thinking about traffic planning and whatever they achieved all those aims by literally taking everything away and just allowing people to relate to each other as humans and Earth family rules I thought it's such a great little story and I think that you could do that in all sorts of areas if you just leave it to people to figure out on a small scale where they can relate to each other you just get a much better result
