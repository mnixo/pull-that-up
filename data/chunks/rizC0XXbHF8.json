hello freak bitches dude I just had a Twitter argument with Chelsea Clinton so I know you did yeah it's like these people don't understand never respond to someone who's like way less than you you know she likes to I called her basically I called her parents of war criminals and she was like yeah you know thank you I should have listened more during during the 2003 Iraq war to the anti-war activists but she initially called people who were protesting the Afghanistan war and like the AUMF anti-american and so she was like yeah because there was a story that came out that said Chelsea Clinton actually with like American flags and all these things like went and disrupted an anti-war protest what after 9/11 yeah like a group of like Patriots and cold chill Japan I felt like 22 or something I mean then maybe maybe younger so then people were calling around being like you know like mother like daughter because there's stories of Hillary Clinton like really working hard to quell the protest the Vietnam War protests on campus and stuff as the president of the Republican Young Republicans Club she was approached yeah really yeah just pre or post Kent State this oh good question really good question I don't that was one the whole the break yeah I got it it would be hard to defend it up to that right after people are shot but yeah so Chelsea actually responded to me I was floored because I was like your dad killed 500,000 babies in Iraq with the sanctions and your mom voted for the Iraq war I was like why don't you protest them and she was like you know I was I can question what did you say she just said she was like you know I wasn't really she's I don't think that people protest in the Afghanistan war anti-american she was like you know 140 characters limiting I was like do you see that I just called your parents war criminals and you're actually fuckin whatever whatever WTF just put the blinders on oh my god and then she was like I was talking about the Americans who denounced like you know that America's an imperialist war monger I was like it is the country's an imperialist war mongering country that's killed millions of people usurp the democratic processes of dozens of countries and the world actually think that America is the number one threat to global peace so I actually agree with the Americans you denounce Chelsea nuts so that was a highlight of the day yeah that's not a good look for her now she should probably stay off Twitter for a few years yeah she's it's like dude just just step back I mean you sound awful I know that you're trying to get in the public spotlight and get that momentum behind you I mean people already talking about her running in 2020 no together to come together that week eight hilarya you imagine what they are finding is that there's like two parts of our operating brain and this is you know going to be me paring it down but one is the analytical thinking deciding thing and the other is this social awareness brain which is always like always checking in on how am I in relation to others I mean it's also the car that brain that actually we could like the metacognitive part in the part that I can they call it mind-reading but really it's just it's just by us sitting here I can kind of get a sense of how you feel and what you're thinking right just by the the connection that we have and just it's it's part of we are so when our analytical brain is offline this other one that the social web pops on immediately so so what they're theorizing is that that is like the fundamental need for humans in safety and survival is how are we relating to each other as a group but it makes sense if you look I mean to me it makes sense in you know we are social animals we forget that I think but you look at other species of monkeys or wolves or whatever I mean you know there might be a period of time where say a wolf will will get kicked out of a pack for a while and he'll go do this thing but it eventually come back to the pack it's not safe for us as humans and animals social animals like these to be isolated it's not and so there's all these parts of us that just if we're not connected to other people in a very direct and true way there's these sort of deep down emotional and physiological fears that come up right and then they're real and that's what the neurobiology is showing which is really interesting and we can just think about that but they're actually showing it now that if we're not really connected to each we're going to be freaked out we're not going to be okay and you know I really believe that this really drives a lot of the internal struggle we have and we're really and this is part of you know getting into it that's part of my what I'm trying to bring into the world and my platform now is is just to you know stand up and say hey we need each other and we can do it it's not and for guys specifically right it's such an social stigma of all right not be real or open or connected or vulnerable with guys and and it's it's cool to see the science coming out because it's I have all this anecdotal evidence of being out the wood in the woods with kids or being in a manager with guys or running a retreat or whatever this is of how powerful it is to like set down all of our differences and just be there with yeah but now the science is really lighten it up and yeah man loneliness I mean we cannot think about loneliness isn't fun it's not doesn't feel good but the other this is crazy too that they're showing that emotional pain lights up the same centers of our brain it's physical pain and that one study showed that an insult to someone had much more painful and long-term effects than slamming somebody with a hammer hitting their hand with a hammer so like our emotional pain literally actually exists in the body like it is actual pain and the reason that it's so uncomfortable to feel our emotions which it is you know I mean I'll just say it is that it actually hurts like actually hurts I mean and there's like people say things like you broke my heart or I'm dying of heart ache or whatever but that the science is catching up and showing us that this pain is actual it's real I know you're really interested in this and I am too and the there are some misconceptions and that why shouldn't a their misconceptions I would say that there's a distortion of what's going on and this is not to say it's it's actually to say that it's worse than you think it is well so what most people who are outside of academia think is going on is not quite what's going on what do you think we think it's something worse why no because I've hear her doing lots and lots of people talk about and it's not your fault at all because you're not there and all you do is get the media reports about it so I think what most people I get it from GAD sad Jordan Peterson yeah professors they and day if you listen to them actually they will day themselves we'll talk about it a little differently but people still consume it differently because the news right is all about the crazy thing that the eighteen-year-old said right at Wesleyan or whatever or they're not the 18 year old it's the forty-five year old and then sometime up the 45 year old yeah okay but here's that stuff that really sort of Looney stuff you know that you hear coming out or protest you know people saying that they are going to die because you said a word that happens it does it's all true it's all there I've seen it but I've seen it maybe at most one time a year making the colleges where I've been maybe not even less than that okay what is and if it were just that that's not actually a big deal it's much worse than that what's what's worse is that if that there is a self-censorship going on that's universal and profound constant omnipresent like for instance you know I never talk about my love for boxing around academics or I'm very careful if I do but it's not even that it's that we know that there are certain things that can't be said on a college campus and so we just don't say them therefore there's no need to police us there's no need to yell at us and scream at us in protest what's the motivation for the for which should the people that are holding back on thoughts that maybe they would normally express okay don't well here's what I think it is for the senior faculty who have tenure meaning lifetime appointments cowardice death all it is right they're cowards yeah if you are an adjunct like me with no job security or if you're an assistant professor up for tenure and if you don't get tenure you have no career I don't blame them I get it that's what I've done to police myself because you have to to stay in the game if you have tenure lifetime appointment your senior professor you make the decisions they're on curriculum hiring and firing and tenure the faculty make those decisions and you don't challenge these crazy ideas in any way or if you police yourself you stop yourself from saying things that you you think are right that you believe in you're a coward I'm sorry those people are cowards I do they mean is it's just overrun by cowards yeah yeah yeah no I mean this they are very dope so here's the thing I can't prove this this is just I'm just saying this is this is my belief but I think it's pretty well informed because I've been around these people a long time and in part I share this the I think the worst fear of all those people is being called a racist or a sexist publicly and I think that is their version of being in a cave crawling on their bellies in the ditch black I think that's their worst fear [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
