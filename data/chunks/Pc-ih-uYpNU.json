we're out there ladies and gentlemen without a net the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you today by marijuana totally let's be honest to start from the beginning yeah let's let's say that you know we think a lot of things on this podcast like that was as we you know we have our sponsors we thank people like the coconut water people who are not really a sponsor or a loan where it's not really a sponsor but god damn it we need to thank marijuana yeah we really do and fuck naked coconut water is that toast I was terrible I saw you tweet that oh something totally different - Oh see - oh it's delicious and sweet boy people have had the crappy coconut water there was talk shit about coconut water like why do you drink that are you trying to be like trendy like you have no I had no idea okay I found out for my friend Edwin he came in to jiu-jitsu class and we had it was you know we do mostly no gay Jitsu but every now and then guys decide to have like a Brazil night so they put like keys on it brought coconut water and dude gave me a coconut water and I was like well that's nice and you know I was like looking forward to this fucking watered down elephant load sort of a taste you know it's a terrible taste and instead it was sweet and delicious I was like what the fuck kind of coconut water is this that's how I found out about c2o like I I kept the can and then went online and ordered it on Amazon and I was and as soon as it got there I was like well let's see if this stuff is just like the stuff that he had by the way those cans are hardcore I bet that like like when people would go through trash and they find those they're like oh fucking jackpot I think they're worth like $2 it would be really good if the end of the world was coming you wanted to make some sort of a can draft yeah seal them all up together totally that would work yeah that's hardcore yeah there's that is so delicious like if you've never liked coconut water you need to try one of two things first of all fresh coconut water coconut water that's not passable foods with it already drilled and has a sticker over it and then just peel the sticker off and drink right from it it's great that is the best yeah if you can get that that is the best of it but see - oh is a closed fucking second and what I'm writing like especially when I'm brainstorming in my office I got that little refrigerator right next to my desk I'll drink four or five of those bitches I got to get up to pee like every 40 minutes right but they're so good it's like it like it it when you are working out hard and you drink some coconut water it feels like the best thing ever it feels but Gatorade feels pretty good when you're tired you know and you work out and like you need something something is something that's a little more potent than just water Gatorade feels good but coconut water feels fucking amazing it's so delicious and you feel like you're a healthy Savage out there drinking some tropical fruit juice you know ha it's not even choose its water and it's delicious shit super good for you too I like that when you have the actual coke and I thought because then you get to kind of eat the coconut the inside like you you know see - oh just told me they're gonna send me a new case that has pulp in it so you it's like we had those from Amy and Brian's which I like them like it's yeah it's weird it's a weird thing you're drinking something and there's like little chunky chewy things inside of it hands but I like it yeah it's like goobers yeah I know it's coconut it's like you're getting a little chewy coconut you're getting a little fiber and you know with with the milk yeah yeah I don't know it's I like it it's a weird thing though it's in a quarter - it's like olives you ever had chia seeds like a Chia drink like the stuff that makes the pet grow spray cause look could you imagine feeling somehow whether that was a drug well you know that is the case with morning glories yeah morning glory seeds are like super psychedelic apparently some of them are apparently they've done something to some of the Morning Glory seeds that they sell in certain places you got to be careful that they weren't chemically treated to kill the psychoactive effect of them apparently but if you get like pure Morning Glory seeds it has a very like LSD type effect to it I'm pretty fucked up Brian I lose you know I was just thinking of how I was gonna take that bring this into a fleshlight where we're rolling dude it doesn't take off this logo off your face so they can see the beautiful juror no don't even do that don't even just teasin like in the darkness all right thanks to let's let's fucking mix shit up thanks to Hana calm oh let's go with them first oh the fuck why not why not I guess I could have a boner just kids crazy let's close strong with the flashlight we have a tonic calm that's oh and NIT just in battle robes and kettlebells is the the newest products if you're familiar with anybody who's ever done like any sort of mixed martial arts training have you ever watched like the UFC countdown shows two really popular methods of conditioning are kettlebells and ropes I personally have never used the battle ropes and I'm looking forward to doing it but I'm a big proponent of kettlebells it's essentially the only way I lift weights these days I feel like it it it gives me like what it is if you've never seen it before it looks like a bowling ball with a handle on it it's a giant ball of lead and you know you can get them as light as 10 pounds and you can get them you know heavy up you get 70 pounders and I some dudes can throw around like 120 pounders like big giant crazy dudes really unnecessary though if you want to get a great workout you get a great workout with a 35-pound kettlebell it sounds ridiculous but there are some by the way which is sold out now because we've been talking about on the podcast yeah you can't get it tried buying those videos that we talked about that extreme kettlebell cardio workout dudes are texting me saying then they're sold out everywhere now so I'm glad because it's a really good product and I make no money from that I just want to let you know just letting people know what the fuck is good I think I just got shocked I think you did too I saw you I thought maybe was a spider bite you gonna turn into a fucking Spider Man I thought this was some kind of viral marketing is constitute not it's not haunted we got issues just got shocked you're gonna be okay sweetie anyway on accom go check it out I took my three alpha brains right before the show what does halfa brain is a cognitive enhancing supplement what does that mean it's called a nootropic what they ours are essentially nutrients they're supposed to increase your brain's ability to produce to produce neurotransmitters now that coming out of mind is just really a bunch of noise because I'm waiting too fucking stupid to understand the science behind any of that thankfully there's been some really intelligent people that have sort of deciphered it if you go to audit comm there is a link where you can get and see the science behind on it and the science behind nootropics and I suggest that if you're interested in any sort of vitamin or supplement or anything that you're gonna put into your body you should do a little research on it I mean people don't like to do that so I just like to take things but there's there's a lot of research pro and con about nootropics and about even vitamins I'm a very strong believer in health and nutrition and vitamins I'm a really strong believer in eating really good food but I also believe that you help your body with nutrients I've had personal health issues that I've helped with vitamins I know they have a positive effect on your body you know I think you have to just be careful about what you take into your body on a regular basis and if you're interested in any sort of nootropic formula like whether it's on it alpha brain or bill Romanowski stuff neuro one that i've talked about before or any of a number of mixtures that people put together online just google it google looking that shit if you're interested in getting alpha brain the first 30 pills when you buy any of our supplements first 30 pills are 100% money-back guarantee if you don't like it you don't even have to send back in the product you just say this isn't for me that's how confident we are first of all in the product and how much we really want to make sure that nobody feels like they're getting ripped off that's just a fact and if you buy it and you don't like it and then we're done it's okay it's like yeah everybody's different I could not tell you how your brain functions I could not tell you how your body feels I know for a fact there's some supplements that I enjoy that other people don't enjoy and some shit that they use that I don't I try it and it doesn't do anything for me everybody's system is slightly tweaked in one way or the other so we want me make sure that no one feels ripped off but these are really good products and they're products that I have been involved with long before I was in a business relationship with them I've always been a fan of Epic's and vitamins period go check it out on accom oh and an IT user code named Brogan save yourself ten percent off we're also brought to you by our first and our longest friend this podcast venture the fleshlight I just came already from battle ropes now I don't even have a hard-on for this flashlight why how did you come from battle ropes I was thinking about it battle ropes make you cum girls with really big boobs swinging there's battle ropes around naked I would think that you would be worried about that because those girls maybe could kill you with their hands and the girl could whip those battle ropes around did you know punch like so toys now for girl women really high-end vibrators like big dicks no no I really like really good vibrators now oh really yeah for women the new like some new product a high-end versions high-end yeah like a Mercedes like what is it well not just like a cheap ass you know crappy rabbit or something good in it they actually sell it is the the best one what is there like a fleshlight of dildos yeah what is it is it the rabbit or something yeah you could die over there if you die over there I want you to know I love you what I wanted I'm so selfish I don't care if he dies I just want you to think good about me before you die maybe we should just scared everything now apparently fleshlight house dildo dildos well Brian we would know he is the expert if there's a guy looking for dildos I would say do you think Brian knows what he's talking about I'd be like oh yeah he knows that's a part of Brian's charm he knows shit about dildos like calm they have a thing for female toys and one of them is it looks like oh Jesus okay they I think these are the kinds that are the enjoys or sea-doos would be way happier with vibrators and dildos and stuff if they weren't shaped like dicks it's like the best thing for a woman's pussy was like something you know mechanical and boxy looking and you know I mean like with a tongue and they just clamp it on the clinton and just want me if that was like a real sex toy we would be cool with that I think what trips guys out is these giant monster phallic s-- you know these giant phallic symbols these giant dildos these fake dicks they sell Lilo's now that makes sense they don't make them Lilo's are really high-end vibrators like that's what all the the girls then I don't know or like is that what you're saying get flashlights oh yeah yeah they just sell Lilo's which it is the best those are the ones that you know they're like they're the alien where's alien where's of dildos wow that's really sweet that's cool Brian you're silly bitch you're a silly bitch how dare you anyway fleshlight is being a longtime sponsor the podcast and it's an embarrassing subject for some folks and it's it makes me cringe whenever we have a serious guest on the podcast and I have to mention the fact we're sponsored by a rubber pussy but it's a good product folks right and it is what it is and everybody needs to settle the fuck down all right hit the music use the code name Rogen and then save yourself 15% off they never want sex toy for men that's right bitches and just when you thought it was impossible to that commercial any definitely the Joe Rogan experience Josh Barnett Josh Barnett is one of those old-school savages that will actually try to drive a 1969 Oldsmobile he like drives that shit like it's a regular car like he actually gets on the highway is like I'm gonna go somewhere in my 1969 Oldsmobile so his crazy ass drove all the way from Orange County on the 405 which is stopped dead like a parking lot 90% of the time so he drove that's a big exaggeration it's not even 50% of the time but when it stopped dead it's a mother fucker it is a mother fucker it's hard to wrap your head around how long it's gonna take you because if you look there's like is there five or six lanes on each side some spots yeah these fire yeah at least five maybe six lanes on each side and when I am talking about there's no room it's just all car for miles there's no space in between the cars all the carts so even if big legs started at the beginning they start at the front of the line and that guy moves ahead and the next guy moves behind him they all pick up speed the highway speed you're there for a fucking hour right because it's just just getting these cars to move is insane it gives you this sense of futility it's like you looking at you like these numbers are impossible is anybody monitoring these numbers what happens when they get completely untenable what happens when they're just unmanageable what happens when it's just so beyond belief when there's so many cars no one can move anywhere do we what do we do then we fly I'll tell you what we don't do we don't drive 1969 Oldsmobiles on the highway like they're real cars I'm having so much fun with my card I haven't owned a car that I've enjoyed for a very long time like like I now enjoy like like flying around him in my car yeah well when you get used to a nimble car that can move around we were talking about this earlier like about how old cars are we were I was actually talking about with the staff that old cars like when you see like a 1969 like like Corvette or something like that that's like a work of art made by a bunch of people in a factory you know they put that thing together and they screw those bolts in place and they made that thing and it has like this work of art sort of a quality to it that makes it really cool but those things drive like shit those things are ridiculously bad they did not balanced right they go out corners all fucked up like old muscle cars or the dopiest fucking things to drive ever they're really dangerous for the most part unless you've completely upgraded their brakes you know like I was talking to Bill but bill burns like a 1950 pickup truck it's so cool it's so cool it's it sounds awesome it's like you open the hood that you could climb in there with the engine and you know polish it with a toothbrush I mean it's it's so big I mean the whole thing is just ridiculous and you look at it and you could actually think like oh I could actually work on this car if I had yeah you know like I worked on my car growing up my dad made me work on cars growing up and I actually could see like alright that's the engine yes the you know the alternator yeah that's the clutch yeah dad it doesn't mean that is the thrill about those kind of cars is that you can go to you know some were like dealership you know and buy like old parts for an old Corvette like you'd order them you know I mean you can you can go somewhere like I know year one they make parts for like all old cars they make replacement fenders and make all these they started manufacturing shit because so many people loved like taking old cars and redoing them and this Josh Barnett is silly for that shit he loves it he loves cars if you look at his Twitter it's like all like death metal and and muscle cars Josh button that's a savage he's legit Savage you look at him he's like clearly got some crazy Viking gene thing going on you know he wants to dominate the world it drives muscle cars and Lissa's death metal it's gonna be a fucking awesome podcast Brian I'm excited that's epic but right now he's stuck in traffic so so what's up this weekend's gonna be fun man yeah we're gonna have a great USC and yeah this weekend is a Chael Sonnen versus Anderson Silva to the rematch that that is that's gonna be scary you should stay an extra day and do the rehab thing with us yeah we want to talk about what you're doing because I don't know if I will be able to we're in talks right now and it might no no it's fine it's ready it's ready okay already we already announced on that bye snotty chef I didn't mean like completely to you so write a little bit okay no I will look i yeah we're going every Sunday we're gonna start podcasting live from rehab which is at the Hard Rock Hotel and you shouldn't bring penicillin with you to Vegas no I know it should bring I think it's dangerous I think I have to really like like I'm going to fly and do it and fly oh yeah I think otally you're totally respected cocaine I'm just gonna go all in yeah you gotta be careful that's dangerous right yeah your liver but I guess the DJ is the guy from Jersey Shore which one Paulie no the one I always has a really nice hair you know you know the lam timeout like you're right that's Pauly D yeah is the hair stick straight up yeah that his name yeah yeah he DJ's the whole thing I met the situation yeah we're in he's very nice guy very nice guy give me a big hug really friendly not a bad guy at all III think it's funny he's trying to he's trying to make something out of an opportunity you know came up the kid ran with he's got a great personality people like him you know you can make fun of him all day but that kid the kids making millions of dollars but showing his ass you know and he's just partying I mean it's really kind of cute he ain't a bad guy you know he had a bad guy at all I mean I see him on the show and look followed me around when I was 21 you think I was a way bigger douchebag than that guy yeah and a bad guy you guys have to be UFC and then maybe rehab and then Doug Benson show and show how station Sunday night yeah he's doing a live date type thing or I predict chaos Benson the whole weekend they better not try to smoke weed out of Doug Benson show at the palace casinos okay yeah gotta be careful about that because a lot of people in Vegas are from old-school Vegas learn if you ever fear loathing in las vegas it's a classic work of my favorite author Hunter Thompson and he had that whole thing about they were on their way to Barstow when the drugs began to take hold I mean it's fucking great but that Vegas of like fear and everything was illegal and if you got caught with pot you would do life in jail like if they pulled you over for pot could do 20 fucking years and that's not bullshit and it's probably a lot of people who did probably a lot of kids who got high in California drove on the way to Vegas and got arrested and then spent years in jail I mean it's really scary it's scary to stop and think about that and the people that are running a lot of those casinos those guys have been well I started out the dunes and 69 and then I moved over to you know those fucking old school guys they don't fuck around man you can't be thinking you're gonna light up joints and one of those local casinos yeah you know yeah oh no you just don't do it yeah that's why you just drink but heavily and make really bad decisions and you don't remember anything and it stays there and it's the palace station yeah pal station you know those are all owned by Zuffa oh really yeah well the same guys same guys the 42 brothers I should say the 42 brothers owned Zoo fun zoo phones UFC because that's actually how it works but yeah they they're they got some cash trouble and I'll be safe don't say that no you might be the exact opposite you might be a liability right and might dig a hole for you out there that's like I said listen old-school keep it together keep it together right call no I just don't think that Doug should encourage anybody to spark up I didn't even think of that yeah I'm not I'm gonna have to be in watch this place is we can get away with that I'm the most places know especially Doug knows that I don't think any you can't you can't smoke a cigarette in a theater okay is the same reason why you can't smoke a joint because I don't want you lighting something on fire you're stupid fuck I don't trust you who knows who's got like pure moonshine in there you know they're fucking there soda bottle right and they spill it and then someone drops a lighter on it and we're fucked and there's a blazing fire inside the comedy club oh you can guarantee that's not gonna happen no you can't anything you shouldn't introduce fire into a room packed with people period that's why I don't believe in candles so I love these little things that you've done these little pods then you got these are some little sweet jammies that brian has and he's got these little pods all around the the room where they they recharge yeah they're little batteries in there and they have different colors yeah and they're almost impossible to turn off which really frustrates me how do you get them to change color I'm just moving them around yeah there's no rhyme or reason in the direction like the directions are purposely insane like they don't have anything to do with the project at all and I think they just do it to fuck with you because you're like anyone that buys these they're just gonna trip out anyway you know what we gotta think who would buy these if I was the government this is exactly what I would do I would take the first like GPS tracking devices that we distribute out there into the world and target stoners so lava lamps I would arm those and these fucking silly likes I would go after this donors they need some lava lamp technology they need to put like LCD screens inside the lava and then so like when you're watching a lava lamp it's just like warp TVs or something like that you know what I mean like what if it was like the liquid was like a TV screen oh you know like you can have like that technology that would be annoying they'd be weird but you can have it tuned into anything well you know what it would be cool it'd be cool for a wall effect it would be cool if you projected it on a wall yeah you know yeah I do that most like yeah well they thank you they really project an actual lava lamp all right they project a video of a lava lamp perhaps yeah it's all video you know they don't they don't actually project the lava lamp itself what exactly one of those parties I don't think so maybe a long time ago maybe the those those things are fun man but you can get sunburned and you get fucking drunk out there and gotta be careful they'll fall in and drown yeah just look at this though because you gotta wonder how many people are paying in that water cuz it's not it's not just one look at this shit though this is like spring break it's great and it's just insane in Vegas it's on another level it is on another level of debauchery people are just tightly wound in Vegas is the one place where it's okay to make out with your girlfriend well you know girls start making out with each other for the first time and look at that see right there right on cue well just you get a little of that and while these girls are grinding on each other and grinding imagine podcasting here I don't think that would be good I don't think those are our people I think the only way they would work is if everyone here just branched off and fucked and got this out of your system there's no way you can put on a podcast with so much swing and deck and Percy all over the place is you look how fuck about anything we have to say I'm thinking about I think I can fuck her I think she wants to fuck and she's thinking I think he's gonna fuck me oh my god should I let him fuck me and then you're doing shots together you next thing you know it we're floating the river thing yeah you gotta fuck get that shit out of your system then come down and listen to us assholes Ren you're not gonna be interested why would you be interested in what anything that we have to say why there's so much pussy everywhere that's insane of this this is why the Arabs hate us bro videos like this videos like this get out and they don't even let chicks wear their fuckin regular dresses you have to wear parkas and shit you know it's Islamic fundamentalist they look at this is this is the downfall of Western civilization this is Babylon to them you know of course it's all ridiculous and of course you know the completely hypocritical for the most part the guys even the guys that were on the planes that flew into the twin towers those guys were at strip clubs like a couple of nights before but this is this is what they point to if you want to talk point to the decline of Western civilization they point to all this undisciplined life what they don't understand is they live in a place where you have to be strict and disciplined you live in a fuckin shitty desert you know if you live in a terrible terrible environment and you know and everyone is like really strict and really harsh and mean it's because the environment you live in sucks no one can relax so the only people that survive are the people are like super hardcore if the road ends Vegas would be safer than al lado right because I know I know there's no water or anything really there oh there's Lake Mead oh there's a big lake there I think it's a fake lake though I don't know if it's an artificial lake I don't think it might have been built by a dam or something like that but it's there right and it's awesome and they have striped bass in there you could go fishing in there but yeah I think Vegas is probably safer than LA I don't think they would they're attacking America they want to attack our banking system though if someone was trying to be a terrorist they would try to attack massive population centers Vegas for all its craziness doesn't really have that many people live in there it's a fairly small town it'd be easy to escape well I just once if the shit hits the fan the resources are gonna run dry really quick you're not gonna be able to bring in any food and then it's like what are you eating what do you eat there's nothing there it's gonna be like it really should be which is a desert and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with living in the desert it's just the only way to live in the desert today and this in this world is you have to have modern power you have to have food you have to have supermarkets you have to be able to get water that that has to come to you if you live in the desert because if it's just you live in the desert you kind of fucked there's no food out there how you gonna grow food you can't even there's no water you know I'm saying unless you're bringing water in you can't really live in the desert so the only way to live in the desert is with modern means and when the shit hits the fan if you're living in the desert those modern means would be useless and then you got to get the fuck out of the desert so probably the most like probably the best places then would be something like you know or Michigan yeah not bad but the winter is a problem right transportation is a real cunt you're gonna ride horses back and forth everywhere it's the only way to get around and you don't want to go too far on a fucking horse you know you don't want to do that you don't want to go too far if you have to drag shit if the horses have to drag lumber and stuff you're gonna be you're gonna want to be as self-sustaining as possible I will have dogs you know I'll have sleighs and dogs I'll be like that says it doesn't get that snowy or any County that snowy does make any sense like reindeers you know all those chihuahuas they will all be put to use as horses no they would be tryin t trample on each other and we'd hate them we find out how mean they really are the D biting the ones underneath them Lister trying to pull your sled I was watching old Looney Tunes this weekend because this guy named Fast Eddie told me to watch he's like did you remember eight a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait you know a dude named fasterthan yeah does he try to stick his dick in your mouth no not yet now I don't know that's a rich guy makes you call him Fast Eddie hey what's my name Fast Eddie they call me fast at this one Fast Eddie all right and it's Fast Eddie Felson from the fucking hustler it's Paul fucking Newman that's who it was the guy that original that's Fast Eddie you can't call yourself fast at it that's completely a comedy star do you know who Hispanic guy no but he can't call himself a steady if somebody else wants a coffee cause himself first of all you better be able to play pool bitch you wanna call you so fast I don't think he calls himself I think other people can be they better stop stop just one Fast Eddie Fast Eddie Felson was I talking about Paul Newman the hustler Jackie Gleason no that's what you're talking about bitch I wonder I think it was 63 I don't remember what year it was somewhere in 1960s early 60s but God what a movie man what a great fucking movie and if you're a pool player that's like you know that movies like the holy grail of movies that's the holy grail of pool movies because it was like a really good dramatic film and it captured this guy's obsession to be the best pool player although quite honestly Paul Newman really does not have a very believable stroke he need to stay down the ball a little bit more his follow-through is a little ham-fisted whereas jackie gleason had a real stroke Jackie Gleason could actually run a hundred balls I believe I believe you at least ran 75 balls he was a real player you could tell by the way he would pocket balls like use you know he was he grew up on pool tables here Andy Griffin died today Andy Griffin from The Andy Griffith Show oh that sucks that does suck that's like one of those oh yeah yeah well nobody hated that guy too fucking nice guy he's already buried that he died today and he's already buried Wow because he wanted a immediate burial oh he probably didn't want to be embalmed or something yeah is that possible can you say what kind of craziness is this the universe eats our bodies all right that's just the way it is it's setup there's a bunch of shit inside the soil okay soil is not just dirt soil is alive its alive with minerals it's alive with organisms it's a dead people backs it's a bunch of shit in there that would eat your body and that's what it's supposed to do and you poison that stuff you know poison your bodies and then cover them with makeup so what so people can stare number 10 you're not dead why do you have a dead person with fucking makeup on lying in a bed with a rosary wrapped around their frozen frigid hands just bury them this is craziness staring at a body doesn't do anybody any good what if we totally miss guests like how old their that the planet is and that actually ever all the dirt is just tons of tons of dead people from like billions and billions of years and like the middle there's just one person and that's God he's just sitting there like I'm like in the middle of nowhere well that's you know that's kind of funny because that's what like some there's some beaches that are covered in fish bones like the sand is actually like fish bones like where they have big die offs like what is that something's it's a Salton Sea yes the Salton Sea exactly there's areas I'm D view on personally I don't want to go to that shit we talked about doing a podcast egg whites but we like sobered up I've talked I've talked to so many people since then that coz now that I know what it is that talk about like oh I went there what's it like yeah that's it stinks it's I don't know if I recommend it's alright it's kind of weird but yeah I mean it was a pretty miserable day I'm like oh I don't but it sound good oh wow yeah well if you don't know what it is there's some fucking amazing documentary on it is that who who made that was it the trial something something in pleasures of the Salton Sea do you remember the name of the documentary oh damn it I'm gonna I'm gonna have to look it up because it's it's it's really a fascinating documentary and it was all showing how it used to be it used to be like this amazing resort town are you banging it see that Google that picture that Google car the guy in a car accident one of the woman you just before you change the subject on that that banging thing yeah I tried googling something and it begged me oh yes I won't Google and I did a Google search and through some Microsoft fuckery it became a Bing search yeah it was not I did not do that though I did not turn into a Bing search it then came a thing search I was like wow I don't think I like that I think that's kind of creepy somebody even it was just a I mean that's that's that's fuckery yeah Microsoft's tricky like that that's but that's immediate fuckery I've had this thing for two weeks that kind of shit creeps me out yeah you know let me google it bitch why so scared you know you'll forget about it though you'll be banging your stand getting beaned all the time you want even realize and okarian luck was that google searching dude good how to come down from really high weed quickly that the documentary on the oh yeah Salton Sea Jesus pharmacy Joe I think it's John Waters John Waters he just loves documentaries and hope this hydrations know it's it's it's more of that's a plagues and pleasures of the Salton Sea that's the documentary and the it's it's really a special documentary it's it's really interesting because this area in our lifetime went from being this amazing resort where everybody went to party to being a complete mess everybody moved out it looks like the apocalypse man the video is insane like when you look at what it used to be like everybody was like driving around there's their motor boats and catching fish and they were all drinking and partying it was like some crazy like resort where like Sonny Bono grew up and he was a part of this big movement to try to bring it back and then you see what it became and you realize if that can happen inside our lifetime from fucking Sonny Bono the science share show was on when I was a kid I remember what Sonny Bono died when he went skiing into a fucking tree I was sad Sonny Bono seemed like a nice guy and from that era from his life till now apocalypse the whole thing is just dead fish so much dead fish that the sand is bones there's a there's a bony crunchy sand the whole place just stinks of death they have massive massive fish die-offs we're like a million fish will die and they just they flood like the inland areas so like all the boats have rotten fish around them owners includable are kind of dead pussies you know like just like that bad or if it's just like you know like fishy bad you know or def Joey the most pressing smell ever I don't think you could be happy smelling a million dead fish it's like nature's letting you know there's a terrible thing here this is what whatever's going on here this is terrible it's led a million organisms to shit out and just stop existing instantaneously that's not good yeah but it looks it looks like it used to be awesome it's crazy to watch it looks like it used to be this badass place that everybody would go to and you know you go to get your party on in our lifetime it's become a nightmare and then this documentary though some dudes say it's not some dudes say it's all hype and one guy was in the documentary that actually eats the fish he eats it like sashimi he doesn't even cook it it just fillets it and I was like wow but maybe his body's just like so used to that maybe he's like while he's doing that he's got three cigarettes to his mouth at the same time he doesn't give a fuck about some fucking pollution right you know I mean if you really think about it what if you're a cigarette smoker should you be even concerned about pollution now there's no way it could be possibly as bad as to shit yourself inflicting all right then you're voluntarily pumping that shit into your system eat some dirty sushi me what are you worried about I'm thinking about sushi I just dunno yeah getting sick that last time really scared me away from it I think well you can really fuck your system up if you get a parasite and they say that if you want to be really careful you should only eat saltwater sushi you should only like tuna and you got to be careful with fresh water stuff because fresh water stuff can contain parasites and your water stuff can yes you really should cook a lot of freshwater fishes yeah the certain fish that have parasites like salmon can have parasites you have you have to be careful and you can get we can get sick man you can you're you know you could fuck up your digestive tract you know and you can it's just not good to have little fucking parasites inside your body hunting it up you've really got to see Ted man that was a really really good fun movie and if you're like Family Guy it's just it feels good it I like how you used a lot of the characters in Family Guy that actor parts you know like they're real the real people yeah actors in the movie so everything just feels comfortable it's funny there's a lot of drug use like mushrooms and weed and it you know when I heard that we did good I was I felt like like a good guy one yeah you don't actually like seth macfarlane is a I'd only met him once I did an episode of I think that someone was on fear factor or something like that on the show and I did it on and then they made fun of me in America dad to it so that was cool I wonder what but I haven't tweet people tweet to get him on a podcast or something I'm sure he's busy as fuck now this movie's gigantic now his movie took off but but he's just a genuinely nice dude like when I met him he was like genuine like you could tell when someone's like here's a genuine smile like a friendly dude so it's nice when you know if I know he's doing well but don't don't fucking don't dose how part guys hate him I think it's just they're just you know competitive is that what it is I don't know I don't think they hate him yeah I don't know you know Matt Stone and Trey Parker I mean especially Trey Parker you said you're fucking genius that it's like you gotta like let him go nutty every now and then on things it's just it comes
