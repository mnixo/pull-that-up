raccoon and they hung something shining in front my face and I said yes shiny um it's gonna be even long hidden good people I'm Joe Rogan and this is fear factor stunts you're about to see were all designed and supervised by trained professionals they are extremely dangerous it should not be attempted by anyone anywhere anytime I remember that and under any circumstances don't add shit I said anywhere we want anywhere any time that is any circumstances you would done dit ho you couldn't is like deciding it from memory like what about this shit we've done doing ho and then I have to say

Calogero is gonna be old heckles that are new again right because it's you stay here yes I might already got that shit yeah I almost already I'm already I'm working ready I don't hope not but it probably will but I think we'll survive the good thing about the podcast is the podcast fans buy out the tickets before the retards have a shot at it right so that's what it's gonna keep them out of moves steps on strip we'll see you guys soon and and soon there's a lot of shit going on a lot of shit happening Tommy Segura is gonna go to Montreal and will get a full fold the description of what happened there when he comes back on his podcast which is your mom's house your mom's house on death squad and that TV you can find that shit on iTunes this might be the most boring fucking post podcast interview we've ever done this is no fucking continuity to any of the things were saying where there's no energy bind it fucking will have a lot to offer today but look there's cycles good and bad that's pro and con is ABS and flows the wave that comes in it goes out can i oh this is the wrap-up of the podcast we had a very fascinating podcast with Giorgio from ancient aliens and of course a good time as your bra who's it to just satisfy your your your anus alien thing I'm hanging out with Alex Jones I just want to talk isn't it absolutely having fascinated when I told him that you were coming on the podcast - I do I gotta do this podcast for you I gotta do this podcast for you I've gotta see this guy great the questions for this guy but Nazis and aliens a lot of questions a bell is a good time oh just the first podcast you ever done oh you know what let's just do this like this yes yeah but I've got a lot of old stuff on all right tweet that I'll retweet you've done a lot over the phone yeah this is what I mean sure it's definitely way to take a picture listening to me right here this is the first time I've ever done a podcast like this we get to go deep deep deep into the crazy bin cuz you I told you you broke my crazy meter with the Ark of the Covenant I love it it's never happened before I think that that's caught after that I was like what the fuck is he saying he said it was a fucking vending machine yes an extraterrestrial one nonetheless that's pretty crazy stuff man what is it like living in the end you you your world is overwhelmed by all this speculation and crazy stuff and any and things that most people will never take seriously but yeah you're you've spent on incredible amount of time and all these things what does that like well I mean look I it's it's bizarre I mean I barely I rarely go to conferences because because there's so much weird stuff going on it's even weird for me yeah you know inside and that's the thing that you know I'm just some dude I'm just a regular you know guy and the moment I hear about you know you know crazy crazy stuff to me it's like you know slow down a second here because this is how are you gonna lose the mainstream because just to talk about the potential of a possibility that ETS were here dude that's fucking enough that's enough that's enough you know and so you know you don't need vending machines through space what about you make your line what about the stars like Mexicans oh my stall Mexicans can't nobody they're not possible because you can't even put a dollar bill in between the fittings in better I get my face oh that's rep sir Freddie Lockhart and I was just talking about keeping the pimp hand strong he was just telling me how he keeps a pimp hand strong and I gotta admit some high level shit he knows what the fuck he's doing he knows he's doing it's like as a man who's grown up with it dude did your dad have strong command extremely it's still strong it works on me still yeah so you could tell man you understand the psychology behind a pimp and the pimp into strong Asian you know if you don't use the pin/pendant things get out of control you get taken advantage of yeah you end up a dazzling your iPhone you've got to realize this nature in this life and women want men and men want women and occasionally a woman wants to be a man and a man wants to be a woman and that's a catastrophe and when a woman wants to be a man and you're a man you usually submit because she has the pussy and then you're not a man anymore she's the man when someone's telling you what to do that person to man with your sales your manhood Alysse out your manhood over lease that you're a little pussy and some companionship don't lease out anything that's your happiness rely on anybody for anything ever that's our public service message of the day now that I'm back on NBC the more you know keep the pimp hand strong the more you know like rainbows and shit my pants ready lock are on Freddie Lockhart has a brand new podcast folks for those of you watching this video blog we don't actually listen to the podcast because you ain't got that kind of time I understand you're out there

and I started over a year ago year and a half ago it was terrible we were awful the first couple of podcasts are unwatchable no no snowflakes and we're like reading off Twitter what is he saying as well with this guy Willie it was like so dumb and boring yeah he let me know the first the second one is I snuck in and Twitter so much disappear listening to this on you know your iPod a couple days later yeah this is not exciting yeah so I was like yeah right I'll bleep oh yeah yeah you got to leave to it but yeah I think the third time we we just did it more relaxed the second time is almost like it's a radio show are going to be professional but then the third time is like yeah just shoot this shit and see where it goes we had one mistake that we did will we let people in the chat were oh we let a chatroom rather than we like read the chat room there's also their cotton eager cunt of craziness fuck you fighting we'd have to ban this guy and this gummy spam and show me your cock drove over so crazy they just they just want you to acknowledge them they want their name to be said yeah so we have figure it out we have figure out you can't talk to them and you just got to kind of do your own thing and you gotta listen to feedback you learn from some feedback that you got a you know you also got to like insulate some people for having an impact on the show part of it CEO they're goddamn crazy it's fascinating there's so many nutty fucking people out there and when you have a podcast you can bring those nutty people together yeah on a death squad label I ran into a guy in San Diego who's listen he was telling me everything about it should I forgot about like I'm this the first one we did oh man people love it man it helps him get through the day yeah if you have a

went in depth and you you did it without any worry about how ridiculous I didn't apologize for any of it you just you just jumped in there it's easy when you're just telling what happened you know I'm saying it's like I didn't have to it is but it's not yeah well maybe not how you do it but it's so I mean I didn't have to make anything up you know it's just that's what happened to me out there it sounds like complete utter or shit but for sure it's just because it's too crazy for our reality it's too crazy for our reality but that was the beauty of the way you told it is that even though sounds like complete utter shit like on paper yeah you're reading you know what but the way you said it was so sincere and so so honest and open about it like you know just like this is what happened
