[Music] boom and we're live what's happening baby what's up Joe Hawaii brother I'm feeling great man thanks for having me you're looking great thanks you're looking rather large I threatened Joe before the show I said you need to start off and tell me how beautiful I am strong and pretty is that your t-shirt company yeah that's my clothing company it's all through bunker branding and basically that's this like a fist from your face I'm afraid everyone's gonna hear me breathe like a fat guy how much did you do any cardio I do most definitely yeah yeah if you watch strongman on yeah so like when you pull a truck that's 70,000 pounds you pull it for a hundred feet with a harness restraining your chest like like not expulsion but your chest expansion mm-hmm it's that's that's the hardest cardio I've ever done I played football for a long time so I mean yeah I can only imagine but I was thinking that like you have to have some cardiovascular strength to do some of those routines some of the some of the different challenges you guys have to do for sure and normally like worlds we'll start with like what we call load medley so you'll have normally like four implements like you'll have two kegs and two sandbags and the kegs will both weigh 265 pounds and the sandbags will be 330 that's what we did last year which was fucking brutal but um you'll have to load each one of them onto a platform that's about 60 feet away so you know if you get going it's not just cardio you have to have diaphragm strength to like if you've got a weak diaphragm you're just gonna fold I've seen guys blackout oh and I've seen guys blackout at World's Strongest Man so what is it how does it how does one strengthens their diaphragm um what we do the normal exercise we did it doesn't really have a name it's just kind of something we made up you'll lay on your back and you take like a sandbag and put it over over your upper abdomen and you'll expand you'll push out really hard and would you try and hold it for like say it say like two minutes and you learn to take tight little breaths while flexing your upper abdominal abdominal whoa I can smoke so you've got the weight on you right and you just yeah and you stay flexed and it's it's like you know how you see fighters taking punches like just keep tight same similar thing and so like me I have a big barrel gut like a big chest and gut but like it's solid I literally get like I'll brag a little bit i've got side abs in the morning sometimes yeah actually I gotta say this I the best compliment I was ever given I put up a post and it was me drinking coffee in the morning just naked but like from like the hip up and somebody gave me a compliment that's actually comes from something you said they said damn Roberts got a really good dick route I think I've been too dick route dick Cruz when those dudes I don't understand what dudes do that they wear their shorts so low that you basically see the top of their cock see the route they've got nothing else to show so that's a weird weird move if you feel a dick route that's all it comes up on the dick bro this is a weird thing I mean when did guys start doing I get girls doing it I get it right I just don't get guys pulling their shorts all the way down low like that seems like you're just asking to get pantsed like I don't understand like sagging I guess it like it comes out of prison culture from what I heard but I hate it now but I feel like an old man cuz I used to do it as a kid used to sag well I grew up in an area it was like it was a very low income like area I don't know how to say that politically correct so uh like everybody was sagging yeah my boxer shorts under no you have to you've learned see when you start off with tighty whities and then everyone makes funnier than you like oh right so you switch to boxes what a weird like style yeah I ran out of that by the time I was like 12 though he's like this is ridiculous well my problem is like if somebody like grabs your pants like you're done like you're gonna have to reach for your pants and then they're gonna punch you in the face like this is a tech you're like asking to Europe you're like at a handicap yeah you sound exactly like my father right now exactly what do you would say you're gonna get your ass kicked yeah I have friends that tried it like even 10 15 years ago what guys my age I was like what the fuck are you doing that's too late don't the thing now is skinny jeans and sagging which is like a counterproductive way like it just doesn't seem like it goes to go right they're trying to combine styles they don't understand what they're doing right yeah well I mean if they've got a good enough dick route then maybe that's what it is like they just got to show the quad like do you wear regular jeans or do you wear like them the stretchy type jeans these are challenging yeah I love those man you can't go back to regular jeans right once you wear like rev towns or you know barbells or any of those comfy you fuck all those regular jeans you can't man now I mean I've ripped so many jeans done sitting down you know I think with your size like it must be fucking so hard to just find clothes right and no and I'm built differently like my waist is like a 40 but my end seems like a 34 and so normally like if you find a 40 waist it's like a 28 or a 30 leg so it's like four shorter like chubby guys yeah so yeah you know still say fat guys and no one gets mad have you say fat girls people like hey yeah so am I so insensitive the fat guys don't catch a break fuck about fat guys deal with the fat guys sometimes - that's a difference like fat girls will pretend they're happy they're fat but they're really sad on the inside so there you go but fat guys especially if they drink they're like high-pressure Bert Kreischer does not seem to give a fuck that he's fat no he does not have a problem with it no my shirt off the moment he gets on stage doesn't get home on daytime TV yes he doesn't people get mad at him well if he doesn't take your shirt off people make you lose your shirt dance monkey yeah take it off that's a part of your gig it's like what's his name a Gallagher without a watermelon right no sledgehammer get the fuck out who was speaking of him what are you guys thinking for a sober October we really haven't decided yet the burnt wanted us to do some dance contest he could suck my dick cuz he wanted to do that so he could just win without working hard I just take his clothes off right no chance but notice how about this what if they found a way to like score a dance thing in a note like so there is no judgement and it was like points based on athletic types of movements or something like that I'm sure like the internet could come up with a way that it's like because I understand what you're saying and what you're saying makes total sense about how like you earn that shit you want it to be regulated myself last year because last year we literally were killing ourselves yeah we were working out seven hours a day and I was just trying to grind those guys in the ground I was like I'm just gonna take you to deep water and see it was awesome and I loved it I fucking loved it I couldn't stop watching well Bart was talking shit and that's when I was like oh I cannot have this guy win this is not gonna happen that's what you fuck up I knew Ari was gonna be a problem cuz he's crazy Ari tried really hard hmm but he doesn't have a lot of experience grinding like that it is best hung in there you're a vet with that shit yeah Bert's trying to win this with fucking style points he didn't fuck off no no I think if if the if somebody can come up with a way that dancing is like regulated in a point system that does nothing to do with people's opinion to where like it's I don't know even how you would do that where it's like there's an athletic type of movement that's required for this so learning that takes this gives you that gives you points that's the only way it would even work what it wasn't based on someone's opinion it's too much time - that's the part of the problem it's like learning how to dance like I did a movie once zookeeper and I had to learn how to do this elaborate dance with Leslie Bibb that shit took forever it took weeks and we and you were like constantly training and drilling and going over the movements and and I don't even like that kind of like like if I'm doing martial arts and I'm training I'm interested that's like I love that I want to I want to get better at it I didn't want to get better at dancing I just wanted to be over we just wanted to film the scene so I could fucking relax ya know move on yeah so I don't know what we're gonna do we have decided hmm we're all waiting yeah that's I said we should have a hold your breath competition Oh that'd be cool yeah your water that needs practice I mean I think you guys have you have to add something in my favorite part of it was seeing you be like nah fuck this like we'll all go to the gates of hell yeah that's me like if someone if some I love talking trash right like that's my thing and in strongman it's not very popular like when I got it oh no they don't it's very old-school like you're supposed to do your work not act like you're supposed to get paid not act like you're supposed to want any attention not draw any attention towards yourself really it's like it's like karate in like 1960 oh my god you know be respectful of the way and I totally get that I understand that and it I mean I don't think anyone can get to the top echelon without having that respect but it's it's ridiculous for people who've never been at that on that on that level to tell other people how they're supposed to behave right if I want to talk shit I'm gonna talk shit I thought I was talking shit to you or just out of class that's just what we do yeah it's fun talking shit is fun and also it's like I feel like that makes it more entertaining and we want more eyes on the sport exactly I mean that's what I my argument about the UFC I always like it when people talk some shit right and and win or lose sometimes you have to eat that like what the kid that Ben Askren exactly a flatline brutal but I mean he also took that on the chin he put up a post like right after that like well that's suck yeah he takes him better than anybody he's got a great personality yeah massive it all said is not even over listen he goes I don't like that dude he goes if I see him at Whole Foods he's getting smacked down oh shit imagine the guy flatlines you with the fucking fastest ever ko in UFC history and he's promising you that if you're looking for Brussels sprouts a smack in the face yeah he already gave him two extra shots to the face which by the way people are giving him shit for its that's his job yes it's go to the referee stops you well especially when there's a heated contest like that way you talk so much shit and he insulted Maz vidal's manhood he talked about this in the ethnicity we said a lot shit that really pissed mom's butt all off right and he's like why didn't he had a statement I was like why is it okay to talk all this shit online about me before the fight but then after I knock him out I'm not supposed to showboat I'm not supposed to celebrate right the fuck I know if you got a problem with it stop him winners get to do what they want he's ice cold man when he said and it's not over if I see so intense Savage that was so brilliant because Askren always grabs your legs and if you kick that close to him he's gonna think like almost like he has to grab you right it's his instinct and you saw him like I saw somebody put a video up in practicing him he would be rounded or bike out to the outside and then acted as if it was gonna be just a normal step and then it's two quick steps on me oh and you see how stiff he was before he hit I'm sure you saw but damn he was still out what his head was up and one leg was up I mean he was staff though that was a right here at here he is practicing yeah that was an absolutely ko and it's the fastest ever UFC ko at five seconds but really he was out cold at two oh yeah yeah yeah I mean he just took the rest of few seconds to get there yeah whatever maybe three I guess maybe I mean whatever it took for him to run over there it seems like two seconds who's like one one-thousand two it's over oh yeah fuck at least he got a lot of face time before you got in the ring yeah you ever thought about fighting his bigs you are um I mean I I messed around with like wrestling stuff and I work with John Jones with the supplement company for a while oh really yeah and I know a lot of fighters I know a lot of old school wrestlers I've got a lot of like friends in the industry but um I'm fucking both school wrestler wrestlers or pro rest the pro wrestlers sorry yeah yeah the totally different thing yeah just it's so that would be a great Avenue for you to write I did think about that for a while - it's just contractually it's just it's a shit show I'm sure like injuries and all that stuff - would take you out of competition but plus they want my man now I started and worked my ass off just to get like a little piece of that pie and when you go to the WWE or something like that you have to step back all the way all the way to the ground level you have to earn your stripes and I understand that but like I have I have a son have a family I take care of people I can't give up everything that I've earned like basically breaking myself for five years breast to crawl back up and hopefully you know end up where I am but you know it's it's a cool thing I also almost a big fan of wrestling when I was a kid you know back in the day and uh you know like I loved watching it got one of my buddies right now a guy who was a strong man with me his name's braun strowman and he's in the WWE he's a he's a badass so I loved watching him do it sometimes do you follow pooja now ski fighting in MMA I haven't I haven't seen a lot of his name and my stuff I know I know him he's he's freakin crazy these fucking people up to men he's he's really getting better like when he first started fighting he was just this giant dude who was just swinging arm punches and if he hit you he would fuck you up but he got crazy and he decided to fight tim sylvia who was a former UFC champion and tim beat the shit out of him he was horrible Wow like I don't know why he thought he could beat tim sylvia tim was washed up or older oldest him now yeah well how long has he been out of the game he's definitely in his forties I don't know how old is Tim Tims jaw yet now for today see that's me I'm 400 pounds I can't yeah I cut both my legs off to make 265 I think that's so weird that they have a 265 cut off because heavyweight is supposed to be the biggest guy right like in boxing remember that dude value of who fought he who'd he fight me fight Holyfield he was like seven feet tall his giant ass Russian dude he was fucking enormous his boxer but he was well over 300 pounds 7 foot tall it'd be skinny at 3 yeah but he was big man he had giganticus or whatever when you mean pituitary gland tumor yeah what is that see if you find that guy value of I think he fought Holyfield I think Holyfield beat him for the title which is even crazier when you think that Holyfield started his career at 109 he started his career as a Cruz really 95 pounds I don't know that yeah yeah that's it here's the guy look at this Evander Holyfield and value of and this is in 2008 look at the size of that guy man I mean get the fuck out of here he's so big man but I think when guys are that big like with that giant Titus or giant Titus it they're always hurting like everything hurts your knees hurt your elbows it's like you can't really move that good yeah I know a lot of guys under the giant was my hero of growing out Lenny was like my first real hero and I knew a lot of guys who had known him actually met Rowdy Roddy Piper like three weeks before he passed and it was when a man Andre the Giant shirt and we we got to sit in the VIP section at a baseball game and he was badass man he was so cool I wanted to get that guy in the podcast and Tony hang stuff was actually trying to set it up but then he died yeah he used to go to the comic store a lot yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he even went on stage a couple times there yeah he would just tell stories man it was awesome he was he was like one of the first guys also to crossover in the movies obviously Andre was first he did a few yes possibly yeah yeah but he was the star of they live remember that which is a the Cotton John Carpenter movie that's a great fucking movie huge yeah so he was in that cool he was a fun guy man yeah well actually um what I was what we're doing the whole basically the reason I was here to talk about TV show this next season season two we're gonna do we so i'll start over we the whole TV show is based on us doing acts of strength throughout for strong men throughout history so what is the name of the show called history strongest man and strongest man this is an ESPN show it's on history history that's awesome so um one of the episodes is next season we're hoping to do is Andre the Giant which we're going to talk about but what we do is we travel to where a historical strong man lived or where he did this famous feat of strength and we we recreate those feats of strength and we kind of talk about who they are as people and stuff and bring the light like a lot of the cool aspects that most people lose so it'd be cool to you know take somebody like Andre the Giant and meet with his daughter and figure out like little parts that people haven't really paid attention to and bring that to light mm-hmm we did one of my favorite episodes we did was this guy Peter Francisco who was he was born in it was think it was Columbia I'm mistaken Pierre didn't Cisco there we go the Virginia giant and Portugal there you go so he was born to like a wealthy family and was kidnapped and sold as a slave and he ended up in in America and at 16 he signed up to fight for in the Revolutionary War he was six foot seven six foot eight just this giant of a man especially seventeen said well yeah there was nobody that big back then you know like a lot of people don't realize Jack Johnson former heavyweight champion who they called the Galveston giant I think he was only six three or six torso up Jack Johnson see how big it was towered over everybody else he fought yeah like Rocky Marciano was 185 pounds 189 pounds like somewhere around there sir says he's only six foot tall but what that's what Google puts popped up from his like Wikipedia hmm I think he's a little taller than that but he was a giant back then right they called him the Galveston giant well everybody was so poor then they didn't have any food right you know the turn of the century know everybody that's crazy that's crazy Louis was six to Jack Dempsey 61 Wow and Marciano I think was 5 10 5 times believe is 5 I think Marciano is 510 185 pounds it's crazy because Jack Johnson towered over everybody was fucking everybody up I mean it's a food thing man no one had any fucking food back then if you look at the size of the people that fought during the Civil War they were tiny ass people right like really time like 125 pound men I don't even go back further all the skeletons picture him like they're making it out like he's giant like look at the picture on the right look look at his back his is pretty direct yeah sure when he's jet definitely jacked for I mean look he's he's big but I mean in comparison to a real heavyweight today like if you put him next to Anthony Joshua right you know like Josh would be tower Deontay Wilder was six was he six seven yeah yeah or Francis in Ghana you know big giant dudes real legit giant dudes people weren't that big back then so that guy the wrestler the the Portuguese guy that must have been unbelievable to see someone that big back yeah yeah and what was cool is like there's a lot of cool things that you find out like George Washington had a quote on his gravestone that was said that there were several battles that we would not have had to go the same way and we don't know if we would have even been able to win the war if it wasn't for him I was a one-man army and for George Washington to say that that's huge that's crazy so it was cool to get to talk about him and all the things he had done and bring you know show a little love for a guy who I'd never even heard of yeah and like there was the story he was on the battlefield and he was pulling people off of horses and like basically beating him to death because we ran out of bullets and then he goes marching up towards this guy who pulls his musket out to shoot at him and the musket misfires he takes the musket from him and beats him to death with his own musket oh my god stuff like that or when the when the battle was over they had a cannon stuck in the mud and this is one of the feats of strength that we did they had a cannon stuck in the mud and he didn't want the British to end up with it so he just yanked the thing off of the wheels puts it on the shoulder and marches off with it how much did it weigh it depends depends on the story that you believe when when we went I don't want to get too much into it but when we went that's the biggest question was because anybody who's ever lifted a bunch of weight and thrown things around it's like that sounds pretty crazy because cannons can go from anywhere of like like a normal field cannon will be like 300 pounds but they've got field cannons from that era that are a thousand pounds and and depending on who tells the story that's what you fed will we try and figure out whether the fuck would you even get that on your shoulder if it's in the mud so you're standing the mud so you don't have a firm ground to push off against right so we're in the park or squashing around the mud and you got this giant cannon you're trying to throw in your shoulders no handles fucking a man and right after a battle - the guy was the guy was a savage it was it was really cool and like afterwards he he up a wealthy man was taken care of you know and it was it was a really cool story so it was I was like actually pretty proud to get to tell that one and that's awesome a lot of them were like that how did you get involved with doing strongman competitions I played football I played football for a long time and then you know football was done with me and basically I was just I didn't want to have a real job just to be totally honest I'm not a nine-to-five sitting an office guy I think anybody is I don't think so either I really don't know it's terrible way to live and so there's people listening right now they're like get out yeah well you can get out I'm telling you I can one of my best friends to quit his job and come with me to China for a week and then of course you have to struggle and find your way but then after that it was it was the best thing he's ever done yeah definitely better off being a nomad yeah just find something you feel better you know exactly like I was talking to a friend of mine today about Thailand about it like when I went to Thailand last year kind of like reshaped my idea of like what makes people happy because everybody over there is wearing flip-flops and fucking shorts everything is real cheap foods real cheap there's no extravagance and everybody's happy and like my friend John Wayne Party says it's the Land of Smiles that's what he calls it mm-hmm and I was like okay he lived there and trained there for a long time but I'm like well I didn't get it until I went there and like god damn it everybody's happy but you'll drive by you'll see like a fucking kid a baby sitting on the gas tank of a motorcycle while guys drive in and the lady's behind him and she's she's holding on to the guy's waist and he's like got one hand on the handlebars in one hand on a baby and I'm like what in the fuck am I saying they're wearing flip-flops you know and they're just everyone's happy I only been to Thailand but it's like that in parts of China like rural rural parts of China it's a lot like that I've seen like people tied to each other on a on a motorcycle bill burr sent me a fucking horrible video yesterday of this guy these two guys are riding like assholes on a bridge like with motorcycles weaving in that track and one guy loses control of the bike and he hits the cement barrier on the edge of the bridge and then goes off the edge oh my god yeah just watch it bang when he flies off oh it's like all I've been seeing the last week - we just did this here it is Jamie God already Jamie's the fastest Googler in the West you're on it see these guys are fighting look at this oh he touched - yeah you see him put his foot down and try and collect himself watch yeah and watch when you see when they pull over and you get to look at how far this motherfucker dropped like he's done that's a guy's got a word on his pockets of course it's florid it looks like it sure it's Florida fucking assholes Florida probably landed right on an alligator now shoot up yeah I read a story in Florida but Tampa called it of course ma'am ass man I was there for two weeks I was scared shitless the whole time I've been everywhere it's Florida I was like paying attention to everyone everything fucked up happens there they they just issued a shoot-to-kill on iguanas they're trying to get people to kill as many iguanas apparently there's so many iguanas there that they're digging holes under bridges and roads and roads are collapsing yeah buildings are collapsing look because they're digging they're digging trenches under the foundations that's so crazy and they're big like five feet long what do you got what's the smile on his face Florida guano hunter mistakes pool boy for wanna shoot them get your shit together guys come on not going to happen my sister lives the floor she's probably listening to this Laura get out of there run run for your lives it's a fucking goofy place to live man it really is it's so crazy it's a goofy place to live but for people like like chaos and party and it's fun yeah that's what it's all about yeah my friend Billy Corbin he made cocaine Cowboys 1 & 2 fuckin loves it down there mm-hmm and he's a smart guy and he lives in Miami and just fucking loves it he enjoys the chaos yeah I mean I guess if you can separate yourself enough that you don't feel crazy on the inside I don't know how you can I couldn't do that here in LA like I mean la is not even a quarter of that but like I lived in Playa del Rey and a Sherman Oaks for two you have two and a half years I was like I gotta get the fuck you know what the problem with this place is there's so much instability because there's so many people that want to be something other than what they are right that's a big part of this place where is that you live in Texas now yeah those are just those are people those are real people I fucking love Texas there there are people they don't have any illusions of becoming famous from some fucking reality show or if they do they're the anomaly they're not the norm out here it seems like everybody but not everybody but a giant percentage of the people that came here came here with some dream they came there some dream of being an actor some dream of being famous some dream of you know of making it and then they got jobs and so there's like weird instability and this this need for acceptance and this need for recognition and you know you go to Montana you don't get any of that get regular people you go to Colorado well Colorado is now filled with stoners Colorado things now it's getting a little different yeah well now now that the shrooms are all illegally yeah what's gonna trying to bring in wolves my friend Johnny Hamilton told me they're trying to bring it they're trying to stop mountain lion hunting and trying to bring in wolves really yeah what yeah well they brought in wolves in the 90s to Yellowstone I remember and that was really lovely right well it depends on who you ask the wildlife people think it went really well because it did a lot of great things in terms of like it preserved a lot of plant species that were getting decimated by elk and deer the problem is like it happened so quickly that the elk and deer really didn't understand what was going on until they were decimated right and they you know in some places they've lost more than 50 percent of their populations but then other people say that they really should have never been that high in the first place it's hard to understand who's because like you try to be objective but you know I hunt and I eat a lot of elk and deer so for me I from hunters that it's a terrible thing but then you hear from people that are concerned with balance and wildlife ecology and a balanced ecosystem they think it's a good thing and so it's a very it's very controversial they don't think there ever should have been these giant herds of elk you know like a thousand elk in the field they think that's on you that's unnatural and that's akin to what apparently what they experienced when a lot of the Native Americans were wiped out by plague when the European soldiers arrived when they talked about these great herds of Buffalo like millions of Buffalo they think that the reason why there were so many Buffalo was because like literally 90% of the Native Americans were killed by European disease right and so these Buffalo for the that during that time period that happened they just bred like my friend Dan Flores wrote a book on it really really interesting shit because most people just assume that that's just how it was back then the Buffalo were everywhere and then the white man came shot all the Buffalo but apparently the Buffalo were only all over the place because the white man came and gave diseases to the Native Americans right it's fucking nuts man so the balance issue so I don't know if it's a good idea to bring wolves around people that are on mushrooms either fact that - if it was me I'd try and pet it I'm reaching out to the forest our friend of mine she lives in a place in the mountains above Boulder and there's mount lines in my neighborhood like when I was living up there a mountain lion ate my fucking dog and she she was like well I just set my intention when I go into the forest and I left the forest no I embrace it I'm here for you she was a yoga instructor yeah she might be she might be a little crazy rest in peace she's still alive apparently still alive yeah namaste mountain lion yeah yeah that worked out great for Siegfried and Roy right there's already cut the Colorado already has some wolves that have been in Colorado they're they're entering in the fringes and from other areas where they're they're present like my oming you know in Idaho there's there's wolves there neighboring Colorado that will eventually make their way in the car righto if they give it enough time the reintroduction of wolves the issue with that is like its abrupt and the animals might not know what's going on and they also make a lot of money off of their hunting like the the tags and all the the economy that comes from people that hunt there Colorado's a big hunting State mm-hmm so it was a last I heard it was those there was the big arctic wolves they were bringing into Montana right yeah they're bringing in from Canada into Montana okay but they're just wolves like it's weird it's weird is it gray wolf fur it's a gray wolf you know it's it's just a wolf it's like but they are bigger when they live in colder climates because it's a mammal thing like mammals like deers if you like a deer in Texas South Texas a deer a big deers like a hundred plus pounds 150 pounds whereas if you go to Saskatchewan if it's cold as fuck those deer like 300 pounds when they're fully grown like a big males like a 300-pound deer which is crazy yeah I'm more than double the size but it's because of the cold right I never thought about that make sense I love Texas well party you live in I'm a New Braunfels which is right outside of San Antonio oh nice I've never been in San Antonio it's nice man a San Antonio is a cool City we're actually right between Austin and San Antonio oh that's great oh it's perfect weather's like that Riverwalk area supposed to be dope that's cool I mean that's like the tourist thing you know it's like what they do it's like going to see the Hollywood sign like there's if you if you want to have a good time just let me know when you come on Texas and we'll go do some redneck shit well my Brent my friend John Dudley was just there with the black rifle coffee guys yeah and they went to some ranch that's just outside of San Antonio that the fucking astronauts used to go to mmm he said these photos of Neil Armstrong with a fucking deer that is a uniquely American place like when other I think when other people think of America they really think of Texas most people I mean I know if they're thinking America they'll say that it'll be Texas but if it's if it's like Hollywood they'll say California you know right those are the two let some people like every once in a while think New York but I think when people think about like crazy gun-toting screaming at football you know like that's Texas yeah guarantee yeah 100% dry products what it's a fun place yeah you know a lot of fun lot less regulations a lot more self self accountability you know yeah well they have fucking zebras and giraffes and shit everywhere they're loose yeah running around I work with um with a but just became a credited zoo that works a lot with confiscated animals like they've got hundreds of animals that basically some redneck was like oh I'm gonna have a white lion can't take care of it so they take it this is folks who walk they've got hi in this abandoned house and they were in the house in Texas and they're wandering around this house smoking weed and they walked into a room with a fucking tiger in a cage oh they call the police please come and rescue this fucking tiger but this was an abandoned house oh shit oh my god yeah there's a just I mean they weren't sure like here you find it here oh you got these goddamn pop-up ads they're getting craftier and crafts here with these pop-ups and then you don't know if like clicking exits gonna download something Texas man look at this Texas man enters abandoned homes smoke weed finds tiger and starts fuck yeah he said it was in a Reiki Day cage in the homes garage but that's weird when you treat animals like property you know when you can just do whatever you want with them and that's how Texas that's how Texas views exotics anything that's not like if you're if you have white-tailed deer in Texas they have pretty liberal tags like you can shoot a good number of them but you have to get tags right but if you have like a black buck which is a African animal or an eel guy or something like that you choose many as you want right yeah they just you do whatever you want you sell them to your friends what does it say it was secured only with a screwdriver and a nylon strap I hope this guy got some kind of fuckin punishment the guy who owned the fucking house yeah as a dick man yeah that's a beautiful tiger yeah something really fucked up about seeing Tigers locked up I I don't even like the fact that they feed them I mean I feel like you just let some loose in there yeah that's what I was saying yeah that's what I was saying but from what I was rolling yeah exactly what I was told was that that was just not PC like it wasn't acceptable I'm sure do you do you ever see the footage of when the US soldiers overtook Baghdad they had they had zoos and Baghdad and what they would do is that the Lions knew it was happening so they would let these goats out and these goats would be wandering around and then they would open the door and the Lions would sprint cuz they knew exactly what this is feeding time oh these goats had no idea they let the goats out and the goats like oh just hanging out being a goat and then they would open up this fucking door and US soldiers filmed it oh and these Lions just make this fucking mad sprint to these goats and just Mahlum and that's how they ate huh people shouldn't be pissed that's what it is if you watch a fucking you want you go and see a parrot eatin seeds that's what it eats right you know may-maybe really identify with seeds and you feel like it's brutal murder murder of seeds yeah that lion wants to do that that's what makes them a lion it makes him happy and it's it's what they have to do you know it's like there's a lot more people getting published it's not publicity but there's a lot more people showing that side of things at least I was we were talking about right before we came on there's this Instagram page called nature's metal take it down for a while you know he got back up but he has one of the very best pages but how can you take it down that's all he did he didn't he had nothing to do with any of those situations it's not like he like had some kind of ulterior motive and came in and put these animals in the situation that's just reality teen instagrams cracking down hard lately I don't understand it they take all kinds of stuff down for virtually no reason hmm it's weird all these someone Isis to complain enough and they'll take it down yeah they need to get that fixed way it's instead of like a I understand it's a lot all right it's a little lot of people so having a computer regulate that just doesn't work no it's not just a computer regulate that if someone can target you like say maybe you could be doing something and they just decide you're offensive and then just start like make a targeted campaign to complain about your content yeah yeah so one of those tattoo girls she got a hurt her post removed just having her hand above her crotch like covering her crotch her legs spread and showing all their tattoos and they took down her page like she's but she's covered up makes no sense I mean shows that pants on but you can't see anything all right fuck are we doing Samaritan serving legs fuck kind of shit is this Texas I need to open the new Instagram what's that oh it's different than what nature's medal is though he might have got in trouble for taking like photographers copy written works and read it's not differently because she's wildlife she's being blonde that's her natural habitat yeah she's a friend of mine yes communist copyright laws at what point if like you know YouTube some stuff is good even on Instagram some stuff they let go and some stuff they don't at what point are people supposed to understand what is okay and what is not okay yeah it's horrible you also have to think of it how many people are on Instagram let's just guess I don't know let's guess how many people you think I'm not either but fuck let's see we think a hundred million more probably close to a billion 500 million like it somewhere in that range I would say all right I'm gonna go with 300 million 300 million and one please what a billion yeah how many people are on Instagram 1 billion people use Instagram every month Jesus cry but that's 1 billion use yeah that are on that don't even use it so it could be like - does that include the Russians one bill yeah it's a lot Jesus Christ that's crazy well Twitter still lets porn happen you can still have porn on Twitter what did I say it's just because it has a 18 plus like warning or something like doesn't even my feed i-i'll be scrolling through my feed like I got to make sure my kids don't ever grab my phone they're looking through my phone at film I hate that age they might be in there though because when you sign your account you say how old you are Oh Elton the system there's a lot of those things are protections for people that are under 13 you know I don't know why there's that internet rule but like there is some government protections they need to be watching out for the minors that are online and that makes sense but does that is that the case with like you porn or places like that you just go there I don't know mmm but come on you don't know anyway I don't know where that why if the kid like a kid knows let me know it is yeah underline it mystic you point which because how do you get there's a browser no two browsers well when the virtual porn fucking world opens up that's when things gonna get very squirrelly Duncan said it's too real Duncan had a HTC vive and he was watching porn with the the helmet on which I only want to be a fly on the wall watch I'm standing there beating off looking at a 17 foot tall vagina in front of him how good it would be the next step and those are here so yeah like if they you've synced it up yeah those that mean I've done that that place we talked about the void you ever do a virtual reality place I haven't it's pretty dope they have a new one that I just saw in Vegas that some new one that was looked like you're going to warehouse and you're shooting at things but you you put on this helmet and you enter into this room and there was two different ones that I went on one was a Star Wars one and one was a wreck it Ralph one and it's crazy man you look around I mean the entire thing is animated like you're above you below you you see the ground you see stormtroopers they shoot at you you feel the the laser beams hit your chest because wearing a Vasa don't like vibrates when you get hit you walk into a room where there's fire and you feel the heat it's good it's getting really interesting when you're in that like say this room was empty would you walk around as if it was like an entirety of the entirety of the room yeah you could walk or they have it set up so that they have rooms that you go into where you open doors or doors open for you and you see the door open like in virtual reality but a real door does open while that fake door that you're seeing opens and then you go into it and then they have these plastic guns that you pick up your so you actually pick up the gun when you're holding it it looks like a stormtrooper weapon you know a Star Wars weapon that's cool it's getting weird it's gonna it's gonna be weird but but I think what's interesting is like that kind of stuff is so much less satisfying to bring it back to like what you do then like something that you have to really work for and it's really difficult and it's a very visceral real feel like the feeling of accomplishment you get when you do something virtual we'll never be able to compare right with the the feeling that you do when you do a physical visceral thing when are you feeling in your fucking bones yeah you feel it you know i when i was doing world Strongest Man in Botswana Africa I tore my bicep and I just was getting beat up over and over again I was just so wrecked my body wasn't accepting is that I went from football to strongman and in football we've never done deadlifts it was all hand cleans and power cleans which by the way just quick little tip that deadlifts the fear if you're dead lifting to be about a deadlift or fine if you're not doing that for deadlifts sake then don't fucking do it the risk to reward ratio is a joke for deadlift for dead lifts really a lot of people aren't gonna like that I'm saying that but if you go into any NFL gym in any Division one college football gym in any athletics where people are actually getting paid and it matters what they're doing they're not dead lifting we are they're hand cleaning and power cleaning why is that is the rich to reward ratio like there's it's so hard to be a great dead lifter and to not risk your low back and to be using your upper back properly and you know just there's so many little chances for you to get hurt you know hamstrings telleth that was that was me my first world Strongest Man I was the only rookie in the finals bro China how much weight is that that was 880 pounds for me and my pink chucks and your I weigh less than that now I'm less of a bowling ball though yeah yeah wow that well they made those weights ridiculous-looking too right well none that right there is something we overhead press to so they'll take some of the weights out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean it it's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you how about that oh really it's just like that and it's it's fucking brutal so they take weight out of that round thing yeah what is in that round thing there's well there's several different attachments to it so maybe some of them weigh different I've never like been a part of that but like either that or it unscrews at the end and they take weights out of it I'm not positive so you leave the NFL or you leave playing football and you were you in the NFL no I had a brief shot at it never it never actually got to do it now I was so what what kind of transition like what is the transition to give me the strongman went from that to I was a security guard in Santa Cruz this place called the catalyst which is where I worked for like six years it's a really cool bar slash concert venue so I was like spoiled I got to hang out with Rob Zombie and willing really yeah it was I'll spoil Rob Zombie I geeked out really hard for it that's dope it was fun yeah we're working on getting him here dude he'd be awesome yeah it was really cool I'm sure he is he's really in a horror movies man dude and he does the best one yeah I love this horror movies man they're wild I'm a huge fan huge friend he's like the Quentin Tarantino of horror yeah it's awesome but it's such a weird transition you know yeah I go from being a rock star to a horror film director he's just crazy and mad and his brother is actually the lead singer Powerman 5000 really yeah Wow family so did I went to security and I was working there and a buddy of mine who I'd played junior college ball with was just obsessive strong man and I've never heard of it I never watched it like when I was growing up we were poor like there was ten of us in a three-bedroom house and from high school on like we didn't have electricity so like we didn't watch TV we would play outside we had a trampoline you didn't have electricity in high school on the weekends my dad worked for Caterpillar catchment equipment so on the weekends he'd bring home a little generator and he'd plug that in and we'd have like three things we could use but that was that like the hot-water heater would work for the weekend and then like maybe the TV on Saturday night or something like the TGIF aha but I mean it wasn't I mean as a kid it's not that big of a deal you know like you just go play with your brothers outside right so but like I never knew what strongman was because of that I mean I'd had no idea so he was obsessed with it and he kept trying to get me to do it and then went home and googled it checked it out actually I don't know if it was Google I'm out of YouTube it back then was who knows what we had but um you know I I was excited to went and tried it out and first day the amateur world record at log press was like 320 pounds at the time and I had no idea but the first day I hit 330 pounds and just put it down and I looked over my buddy and I was like you know how'd that look and he's like get the fuck out of here like he's been trying his whole life to do this just came in and took it and then eight months later I mean six months that I was competing in England and I had my pro card two months after that I was in China at that photo right there what's wrong man that was the only rookie in the finals so is it the log thing is it the the awkwardness of like holding on to a log and getting it under your hands yeah and it's actually it's a lot healthier for your shoulders instead of mean how would you call that with your hands right there instead of pronated yeah we're the worst I like it my trainers use that those guys got shit together it's fat dude eating french fries so yeah I mean so it's better for you it's much better for your wrists and your shoulders and and also like that's what my hair goes Jaime Shauna's pronated grip Suppan ated grip so yeah neutral grip is much better for your wrists and shoulders hmm okay like so handles like this they say that with benchpress as well yeah like those benches that they have new bars the bars forg yeah awesome yes Road makes good equipment yeah I use all their shit my house in here no no they don't pay me it's not free I buy all of it same here I don't want them either but they're the best yeah it's the best shit so um we went to Worlds and then oh yeah I totally lost the whole game so you won but first of all you beat the fucking world record log press that's not your world record amateur amateur whatever yeah that's hilarious yeah so it was good much and there's the pro record right now the American records been mine for four years and that was 211 kilos and that's what is that pound fucking 468 but further like that this you hears me yeah this is an Australia in front of Arnold Jesus how do I know was there yeah sure that's his competition this is my competition this is so this is a log press right here yep that's a skinny log - this was a hard log to use but this was a buddy of mine had that record and he passed away and I wanted to be the one to take it from him after he dead and that was this moment Jesus Christ that looks heavy and you show me show off a little bit - I like to do this after I get it up Wow so that's the world record my American record who's the world record the world record I like to hold it up there and talk shit every time you see a record broken the guy gets it to hear and then he just throws it down right well I don't count doesn't count so the world record is two hundred and nineteen kilos I believe something like that something something right around there it might have been to 220 how close are you that I can I can break it right there yeah well in January Robert I'm going to London I'm gonna give London a little introduction to Texas what do you call it Texas pride and Texas power that's in for sure Wow I'm excited so you go and you break the American amateur record right away first first attempt out and is that when you felt like fuck to do this shit yeah I went home and I told my my fiancee at the time we were living in a studio and we were just broke and I was volunteer coaching and I was for high school which is my passion in high school football and then I was working at that Club at night so I didn't have a lot of time but I was like I can make this happen like with with my personality and this is a platform I can do this and everybody kept telling me there's no money in strongman there isn't any and there really wasn't there wasn't like there was no money in strongman until I made money and strong ran like really brought it in to there were several other people but like what we did was we cultivated a whole new era of strongman was before like even like pooja now ski was a guy who got a lot of attention cuz he looked just shredded yeah jack but I mean if you if you he's got like a cribs episode that they did in Poland and he's got this tiny little house with like little knickknacks and stuff he's so proud of it's really weird it's crazy but like like even then he's five-time world Strongest Man winner but there's really no money in that I thought he was been balling out of control you would think so I know who he is I feel like if I know who you are and you do something on TV you must be rich exactly that's the rapper's the display yeah I'm flying in first class and then you catch little bow-wow in the back well I remember one of the weird things that I read about butcher now skis how much candy heeds huh yeah and that he really likes candy in between workouts because he's blowing out so much sugar then he would eat chocolate bars I make sense yeah we do a lot of like I do peanut butter and honey like that during competition peanut butter and honey our Snickers bars really yeah yeah but when you peanut butter Anne how do you eat with a spoon like what do you usually make the sandwiches I see guys just pouring honey in their mouths like the Russian guys there's a Russian guy who was Russian Secret Service for a while and oh yeah like you look in his eyes you like this murder Rutger has done some bad things but he's the nicest dude in the world he's like the sweetest guy he comes like he always comes over and talks to me and my family and he's he doesn't speak good English but he's really nice about trying to get his point across and everything and but um yeah that that guy's done probably scary shit yeah yeah I'm sure there's a lot of that because we compete with people from all around the world you know and you know we we tend to forget that everywhere else there's a lot of it's it's normal almost to be like that in some places right to survive and if you're a giant dude it's probably the best way to make a living exactly yeah it's so they just squirt honey in their mouth yeah they'll just poured like like a whole little canister of honey and just take that you see guys do that right before they go lift and stuff I'm I the way I grew up in the the way I did things like I was always taught and it kind of worked with being broke but like a warrior goes to war hungry mmm that's like in football I would never eat before a game ever and then got in a strong man and I did that for a long time and I got off to 440 pounds and I would I would do an entire show like five six hours without eating but then during it I would smack a little bit but I would never eat a meal right listen the resources it eats up your resources right right and and and see for me it felt like anything in my stomach just made me feel like slow mmm yeah that's what I'm saying yeah cheese that's the same with comedy too and I learned that from Katt Williams watching the interview with them just don't eat before you go onstage I'm like that makes sense yeah you better off being hungry right I just do that to the best hunters they hunt hungry yeah see you then but what happened to me was I lost 80 pounds that was 440 I lost 80 pounds and when I got hurt in Botswana I lost all that way and just because of the bicep tear no I chose to do that I graduated high school I was 370 pounds so I've always been a big dude but I got up to 440 and just walking around was laborious you know just I felt like fucking horrible I think when you when you did that log press that log press that was like my 425 ish for 30 mm when I run that so like I gained a little bit more after that I just everyone tells you in the sport the bigger you are the stronger you are and that kind of holds true to static lifting like kind of it's not necessary all the time but it kind of holds true but we got a move man like we're talking about pulling a truck and doing the old events and all that stuff when when you're 440 and your body not agreeing with that 4:40 it just hold you back you don't imagine their load on your joints to particularly lower back yeah my low but yeah that's what happened I got hurt and I felt like I was done cuz my low back I'd have to take me like 45 minutes to get out of bed in the morning really oh yeah I was messed up man really bad and get an MRI I never got an MRI and didn't I'm scared exactly this fucking wrong fix it when I lost weight it got better and its core strength for me now core strengthen stretching and also I smoked weed like a lot of a lot of athletes are against it and a lot of people think that there's some like negative connotation with being like someone who smokes weed but I mean I'm watching guys take vicodin like his skittles I'm watching I've seen guys throw away their lives their families their career over a bunch of pills because they didn't want to smoke and it's crazy you know and we actually officially got world's strongest man to take marijuana off of the drug testing wait wait wait wait this is drug testing and world Strongest Man every year are they making sure you're on steroids test you though make sure you strong enough drugs in the sky Robert Frank is the councilman he's a he's hilarious Instagram guy I I can't recall but it sounds really familiar yeah he's he's really funny man he's like really fast he's got this fucking hilarious rant about someone getting the girl pregnant and taking responsibility and he goes he was I have to ask you he goes if you're trying to get jacked and Dan what kind of gear are you on that's a question your gift you'll get your girl pregnant you have got so much he's another one he gets censored off at Instagram all the time they pull his post and they he's got a million followers and they won't give him a fucking blue checkmark that's ridiculous people understand that's that's our livelihood a lot of people that's social media is how we feed our fucking family well also he's fucking fun but he's funny with because his opinions it's funny shit man it's fucking funny shit and he can't get oh he can't get approved and they they've gone through publicists they've tried to get him what does it recognize what is it called verify verify get try to get that blue checkmark next to his name it's silly man I'm no how that even works somebody's to thing they did mine too much muscle yeah I mean well you can do it because you're not making fun of things making fun of things to talk about getting this car stock pretty and strong damage on it that's perfect no is it's silly that they do that though you know it almost I mean if you look historically back every time they've done that those people have got more power like all you're doing is feeding that guy so in ten years when you look like the asshole that censored him he's gonna be ten times that well especially now that we're talking about them yeah which is good yeah it is good that this exists yeah it's fucking good I think so a lot of people appreciate it well I think this is a weird time what you can't you're having people dictate what you can and can't see or what isn't is Val isn't isn't valid and that's just that seems like nonsense to me like we're moving backwards especially with something like that he's being funny like he's funny he makes me laugh well I'm Alex yeah we are at the fuck man even bad jokes man even bad jokes by juiceheads this like it's fun he talks about being a juicehead it's hilarious I'm my first introduction to comedy I loved growing up I was a huge fan of Richard Pryor and all that stuff a huge fan of Carlin I just big fan I even liked what was his name Jeff Foxworthy I love Fox which is great and my first time I ever got to see his show I came in I move into LA and a buddy of mine brought me to see you and uncle Joey and I was like holy fuck I couldn't first Joe comes out there and you can't even breathe he's an animal he's got some shit right now like if you get a chance while you're in town he's got some new shit that we were falling on the ground crying the other night oh yeah I'll come check him out he's the best ever he crushes crushes no one no one's like funnier in bursts you might get you know guys who are really good joke writers guys who are really funny guys her like they're they're valid in terms of our culture but no one's funnier than Joey do it no no no the whole room like it was like we were uncomfortable we couldn't stop laughing you know he's so damn good when when you went up it was like so it was it's a whole different style but it's like super like along the way that I think about how like you're introspective and comparative with different things and stuff in the way you make people like look at something in a different angle and then you poke fun of the way that you originally thought about it you know that's at least how that set was but it was I mean I being in a live audience is so different than watching a special on TV oh yeah it's way better well I met you in the belly room which is one of the best places to do stand-up right the last tiny room yeah yeah I did a set on bail men onstage once and I didn't know and yeah the belly room yeah I went up there and did it was story time and tape Fletcher and man I can't remember who else a bunch of people just kept telling me like like just called and tell story just go tell story and I was like I there's no cameras in here right I can tell a real story but they got me up there and I did six minutes they gave they gave me four and I ran home for six I didn't know what the lights meant I was just talking you know I didn't know and I told the story about being in China and we thought we were gonna go to jail in China and stuff and it was fucking hilarious what happened in China that that year you saw me in the picture we we got done with world Strongest Man and we do like a celebration we all go to dinner and all that stuff and I was I was fucking excited because I I was the only rookie in the final so super excited so I'm hammered drunk like you're in China and the little things start to click you see people all we're in like the the Communists uniform like that they have they were celebrating I don't know if it's called communism day or whatever but they celebrate that and and like almost the entire city we were in Sanya which is a little island which is like their kind of vacation island and um where almost everybody was dressed in those uniforms and I'm drunk and like I'm looking around I'm starting to feel uncomfortable and we finally we get up to go and we all get on this bus and the guy who runs World's Strongest Man is is a very old man he's he's got to be like in his 90s right but he's he's uh needs help moving around all that kind of stuff we get on the bus and we're setting up and the camera crew left all their stuff on the front seat which is which is the older guys seat you know we make sure that he has that seat you know and we get in and we're trying to have fun at all like we're nothing aggro we're trying to be assertive but nice to the the camera crew that they have to move back and they were they didn't speak English at the moment you know and there they were acting like they just didn't understand there they're being really rude about it and Nick best who's actually on the TV show with me he came over and he picked up the camera and he was like you're moving and started walking back with the camera case and then the guy got up and started yelling at us in English and he's totally knew exactly we were saying the whole time and he's yelling at us and freaking out and Nick puts the camera down like towards the middle of the bus and then sits back down the guy marches off the bus comes back on the bus with three cops three police officers and Chinese uniforms and I'm fucking scared shitless like I've heard horror stories about Chinese prison you know it does not sound like the place to be and the guy the guy and the cops are getting really worked up about the fact that he touched his equipment and that Nix called him an arrogant American all this stuff like freaking out and the police officer literally exactly nobody ever believes this but it was like in 300 is almost fucking exactly he goes this is China and he's screaming at a bus full of the world's strongest men he's fucking scared all of us into thinking we were gonna go to jail this is China he's screaming at him and Nick best like kind of sits back in a seat and puts his head down and realizes like you know we better shut the fuck up so we all like kind of tucked their tails in and sat there and then the older guy got on the bus took his seat then the camera guy kind of pretended like it didn't happen when sat back down the police officers left but that in the entirety of that that situation like I fucking I could have swore I was going to prison but scared to death yeah you do not want to get locked up in an Asian prison no especially China no no no no not there and especially that spot because like it was it was their vacation Island but it's fucking dirty like the stories you hear about kids shitting in the streets and stuff it's not everywhere in China but on that island it was everywhere like the kids just stopped pull open their little shorts and take a shit re told me you saw that in the mall inside people just walk in the mall walking they just stop pull their pants down and shit on the ground yeah and I went what on the floor yeah no that's what they do man it's crazy it's so crazy so who comes and cleans up the shit I don't know I don't think anybody when it's outside was there just everywhere wheeling yeah you see human shit everywhere all over the place and smells like it and we almost I think there was 30 of us like 26 of us all got stomach flu or stomach and intestinal parasites oh I've been everything has got shit on it yeah if people are just shitting on the street there's probably shit everywhere you touch they were burning tires for their street lights it was nasty man what's up the island it's it's gorgeous too I'm telling you like the photos the pictures Sonia Island is gorgeous it was bring tires for street lights that's and these motherfuckers want us to switch to electric cars yeah they're over there burning tires in China well at least in 2013 they rock it's crazy crazy world's have you had to travel for strongman um I have done Africa Dubai is one of my favorites it's it's it's creepy sometimes like just realizing I don't like not feeling like I'm in control of what happens to me my destiny it's like it when I'm in Texas I feel great no I'm like 90% of the people around you were armed if some shit happens they got it my girl actually like she rides horses and she manages a gun shop select I'm straight you know I don't have shit to worry about but like when you're when you're in like the Middle East or when you're in China or anything like that you just have this feeling inside you like it could fucking go wrong right I mean but uh when we go to Dubai we actually do world's ultimate strongman in Dubai and we're gonna do another competition that October 25th which is it's the highest-paid strongman show that exists it's it's a really big show it's a lot of fun we go out there and they fucked up they gave me the keys to a Ferrari and I just fuckin went crazy I went to downtown door like 120 there's also no cops too so there's even I doesn't have any cops no they might have a few like in certain areas but it's it's basically they use cameras everywhere so if you if you speed or if anything happens or you steal or anything like that it's all on camera like there's literally cameras everywhere that's how their judicial system works they don't use police they just say oh well let's look at the camera footage exactly lock that motherfucker up forever yep yep and when we were there like it was craziness going on with the royal family and stuff like it was it was pretty Tang I'm going back in October it's crazy you look at that place like what it was like in 1970 versus what it is now right like it's some of the before and after footages it's it's insane there's so much wealth there yeah I mean they have built the biggest building in the world they're the tallest building in the world which gleeful I shit my pants at the top of that building not literally but like I hate Heights but and I went up there and like I couldn't walk house it was like a hundred and thirty I don't know man we get on them we get in the bottom of the elevator and Eddie Hall who's also in the in the show with me it's me Eddie Hall Nick best and Brian Shaw first of all how the fuck is that elevator gonna carry all you assholes yeah exactly we get in they close the door to go up in Eddie farts oh this motherfucker no a hundred and thirtysomething floors smelling this guy's ass it was horrible and Eddie's the worst he's English so he's eating my porridge drinking tea and farting I will put tape Fletcher's farts up against any man who's ever lived really oh my god the worst back in the day when he was fighting he's - I think he just over consumed protein and then he was legendary legendary he would laugh was coming he would laugh first and then it would come that's the worst when they enjoy the fact that he doesn't do it anymore must clean his diet up he's never got me I loved I loved going out with tape because like normally when I go out especially in LA or something I just draw way too many weird eyes I feel like I just like need to like hide in the corner but would tape it's like the bash brothers walked in right not as big as me but he totally normalizes me right so awesome we still gone into the comedy stores my favorite man I used to go and actually I saw a lot of the transition from when you started coming back and I saw the culture change man you did a lot for that so that place you fucking changed the entire culture of that back room that's crazy it was awesome man well that's my spot you know I wasn't there for seven years yeah yeah and you and I was there just before and then just after and I should go in there a lot I used to go hang out a lot and I'm telling you just just the way the comedian's interact with each other it's totally different when I first went there it was very like like oh well I I've had this and I can do this and it was basically like Hollywood at the Comedy Store you know so like if you're like waiting to audition for a commercial and these these people are all but telling each other how cool they are that's what it felt like then now now I mean not now haven't been that for like maybe a year or two but then after that it became more like like what we do like we're talking shit to each other and it's it's like it's a camaraderie yeah it's not like I'm better than you it's like we can all talk shit we're all on the same level you know that's very important to me that I think that that it probably comes from martial arts but it's also just my my own philosophy it's like I want everybody to do good I don't want to be the only one doing good right I don't understand that I've never understood that I want I want like when I go on I could go on the road I try to bring the best people alive I want everybody to have fun I want this the audience to have a great show I want people to kill yeah and I try to help comedians I really want to support them and I'll try to get them all on my podcast I try to tell everybody they're great try to tell everybody to go see him and well you see what that cultivates - yeah everybody got better yeah I mean Joey probably exactly the same he's all the same but part of when Joey became a monsters cuz he got all this love you know and realized he could just be himself up there yeah like when they stop taking token all that stuff yeah that helped but he was doing coke he's fucking amazing yeah I can't imagine him not me I can I can hear him tell the same story five different times and still crack up every fucking time he's an American original there's not a whole lot of people like that guy so that place yeah it's you know it's just insecurity when people realize they're loved and that there's real camaraderie and a brotherhood and a sisterhood and that you really do care about each other yeah everybody like that place is all hugs man ya know there everybody's hugging yeah and it wasn't that way I know I know every time I give you a compliment I see you kind of like wince a little bit yeah when people like like like yourself or I'm the same way like whenever I do something well and someone tells me I'm like now I mean I should have done this this way or at least I'm always that I should one up myself guy yeah but you really change the fucking culture there man and you've made a lot of people better the same with a podcast they got Flint it was all thanks brother thank you yeah well I feel very lucky you know I'm a very fortunate person so yeah I like to spread it fucking from from where you started to where you are now the hustle man that's inspiring I always feel like I need to do more and I need to like extend myself in different areas and stuff I look at like so many people out there now we actually have access to and you can see like Jaco like yeah this dude's up at 4:30 in the morning and I'm like complaining the fact that I only got six hours with this guy you know like do you really learn your level of hustle in reality versus where you put yourself in your head you like yeah I'm killing and I'm working so hard there's nothing more I could be doing and then this motherfuckers up for hours before you killin it well those guys they've their fuel you know guys like Goggins him Jocko those got Cameron Haynes those guys are fuel yeah like if you ever start thinking maybe I was Lakoff maybe we'll take a day off that's you look at Jocko fucking hairy gorilla arm know that 4:30 on his Iron Man watch it just says attack right it showed some of that today is this lady that the the clinic that I go to she was talking about her boyfriend's into Jocko ago she'd go to his fucking Instagram page every morning if you see you see that 4:30 watch and that's like fuck gotta go when I get going what am I yeah yeah it's just but it really is fuel like you feel charged up we're not when I listen to like Goggins talk so a lot of soft motherfuckers want you to stay in bed fuck that shit fuck that shit you gotta get up and go Kotak stay hard yeah I love it I love it it's nice man it's cool that we actually have that nowadays yeah man this didn't exist before I mean you think about before the into the internet and podcasts and social media and stuff like that was hot you have to find that inspiration hard to find yeah and sometimes you'd think you'd have an inspiring person in your life for real at in reality it was just some shitbag it was like just close enough doesn't look like that right when you step back as an adult you're like okay yeah there's a lot of faking it yeah ought to be fake like they work hard right actually somebody was trying to tell me the story I've heard you talk about it on here about that guy who pretended to be a MMA like guru or whatever and ended up murdering his girlfriend yeah well no he murdered his girlfriend's husband okay yeah someone was pretending to be a black belt and any rolled with them and uh you know like when you roll with some of there's no fake in it like with karate you can kind of fake it like there's guys that like art athletic and they can throw some kicks like just like learning on the streets just hanging out with their friends they know how to throw some kicks this is people that know how to throw a wheel kick that have never taken a martial arts class and in life and if you see him throw it kicks like wow that guy's legit right and but you don't know unless you see him actually fight so the problem with that is inspiring a lot of karate sparring you're kind of polite and you're not trying to hurt each other you just like and you could kind of fake it a little bit you could throw some shit in the air and fake it and touch each other yeah but in jiu-jitsu you have to roll it's it's you know the guys grabbing your arm he's armed dragon who's taking your back you got to defend correctly and Eddie was like man I don't know what the fuck is going on but that dude is not a black belt and I'm like really I go like what do you think he is like he's terrible he's like he has nothing Eddie said he was a CIA was before Eddie was deep deep deep deep deep in the conspiracies back then it was like he was peril he was like in the UFOs and shit it was barely in the conspiracies he's way off the deep end you got me into UFOs man well maybe it is true I'm scheduled to have a phone call today this afternoon with George Knapp he wants to brief me all the shit George Knapp is the guy that broke the Bob Lazar story in the 1990s yeah and you know he shares my opinion he's like most of this is bullshit most these people are liars most these people are crazy but there's some real shit out there too like a lot of these Air Force pilots that they have eyes on this fucking thing that's going 600 miles away in a second like dropping down from 60,000 feet to 10 feet like in a second ya know like I don't know we don't know what the fuck this is we have no idea how these things are doing right and that's not some hillbilly like just no talking about SAS exactly though yeah it's Air Force pilots people who they're trained to fly jets and have gunfights in the fucking sky right these are exceptional human beings yeah when they see things like that you gotta go they know what the fuck they're seeing that's so crazy yeah who knows the thing is like every day you can go out there and look in the sky you don't see shit you know there's nothing up there because you're not seeing it but if you go to a fucking Lake you're never gonna see a shark you know I'm saying right like it doesn't mean sharks aren't real it's like you're looking in the wrong spot or you won't you aren't there when they show up but they're real so we have enough accumulated data to know that though there are sharks you know there are real but they're not in lakes there in the ocean here's where they are this is how you find them go to South Africa oh look there's a shark let's go say no yeah oh yeah or um fucking Catalina off Catalina I'd say Tom yeah I worked at a Boy Scout camp in Catalina and I was teaching snorkelling and that was like the whole time I was shitting myself oh my god it's just the nicest water in the world though it's so warm and salty it's yeah you just float you know we did Fear Factor out there a couple times really yeah we did a couple of stunts my hello water stands here it's a cool spot we stand on the other side like there's the hotels on the one side and everything we were on the other side it was awesome awesome I was like 13 and I got so roasted my entire body became one blister Oh stupid that was stupid no sunscreen done none out there all day long yeah so I don't know if you know UFOs are real but it's it's certainly believable enough but it's not like the the sky is empty it's filled with stars so do you think now after speaking with them that do you think we've had contact it's hard to tell thinking it's my own opinion not for the listeners not for anybody else just you when you're at home and you're chilling do you think it I don't know I really honestly don't know I couldn't say yes or no I'm more inclined now to think there's something going on then I was before I met Lazar and watched that documentary because I was on that not that I was saying that aliens are not real I think they're I think there's a hundred percent life out there let's just say that it's too big right it just doesn't make any sense that there isn't it's the question of whether or not it ever has gotten here before is the weird question and it's also the problem is that you feel foolish talking about it because so many people who believe in it are foolish and so many people who tell stories there's their stories are foolish so you feel foolish kind of going along with it right but I'm very careful about stuff like that because I'm like just cuz something makes you feel foolish doesn't mean it's true mm-hmm you know it isn't true yeah so I definitely think there's a very high likelihood that there's life out there and it's entirely possible that something's gotten here before but as to whether or not something really has made contact with people I don't know I'm in close if I would say like where's my scale it's like probably 65 percent believe yeah 35 percent going home especially after talking about yeah but what he could have he could have experienced something that was an experimental aircraft that they didn't want to tell them right you never know man I mean I just don't know what the tech look I'm a moron like I don't understand physics at all I have no knowledge of propulsion systems or mathematics and I don't know what the top of the field in propulsion experts are capable of today I don't know there might be some shit that they're working on that they've never really perfected so they've never actually implemented in the battlefield or something like that but they have some sort of a drone that looks like it would be filled with three-foot tall people like these aliens that they described I don't know and they're not gonna fill you in on that if you think it's alien yeah fine it's fucking alien exactly I mean who knows what that was I mean they they're taking this guy who was a physicist from Los Alamos labs who went to Caltech and they sent him to these classes at MIT to learn fucked in nuclear shit and then they try to see if he can figure out how to back engineer something they try to say that doesn't mean it comes from another world right it could have been a Russian thing it could have been something that the Germans figured out I don't know but I'm more inclined to believe him than not believe him yeah he didn't seem like he was full of it exactly and just looking at him he also didn't seem like he wanted to be here he did he was just like I'm done with this he was getting migraines talking about it before I even got out here is like I just kind of tie I'm getting a migraine yeah and like you know Jeremy was trying to talk them into doing it like we're gonna be fine George I mean uh bob is important it's really good to do this and we're gonna be able to really get the story out but I think more more people told me that they got more out of the conversation because it's just him talking not no spooky music no edits right and you get to see like he's honest about what he knows and doesn't know and when he would say like what do you think about this is like maybe I don't know right he wasn't a bullshit he didn't seem rehearsed rattle the shit not him know what he was saying if he didn't believe in that well at least to himself what are you saying I'd be fucking amazed and his story has not deviated in 30 plus years which you can't I've tried to have me tell a story of something that actually really did happen from 30 years ago and I probably told it a bunch of different times I don't know what we started the podcast exactly it's hard to remain you my memory varies day to day like some days it's awesome and some days it's dog shit yeah it's crazy how that works on yeah have you've had a few concussions right oh yeah that's a man yeah I I have horrible memory but from football it's like probably the worst thing ever for concussions because you're getting them even from body hits when dudes as big as you or clashing into each other your fucking brains getting rattled around in there even if your head doesn't get hit right and I played rough like I didn't avoid anything I'm sure yeah well that's a strength of yours a guy as big as you I mean I would imagine you would impose that exactly yeah paid for college oh that's cool no it is awesome it's actually the only thing I haven't liked about I ever liked in school like science and math didn't really click but history it was all specially you listened to Dan Carlin oh yeah yeah of course the best just do more hard you know the research that's what yeah you know I'm embarrassed to call what I do a podcast person what he does he does is like a lecture he needs to call his yes that's what it is it's way more in-depth his his hardcore history on World War two and World War one and the one on the Mongols the greatest fucking shit I've ever heard the Mongol one I've listened to like four or five times the wrath of the cons mm-hmm fuck it's good he's so good he's so entertaining too it's like if history was that entertaining we'd have a fucking world full of history scholars right and we wouldn't be censoring Instagram right now but yeah yeah Dan Carlin is uh he's a fuckin man he really is his podcast is incredible and the fact he only charges $1 for them you know he did that well he's there free and then when you go deep into the archives he charges a dollar a podcast which is fucking nothing neither an hour and a half long it takes a months and months to do and he's really just trying to make up for a production cost he's not trying to get rich right he would be charging much more in there worth more man yeah I've learned more from that than I did from college you know yeah and he retain it because he's entertaining he's the man and he's a great guy too I really love that guy yeah and his story is interesting too is the old-time radio guy you know did radio and then was always a history buff and even says he's not a historian it's like very self-deprecating but damn probably the most important historian of our time exactly it's not for guys like me I've learned more about history from that guy than probably from anybody yeah I'm sorry I mean probably Ted this moment now he technically is a historian you know I think is we should at least give him that I mean he's got them yeah I mean I don't know what you have to be to be as I guess a practicing scholar is like you think if you say it'll just show it's official he's just he's absolutely a historian boom Dan Carlin you are a historian give that man a plaque give him a plaque because a paper some bullshit group of dudes that's one of my favorite things about the TV show is being able to like dive into the history of the stuff like we did a an episode in England we were in London for most of it and this guy thomas topham and he was a fucking psychopath person like just a crazy person like he he he owned a pub and his way of getting people in was doing these crazy feats of strength and he would he would go out there and one of the biggest feat of strength which we challenged ourselves to do and we actually attempted a world record I can't say if we broke it or not but we took these giant barrels of whiskey out in front of this pub downtown London and we were picking them up on like a yoke you know what a yoke is like a yoke walk yes yes sir like that so the crossbar goes across your back and you pick up basically we went though the world record we were attempting was I think it was like seventeen hundred and ninety pounds something like that that's a car that's a 1968 911 yeah exactly engine and everything yeah it was awesome man that's great when we get to tell his story and talk about like that my favorite my favorite thing we did for the whole season was probably his episode there's a an old tale that he got drunk one night and back in the day London police officers had these little huts they would stand in so they could be out of the weather like on the side of the road almost like like I'm an outhouse but a little bit smaller and they'd stand in there and and they basically keep watching on the street being till the rain didn't get on them there was the story that he got drunk with his buddies and just to fuck around with this cop he picked one of those up with them inside carried it down the street and threw him into an open grave at the graveyard so we did that it was awesome and we're running down these back cobblestone streets with this like we didn't use the real police officer obviously but we're like what the whole set up on our some of us tried to do it on our back some of us tried to do other ways you know but like we're running down and all these people were cheering us on is we're like celebrating this guy but basically like drag the cop doesn't zoom window graveyard is hilarious now when you do something like that say a stunt like that how much of a consideration is like would you look at it you go okay I think I can do this but fuck I might get hurt doing this all right almost everything everything's like that like we were with the Daredevils last night and the evil eye evil life we did a premiere where I'm like it was a homage to Evel Knievel guys the guy was gonna jump a world record jump but he actually broke his ankles doing the testing for it so this this woman came out and she she broke a world record driving through they have these platforms set up with like boards on fire and and she's did 13 boards that were all on fire - Oh face first - him why she was a fucking savage and she was the baddest I I'm so sorry I can't remember her name right now but um she came over and spoke to me and like I'm from Santa Cruz like you hear the way I'm talking right now this is how I talk like I'm not like super official or anything like that and she came over and I was like so what do you think and she's like no no bro probably dry like thirty put my face to the motherfucker I don't know like that I was like this girl's fucking Savage I love this setup it was so awesome he's finer Jamie what's her name - gold golden Vikki golden she looks like a regular girl she's not even a giant she's very pretty she's normal like just that she's putting her face through boards yeah Jesus fish brush there was so my God look at that fuck man so that's that's the board's there that's that's like I had no Jesus yeah oh my god so she's just accelerating through these flaming boards no fucking 13 of them and that's the kid that broke his ankle axle Hajus he uh he got hurt like just like four days before the live show well Evel Knievel man they put him back together again back when they didn't even know how to put people back together yeah yeah I'm his glue and shit screws and rubber bands crazy maybe he's helped Bonnie back you ever see like the x-rays of Evel Knievel's body I saw from the show I saw a little bit of it I or the videos of him like flopping as you see his ankle go one way and his arm go the other way and I'm just that shit creeps me out man John was an animal he just didn't I wonder if he was I wonder if it would take something before you'd go good job everybody was on coke back then huh yeah yeah yeah what year was that I'm talking shit I mean that would be the thing you a fucking giant Bob right like something some meth type substance yeah I was talking to them about is basically the same way they look at a stunt is the way we look at a lift it's like this this could possibly cripple me this could finish my career all that stuff we're good what do you got Jamie when he jumped the Caesars fountains in 1967 he crushed pelvis and femur fractures to his hip wrist and both ankles concussion that kept him in the hospital and rumors that he was in a coma for 29 days mm-hmm and kept jumping came back I think it was six months right like that was they talked about this I can't remember how long it was but he was right back out on it seeing you find a picture of his x-ray I did it's not that they're super old so it's not clear I like what it was and I was just kidding he probably wasn't doing any drugs just making a joke I'll say it he's doing coke drinking coke having a great time why not get everybody else yeah it was it was for that for that specific lift that we did I didn't really that's him as Caesar huh hmm Jesus Christ look how fucking pious on now that's looked too clear to be nice oh I met his son I met his son on the set of fearfully made it yeah son made it yeah oh what the front end that high yeah that's Robbie Wow fucking crazy oh he goes little man that stuff creeps me out yeah mm-hmm well it's just weird that that was a thing like when we were kids Evel Knievel was like the daredevil guy like you know what do you think your Evel Knievel right the toys and everything man yeah I had that wind up back end that would just shoot him forward so you have to look at a lift similar to the way they would look at a stunt like it's it there's a high possibility right and and in everything from where you step those cobblestone streets that was the sky yeah because the thing itself was I think it was like like 400 some something like that it wasn't like crazy heavy it was around 400 pounds so for us that's not that big of a deal unless you put your foot wrong with 400 pounds yeah then all of a sudden there goes your ankle there goes your knee there goes your Achilles and and the other thing is once once the whistle blows and it's on and we're racing or you're playing in sport and like the fight starts or like the game starts when the whistle blows all that shit's gone like the fear is gone the hesitation is gone I'm gonna fucking win you know that's what I'm here for so that that's what you really have to like worry about that so like beforehand I'll always walk the course and just like look like okay I want to I want to hug this corner even if it's gonna take me a little bit longer I'll be loose on this corner because it's a little bit of a dip you know stuff like that but you know I mean it doesn't always turn out right well first world Strongest Man Franco Columbu just destroyed his knee carrying a fridge anyway yeah which actually changed a lot of the structure of contracts that we sign now Franco Columbu was in the world's the first world Strongest Man yeah I believe it was Franco Columbu yeah yeah it was there was Lou Ferrigno Franco Columbu and I could Franco was this the shorter guy who's gone long right yeah yes the guy who used to blow up hot water bottles with his lungs to make him explode right yeah yeah which is crazy fucking insane about a lung power yeah no that's like longevity power - that's the kind of stuff I really like I can't wait till like I'm done with the sport and I can actually do stuff that'll make me feel good okay you know instead of like waking up broken every day I'll be like I can do a little bit of yoga I like to hike that kind of stuff yeah you're looking forward to a normal life yes exactly what what injuries have you had um I the first the amateur show I was doing actually I competed Brian Shaw who was on the TV show with us he's four-time world Strongest Man when I out of Colorado he was hosting an amateur show in Colorado and I'm I was in San Cruz training ocean sea level went up to outside of Denver to compete at the show and fucking had a heart attack it was so so hard but uh it was the deadlift is it was like maybe two two months after I started deadlifting maybe three months so I'd never really dead lifted and we were dead lifting a car the back end of a car and they made it heavy so it was probably for amateurs heavy is about like eight hundred eight hundred and forty pounds something like that so I'm winning the show and and I'm doing it in front of four-time world Strongest Man when they're who already I had my sights on him like I was coming for him you know like I that's like when I first started I was like okay this guy's the best this guy's the best I'm coming for that guy so I wanted I wanted to show out you know so I go out and I pull the car up I do the first rap and I was like basically it took 90% of everything I had for that first rep but like a meathead I was like I'll pull the second one you know but it's four reps so I go pull the second one about halfway up my lower back pops and I just let go my both my legs went stiff and then they went numb completely I fall forward into Brian's arms actually as he's judging me and my legs were numb like maybe two months straight and then off and on for like two years they were just so bad for the for that first two months I actually ended up in finish that show ended up in second place qualified for Nationals which was my goal so I could get my pro card I went home started training for nationals with numb legs and had to sleep in my pickup truck because I wouldn't I couldn't lay down and we had we had a studio at the time no chairs we just had a bed and so I would sleep in my pickup truck get up drive to the gym go train and looking back like yeah that was stupid it was really stupid but that's one side failed at football in my eyes had failed once once I kind of painted myself in this corner I was like I'm just I'm just not gonna lose and you never got an MRI no I didn't have insurance oh you don't want to get a look-see I kind of do I mean it feels good now I mean I should take a peek I'm like I need it I'm gonna go get my achilles checked out because that this current list last world Strongest Man I had a decent pop in my Achilles and so I'm gonna get that checked out but I've been been really careful about how I rehab stuff like that but you're right yes I should check out my brother he's crazy though that your legs were numb for two years yeah off and on there was straight numb for about two months straight and I'm like someone could stab you in the leg like like a sleep oh like that yeah and it was sciatic it was I against my sciatic his best sure what I was told and so you know I figured that other then after that I was in Africa and I ripped my bicep off the tendon and I've been getting beaten up a lot at that point and like my first year world Strongest Man it was so easy for me to get to the finals I kind of just was like you know fuckin you know it's is whatever I don't have to work for this I am the strongest man without having to work for it and then got in Africa after being beaten up a lot and kind of getting my head pushed down in the sand for two years in a row and ripped that off and I was just like I'm done like I in my head like I just thought I was done walking out by the river and sitting there and just feeling like broken just like I didn't know what I was gonna do with myself or anything like that and I walked back to the tent and the referees were telling me like you know get your stuff they don't want you that once you get hurt you have to fly you home right away they they don't let you stay and watch the finish or any of that shit they believe yeah I think it's a liability thing I don't know basically they just gotta get rid of you but the the judge for the show was like hey we're doing what's called the Hercules hold and in Europe are you gonna do it and the Hercules hold means you reach you reach out with both arms here like this and um you have like a handle like basically like like in the gym you know the RO handles like that attached to a tower that's falling and you hold it as long as you possibly can and uh in my mind I was like this is the last time I'm ever gonna be here so I might as well leave some fucking blood on the bar so I've walked out Dybbuk and it's Oren bicep off the bone yeah 10 the tendon so I went over there and I'll just like fuck it like let's let's at least leave a mark you know like I had to do something did you tape it up or anything no what are you gonna tape up I mean like it's like fully extended your arm it's basically just taking weight pulling you and it's so it's not direct like curling hurting but it's it's yanking a tendon further in up into your bicep and I felt that creeping up into my shoulder as I was doing it and I did great I actually moves the best of him I'd had that year you know I crossed it and I remember just closing my eyes and being gone and just if when I let go it was almost like being baptized man like I felt like all the pain and all the stress everything I had felt like build-up once I gotten hurt I just dumped it all and then it took me it took me I think it was two more years I finally fought back I thought I was done and then last year I made it back into the finals I'm now again top 10 strongest man in the world so is it was it because of surgery and Rehab surgery and then everything else was so beat up once I once I finally stepped I was like like there's no reason I should have to take an hour to to be able to walk in the morning yeah and I'm like there's no reason why my back should hurt from walking from the front door to the car you know like I was so racked and so I just started working on different things trying to take care of myself and I got back to worlds with that next year actually I got back and I just didn't do well because I hadn't been able to do anything and then came back the following year which was just this last year and you know I basically I've been written off it was it was I was told it was my last time I was getting invited because at this point like you're done you know like it's time for you to find something else and I came out and I had the show of my life it was I've been working so hard but you never know how strong you are until you line up you never know like what kind of athlete you are until you get tested right so I got I lined up and I got done I just crushed when I'm when I finished I loaded that this stone and I know I was in the finals like dude I did emotional just think about it right now like it just felt like somebody just washed all that away Wow no I remember ripping my shirt off I am a fucking showman I'll tell you that I had my strong and pretty shirt underneath and I ripped my world Strongest Man shirt and showed my strong and pretty shirt and I was just roaring we were in in Malaysia and like everybody just kind of like step back a little bit it was awesome so what kind of stuff do you do to try to rehab your body to try to get your body back in the condition ton tons of core work tons of stretching and like basically just digging out scar tissue is huge it's huge like a lot of people use like a faragon and stuff like that I went the cheap route I took a Black & Decker skill saw and I've got the stuff attachments put it all together it cost me like 65 bucks you know but like stuff like that I kind of figured it all out as I was going you know I just I there's people out there that were telling you stuff but it wasn't as easily accessible when I was when I was first going and now like literally now we have a website called starting strongman so like people who want to train and figure out like what's the safe way to start out or like if I want to train like this but I don't want to don't want to buy all the equipment or if I just or if I do want to be the strongest man in the world or if I just want to know what what kind of type of lifts to use to to like keep your back healthy to help you use your upper back instead of your lower back when you're pulling that kind of stuff I mean it's all there now like literally let that did not exist and you just have to like listen to like the sock on the cock guy in the gym telling you know what to tell you know right that's what it was for me like it was a bunch of older lifters and I remember just you know warming up is for pussies and all that kind of shit oh yeah old school lifting man or whatnot listen to pussies yeah you ever see a lion warm up before it chases a gazelle I've heard that nonsense before it's written was talking that crazy it's crazy yeah it's crazy I'm not a lion yeah if you have to it's there but if you want to take care of your body it's definitely better to warm up yes yeah if you watch like a guy like Manny Pacquiao trained like the I watched him work out once with Freddie Roach and he were he warms up for a long time it's like 15 20 minutes of warming up they said that about Ali that Ali would warm up for one hour yeah so an hour of his workout was him just warming up his body just moving moving along and getting stretching and rolling his arms and his legs rolling his hips and and then once that blood flow and then he starts shuffling he starts hitting the bag now he starts hitting the pads that's more the older I get the more I realize how important that is and Mike how important it is to teach the the next generation how to warm up even just rolling your hips I only started doing that in the last year and a half that's crazy it's crazy it's crazy put all that strain on my hips and low back my I'm telling you forever and didn't even move my hips in a circle like a figure back do you ever use a reverse hyper I do I use a reverse hyper I like to do a lot of stiff like stuff I avoid deadlifts as much as possible but like I mean still computer can't crash and what I did now was what a lot of guys do is they use a suit I didn't know like everyone was using deadlift suits and it was actually protecting their low back that's a lot of what his deadlifts who does is transfer it to your upper back which is like I went to worlds this year and it was the first time I didn't zero the deadlift at World's Strongest Man I pulled it up and it was it was fucking easy it was always in my groups and I was cruising zero the deadlift like didn't get it like a no rep like I was the first time I actually pulled the deadlift rep at World's Strongest Man every year I've been fighting to get in the finals and doing my best with one arm tied behind my back because when this event comes I get zero points hmm but like I finally figured that out as well I was I was still thinking that I was close to retiring even though I was feeling better but then I realized that I'm so much stronger now and I don't have all the pain so like I'm I'm almost like peak age for strength too so I got to give it a couple more years I guess a peak age for strength they say but for at least from what I've been told they say it's like between 34 and 36 is for strongmen this is what I've always been told but honestly I think the longer we study the stuff the more realizing this like if you treat your body right you can keep getting stronger as long as you don't break things messing them that's the big issue right people break things and they have to work around those things and they break something else and they're compensating cuz one nice fucked up and then the other knee blows out because it's compensating for the bad knees luckily yeah yeah I always tell people like I know a lot of people that have had ACL surgeries and they try or ACL injuries and they try to not have surgery we try to just rehab it and I'm like god dammit just get the fucking surgery right yeah you're gonna be out for six months but at least you'll have a fixed name right I know you're you're bad yeah you'll be great like and years can happen whether you like it or not right in this way that year happens and while it's happening you know you'll realize like hey I got a I got to keep my fucking legs strong I got to keep all those stabilizer muscles strong right and then everything else doesn't fall hamstring hamstring strength it's big huge huge and but strength a lot of guys don't like to do like butt exercises that's huge man it saves your low back and you feel better and also stretching out the front end of your hips and your abdominals stretching that stuff that company you spoke about is so right yeah they actually just they hit me up the other day and they were like we got what we really want to send you in ladies and I was like fuck you have them here no no they're sending me one so we got want to give you right now nice yeah give us a box of them I give them to people I fucking believe in them they're not expensive it's real simple super easy to use.you I put them down the ground and lie on it it's just like kids in there mmm dig and it's not just for the so awesome oh so it's for your whole back right I use it on everything I use it on my shoulders I use on my legs yeah I saw a video where this guy was doing the outside of his legs and everything with it brutal yeah but you know what's my favorite is that timtam thing that thing right there see that that jackhammer motherfucker yeah there yeah that's like a upgraded tarragon yeah that's like even more about new ones yeah that thing's amazing and they don't die as quick to a lot of the guys that world use those those are good they're so good yeah yeah although all that kind of recovery stuff is so important guys I think they could just work out and and not take that time and recover right yeah I was that guy though I wasn't you you learn more I mean I when when I needed one this ripped we this was the full tab finally like my my tendon exploded it didn't rip actually it exploded so they were still look at when you were doing the Hercules thing no no that that was after that was after so that when that happened it wasn't it didn't fully separate so but when when I went home and I was training down the road this was like a little while later so you didn't even get surgery immediately you couldn't you can't why because first off if it's muscle or if it's not completely separated you can get surgery but this basically what I'm saying is exactly what's your same just a different time period I this exploded off the tendon when I was doing a world-record attempt for an axel in training and that I I was like I knew it was tore right away but we had the pilot for the TV show we were supposed to film in Nova Scotia Canada this next day and I knew what an opportunity it was so I said fuck it I went took a shower and got on a plane and I flew to Canada and in Canada with with it completely torn knowing that I needed surgery and like like the worst pain ever we had to flip a boat so like one of those little row boats we had to flip it like a tire then we carried three hundred pound water jugs up a hill we did like all the stuff with that separated and the entire time it just felt like someone was stabbing me with a cattle prod but that one that was meat head but boy worried that you were doing more permanent damage though not on the bicep no once once the bicep goes the only thing worse you can really do is shove it up higher so they have to Flay you deeper when they pull it down and lays it hard I'm thinking some fucking Inquisition type torture device right but I had a I had a great surgeon I was I was taking care of man and it was it wasn't too bad how long is the rehab to moan Oh three weeks in a cast and then like he gave me this like an arm brace that would like I'd adjusted every week or so to wear good more and more straight and then that was maybe three months before I could use it and at that point it's not like I could go do what I was doing it's at that point you start over Wow yeah and it was my arm was like tiny I was but I was pretty pissed off leaving your arm Chinese how weird is that I'm walking around like one like this and the other one looks like it works a bit like some IT company well you know bas Rutten you know yeah yeah I met him a few times box has what he calls baby arm is one arm that's small because of atrophy because of pinched nerves right this is really it's really kind of fucked up yeah it's like to this day he I don't think he can hold up a jug of milk oh sure like he couldn't like hold a jug of milk in his arm extend his arm yeah that's a guy that for some reason didn't get a lot of the love that he so deserves he was a pioneer Savage yeah and one of the most like one of the original technical strikers right taking on dudes way bigger than him and still handle them like hoist Gracie is amazing and savage but he was doing the exact same thing oh yeah yeah he was just years later but if hoist had to fight bas Rutten it would have been ugly but no the thing is like in the early days boss didn't understand submissions either so hoist would have probably got him if it was like UFC one right yeah it's um it's a crazy sport and the people that have been able to you know like pave the way like a guy like bas Rutten yeah they were such he's such a savage he would just shoot cortisone into everything all of his joints are all fucked up you just take cortisone shots just shoot it into everything well lidocaine shoot lidocaine into his shins oh my god so he can fucking blast people not feeling we had amazing stories though we went to his gym we did I did mas mas wrestling is like an old Russian style wrestling y-you have like a a stick and you each hold the ends of the stick and try and take it from each other ah and we actually I did it twice and two tournaments and I was the undefeated American champion for a year and a half but after doing it twice but we went to his gym to do the qualifiers to go to the World Championship in Dubai and he came out there and he was judging and stuff and I remember like I basically I was way bigger than most people and I'm like upper body heavy so I just lean back and take hit and at the end of it he walked over and he goes he's like the force is strong with you son I love this guy yeah he's got a great personality he's he's a great commentator too it's great at that it's fun yes it makes shit fun yeah he seems like cool what's with the average lifespan in terms of like how much time you can compete at the highest level for strongmen because it seems like you're everything is so fucking heavy it's everything is gonna almost blow out right look how many years can a guy expect to compete at the highest level it depends on the guy dependence we're getting better at holding on to that kind of stuff and if you make it to the top echelon salute you're saying at the top level I'd say the average the average is low it's probably like a year two years but if you just took the last five years and kind of cut that out and did your own like like study that with that five years let's say guys now are gonna average more like like three to five years five maybe six if you're doing good but then you have these guys like like Brian Shaw has been doing it since before I even know what it was you know brian schatz four-time World's Strongest Man out of Colorado he takes his rehab seriously he's he like he doesn't care about how much it costs or what it takes like it's to him he's an athlete first like he's got these really amazing like cold pools and hot pools right actually each other at his house and and all the different type of equipment that he would need to rehab and he's he's always making sure he gets body work done two three times a week and when we're on the road like like when we were on the road for me that that's that was it was an education because I was with Nick best who's 55 and he's he's still doing this really yeah 55 oh he's just a savage man he's an old power lifter and and he's at the point where he needs help to get down to the ground to pick something up but he's trying to figure that stuff out and and he's definitely gonna pay for it for the years of savagery for sure but we got we have him and then we have Eddie Hall Eddie halls one world Strongest Man 2017 and he's the the strongest person to ever deadlift in the world he pulled 500 kilos from the ground which is eleven hundred and four pounds I believe five hundred kilo deadlift and just straight stood up with it like it was nothing looked around the crowd made sure they understood he had it like it was easy and then put it back down you know that and a lot of people's opinion that makes him the strongest man ever to live deadlift - a lot of people whose King then we have Brian Shaw four times world Strongest Man and he's like a mad scientist with this stuff like if you go to talk to Brian Shaw about like the trajectory of a sandbag or or how you want to put your hand placement or where you want to do this is that or like anything that has to do with the science of lifting he can dissect it like basically Bill Nye the Science Guy that's what that's what I always call him it's a daddybo because he it's crazy reminds me of debo from Friday and he makes me look small Brian Brian's got me by like two inches in like 40 pounds Wow and when he gets tired or hungry he starts to get that flex you know and he's like it goes like that Deebo calm down but like I'm traveling the world with these guys and I'm I'm basically picking my little pieces out of what they've learned and what they've done because I'm very young in this game I haven't been doing it for a long time I've I'm still I mean I'm getting to the point now where I feel comfortable calling myself like not a rookie I wouldn't say I'm Ivette I'm right about that but I've got to learn like what Bryan does for his rehab how many times he gets massage therapy and what the difference is between massage therapy and a massage or someone who's a PT and someone who actually is fluent in like deep tissue or sports sports therapy that kind of stuff you learn all that stuff and I never took the time or spent the money honestly I just I never had I was never in a situation where I could spend that money and take care of myself that way it always kind of seemed like a luxury and it's not like for them it's it's maintenance it's like getting the oil changed in a car do you roll out with a lacrosse ball oh geez like one of those WOD balls I just saw a softball yeah I use softball cuz it's big and it's not hard like a baseball so I mean for a lot of people that's too much but for me it's perfect and I actually do a lot I try and get a lot of people to do them on the front of the hips too because it's it's nice like pressure point stuff yeah really good or like an atlas stone the the balls that we lift the concrete stones yeah you just roll your stomach over that and just relax and just let it sit there and it kind of just pushes everything back and moves it around you know so I like doing a lot of us I've seen a lot of guys do that with kettlebells as well yeah there's you I down on them and roll it over your back because it's unforgiving it pulls all the tissue apart yep exactly yeah now what about food like what what kind of diet are you guys on we all basically the exact same thing yeah oh just a ton of meat and rice and we do a lot of peppers and stuff like that no one's vegan no that one guy that Patrick with the foxes name there's a vegan strongman I've heard of I don't remember his name but he's not like he's never been in the world Strongest Man well there's there's a documentary they're doing with James Cameron where they're trying to as being james cameron's on this vegan kick mm-hmm his wife has a school and they feed the kids all vegan food and Arnold's a part of this too and there yeah that guy yeah yeah yeah I know who that is he's not one of the strongest men in the world he's a strong Landon he's strong and I've said no disrespect I'm not I'm not I'm not saying anything bad about him he's just put that back up again Jamie he's just he's I don't and from what I recall he's never even been invited toward snores man so it's bullshit yeah I mean you can say a lot of things like this guy say say he broke a record in in like some powerlifting competition that was in a guy's backyard right and they call that a world record and then all of a sudden now he's a world record strength athlete because his buddy in his backyard said so a lot of that happens I don't know specifically about him I've no no clue where he's getting his his uh his credentials from one meal a day see this is ridiculous one meal a day and vegan vegan professional power lifter to 13 2013 said the deadlift world record for his weight class Oh 672 pounds for how much does he weigh though there's six seventy two isn't even big for guys that are like a hundred and fifty well he's only five seven okay so he's smaller than me so they're talking about powerlifting to see once you get into powerlifting there's so many little federations and stuff like that everybody and their mother has World Records and just listen man so this documentary is touting because that's what I was confused like all the strong men that I've seen are giants right right like how can a five seven guy I've never seen them anyway on the circuit or anywhere and there is a circuit like confirmed circuit with guys like you yeah Eddie Hall and Nick best we have humans yeah we have the we have Giants live Giants live is the qualifying tour for world Strongest Man so to get to Giants live you either there's like a bunch of little Federation's that you could possibly do well in and they'll invite you or you know like getting invited is kind of like the only tricky thing get getting in but once you get there if you prove yourself you get top three or if if like say you go to my first Giants live I went to it was like stacked like it was ten of the strongest men on the planet and normally Giants live has like three of the top ten and then a few of other guys trying to get in and so when I went it was topped all the top ten guys and I got a sixth place I believe but I still got invited the world Strongest Man because it was the top 10 strongest men in the world there when I did that so normally you have to go to a Giants live prove yourself there and then you get divided to world Strongest Man sometimes like we've had years where world Strongest Man got pushed and was filmed early so they had to invite other guys but you can you can always tell who's strong like you you can see when I got shows up and and he's ready to go or if he's just got show muscles or if he's just a big chubby dude you know and it's it's I mean you strap a guy to a truck and tell him to pull it 30 meters you're gonna figure that shit out real quick yeah I can only imagine shit show for some people well there because the James Cameron thing they're pulling this guy out as if he's some world record power lifter strongman guy he probably has invested he probably has some type of world record I I've seen him because I've posted videos talking about my meals and stuff before and a lot of people give me that like this guy does this and he's vegan but I've I mean if the biggest poll he's ever pulled is 627 that that wouldn't even do like that would get last place at an amateur heavyweight show in America but also the other thing is is America we have way of the strongest men in the world to like everyone it's weird in America we have these people like have these this love for other countries everyone wants to be like well here in Iceland they're really strong or oh and Poland they're this and it's like motherfucker we're strong here like we're fucking strong like if you're an American getting into Worlds is the hardest way to get in is if you go to another country it's much easier much easier because here we've got out of the top ten we've probably got four or five guys four or five guys that are top ten in the world at any given time and only like three or four maybe five guys get invited every year from America so if you're if you're getting in the world's you've got to be a bad motherfucker or go move to Poland or actually Poland's got a bad dude right now Go Go move to Lithuania or go go somewhere else like it would be easier cuz you'd represent a country with a smaller talent pool yeah much easier what about hanging out here what about the mountain the guy for the game of the mountain from Iceland yes legit he's a savage yeah yeah he won last year yeah he's no joke man he's strong how do you say his name uh half-thought Julius Bronson just calm Thor half Thor Julius Bronson half Thor Julius Bronson bjornsen B onsen yeah he's a savage yeah he's strong and he's definitely legit no joke you know he's he's good he got third place this year he's uh you know doesn't he fighting off Bell's palsy or something he had he had Bell's palsy a couple years ago and he's I think he's almost all the way better like his not to be rude but his face always had like a little bit of uh like my I've got these huge fat chubby cheeks so I'm allowed to talk shit I guess but he had he had kind of like that look on his face a little bit already so but I'm pretty sure he's he's probably like aw I'd say at least 99% done and this is that shit a lot of times it's stress it can be an infection I'm I'm not a doctor I'm just pretty not a doctor at the moment I'm working on getting my license Jaime the fuck is this guy here for it's fucking done so all of you basically you're saying eat the same thing it's just a meat and rice basically meat and rice potatoes it's kind of meat and a lot of times its bison and we do it sounds strong yeah I fucking love bison oh shit how long you in town for two more days you got some way you can cook yeah I got a lot of elk for you oh my god I love you my favorite commercial freezers in the back nice I shot two last year so I really yeah I try to give it out to maybe my weird weird go one of them in Utah and in central California nice nice nice I've always been Oregon they got a ton of elk on the Lord it was Roosevelt elk in in Oregon their bigger body - that's right animal man and the best meat this through this but in my opinion the best meat there is yes elk by far yeah it's my favorite so good for you - yeah it's taste so damn good - I've never had out that I didn't like even if the guy cooking it sucked it still came out good yeah that's a crazy taste right it's like people to think that uh that venison is gamey like first of all just because someone hasn't prepared it correctly and they take care of it after they killed it but - it's like not alq no no the shit is always good you could have an old bowl like a fucking ten year old bowls been rotting and snap another elk with his head huh and still taste delicious when it's fucking amazing yeah that's the reason why wolves are chasing those motherfucker exactly that's delicious so how many times you eat a day so right now it's usually it's usually about five but right now my five meals are smaller like when we're going in the world's like the last two months I mean those five meals and then anything else everything else just don't raise everything I possibly can yeah and um you know I try and keep it clean but you just you just want it all when you're in a competition how many days is a like World's Strongest Man competition world Strongest Man is normally two three weeks two or three weeks fucking savages it's so brutal so are you working out at all while that's going already just doing the events you're doing the event and then you immediately try and find someplace cold because normally world's is in some exotic location that were selling tourism - so it's like Malaysia Africa we were in Florida this year it's always some hot humid place so trying to get people to come to see it right a lot of it's a tourism ad and um it's always beautiful background right background fucking hell on us you know it's it's brutal yeah so but I mean it's it's part of what pays for everything and none of us really we all know to expect it's going to be hot and humid we just you know now myself this is the first time I've had people come with me like every time I've been the world's before it was just me and my gym bag and I'm just ready to bang you know but now I have to for some reason I kept thinking of a sock on the cock thing so but now this this year and every year forward from now on I had my crew like my girl was with me and two of the guys I trained with and they basically so we'll be in our tent and like 400 yards away is them lifting and if I want to know who's doing what or what position they're in or like I'm competing in a group of five I need to know how many points this guy just scored what this guy has like I need to know all that before I would have to walk out there hot and humid find out that come back and be moving back and forth doing all that stuff if I want to get food anything it's just a ton of extra stress this year like they literally wouldn't even let me bend over to tie my own shoes like they put him on me behind me set and I was fucking strong and shit Joe I'm telling you because of everything like the work to that I really thank Brian Nick and Ed for how strong I was this year like just training with them and then you know when when you're with somebody like you compete just if if you and I were walking to the door I'd try and get that faster you know yes just the way it is right so doing that for the entire year going in the Worlds I showed up and I've been going chest to chest with the strong in my opinion Brian Shaw is the strongest man who ever lived and so I've been going chest to chest with this dude all year you thirty other dudes ain't shit I'm here to take your money right so I felt great and having them help me and stuff it just it all added up to me feeling the best I've ever felt do you do a lot of ice baths yeah yeah yeah I didn't before cuz I I was basically just pushing out and just didn't wanna but they they you have to if you're training with these guys you have to they're not gonna let you slide it's like that that Coach that's just like yo you don't want to okay well twice as long for you when do you do the the ice bath because I was reading something I think was Andy Galpin had a study that he put up about hypertrophy and how it how it affects its affected by ice baths right that there's a certain amount of time and what you're lifting you should wait before you get in an ice bath yeah we've all known that for a while yeah I didn't know that that was new information because a lot of people are just now finding out the way your body reacts after a workout like the pain the inflammation all that stuff you're supposed to allow that fat long for us it's like will train normal it depends on filming like because we'd we worked 13 hour days on top of that you know and you're not filming us fucking exhausting it's like yeah you did that perfect do it three more times you know that shit's so crazy but um so normally if we train in the morning we would we would wait to ice baths to the end of the day but if if we trained immediately after after set like we got off set we went and trained so be like six or seven at night we'd come back we'd eat and we'd like conversate take our time and then we would go just before bed so it's it's like I think minimum we would do like like two hours or so and I know maybe that's too long maybe maybe but you know for us that's that usually just that's our routine we we don't want to avoid that stuff because that's kind of your body learning how to deal with that yeah I think that what they were studying was the difference between someone who did it immediately after workout or someone who waited an hour and waiting an hour was beneficial to muscle growth right yeah and it's the same thing with you see people like pop and ibuprofen after workouts and stuff bro you're supposed to feel that you're supposed to feel that shit yeah yeah it's part of the part of the whole thing now when you're eating these five meals a day do you have like a meal prep person that sets it up so they have the right amount of calories and nutrients and yeah you're doing it I don't have to worry about that too much when we're on set we have caterers and stuff and so it's it's super easy then do the caterers like give you bison and rice always like everything you need everything when it's nice so when it's that it's not easy but when I get home see you get used for that too so you go home and you try and eat some shitty me after after like three straight weeks of clean food your body like what are you doing well you know enjoy these parts exactly exactly run my girl out the house no you're bad what about drink what do you drink do you drink just water very water um I switch to those like we when we're doing like humid shit like when human areas the liquid ivy we did those we did those but and I got off a Gatorade and switched to those body armors I was like I was body almost is like less sugar and it's just it's way better more electrolytes yeah so it's only I only do those when when we're actually training and it's humid I I try them the best I can to keep myself from like allowing that type of stuff unless it's competition like when it's competition take the fucking ibuprofen drink the body armor all that shit like this is what you this is the moment you worked for like you want it to be as smooth as possible now but when you're leading up into that it's it's it's water but when I'm when I'm really tight on my diet like everyone smile would be a Coke Zero which I'm telling ya getting crazy it saves me I don't get in and out but I'll have this Cook said it'll be okay with you know in and outs amazing it's this is for everyone in Texas I'm so sorry but in and out is a million times now no they're in Dallas then Austin then new braunfels yeah those water burger people are there drinking the kool-aid if you campaign water burger you got a compared to like McDonald's like Burger King it's been that's a different show like this is this is the different ticket the only people that fuck was in it now is five guys okay five guys but if you go to Austin and we're on it is if you go out there there's this place called P Terry's there's only three or four of them and they're only in that area I'm telling you they crush everybody I'm Harry P Terry's just like Terry Crews like GE rry apostrophe s and I'm telling you like this is not a sponsor that they are the fuckin shit and their fries internauts fries are okay they're not the best other guys have better fries way better waiting fries and they have better burger choices too $5 weird jalapenos bacon exactly have shakes right oh they do have shakes yeah five guys didn't have shakes for a while now they have shakes at some places but they win but with the jalapenos oh yeah I'll be honest and bacon yeah they gave me more options yeah better buns too yeah way better buns that's what I'm saying but when you go to Austin you got hungry now we left we left evil live to last night in a limo and I was like we've been here for nine hours we're stopping in and out guy was like you've never had in-n-out I was like no I've had it we're just stopping that damn Terry's bang for you that does goddamn good yeah so good and they're only in that area it was really yep they need to branch the fuck out that looks fantastic yeah whoo yeah next time is that for sure yeah I'm in so what about supplements like vitamins yeah minerals actually a protein is something I definitely stick to and I do pre workouts depending on like what mood I'm and what kind of protein powder you I'm spoiled I do the rtds like they're ready to drinks well like I'll get those cases at Costco man Costco has always got great deals but um I like to basically use whatever is easy on my stomach you know like way do you like pea protein hemp what do you like I've had I've had pipi was okay it tasted kind of funny hemp hemp nice yeah and Saul was nice and if you can for me like it's just nice to go back to that like percent you need to on it stuff no on it I get I wish I had some here give you some no we have any on it baby we'll see it's always nice empty man whatever it's always nice to go back to the hemp like yeah for anything for like if you're doing clothes or anything like that it's just so easy to digest to write hemp protein just like Goethe no problem nice yeah it's my favorite yeah and then so I'll do I Dupri's and stuff like that I actually work with a company called Nanna suitable solutions that does the vitamins and it's basically I'm gonna fuck this all up concussions don't don't that's fucking and don't email me telling me I fucked this up I'm trying right now I fucked this up got that email Joe okay the email Joe that's what so nananana suitable solutions they take like basically your normal vitamins and they break them down into a smaller a bit like normally the smallest way you can you can it's called bio like the way your body ingested it's a bioavailable there you go thank you that was gonna bug me so so for your body to actually accepted like the lowest we've gotten so I think micrograms something like that and the the sky at a San Antonio he broke it down into nano grams and he's been working with me I think I'm the only athlete he works with he's a small company and we've been talking we were working together and I could just tell right away I used to do b12 shots you never had b12 seven you know how right afterwards you kind of taste that that weird taste in your mouth and you get that energy or with him he has that sublingual vitamins so like between the b12 and the glutathione that I'm telling you like the b12 it was just like getting a b12 shot what's the name is company Nana suitable solutions nano suitable solution there we go the prior Terry manufacturing process allows for the molecular dispersion without excessive heat or breaking of the chemical bonds this allows the vitamins and supplements to remain unchanged and undamaged when they are absorbed in your body fuckin um in that's exactly what I said methyl b12 melatonin glutathione and glutathione secesh nobody knows about chimera cancer cumin I just found out that turmeric has an R in it yeah I learned it this year I learned that from you that's like I thought it was you Marik goddamn it was so stupid yeah we are reptiles for sure you and I for sure so I do that not small people out there make it vitamins that I'm nanograms yeah exactly so I just try and eat clean and that kind of stuff you know and it's you can we can always tell when our bodies like act a little weird it's funny and you can just backtrack a little bit and you're like oh like I've been doing this a little different I've had beer fucking six nights in a row like just shit yeah so most of the time it's self regulation now you said that they drug test you guys what are they testing for they test for everything when we get drug tested at World's Strongest Man it's for everything it's steroids for steroids it's fake everybody has to be on steroids no I mean I don't know what to tell you when there's one test a year right so you don't test that test you have to pass that test and they can test you randomly to the randomly thing from my experience the random thing only happens if you're acting like you're on em feta means feel like you're on feta means they're gonna test you and there's been guys who pop and fram feta means after they randomly tested them exactly if you're screaming at somebody about talking sock and all that you're gonna get drug tested so that's what I would imagine that they would worry about that when it comes to lifting right most definitely I don't want somebody to got dye on there right now you can't have that and more like pulling that truck I'm telling you they stopped using the heart meters because people were losing their fucking minds seeing that our hearts were so high it was like 240 a minute Wow maybe 230 yeah it's insane you can get that high that's what everybody else said so they pulled the fucking meters oh my god dude that's like a jackrabbit crazy huh Wow 240 a minute fucking a does anybody pissed hot for steroids I believe one person got busted I would imagine I don't want to say his name cuz I don't know if that was for steroids or for a meth what I say what a call and let me yeah that makes sense but I mean I have to feel like for steroids are coming I mean I don't want to like push it but it seems like you'd have to be I mean it's it's a sport where it's it's built for bigger men but I mean there's a lot of guys who have gone through and been very adamant that they're not and you know we get tested we will literally like every year I have to explain to the guy like yes there's gonna be marijuana in my system and that's in the rules that it says it's okay like I have that conversation every year and it used to be illegal you should be illegal Emily got we got a switched believe 14 switch I brought it up a lot I don't know if that really changed anything but I was like look at these fucking gorillas you want everyone here I'm vicodin and like I would literally like all I'm saying is we should be able to smoke weed I'm not saying League I should be able to do math or any other shit none of that like well I think we're finally recognizing finally as a culture that weed is not what everybody thought it was we're never in the 50s and the 30s and thank God thank God because I mean people were doing so much worse shit well that's why that little Jeff Sessions cunt was driving me fucking crazy when he was the Attorney General and he was saying we got a you know marijuana's good people don't smoke marijuana like right yeah you're not hanging around with good people for not at all because good people don't want to hang out with you exactly you don't know what you're talking and wasn't it wasn't a Hillary that was saying it was she was gonna do her best to keep it illegal yeah she had some nonsense that she was saying to that was I don't know she fucking who knows that's crazy if I was you and just being honest on the show would scare the little fuck out of me because so many people listen I just be worried that sooner or later like you know somebody for you just show up Hillary just shows up the show carrier like one of the Kings they carry with the poles on the shoulders moves the veil impeach yes that is the one did you see that video I put on my Instagram with that dude who ya with a Hillary head inside the body that was so badass who is that guy let's give that guy some props cuz that fuckin animation is amazing put it put it up on on the big screen this like one of those things were like how does this guy even think of this and where is he buying his weed because this is not something that a regular person thinks of is his name be bullcrap be VP le underscore craap and he's got this video of this Trump robot with glowing eyes and one artificial leg moving and the entire body of the Trump robot is Hillary's giant head floating around in a vat of liquid like a war-torn United States soldiers marching with them yeah at some apocalyptic post-apocalyptic scenario but there's all these lights and it's fucking amazing it's so dope and Trump's body is weird and his feet are like baby feet yeah yeah they always get that they do their best to just fuck with that like because it bothers him he should have never acted like it bothered him did he act like it bothered and I think he said something about my hand these big hands after they'd said it I don't know that's the thing is every every dude knows like if a guy flinches when you say some shit you say some more that shit flinch but they're the ones who say you don't body shame I mean while their body shaming this programmer having look he doesn't even have little hands abnormal hands rules don't exist anymore has made this thing - gorilla yeah if I was Trump I would hire a trainer and just get on the best juice - if I had abs like that I'd never wear shirt I go to funerals without a shirt on yeah sorry bro you dead but I'm jacked in town put a sock on your cock yeah I don't I don't think Trump has little hands the regular hands but it is a constant theme generous but that thing that people craft guy you say his name beat will underscore crap he's amazing got some great shit on his page - that's really cool goddamn look at that a giant kim jeong-hoon robot there wasn't Trump just a nude no a runner but mardian with that dude they probably killed somebody together I wonder if it was like the interview where he let him try the tan and they were listening to my Miley Cyrus was a Miley Cyrus what was it remember it wasn't my least listened to in the movie the interview yeah they were joking around and welcome I don't remember yeah there's the Seth Rogen movie yeah hilarious movie by the way I never saw that movie oh you got to see that shit it's fucking clips no you got to see that one that's good that movies like vanished like I forgot about it huh I can tell you just brought it up I was like oh yeah it's on Netflix I'm sure it is yeah all those all those like from super bad got me like I was a monkey for battle airs so good at sex when you go to college you won't be sucking dick you fucking pussy I don't know man but the scene Woody's just draw a dick yeah just preposterous shit that just like relaxed humor yeah yeah you didn't care if it bothered somebody and now he wasn't trying to be a dick but he was funny well what's interesting is that was quite a few years ago I wonder if they would even do that movie that way today you know who's like 2013 there's the movie coming out about three younger kids than the super bad movie and it's rated R it seems like it's right along that same vein of like yeah he immersed how many know thank God we need more than yeah it's like the backlash is stronger now than ever before but also the appreciation of it is stronger now than ever before too because people are so tired of people being so politically correct and so upset about everything yeah you know like no one's telling you to be an asshole but did people are jumping on things that aren't even bad right it's like I was I'm actually like a little nervous about telling athletes that they should smoke weed now like that's that's nerve-racking because like your whole dependent you're dependent on your underboss and the places you work in you do so just saying something like that if two people find that offensive and they raise enough how sure that's a big fucking deal but what we're just saying is like it's better than vicodin it's better than Hills it's it's it's a very much healthier alternative alternative well you know what it is man it's a tool it's like you can abuse tools but you could also use them correctly you mean you don't want to fucking hammer nails with a saw right but but if you use marijuana correctly and you have discipline and you know what you're doing the problem is that it's been illegal for so long people don't understand what the best way to use it for is and what are the side effects what is the you know what's the paranoia what's this heightened sense of awareness that kind of freaks people out like how do you how do you mitigate that how do you how do you get over what's the right dosage all that stuff is dependent upon information and when people are lying to you about it being terrible and you know making you fucking blind and losing your marbles you're gonna kill people yeah this stuff people are so confused about it that it also makes you more paranoid because as you're smoking you thinking oh my god I shouldn't be doing this right what am i doing I'm ruining my life I can't believe in doing that then you get even more paranoid and then you're like I'm never doing this again exactly yeah yeah now what about sponsors is it ever an issue with sponsors the weed thing where would be right now the only people I work with other than myself is that an analytical solution so he's actually working on doing the CBB thing and stuff um I don't know if I'll be a part of that because I'm trying to there's it's so available now I just I'd rather just find whoever does it the very best and not not marketing right it's so saturated I just take it for myself actually a lot of people I I worked in group homes when I was in college for kids with autism for for a long time and there was actually this little girl who she had this this it's not a disease she had this I'll just call it a thing she had this thing where she always felt like she was falling so I'm so like she looked completely normal she was autistic and nonverbal didn't speak but imagine all day feeling like you're falling so she learned as a child really little if she would hit herself that people would hold her so if you weren't holding her she would literally she watched her break her own nose and she was she was 11 years old this this sweet little girl like just super nice and smiley but like if you didn't hold her she just whack right on the face and we found out that through I don't remember exactly how it came about but they they gave her THC pills they gave her THC pills and then stopped she would walk around the house normally like she was still nonverbal it's not like I fixed her autism or any of that stuff but with the whole symptoms of feeling like she was falling which I'm sure I don't even think had anything to do with autism again I'm not a doctor but shit so uh would they gave her THC pills and she was like just walking around the house smiling she would help us cook she would move around like she would help the other kids cuz there's four kids in the house she would help the other kids tie their shoes stuff like that that's true some then her parents came back must have been four months later and their friends had guilted them about giving her dog their daughter weed and they stopped giving it to her and she went right back to it straight back to it it's so stupid it's just ignorant people just don't understand what it is all it is yeah oh that's so sad I felt so bad it's one of the things that like just rip me apart from working in that field it's just there's so much like there's these little rules that you don't understand we had a kid that would sit right and he would just he would feel stressed out and he would sit and the rule was when he did that we weren't allowed to help him up or move him or anything like that because that was rewarding bad behavior that's how they classified that so he would just sit in the middle of the road and we weren't allowed to get him out of the middle of the road he would he would and then he learned that if he didn't want to do something if he basically would stay in his room all day he would stay in his room all day because he didn't like they only work or he liked was me and I think it was just because I was big and jolly and all but if he didn't like the person who was working with he just sit in his room on the floor and then they couldn't touch him they couldn't do anything he just sit there he'd go days without eating or going anywhere out of the room or anything like that and it was all because we'd put these rules in and put these chains on ourselves based off of other people's opinions are worrying what it would look like if we did this you know if this girl's taking this pill what does that look like or if we're picking this boy up off the ground what does that look like and it was it was it was it was like trying to help these children with your hands tied behind your back and I don't know if it's like that anymore it was this was a long time ago but it was just it was heartbreaking I remember everyone was terrified to work with this little boy he was 10 or 11 he's just a sweet little dude he just didn't he got nervous you know and so I remember coming in and one day I was like you know what I'm I'm taking him to go to a football game so I took him to a college division 1 football game never had an issue never had any problems never sat down nothing sat second-row in the endzone and like would get all excited every time anybody came by like the the cannon went off for a touchdown it was like the greatest moment of my whole like college career was hanging out with this eleven-year-old at a college football game it's people were too terrified to even get out of his room that's terrible that's so cool you got him there though yeah I'd like to think that a lot of people work more in that direction after I left you know I'm hoping then she was you could see in his eyes he was a sweet little boy you know and you know you there's I've never met a kid that was evil ever you just need to know how to how to work with him how to talk with him well that's cool you have that kind of patience yeah do you have kids your own I do I have a three-year-old boy oh nice yeah I'm a little Atlas bear first one three-year-old yeah oh that's that's a fun age man they start talking to you and they're running around telling all the stories and everything at night now he doesn't even like like we have to read books before we go to bed because when we go to bed he wants to tell me stories so he'll lay there and he'll be like well this one time and he'll talk for like ten minutes about some shit you know it's it's so sweet and so cute yeah Wild Thing having a little-person that he made yeah people that don't experience it's it's very very hard to describe yeah it's like the sweetest most lovey most intense sweetness you've ever felt in your life yet the scariest fucking most horrifying thing at the exact same time right you just feel so vulnerable yeah vulnerable is a great word for it I also have so much more compassion for other people now because I think of other people now as babies that grew up where I used to think I look at this asshole and I think how that asshole used to be a little baby like someone's little boy right someone's carrying him and holding them and he just got bad information and now he's all fucked up yeah yeah I saw some homeless guy today I was a stoplight he was wearing a bathrobe got a bathrobe and socks on it's just dirty yeah fucked up and I was looking at him like this that was someone's baby boy yeah now here he is a guy in his 30s or 40s whatever he was just wandering around all fucked up and dirty with mental health problems we're in a bathrobe and my taste to be someone's boy yeah that's us it's good for you to feel that way but it's rough to live like that yeah well it's it's it's so hard when you look at all the problems in the world and all the people that are suffering from poverty and disease and strife and natural disasters and all these things there's just so many people to care about and think about yeah it's almost like you can become paralysed with compassion just as definitely just looking at all the problems with the world yeah and then the other side of it the one that gets me a lot is like when you see parents or you hear about parents I haven't seen a lot but you hear about parents who just don't give a fuck it's like this is this is a burden on me and they avoid it in digit I when you look at your daughter's eyes have you ever once in your life imagine being able to walk away from that and fuck that would that would kill me I heard a story about a lady who abandoned her kids the other day I just couldn't imagine that she abandoned her kids and wanting to start fresh left the husband with the kids just left Wow and I was just sitting on why in the fuck and then the fires came and their fucking house burnt Wow and so then so here they are the dad and the kids daughters and the mom fucking jet and the guys there the no house oh my god Jesus cursed man yeah man it's uh it's rough cuz you gotta wonder like what is wrong with that person like we're kind of schizophrenia they dealing with kind of mental health issues like what is right how could you do that like how do you not like you think about what you experienced with your son and I think about what I experienced with my daughters and like how could you how could you not want to be there for them how could you not want to take care of them how could you not want to love them lets there's some kind of disconnect man yeah what happened well I mean you think about that poor girl kept punching herself in the face because she thought she was falling like there's obviously an issue there like what other issues are there psychologically with empathy issues detachments you know sociopathy like what what's wrong with them that they're allowed that they can allow that in their life you know almost too many people man that's too much to pay attention to yeah well I mean legitimately it's hard to say what it is too much yeah it's it's hard to say that I'm accept it but it is I mean that's how a lot of people end up going crazy yeah paralyzed from fear or worry yeah that's where we comes in yes you just worry about aliens if you have a guess I'll turn around on you what do you think about aliens do you think Bob Lazar is telling the truth I know you didn't look him in the eye because you weren't in the room with them yeah wise I told you I was I'm the one of the the creepers that watched the YouTube video I'm that guy right there I sit at home I don't really watch much TV like I'll sit at home and like stretch and watch you watch these videos so it's I think it's a whole new thing to it like it adds an element that I really like like being able to see miss Pat dude yeah fucking hilarious the entire time I was like like glued there's did everybody I mean I've never before I mean when she talks about broke dudes or great at swingers you know I love his are re subtleness like oh man he's fuckin well I would imagine them that for like a guy was doing such ruthless fucking explosive shit like you're doing all the time like comedy must be kind of important for sure it's a huge release plus I mean I like I like it and a lot of my friends were that like I was friends with a lot of guys at the Comedy Store so I was around it like I even I saw about doing it for a while I just I know I'd have to dedicate so much to even be decent that I just couldn't do that but it's it's one of those things I like to date tried it for a little bit yeah yeah I was with him I was hanging out with him a lot when he was working on material and stuff I remember he came over and he gave me this badass poncho one time he just randomly came over to give me a poncho and I'm like date yeah I think he wanted to hang out and we were sitting out on my deck and with the support he was working we're just chilling he was like it's so cool one of the what's that quote it's better to be a warrior in a garden and a gardener in the war yes that's tape yeah that's tape yeah and that's similar to you it's a lot of guys like that you see a lot of these guys gorgeous they're built ready to go you know like if some shit went down like I I would happily stand next to you you know like I'd be I'd be I'd feel like secure but you don't have to worry about like if if you're come in here you're not gonna have no fake light syndrome and flex up one right nothing an asshole yeah that's one of the things you do see with fighters too is that most of them in general they're really nice people yeah since they don't they're not always puffing their chests out for no reason act like an asshole for no reason they're nice folks yeah they get all that shit out they get it out in the gym and if you're a bad motherfucker you don't have to act like a bad motherfucker you just be you exam that's why I wear pink chucks and strong and pretty shirts and shit you know like I don't have to hide right directly well no one's disputing it exactly exactly mine they sometimes do who are they are they even real that's the people I'm saying I'm not a doctor for yeah but for the aliens um would he think you had a bet if I if you had a hundred bucks you last hundred bucks it's it's hard I if I had a hundred bucks and we were gonna find out I'd say I'm leaning more toward yes than no I'm not more towards yes - I wasn't leaning before that interview I wasn't though I wasn't before the documentary that Jeremy Korbel documentary bob lazar area 51 in flying saucers mm-hmm before that I was like mostly bullshit there's that one is that one available that's yeah it's great yeah I'll check that there's a lot of old Bob Lazar shit - from the George Knapp interviews where he goes over the the details of the craft and he describes it and explains it and what motherfucker knew about element 115 in the 1990s that's that's that's one of the big ones that gets me that's one of the big ones that's like that's a big red flag that this dude's real this is a lot who knows but there's a lot that makes me go mm-hmm I know we talk about this all the time but I so fucking like Sasquatch is real I'm walking around I buy all the little like roadside trinkets and yeah I love that shit I wish he was fucking real man it would be nice it's I mean that's that's one of the ones I'm like 90% sure you gotta give you always got to give room you always got to give room for the the possibility the thing is that people really believe and then go looking for it they invest so much time and if they start going crazy yeah like Survivorman Les Stroud yes it's gone gone gone gone it's out there in the woods yeah he's got a pup tent waiting for Bigfoot's not fuckin zippers yeah it's weird man he's a hundred percent believer now well he does that for Survivorman bigfoot show it was like when i heard a branch snap cut the corner that's definitely a Squatch yeah those shows are weird man because those shows have been on TV like surviving Bigfoot or Finding Bigfoot rather so Finding Bigfoot was on TV for what eight fucking years they never found shit how the fuck do you keep renewing that job I'm gonna breathe underwater the shows called breathing underwater can you breathe underwater not yet tune in next week next season though we're gonna try to breathe underwater another shootout y'all just give us an offseason we'll get this talking these scientists they're saying no one can breathe underwater not yet they don't know shit Russ honestly we south Louisiana we got a guy he breathed on water if if there was a Bigfoot no one would be happier than me dead I'd be right there though I was so fucking stuck man you seen it a cage yeah fuck that cage that I want to see it like in an anaphora destiny like the mushrooms trip where he's like walking and singing with him Oh Jack Black speaker that's the best to me Pick of Destiny I would want to be there I want to want to see it with my own eyes video I'd be like man I saw 80-foot tall Donald Trump with a Hillary Clinton walk it through a post-apocalyptic Philadelphia you can't you can't prove to me that video is real I didn't see it I would I would shit my pants I don't know what I would say though if I was in the woods and I was camping and I saw fucking nine foot tall gorillas I don't know what you wouldn't I mean if you came I'm not sure you'd probably have to yeah cuz you'd be so you feel so stupid yeah well puss I mean there's a lot I mean say there is one out there there's a lot of bullshit artists out there telling you they saw some shit yeah a lot of people trying to get some camera time it can't be one though if it's gonna be a real thing a living thing that has to be a living population of them yeah because primates don't live that long I don't think there's a primary that lives any older than humans we're just we're just way into the weeds we know it doesn't exist most like so exist yeah as they like to get better and better like using drones and scanning the forests and stuff it's getting less and less likely yeah I used to do that as a kid that like walk out in the woods and like look and hope yeah when I was living in Oregon I was like Hells Canyon is probably one of the least explored parts of Oregon if he was anyway he'd be up there you know well there's some dense ass thick forests in the Pacific Northwest which is one of the reasons why I think it's so attractive yeah because like you think like man could be in here no one knows like you go outside of Philadelphia or excuse me Seattle when you go into like you know what is it what's the mountain out there what's the Sat Helen say no it's the one that blue but there's another one that anyway those big-ass mountains filled with soup there's the trees are so dense it's like a box of q-tips yeah just one after the other bang bang bang bang bang and the forest floor is all pine needles so that nothing would leave a footprint right and then you looked like what if you saw something 30 yards away it could disappear instantly left right you wouldn't know where the fuck it is you'd never find it and it could it could be out there so I think that also leads to this this delusional idea that it might be alive right but I think it definitely was a real thing back in the day yeah they have that Gigantopithecus know that they proven was a real bipedal hominid that existed as recently as a hundred thousand years ago and in America no it was in Asia they found it in an apothecary shop there was an anthropologist who's in an apothecary found teeth and he was like what the fuck is this and they said we found these he's like where did you find these because he recognized his primary teeth and then they start digging they found jaw bones that were indicative of a bipedal hominid because of the shape of the jawbone they could tell the difference between like the way a gorilla's bones are shaped and the way ours are know and they think it was in the orangutan family and that it was enormous some enormous fucking 8 to 10 foot tall bipedal ape yeah so stories that build in buildings yes that's probably where the lore and the legend comes from you never seen like a picture of what it looks like I know I remember you talking about it on here I don't remember um if I saw a picture yeah you get to find it on Google there's pictures of it standing next to like a standard you know what six foot tall man like what I'm a regular-sized man would be like standing next to this giant ass fucking gorilla really did live they really did live and it lived alongside people while people were real people they know at least a hundred thousand years ago it was alive that's that's what it looked like oh shit yeah that's a depiction of them this said there's a few different versions of that we'll get that others with the want the arm up in the air Jamie in the lower right hand corner no no no go go up up go see those pictures I see that when you have those little pictures and the little windows below it see the one with his arm up in the air yeah click that one that's the one that's what it looked like I should will fuck you up yeah probably super fast but see how it's kind of like a Ranga tan looking doesn't they think they think it was kind of a member of the orangutan family who's like my dad but it was a real thing but it's just funny how like we want those things to be real yeah we want mysteries to be real yeah it's part of the reasons why you have to really worry or wonder whether or not someone's telling the truth because the desire for something to be real so strong like UFOs you know the same thing people want to believe God so hard to be objective what about with all that stuff hotep was saying on here because like a lot of it he sounds like way more intelligent than I was expecting when I first turned it on I didn't really know much about him but they mean about Africans traveling the world in boats well about them being in America first or about them like giving that technology to Rome I know he said a lot of stuff that like I mean obviously again I'm a meathead right I'm not like the smartest man on the planet but he's made a lot of sense from what he was saying well for sure when people think about Africa they forget about Egypt right and Egypt is one of the most fascinating and absolutely spectacularly advanced civilizations of all time we have no idea how they built those structures there's all the speculation but especially like the Great Pyramid this is a stunning technological and physical accomplishment that to this day baffles people yeah that's Africa so those people at boats and we don't even know how long I mean Graham Hancock believes and so does Robert Schoch and John Anthony West when he was alive believes that those people were building those things tens of thousands of years ago yeah that that is like a spectacularly creative and innovative society that was most likely wiped out by some sort of global Cataclysm around 12,000 years ago and then everything after that was a rebuilding of past knowledge right so it makes sense if they had traveled to South South parts of America and then just basically everything got wiped out and so wait they're there working from fresh start in America and then over on this side they don't have the information about that because they all got wiped out well it certainly makes sense if you look at the Olmecs those giant stone heads that look like African faces when they look exactly like Africans and these are heads that came from thousands and thousands of years ago in a civilization the Olmecs that they know very little about mm-hmm yeah I felt like I felt like I was crazy for thinking he wasn't crazy some of the shit he was saying but it's like the the history of humans is something that becomes more it unveils itself over time and the more they're starting to find new things like there is something of the low there's some ancient castle that they just discovered that used to be underwater that's like 3,500 years old you know I'm talking about like the receding flood water yeah yeah yeah yeah they felt like what the fuck is this they don't like they don't even know what it is so 3,500 years ago long before Europeans ever came to America these people had built this fucking castle is now underwater you like to see levels rise and fall that's it yeah where is the things in Iraq oh yeah it is in Iraq yeah so they found these ancient now Iraq is also where sumaré was that's the the earliest known civilization in terms of the earliest known writing the earliest known agriculture and mathematics that's sumaré that's epic of gilgamesh all that shit came from that part of the world so there's all sorts of stuff that was probably lost in that you know thousands and thousands of years of history it's amazing it's so fascinating to be there just like I like this place that I was in in Italy there's a church in Ravello that's a thousand years old and below the church there's a glass floor of the church there's pictures of it on my Instagram it's a glass floor of the church and below the glass for is another church that's so old they don't even know it was built Oh so it's more that that's it that's from my my Instagram so fucking cool so that that they have it's like blocked off and they put a glass floor over it so you could look down and see it because they don't want you know people to tread on it and fuck with it but the church itself they just the the church that you could walk around in is a thousand years old right you know and we're working off information that's basically just been since we started writing things down yeah we've got this little short time period where we started writing things down I mean acting almost as though that was the beginning of time and you have to take people's word for exactly exactly old pictures no video the same thing with the aliens and the Sasquatch there's some things that you want to believe so you throw that in there yeah and history was written by the winners exactly so a bunch of lion assholes it killed everybody the chance my friend my son loves that song between that woman we will rock you yeah we were in a limo yesterday it was like put on we will rock you so I'm cranking we will rock to my three-year-olds in the back deal boom boom when you think about fucking classic songs man Queen had a gang classic songs that just worldwide to this day that are used at basketball games and football games all over the world yeah yeah huge such an icon yeah Jon Jones came out to we are the champions yeah this will this last one yeah nice I didn't get to see the fights how did I know John went to was a split decision man fuckin Thiago Santos is dangerous he hit John with some big shots fucked his legs up with kicks to the point what John had to be carried out yeah when he when he walked out of the Octagon they were carrying him couldn't walk his legs were fucked up that guy kicked the shit out of his legs and Thiago blew his knee out somewhere in the first we believe threw a kick and blew his ACL out but never even winced dude you hobbled around on that knee and just kept throwing kicks with it and everything that's yeah crazy it was an awesome fight you think he fought again this is I'm not projecting anything I didn't get to see the fight did he fight well enough to suffer an extensive damage to left knee surgery are out for the rest of $2,000 well there goes the question you think you earned another shot well he he definitely did he proved he is worthy yeah he had a split decision what what's a complete ligament torn in his left knee oh yeah there you go yeah I kind of we kind of saw it looking at it yeah shows left knee meniscus and all his ligaments are completely torn Wow the meniscus and all the ligaments that's Jesus Christ he still stood in there for four fucking rounds he needed surgery on his right knee earlier this year also suffered damage during the fight as he compensated for his left knee oh man so he doesn't even know if he might need tests on his right knee as well but you know what the good news is the UFC doctors are the top of the food chain they'll fill that motherfucker up with stem cells and mm-hmm do everything they can to rebuild some of that inner tissue good he deserves it yeah if you're gonna stand in there and put it all in line like that you know give that man his fucking stem cells if they fight again Jon Jones fucking power doubles him takes him to the Brussels yeah I mean I think I don't I was shocked that he didn't do it I saw I've read enough it was on his pager on the one like MMA junkie or something but he said that he it was pride he didn't want to do that cuz yeah that's crazy that's John though but pride almost cost him the title yeah like what if Thiago clipped him and dropped him in the third round and then he won that round on all the judges scorecards and then he won a decision yeah he almost lost the title because crazy I mean I don't I don't agree necessarily with the guy who give it to gave it to Thiago I'd have to watch it and see how they thought it and because when you when you call in a fight I'm trying to be entertaining I'm looking for patterns but I'm not really scoring it right to score it I think you have to do with silence right yeah so I'd have to see whether or not I agreed with them but it was definitely close was definitely interesting a lot more interesting a lot of people thought a lot of people thought John was going to blow them out of the wall that's what expect me now I've messed around just like you know like broke like like uh pushing him around him stuff like that and he's way stronger than I would expect oh he's strong it's fuck laughs shit he took Daniel Cormier down you know yeah there's a motherfucker dude in I think when he goes up to heavyweight he's gonna be even stronger and I think that's probably what's gonna happen next with John oh yeah he fucking should yeah yeah when Ash deepen the Dana fighting that's out here in August honors that is yeah that's in August and that's at Anaheim yeah DC and steep a - that should be very interesting - I don't even know who to root for cuz I fucking love steeper yeah but like I I've got a lot I I feel like I have to love Daniel cuz everyone else for no fucking reason doesn't like they do now you think they're more he's getting my loves turned Goods turn cuz he fucking deserves it you know I mean he's he's a bad motherfucker especially knocked out steep a with one punch that turned the time nice good good friend when he beat Anthony Johnson that turned the tide people get it now for a while though they were like looking at him like he's illegitimate yeah oh that's absurd yeah well welcome to the world of MMA Pettis versus Diaz is on that car - oh yeah Yoel Romero versus pollo Costa
