the girag and experience hey so listen man last time you were here there's a fucking story about the Russian mob we tease these bitches we let these people right now on Twitter they've been going crazy all day do not let Bert Kreischer get out of there without the Russian mob story man tell us what the fuck happened all right this is in 1993 probably I think is what I went to Russia I was taking Russian classes at Florida State I thought there were Spanish classes because I thought there's business classes because I was a noon class and I signed up and then I was like fucking sweet Spanish at noon I could phone that in and then I get there and they start writing a new language a new alphabet and I'm like all right this clearly isn't Spanish so then I said I'm going to leave and the teachers like listen don't leave because if you leave well we can't have a class and I can't get my master's degree so but if you stick around I'll talk to you after the class I get done the end of class she's like listen don't you know if you don't leave and I won't and just show up a class I'll get be a see I was like done done so I took Russian I took Russian one two and three because these kids need another guy in the their class to take these classes so then finally I take Rush I take one from four when we go to Russia we go to Russia but this is Russia like when the mob ran Russia like are you are you guys aware of that now okay in like the nine late 90s mid 90s the mob ran everything that had to do with Russia so when going over to Russia you had to you had to literally pay off the mob in order to go and study abroad so we paid off the mob and they gave us in return - banditos - young mobsters who would go everywhere with us they lived in our hotel they stayed with us they went on tours with us they want they would did everything with us their names are Igor and Sasha our teacher was like listen this is Igor and Sasha they will be ghosting us with my teacher who was there with me was like during the fucking mob Igor inside thought like an a guy named Bruce and they were like and they were oh it gets worse so so they like listen whatever you do to our class do not talk to them do not interact with Obama do not engage them they are only here to shadow it so in my head I'm like fucking get to know these guys right like get a bottle of vodka six-pack of all the knock on their door no mind you I speak no Russian at the time rushing side never studied in any of the classes so first night there a knock on a door in Sasha's room and they're having a party in there like fucking all their friends are in their room they live right next to me and Kendra my teacher lived across the hall from Igor so I knocked on the door Igor opens the door and he looks like a fuckin thug he's got he's got like a wife beater on a cigarette of beer and he just looks at me in Russian he just goes stole and now is the second he says that I start panicking all the phrases I had in my head that I was trying to say all disappear and all I say the Igor in Russian is I am the machine what is that he say that yah yah machine oh and so but I just said yah machine though and he went oh stole and now I don't know what I said I'm like - what did I just say I'll fuck you up like and I go I go I am the machine and he goes say it again I said I'm the machine and then he starts laughing he brings me into the room he's like hold on say it again and so I say it to the room I don't know what the fuck I'm saying I'm like I'm the machine they're like you're the machine I'm like on the machine I sent that all fuckin night with these guys that's the only communication we had as I said on the machine and egora Sasha and I became best friends right we did everything together if we went on a field trip why they would tell me machine you don't need to go on the field trips come drink with us so now cut to one day we have to take a train to Moscow now a different mob ran the train to Moscow and a different rant mob ran Moscow and iwere Sasha were not allowed to cross boundaries and they told me they said listen we're not going to go with you but we've taken care of you we've talked to the mobsters on the train and in Moscow because we had to pay them - they asked they weren't allowed to come with you there weren't a lot to come with this is a different man we're paying a different mob now to protect us on the train we're taking a different mob to protect us in Moscow holy shit so they said we've taken care of it don't worry about it so they take me to the Train and they introduced me to our two new gangsters Igor and Igor what I double Igor where do you 3e wars at a four dude key or there's not a lot of names in Russia it's Alex Igor Sasha what about
