hello freak bitches for but even if we did it's worth repeating I about an article an article that was done by some colleagues of mine I don't know them well but some some academics where they looked at the political affiliation of professors at top I think it was Californian schools whether they were identified it or whether they actually had Democratic affiliation or Republican and as you might imagine was extraordinarily skewed towards Democrats but then depending on the field of study so for example in sociology and in the humanities and in women's studies women with a Y by the way please don't write women with an e that would be sexist really even if I said yeah oftentimes and women's studies they they think that to have men as part of the word women is itself a form of aggression so they've altered the spelling to wait min oh no that's not real she already has the price of admission covered with that story but it's still the word women right so anyway still the same word why why do you have to change the letters so in sociology do you train to change the word trigger because it sounds like the n-word oh well seriously right you're getting triggered I'm triggered I'm triggered well I'm fucking triggered and if I was black I'd be super triggers but I don't know if you notice some of my tweets now whenever I tweet anything I put trigger warning trigger warning it's not become part of the vernacular to make it satirical it's too close to the n-word way too close I am trigger but anyways to finish the point about that study 44 to one the ratio in sociology so imagine if you are a student take doing an undergrad in sociology right it's not a very good thing to have almost all of the professors that you will ever come across be of one particular persuasion now some people will write to me and say but what do you mean the Democrats have everything right they have truth on their side and the Republicans are a bunch of hacks now when it comes to evolution evolution that's true right if if on average Republicans are more likely to deny evolution then that point is well-taken but when it comes to issues is the death penalty right or what kind of fiscal policy should you have what type of foreign policy should you have this is not a one plus one you know scientific equation so you should be exposed to multiple viewpoints but of course you shouldn't be because you should only interact with people who are similar to you well that is a problem with a lot of people that go to college graduate get their PhD get their doctorate and then start teaching and never enter the real world right they stay in this sort of insulated world of academia and then they espouse these same ideas they promote these same ideas they promote the same way of thinking as if this is the real world because this is the only world they know true so my friend Luther reigns he ended up he had a massive stroke and now he's actually four somehow so when when you have withdrawals from painkillers it feels like you're gonna die and so when he had this stroke they said get his mother here he's not gonna make it through this and we can't pump him full on a full of enough drugs for him to get through this he's gonna he's probably not gonna make it somehow miraculously the part of the the brain that is his like 30% of his brain got killed during the stroke part of the brain that got killed was the part that was responsible for feeling withdrawals so somehow he fucking dodged a bullet we called the bulletproof bad boy how you have to pull it he's alive he has no more hangover he's completely sober and he goes around and talks to kids and churches and things like that so he's doing great work you know so you lost 30 percent of his brain yeah but somehow he's still cognitive he's still you know he's still there he's jacked I mean steroids something so he's off the pain pills on steroids and helping out kids yeah there you go what the fuck kind of a world we live in I love that one day we were eating with him that we were grabbing a burger or something he's he's got this fanny pack on he's like pulling stuff out he's trying to find his like money you know he's like I'll pay for it bro he's and he's like moving in slow motion he's fucking drooling I'm like this guy it's amazing what is going on with this guy he's putting all these like different bottles of pills like on the table he's got like viagra and a bunch of other shit and he carries a bottle with him yeah and then he put like in his fanny pack yeah well there's Bob tolls the many bottles and then he puts down like a little bag like a clear bag of something he's like he looks at it and he grabs his money clip and he puts his money on the table he looks at the clear bag he's like whoops and he puts that back or whatever the fuck that was that was like that wasn't okay for him to put on the table everything else was fine for some reason whoops big ol stack of cash that's so crazy oh yeah he's oh my god I was like dude what if you get like your pills mixed up like you're just running a ton of fucking viagra and shit like but we have to be aware that when people are taking these powerful mind-altering substances which can have these wonderful things as you and I have experienced we got to be aware that there are people who are not as stable as they think they are people who have deep-seated shit going on and they don't know what's buried that's gonna come flying out people don't understand that yes if you're gonna jump jump from the first floor not the fifth floor so we got to make sure because you don't even jump on the first floor get on the ground from the ground exactly you know but that it's gonna be so key because I mean look just to shift away from the silos for a second one of the issues were working on big time he's trying to reduce the number of people dying from overdoses involving either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates last couple of years more people have died of an accidental overdose involving heroin or other pharmaceuticals then in a car accident it's the number one cause of accidental death in America today all right I mean absolutely crazy stuff right and in fact when we say over those who suggest you took too much most of what our overdoses acts your drug combinations they're typically doing this opiate your pharmaceutical opiate oxycodone whatever might be might even be prescribed to you with booze or with benzos valium type drugs right so what we're trying to do is to put out there the notion that don't Kim if you do it opiates don't combine it with booze don't combine it with tranquilizers there's a miracle drug called naloxone and we're trying to make that stuff as widely available it reverses the it's like an antidote for an overdose make it available we're passing 911 Good Samaritan laws so if people are around and a buddy there's overdoses they don't just flip out they call 911 one right away the way with a heart attack so you know it's true with the psychedelics in marijuana but even with the drugs that we see is less elevated in a way but that huge numbers of people are using like the opiates it's really important that we become more and more of a society that understands the notion that we need to make it safer to use these drugs right we got to keep people from getting hurt the way that people get hurt [Music]
