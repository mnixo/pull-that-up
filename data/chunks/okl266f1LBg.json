there we go four three two boom and we're live hello Miriam hi Joe good to see ya grab this mic and keep it like a fist from your face that's a good reference okay perfect okay perfect like that yeah good yeah it's like I'm sad that you can't sell these snacks everywhere because I know you're you're working on making these mass-produced but they're fine fantastic yeah they're very good when did you first give me some of these like five years ago or some shit 2014 it's not my map yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean II blew out I just had surgery and I needed something to do so I that was me number one the second one that was a second one yeah yeah that was and I've had two more since yes I've had four total the life of a world champion muy Thai kickboxer no no as actually started when I start started grappling that's when I started blowin uni out yeah yeah no I was a wheat I was fine I got cracked ribs I got cut I got maybe concussions maybe really bad like broke my elbow on somebody's head oh yeah but not know me stuff it was that MMA jiu-jitsu yeah wrestling and jiu-jitsu a rough on the knees this motion not awesome on the cartilage mmm like a weird motion you mean like hip stuff like me mm-hmm so like on your back like we're a guard that's what you think yeah well I just yeah and 20 years of use on this body mm-hmm yeah well you does put you put what it puts weight in weird ways and then these two something's trying to pass your guard and they're moving your ankles off yeah it's a swivel with their weight and their violence yeah directed at you yeah I saw you getting a bunch of fluid on Instagram shot into there what is that all but thing was like ortho Fisk what is that did not help no I was away some money oh yeah there's like a like a gooey fluid that was like like padding goes out the ideas but Louis what was really nice as I got straight shot ibuprofen in there that felt amazing like three months worth of ibuprofen just shot it right in there really yeah that shit is so bad for you though really good yeah I tell everybody stay the fuck away from my beeper oh yeah dr. Rhonda Patrick is the first her personal eart admit to it the increased risk of strokes and heart attack and and then my friend cam Haynes who's an ultra marathon runner he um he was taking 800 milligrams a day every day okay for how long forever have a lot it's a lot that's different it is different and she's got one super shot well he was wrong he basically runs almost a marathon a day yeah that's crazy yeah because he runs he's 240 mile races so he was having these serious pains like he's like I got needed to get going so I told him about all the heart attack stuff and the stroke stuff he's like fuck so he gets off of it all of his inflammation relaxes and calms down turns out what was going on was the ibuprofen severely upsets your gut bacteria and so when that happens it causes systemic inflammation which you then treat with ibuprofen so he takes out the ibuprofen all the the gut problems go away all the inflammation goes away all his hip pains knee pains all that shit went away which is crazy I think ibuprofen is great if you do it every just rarely so something's going on you need what I noticed when he shot my knee that into my knee I meet like within the next week you know over the course of a couple days I noticed that I had greater range of motion so what I mean we realized was like oh I had a little inflammation in there because I was kept thinking was like is it is it the tissue tight is this homeboy shooting would it what does he shoot in here and this desk this is that stuff that with no gloves on yeah fucking doctors is where we you know garage so we're free clinic yo look at you so what is that worth of is stuff supposed to do it's supposed to like like give it padding mmm yeah it didn't really help is waste of money in time how much does that shit cost I think was like 200 or 220 a shot and I got three of them maybe it's like regular people maybe we'll go for regular people not four people they're throwing a lot of kicks you know I keep it kicks don't bother me that bet it isn't the kicks right I think I think about that like it is grappling right that is the thing that puts the most where on you if you taught like you meet like old kick boxers I mean some of them have brain damage for sure yeah but their bodies aren't as broken down as old grapplers no they might be hobbling a little bit you know their toes might kind of using Rob Rob became a member yeah Rob's foot look it looked like he jumped into a pool that was empty big toe yeah all of them but when you're a guy like Rob who's been kicking chins and elbows for so long he's amazing I it sucks it hurts my heart that he missed the curve he missed it you know the fame way yeah yeah he's brilliant mm-hmm he's fucking brilliant he really is yeah and he helped a lot of fighters to I mean he was a big yeah big part of Brennan Vera's early success hmm and that's when I was training with him bomb squad days and you know he was working with a lot of kick boxers and him people were starting to catch on to his whole system I couldn't even when I got to work with him and I couldn't at the time I was so green as a fighter or just as a martial artist that I couldn't comprehend what he was trying to show me and tell me and he's like no you're gonna have programs counters to the counters no and he was like trying to dial the me and program me in and I couldn't keep up with him Brian you know at the time I was just - I wasn't at that level well you know what the difference is like some people just use a athleticism and timing and they just they just try to be creative what he does is he has a full system of like what to do in varying positions and what to do depending upon your opponents reaction but then on top of that there's also creativity which is and savagery yeah oh yeah savage he's super he's very his highlight reel pull up Rob Caymans highlight reel I mean he pornstache thin thin Rob cave it's really incredible when you think about like how many great fighters came out of Holland and kickboxers in particular it's just mm-hmm one small country and here it is right here get to see some of it look at Rob came sexy bitch too angry well back in the day he was which is really interesting if you know him now cuz he's so friendly and yeah yeah yeah Ian he's like a big fluffy dog yeah he's he's a fast cuddly guy he really is but his his knowledge of kickboxing is just so fucking tremendous I love how he's sit down on his punches like a boxer mm-hm and like shifting his weight because I don't see a lot of kick boxers that do that well yeah we're still here right and then they rotate rotate but they don't he's like really kind of getting in here you know in the boxer why do you think that's because when you do dig down you're you're sort of compromising your ability to throw kicks for a brief moment because you're really digging in but he's knowing he knows when to do is fight IQ right it's knowing when to do it and it's also I my pet peeve with MoIT I look at him my pet peeve with Muay Thai is when they throw punches they kind of come up mm-hmm it's like very triumphant looking isn't it right it's like that doesn't make any fucking sense cuz you have a punch with power nothing power and you can't get out of the way why do you think they do that I don't think they I just think they weren't taught well mmm I wasn't yeah I just recently started changing my style you know but when you kick your up you kind of come up into the kick you know like raise up and then try to punch in that way and I really feel like just with mixed martial arts when you are doing rest you have to like be respectful that you're doing MMA fight but kind of embody that mm-hmm you know that wrestling technique when you're punching you got to embody that punching technique when you're kicking you got embody that kicking technique and same with jiu-jitsu like you wouldn't stand as a muy Thai fighter if you're doing a wrestling move run an MMA fight of course and I think with Muay Thai fighters they don't understand that it's like when you're punching you like kind of sit down and rotate you got a hotel I'd like to say Hotel Cote ation yeah you have a good rotation and then when they kick they got to come up when they need they gotta come up mm-hmm you know it's different and they don't make that distinction and then they don't produce they don't optimize on their body and the power that they could produce that's always been a big issue with with MMA is fighters trying to figure out exactly how to position themselves and how to move and then all the variables right how many different ways there are to do it really successfully like you see how Conor McGregor stands wide stands kind of sideways he stands almost like like a karate guy his strong weapons yeah yeah whereas different guys have you know different ways of doing like you know Daniel Cormier very different style you know hands up high moves forward you know a lot of bobbin and Weavin is much more like he's only gonna fuck if you heat you get your hands on him though no we're Conor does right exactly grab me by yeah yeah it is but it's it's fascinating also how a lot of people that come from certain backgrounds like even wrestlers who come from a wrestling background they have to alter their own wrestling style for MMA like a lot of wrestlers specifically guys who stand in Orthodox Perdition position when they're boxing but if there were a right-handed wrestler there's a lot of times they'd be standing so yeah yeah and they'd be shooting with the right leg forward so it's a lot of - yeah yeah yeah it's a lot of weird like MMA is such a different thing it's so different there so like it's where all the pieces come together and some of them don't line up that good yeah yeah I think the best people are the ones that can make it sure yeah and the most fluidity when you see particularly you because you're a world champion Muay Thai fighter and when you see the level of stand up and MMA for sure now with women it's the highest it's ever been right like right around now mm-hmm but you'd still not quite the level that you would see in like championship Boyka except for girls like Valentina yeah yeah cyborg of course is very scary I take yeah she's she's so nice super nice right you pulled us high that's right um yeah have you met her yeah really I felt bad for making fun of her she's so nice she's um just got like this really tender soul or heart you know a which is funny it seems genuine yeah very genuine yeah very very genuine and she's smashing people's yeah well that's genuine - yeah it's like so whatever it is it's a hundred percent and that's and there's something really rare yeah and then so powerful because people aren't a hundred percent right you know they aren't a hundred percent like fully like just heartbroken wide open soft mm-hmm and then they're not a hundred percent you know violence right and she's just like a hundred percent it's so cool about her yeah yeah that's interesting right like when she fights she's a hundred percent unit and violent yeah and that is that's that's something that you see in a lot of a lot of Champions it's like there's yeah there's an ability there's an ability to be like a really nice person and then a terrible person mmm not even a terrible person a furious competitor yeah you know yeah when you first started fighting did you just find that inside of you did you know it was always there like that's you have because you're you're a person that if I had like if I'd explained you like you're like very energetic and fun-loving you're a very nice person skipping around just yeah you fuck that you're a fun persevering we probably met in like I want to say it was 2003 it was the bomb squad days I was about 28 yeah bad I'm 42 the dizzay yeah right yeah yeah but you've always been like that then when I've seen you fight like this is a different Miriam like Miriam when Miriam comes to fight it's like oh she got a little switch in there yes you hit a switch and then you become a different person and then it's not just that you're a competitor you become super hyper focused and aware and ruthlessly aggressive yeah yeah I am did you know that was always in you before you fought I knew that I would always have trouble with girlfriends and I mean like dating I mean like trying to have a girl that's a friend when I was younger because I would hurt them you hurt them physically yeah accidentally yeah look I was wrestling around with one woman oh yeah we're gonna be friends we're like the same high and we're wrestling around playing around if we were like partying in Vegas and I we're wrestling and I wrapped my legs around her ribcage and squeeze and cracked something in there oh where were you you were on the ground it's like utopia and we went to this after party afterwards twenties drunk or whatever you know or whatever or whatever and she was my size as I thought you know she wanted to wrestle too so I was like okay wrestle too and coach yeah crack something in there she didn't want to be my friend anymore she's mad at you yeah I was really sad oh yeah well you probably got off flight anybody gets upset that you know yeah that's all you meant to hurt her no but happy why the fuck that is a weird thing that people do right I mean I've seen guys do it and girls do it where they start play wrestling but they have no fucking idea what they're doing yeah and then they hurt themselves and they bite off more than they could chew it's a common thing for whatever reason people get a little drunk or whatever uh-huh and then they want to wrestle so what I used to do is I used to let people play around like with me and then I getting stabbed in the eyes no with fingers uh-huh oh yeah so now I don't I'm like all right cool that's the number one we're play with you anymore Mme yes for sure so fucking I fucking hated his so many guys look at man Michael Bisping he has one eye that's like completely fucked up though he's got oil in his eyes if they should um penalize more higher for that 100% yeah I think that that would the behavior with the crease I think so too yeah I think one point I think one point for a nut shot and one point for an eye poke just period yeah you didn't mean to do it that's great but you did it so for the second nut shot no first nut shot really first nut shot first eye poke because I don't have nuts yeah I'm a little bit more lenient on that one I'm like yeah whatever well Brian Foster is a duda fought for the UFC back in the day he lost a nut okay so reminding me of this guy that was at the old fairtex Clementina when Backlund Alex Khan was there and he so the rumor had it that he had one ball and yeah and he was kind of grumpy and sort of like insecure and one boy yeah I guess so hmm so this I just thought of him and it just made me laugh okay yeah so it's not just but that was in general no but that would be really that would be super painful to lose one of those apparently what happened with Rogers he was sparring and like like one last round decided not to wear his cup and went out there and slam Bo got took one right on the sack and burst no he's still fighting I saw him on a smaller one of those you know I got access TV fights reminds me like a breast implant it's ruptured oh that's so much the silicone residents all over the place it would be like if a breast implant helped you be a woman because that's like the sack that produces your testosterone there stupidest yes half less yeah well nobody mind lost one to cancer just impregnated his lady it still works yeah you don't get a token yeah but um well we're talking about getting kicked in the balls oh yeah one point just one point for I pokes yeah one point for ball shots just take a point away every time I think that would be giant that's fair I would it would fucking help you so many people the thing is good I poke will change change the change the fight 100% I can it can sway the fight one way or the other yeah you know so I don't I that's and people they've gotten poked in the eye the ref let's a continue and then they get fucked up and then they lose yeah a fight that they were winning exactly yeah that's terrible terrible it's a huge swing I think one point absolutely and I think there should be a better way to determine whether or not a guy's eyes have been compromised by that I poke and sometimes it's not within the I mean everybody wants to see the fight continue but if you really have to think about it like if this guy really can only see out of one eye yeah it's not right yeah yeah especially when it wasn't their fault but it's also such a fucking shit design all your fingers are just outfit maybe they should just curve on more yeah like the same design just curved well they oughta make it like when you have a good hand wrap make when they wrap your hands for the fight when it's a good one they just sit like this yes like your hands just sit there so they're just already ready to you know it's perfect well there's someone that I know that's working closely with the UFC that's working on new design that I think is gonna be flying courier okay but still the fingers are exposed I think almost like the fingers should be covered in hives but I think you cover it like a bad glove you know how bad gloves like those old-school ever laughs that would be amazing for me yeah for graphic babe like I think it'd be good for grandpa too I had a ground gloves on I don't think I never a problem with it grab the maybe you know like a wrestler or they I don't know there i think the real i think it give you more traction honestly the real problem is the pad on the knuckle like when you're going behind the neck you're choking it's very hard to get that without that pattern it is it's hard I'm grappled with you know I've never had an MMA fight but I had grappled with with book with gloves what are these does as far as and grappling gloves and yeah yeah those are just like um those are just a little bit more padding but those yeah I mean that that's a little bit better pride gloves are better honestly quite honestly some pride gloves really had much more curve two of them yeah and it was very few eye pokes in prime right I won't even fuck with a boxing glove that doesn't curve like it doesn't like if I have to make a fist inside the glove I'm not gonna deal with that see there this is like someone had observed this a long time ago that look at the UFC gloves on the right and the pride gloves and laughs the pride glove is your hands car that's a pride glove yeah yeah it's way better it's way better glove yeah and the back of your hand is like padded in a weird spot I don't know why they pad right here like right above the wrist where are we it was scroll let's go make that like right there the one that one would you know though if you did a spinning back fist and you hit you visit a little bones mm-hmm yeah they do break but most of the time you're doing that you're hardly ever doing it like a back fist you're kind of doing it like a hammer fist and then the real thing is happening with a lot of fighters is they're hitting foreheads yeah snapping arms adjusted if you hit me with I'll be fucking you get mad it's so fuckin bullshit I don't know if the bullshit move just the bullshit some people have moves that they feel are bullshit move yeah just like offended like if somebody acts kicked you that I don't care that wouldn't be bullshit now have a push kicks me in the face I wouldn't care okay I've like alright but is spinning back yes bullshit offended but it's so good such a good technique though something fucking cornball about that okay what about spinning elbows though girls are awesome and I'm not great at them doesn't have to balance right yeah yeah there's it is weird right yeah well I mean I would think they should allow spinning backfist in boxing you imagine how everybody would be so cocky no so many guys do you know like they're sad the boxing fans would be how many guys would get flatlined how many guys who don't know what the fuck to do about it your standard Superman punches yeah well Superman punches I think are legal right well they react the same way right no one would think you're throwing a leg kick why is mine so that is it cuz cuz you have all these hair is it yeah I'm bald fuck okay um yeah but why can't they spinning backfist in boxing I don't know should be able to the purists they are very purist yeah but I see where they're coming from in a certain way like when boxers talk shit about MMA and striking and MMA I see where they're coming from they're wrong because your shit won't work come try that shit yeah you're gonna get taken down stupid like this is the whole reason why they do it a different way but I actually do believe that a boxer with incredible footwork and a jab a great job could survive and win in an MMA fight as long as he doesn't fight a long guy with good kicks like a John Jones John Jones just kicked the shit out of you from a disc yeah and you're not even gonna get close to him and then by the time you've eaten all those leg kicks you're not moving so good yeah that's a whole you know smash your face I agree yeah but yeah i think i think footwork is key do you remember when vince foster when he was a shit not quite world-class anymore he'd lost a title see this is what worries me cuz I don't remember shit you don't never show way more of a fan that I am well he fought Masato but when Masato was the king of k1 over in Japan Masato the sexiest Japanese man I've ever seen pretty sexy yeah he's sexy and sexy Yama you don't know sexy arm is sexy on UFC several times fought in Pride oh yeah that's a great name though gorgeous gorgeous man I think that should be a super sushi roll there he is there's sexy Yama Oh No Masato is way better looking yeah you say that you know sexy arms look at that I like the way he glows yeah look at them that man is beautiful look at those pecs yeah he's got that cross dangling super low what's going on with so you look that croco it's almost like a bellybutton ring or some shit it's like that's a deal-breaker right a dually a bellybutton ring how about that a guy a gorgeous guy with a belly button ring he's freaky that meaty vain or gay as fuck [Laughter] never rubbing it means he's freaky or he takes too many selfies yeah definitely did she eat yeah is that something any man has ever bravely tried to rock my know guys do nipple rings like a real freaky dude I've seen it once you've seen it a bellybutton ring on I think one time I saw a pierced who's that that's not oh Masato there is beautiful I thought you'd show me a belly button ring there's better pictures of him he's very handsome yeah and still is and you know and still you know is very active and all sorts of promotions you see when he fought know when he was gonna fight Petrosian and Petrosyan was killing Sauer what happened it was supposed to be his like this one so goodbye yeah yeah and so he's watching Petrosian just I think it was sour destroy many sour and and he's just like a lot Masato versus Vince Phillips because what was interesting about this it was it was like do you remember when Shannon the Canon decided to fight in k1 and he fought Tom Erickson in a kickboxing marriage no November but that was a similar thing but Tom Erickson was not you know Tom Erickson was a wrestler who was an MMA fighter and Shannon Briggs ate a couple of leg kicks and he was talking about on the podcast huh like that he was trying to play it off he's like god damn that should hurt but he wound up Kalin Tom Erickson but Tom Erickson at the time was not nearly the kind of striker that Vince Phillips was when Vince Phillips Watt Masato Vince Phillips had beaten world-class fighters I think who did he beat he be some fucking high-level world-class boxers and then you know he got like 36 37 38 and then took this fight was he 37 at the time so he fought Vince Phillips but it was so weird seeing Vince Phillips walk out there barefoot I mean they should have let him wear boxing shoes at least because he's not throwing any kicks yeah and Masato just fit beautiful man perfect bone structure yeah he's ridiculous perfect hair - yes oh yeah and Vince Phelps is like what the fuck did I sign up for yeah that feeling that they have when they're they know they're about to get leg kicked so right away you're opens up inside and just moves away from the punches sets goes up high it goes up high a punch time kicking into the arms and it goes across the leg see that's a that's a weird one right the across the thigh nut shot but this was this is at the time like one of the first times that a a real world-class boxer had attempted a kickboxing fight and no that's um I love that he did this friends Botha did that too do you remember friends both uh who was a heavyweight contender in boxing day do you dedicate watching to watching fight if you talk to my wife and ask her which she told me about ten minutes ago I will not remember what the fuck she said not a shit that I don't remember but I have like storage units in my brain and stuff like oh that's interesting what happened there this happened Oh why'd that happen hey how did this go wrong okay hey Giorgio Petrosyan versus andy souwer SI u ER is it no how's it hi spot oh here's friends both oh yes oh you yeah so you so friends both uh this is France both of fat as fuck - he had hit the wall he was the white buffalo he's a South African heavyweight but he he actually learned how to kick a little and he was not just boxing guys but his his hands were just way better than most boxers or most kick boxers rather as he was at one point in time a real heavyweight contender this is not a good example which was 2015 holy shit dude that this is mm this guy was a fucking contender in the 90s we he's already hurt oh yeah this is should have thrown a knee did you watch the chocolate dough fight just the end of it yeah not good right helped us you know 50 yeah so there's hope for me well you've never been knocked out the way he's been knocked out so many times I don't think I've ever been knocked out not in the gym not ever flash flash knockdown that's it doctor yeah I've had concussions and been knocked out from like falling in the rain and falling off a second-floor landing when I was a kid right but in fighting and never know Chuck's also I think there was an issue with his style because his style was so aggressive aggressive that people could just set set set boom and counter like Rashad Evans did with him and so you're getting his momentum coming forward and the show flatline he isn't change no he doesn't know he evolved he had a style that was incredibly effective back in the day yeah I think he became married to that that approach you know the approach that works so well and babalu so well on tito in the early fights he was just a marauder you could hit him in the face with a fucking crowbar he would just spit metal out out you didn't give a fuck he was so badass back in the day he relied on that so much I remember all the Mohawks yeah everybody get in Japanese symbols tattooed on their head because em yeah yeah yeah it's just that's that style there's this comes a certain point in Tommy you just can't do that anymore you know I think I don't know like it's a martial artist you know and artists evolve and they're like oh well let me try this new paint oh let me try the this new technique let me try this shading let me you know start sculpting let me try and I think with especially Mme you know there's so much opportunity to evolve just add new new new nuances to you as an artist I think that's what I love about it there certainly is but one thing that does happen when when guys try to add a lot of things like see sometimes they'll try to like say a wrestler will add a bunch of things to his repertoire but then they stop with the wrestling game and then the wrestling is not as sharp and so then when they go up against a really good wrestler they falter and then they don't have what brought them to the dance in the first place yeah I think that's just looking at your opponent and what's in front of you and also like being honest with yourself and like like right now I'm looking at getting back into fighting and if I didn't feel the sharpness I didn't I didn't feel the fire and not just the fire if I didn't physically feel the sharpness if I didn't feel the reflexes I'd have to be honest with myself and say okay don't do this do you think that you were a hundred percent be capable of being rational and objective about what you can do right now yeah yeah because I don't I don't fight for participation Awards hey I'm a but there's some UFC fighters are like I'm a UFC fighter yay I've made it like that's not really making it you're just another you know like say I'm a world champion I'm a the best in the world Emma that's I'm a UFC fighter is like a participation medal basically like well it shows that you're a very high-level fighter you're very professional fighter right but um your eyes you as a champion yeah that is what's important you want to be the queen you wanna hop of the hill we really the best of that your best self yes you know yeah yeah um this one thing that I really like about individual sports whether it's jiu-jitsu or Muay Thai or any more boxing is that you can focus on just ones and all the various aspects of one sport and there's so much subtlety and so much technique and so much to learn I mean you really watch Floyd Mayweather senior train people it's really interesting because he's showing guys who were world-class fighters like the subtle subtle aspects of boxing and things they're doing wrong yeah he you know Simon Marcus he was working with Simon Marcus and he was doing some training with Simon Marcus I'm like this is so fast it had to be hard forgot like Simon yeah cuz he's very rigid yes and he's he gets so much power from his rigidity yeah and so like boxing is much more it's not rigid right you know it's like hip-hop you know Mike boom that's got that like that beats him that like swag to it and Simon Marcus is just so that muy Thai forward yeah yeah he's a very physically strong guy - yeah he looks like he's on shit yeah he does good Janine's yeah G great G yeah yeah yeah yeah remember Joe Schilling yes si Orcas yes that beef fuck yeah I do remember that what a fucking crazy fight that was I was there for that there was all the controversy on the first one right because it was the that was the illegal was it illegal he hooked the back of the heel or something and then and then on the on the throat on the yeah he this was the other first first fight yes first my first fight Simon Marcus won but it was like a knot he got knocked out right Joe did from he went Simon fell on him and he also put his foot behind his heel right I guess and there was a lot of conscious review about that whether that was legal or not my boy died yeah and then we fell on him I guess he hit Joe in the head in the jaw with his his forehead or something and so Joe got up like this right did you remember that yes oh yeah no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the revenge that have it in that Last Man Standing tournament which was a fucking crazy thing to begin with where they were gonna have to fight three times at a night yeah yeah so they fought in the first round Joe fought Simon and went three rounds and it was a draw and so in the fourth round they had to come out both guys were like holding you know glory goes one more round sorry they're like fuck and Simon Marcus had kept spitting out his mouthpiece and big Karthi took a point away Sarah goes he takes a point away from sonic Osama was exhausted and they were going to war absolutely he's spitting out his mouth he's pretty fucking Jack Jack and so now he's got one point down going into a fight that's a draw so he's got to move forward so he comes after Joe and Joe knows he's got to come at him so Joe starts countering and he catches him with this fucking nasty right hook I think it's coming soon well it was a a wild fight just a wild series of exchanges and I think Simon yeah here it is Simon's moving for it boom there it is and Simon had not Joe down early in the fight I think he knocked Joe down in the first so he so Joe lost the first round and then probably won the second and third so it was a tie going into the fourth Wow yeah it was a crazy fight awesome fight though they actually fought in lion fight - if I had a lot of concussions could be wrong but I thought it was controversy yes and then the second fight was in lion fight and it was winner-take-all the purse and then I think is glory mmm yeah I think you're right yeah that's that was round two got knocked down yeah yeah I loved lion fight I wish they'd kept it on access TV I don't know what the fuck happened I don't know where it is now I think it's like on a web app or some shit I was afraid to fight lion fight because of the judging really and some screwy to say yeah yeah but is that an athletic commission thing that seems more like athletic commission thing than a lion but does it matter because whatever they keep doing it in the same spot so it doesn't matter that's a the case with Vegas though I mean Vegas has some terrible fucking judging sometimes yeah and it's not I mean I don't know how you fix that other than fire anyone who has any shitty decisions and it seems like you can't even you can you petition you can but nobody wins see that's fucked up it is fucked up that's I can't imagine when has anyone in your recent memory or in your memory period when as anyone appealed a decision and one I've never never heard of it uh-uh that's crazy you think about all the fights that we've seen and that we've never we don't we can't even recall someone who got fucked who went back and read the tape look I I'm hitting him three to one two to one and still lose a decision which has happened yeah that has happened there's been some egregious horrible decisions that I hate about this is I I think that these the judges don't really think about that it's our lives I think if I have this loss because of your error the next time I fight I make less money and I'm already not making that much money like you're not even thinking about how how what this does to me as an as a fighter you know yeah it doesn't I don't think that they're not thinking about that I think it's they're not competent I think when they're I think there's certainly corruption and there's certainly people to get bribed a guarantee that does still probably happen how do I guarantee probably I can't write but I think more likely than that is you're seeing incompetence I think you're seeing people that don't have any martial arts training oh that's fucked up Nick no no no that's ego like they can't admit that they don't know oh my god bad job I fuckin had that at a I was a WBC title defense and I'm doing completely legal throws my high throws and he's telling me no more slamming her on the canvas he's like he says this ain't no jujitsu no literally referee says yeah I said his name that's Baltimore you have a girl wins Commission appeal retains me AFC champion wait a minute convinced what is a commission appeal though what does that mean though that might be lost a submission and the other person was a champion for 13 days she lost by submission huh yeah then at the end of 25th 2016 how is it overturned to a no contest I had that so what would happen I googled your question and someone found some examples of it happening and this was one of the three I found that's a little different because that seems like there was an error in the officiating and so if if she lost by submission and they said it wasn't it wasn't legit did you really it was John big guy the big ref okay what's in Jim John Big John McCarthy John McCarthy John bigger John but I need a downed opponent in the head oh but from where I was I didn't realize that mm-hmm so I need her once and she was like this so I was like oh man let me make sure this is over with and I need her again but she was like 511 Swedish Jessamyn Duke super super long yeah and I didn't realized that she was her knees are on the canvas I didn't know Jesse Duke fought more time oh so I knocked her out but and then I put one for good measure Oh unfortunately and so he gave me the win and then she appealed she appeals it and then it got overturned to a no contest at least not a DQ cuz I mean it I didn't realize right right that's interesting hmm yeah because she would have gone out anyway yeah so I I've kind of fucked myself like I gave her a leg to stand on yeah hmm yeah what organization was that in Invicta mmm how many fights you have Invicta oh three three I think how many is that all the most MMA fights you've had three right for four I think for now when you talk about coming back now I know you know you're recovering from knee injuries and all this jazz chunk eNOS chunkiness you look great now yeah it's so much my coming is it because of Samoa hey no Nakamoto healthy snacks yeah man when you're 40 pounds overweight you smell different do you yes my work just not not yourself it's not yourself this is not 40 pounds a lot is a lot what were you eating or not eating or drinking all the time oh you're not working out and like limping cuz my name is so fucking good yeah there's a lot of a lot of grief yeah yeah but um for someone like you it's got to be hard too because you're so connected to like your physical activity oh yeah so to have that removed and taken away from you well that was a we're talking about like finding out who you really are who you think you are yeah I'm like getting that injuring gaining all that weight I was like okay who I think I am I no longer have access to that right so now Who am I you know and it was like spent the last five years trying to work that shit out so yeah that happen to a lot of fighters in there retire yeah okay they have to target yeah yeah what were you thinking well that time was up because you got to feel like also you're 42 now yeah so this is all happening at 37 which is you know for some fighters it's towards the end anyway yeah no I was doing well at 37 yeah I was even fine no you were doing great yeah but there's a reality of the clock yeah for sure when you look at it least historically everyone outside of Bernard Hopkins he's amazing fucking amazing holy shit 46 years old fighting world-class I mean I think he beat did he beat Kelly Pavlik when he was like 46 I think he boxed Kelly Pavlik up when he was 46 and lost to Joe Smith I think he was 51 but by the time we got knocked out and sent out of the cage or out of the ring 43 money for Pavlik but he's nobody thoughts he's like more conservative now yes boy he's done yeah but yeah well he's just leasing stuff a masterful boxer just absolutely understands everything about boxing and is not gonna put himself in a position where he's gonna get fucked oh yeah yeah until he couldn't help it anymore like the Joe Smith fight it was like this has got to be this is gonna have yeah and call the left - it felt like Koval that was lighting him up I was like oh I don't want to watch this you know it hurts when you see somebody so incredible when they're you know when it's done yes cuz they just yeah yeah yeah actually you're so much better than this it's especially like when they're an artist like there's something yeah well when you see Chuck go out on a shield something about it to me I don't like seeing it for sure I definitely would have liked it if he didn't get knocked out again but one thing that I would but I would like young fighters to see is that this is there's consequences to choices in terms of like how you approach these exchanges and how you how you fight and I'm I'm of a belief that you should fight the correct way don't fight the way that pleases your boss or the crowd fight the way you the way you're supposed to with your skills well yeah and win by knockout when you can but don't get knocked out because you're trying to win by knockout doing something that you're overextending yourself and exposing yourself and you're compromising yourself like that's not wise and I think part of fighting has to be wise it's exciting enough I mean it's fucking crazy wild enough but everybody wants every single second of it to be filled with blood and crowd cheering and when they're not I mean how many times have we seen fights where just there's a lull in the action for a brief moment or there clinching and people start moving and then someone caught makes it up boys mix it up like what do you mean mix it up the fuck you do what do you think they're doing man they're fighting this is crazy talk you know like you see it all the time social media brain there's a little bit of that patient well everybody wants to be a huge star too you know everybody wants to do their best to gain the most followers and get the most love and get the most applause you know there's a right way to fight in a wrong way to fight and one of the things about watching a guy like Chuck go out on his shields like that it's like this is the bed he made I mean this is his style his style is Marauder Berserker moved forward like Melvin Manhoef when you see Melvin go out on his shield you go look this is Melvin's style like why are you cold yeah yeah that's true but if you see a guy like Sugar Ray Leonard man and he gets kayoed you like oh Jesus like stop you can't do it anymore you're not really you can't you can't move the way that made you successful Pernell Whitaker something like that you see them for whatever reason I can't move right do you remember printout Whitaker I know the name but I haven't watched his fight like man he was a defensive genius Olympic gold medalist 76 I'm I'm terrible so people will ask me they will ask me about the Wai Kru romwe and I'm just like I don't know it's both or they'll ask me how do you win a Muay Thai fight and I go I don't know do more damage like I don't fuck you know what scores higher elbow or knee or punch I don't know just fucking win right like I have no idea were you ever thinking what scores higher no I'm gonna dominate this motherfucker this is my space yeah like this is my you know yeah square circle the roads are you thinking about this is mine well yeah I guess a key you you dominate the space and like it's about territory you know and Fighting's territory and you start in its even and they have to their side and you have your side and you take the territory away and you want them to feel like it's not theirs to make space anymore like that's how you you impose your will I mean yeah yeah it's as simple I don't know I don't know about fucking points in this imagine it's shit you have no idea do you ever teach uh yeah do you teach private lessons do you teach classes equity teach a little bit yeah yeah yeah you ever work with fighters I have yeah yeah yeah when you do it do you find that looking at it in a way where you're trying to explain it to someone who's also trying to do what you do it helps you understand what you do [Music] yeah yeah but I definitely don't you don't like it no no I I still like this conversation in the same like it's it's more about like the tone you're setting mm-hmm rather than the weapons you're using mmm because it's it's really just like there's that space and it's your job to own it mm-hmm you know like you own the center of the Ring you you dictate where they go you take things away you know it's like a it's an ex-convict trying to get a job the doors just shut in their face shut in their face everywhere they turn shut in their face shut in their face interesting way to look like that's how you want to make them feel like your parole I don't I don't what I don't want next comic to not be able to get a job in the ring yeah you want to take shit away from somebody and make them feel very discouraged yeah yeah like you don't belong here anymore and you know that you know like that's what you want them to feel yeah yeah and you don't want to fight me again that's another thing you want to make that feel do you know like this is these things see you gotta understand what you're doing there but insofar as like what score is higher and what do this and then I don't fucking know laughs no fucking idea it just goes off of like how how my opponent is reacting to what I'm doing to them how they're reacting to me and that's what I'm gonna throw or where they move and that's what I'm gonna throw I don't think about like it was just gonna score so I throw this or this which will score higher Brian you can't I don't know that's fucking retarded yeah sneak yeah it's not a wise way to think I don't think I think especially in something like my tie which so many fights wind by knockout so many fights are won by knockout yeah and it's such a such a devastating art you know we think about just having the ability to kick and me and punch and elbow and all these different weapons you're using I think we that doesn't hurt that much what does that mean what does that mean wait I doesn't hurt that much what's up are you talking about earlier about breaking your elbow on someone's ahead yeah but didn't hurt at the time at the time it didn't hurt adrenaline I don't know I mean it just was like just BAM and I'm like whoa she's bleeding it's crazy and the refs like pulling me off her is I don't think about how it felt I don't think about you know like when I got my ribs cracked from a kick and I'm went I fight I thought it was liver so I was like I feeling my pain I'm like no and then I'm like fuck you I'm in the fight and you pull yourself back out of that pain because you don't wanna fall into the pain right because it's hard to climb back up it's like swimming up up upstream mmm right so you kind of can't fall into that fucking pain right and but it's not it's I mean it's banged up but it's not that bad well you have a tolerance for it yeah I just like I mean your shins will be bruised up you know I don't hide sure up on Instagram once of your legs I know that hurt yeah no that really hurt what day was that week after the fight that your legs were that fucked up no no that was right before I thought is right before you vote yeah so I had three fights and that one was about right before the last one oh yeah three fights in a day no I had three fights over five days which made it worse actually because of the three fights have been in one day but yeah so they had a day between each and so the pain would set in and yeah it was if one was it in Thailand uh-huh oh they're crazy over there it was cool I liked it that's wild that shit hurt I'm sure that shit her for weeks like I couldn't roll over in bed like I couldn't they couldn't you know you stack your legs and you snuggle you're up in your position yeah couldn't I had to and like put a pillow in between him yeah there was the bruising was behind on the calves like it was it was I got kicked in the front Yeah right but there's so much blood you know internal bleeding from the bruising it went to the back to my calf so it actually is circling capsulated my whole leg and bruising and then it went down my ankles both sides and then down to my toes so when yeah you took the pictures that was you in between the second and third fight that was the right before the third fight I was waiting it was the King's Cup as was the King's birthday yeah yeah so that's long yeah and you can see my ankle and it actually went underneath my toes and this is before I was a fight again both legs were like that yeah both were like this and you have to fight again yeah goodness said you know wooden man Johnson on that's him rubbing me and so he tried to give me the boy ty they gave you the pre-fight massage with the title in it he's gonna fucking touch me they're so bad fuck did you fight like this I don't know but I did that is so insane yeah your legs are so banged up the fact that you fought yeah yeah and it's so like mentally I was just like wow this is this is this is happening this is I'm I'm gonna do this and I look at my legs okay okay this is happening this is this is okay yeah yeah no once you started fighting what did you feel I don't think about that okay sometimes you get kicked in it gets it goes through like it gets through year for shield you know like you kind of put up this like I don't know when I fight it's like I'm fighting and I think yeah it's a poor shield in a sense you know and sometimes if it hurts enough like when I got my ribs cracked I felt that right I can went through and they like disrupted my force shield and so sometimes that's something we'll go through like I said good it's all we're here it's my force shield so yeah you're AB tune your mindset yeah this is like you're fighting your you ready to accept all sorts of things yeah like I could die or even harder I could kill someone do you think it'd be harder to kill someone than to die and so where are you yeah yeah because then you think about their loved ones mmm so think about all the people that loved you we fight think about all the people that love you right yeah and so when we fight I didn't I don't break any rules but I killed you right think about all your loved ones everybody that loves you that's attached to you think about that all that pain so long because of what I did to you right even though I didn't break any rules have you ever been in a promotion where someone died mm-hmm but that's heavy right yeah I don't I think probably why a lot of Fighters I I have noticed like there's there's I don't think the majority of fighters look at what they do with the gravity that that it deserves you know like you could kill somebody you need to think about that and be okay with that not okay but just understand like all right that could happen and I'm gonna become consciously knowing this and choosing to go forward they just think oh I'm gonna fight it'll be fun it'll you know whatever or it'll be hard or I'm gonna like whatever they don't think about these things is this something that you thought about when you were young yeah before I really got into it so you this is a something you've been contemplating even before you started fighting you were aware of all the possibilities yeah I okay alright I'll say it so I was um it was about 28 I think and I don't think I had my pro boxing debut yet and I took some mushrooms and I was thinking somewhere along the trip I started thinking about fighting and I started thinking about like what could happen to me and I think I started thinking about the death of me and then I started thinking about what could happen to my opponent like what's worse than that and I thought about I could see like if somebody had fight and I saw all the like like lines of gold thread attached into them like from their loved ones and then all the lines got snipped when they died yeah I saw this limb this mushroom trip and I was just like and so then when I decided to fight there's more intense you know and more commitment and more resolve that's heavy yeah yeah but that is what it is right and that's where I think real there's more power to people that have never fought for are people that don't understand fighting they did this I don't get the appeal I don't know why you watch it that the reason that p1 of the reasons there's many reasons but one of the reasons why people enjoy participating in it so much is because there's so much risk and it's so dangerous and it's so difficult so unbelievably difficult to prepare unbelievably difficult to put yourself in the proper mind state especially to be a champion to beat the best of the best and to get to the top of the heap that once you do succeed like explain that feeling to people explain that feeling when they raise your hand and put that belt around your waist and the crowd is cheering I'm kind of weird cuz I actually get depressed you get depressed you could depress when you win uh at times yeah or or I'm just I think for me what I've come to realize about myself is that it's about authentically expressing myself in the moment and I think with a lot of my fights I wasn't being honest I didn't take my heart and cut it open and pour it out on the mat or the canvas I played it safe I didn't go in for the knockout I didn't slip a punch and counter and get inside I stayed outside or when I was inside I would clinch up an elbow and knee you know so for me it hurts when I'm being inauthentic and I know that with pretty much all of my muy Thai fights I wasn't but is that the case or is it you being hypercritical of yourself always always no I said so I've I've actually you just said carrying on and he can attest to this I've come out of fights and and won the World title I've done a great job and I come into the gym the next week carrying this was stupid I look stupid I didn't do this right this fucked up I can't fight like that again like we got to fix that and was just like that but that's what makes a champion though yeah but mine was unhealthy so mine was more I think I think I'm more of a champion now than I ever was when I was actively fighting and when I was i I was trying to be good enough instead of just focusing on how I say this my my pursuit of world titles wasn't wasn't about it was in the defense of something that was told to me when I was growing up so it's like I'm world champion so you can't tell that's not true because I'm world champion right that's what that was about for me so it was about making up for a lack of love a lack of appreciation or just abuse yeah like I like I'm not good enough so I'm gonna win this world title and prove that I am good enough so fu and that's not a pure place to express yourself from right you know like now I'm more of a martial artist than I've ever been and I'm more of a teacher and a student than I've ever been and I'm more of a champion than I've ever been how are you more of a champion than you've ever been it's the way my outlook and the way I learned the way I attack new information the way how malleable I am how quickly I take things on you know how driven you know it's easy to be it's a lot easier to be champion when you have the six-pack and the muscles and the youth and the everything to back that up but when you have those things taken away from you then what is the champion what is it without those things that's your hearts your desire its your resolve it's your mind but using this expression champion like what what why why champion because your if your champion you're competing against someone to become a champion that's a mix chance self right so to do it matter to learn yeah over the things that you feel held you back and limited your potential when you actually were a world champion King and so now it's more about self-expression you're more balanced person yeah definitely and now it's a pursuit of self-expression and it's a pursuit of authenticity um and like finding that moment to ride the razor's edge instead of playing it safe and staying outside but not having a satisfying fight yeah you know even though you won not having satisfying fights because you could feel the flaws yeah I could just feel how I was holding back right it's like you can feel when you're in the zone and you go for it and hundred percent commitment and you just in it you know you're in it so I sent it what fight's have you had where you really felt satisfied I would say the fight after I thought Julie yeah she's it went up to the kitchen yeah I went up and wait to fight her she went up to 140 it was a champion a champion she had 58 fights I think 14 world titles I had 14 fights at the time and six world titles I think and that's pretty crazy 14 fights six world titles yeah yeah I started really said that you were the most talented person he's ever worked with I would agree I would I would because it's so what I high praise what I know it is I mean that's really it's amazing stuff well I'm malleable and I'm really dry like I'm like no that's not right do it again that doesn't feel right do it again what do I what are you doing what am i doing what does it look like what should it feel like where's my pressure where's the leverage was this that it you know I think I'm like I'm like that you know no it's not right let's do it again oh that was perfect but let's move on to the next thing and this sort of level of dissatisfaction with your performances though don't you think that that's ultimately what makes you such a champion in the first place like you Alexander Gustafsson had put it best once when he was talking about one of his training camps he's like this is the the life of a professional athlete she's never satisfied he says if you achieved if you want to achieve greatness you're never satisfied yeah no I agree but not with the way I was doing it so you were doing it but you were doing it in a manic almost unhealthy way yeah like I could never just give myself that right never like all right that was great this needs adjustments right all right so here's the game plan you know like know here you know you did this this is a accomplishment or you know you you conquered this you took on this new skill all right let's give yourself that credit right as long as I never good enough I never good enough no never never good enough you know but is that never good enough you'll like is that thought like you're never good enough never good no it's definitely fuel it is right but it's not not there's there's there's much it's more environmentally friendly fuel this is like pollutant pollutants and as far as your life goes yeah yeah ya know what you mean ya know so I am working with I am back at say say working with carrion you know but I told him for from Muay Thai I actually told Dave and carrying this did I killed all Kurian well I guess I'm telling him now if I were to have a Muay Thai fight obviously I'm not gonna you know I would I wouldn't be with anybody else mm-hmm like he's that's where the success has been that's where the formula works I'm not going to change that but now I'm also over at guerrilla jujitsu with Dave Camarillo and social approach oh my god genius oh my fucking Jedi Knight dude yeah he's a Jedi Knight guy too holy shit yeah he's amazing he's amazing but now I get to learn from him and so that is he making you wear ghee uh he's not making me but I do and I wouldn't have no problem with it he definitely says like I need to go to classes which I absolutely agree with you know as a high level striker or any kinda striker going into MMA you need to go to the fucking classes and learn to swim in the deep end yeah you have to and just be like all right this sucks I'm just getting like fucking armpit suffocated it's fine just deal with it but with Dave I can feel myself changing into the fighter that I want to be how often do you get to UM well right now I haven't roughly so much as much but I was doing it like every day yeah and with your knee I know you have like a limited amount of mobility with one you need yeah yeah it's not getting in the way of anything it does I definitely have to like put a brace on or anything no I just communicate clearly with my training partners so funny thing is I love heel hooks and I've had four knee surgeries isn't that weird it's a little weird they're activist fuck that's the only submission I go for really heel hook knee bar well let's say it's a very good submission I mean it's revolutionized jujitsu over the last few years the leg lock game is really taken over yeah you think it's like if somebody had that many surgeries you'd be like no I'm not fucking with that well how about John I'm actually I'm like getting in there John Danaher as a fake hip he's got a fake knee oh wow this whole body is getting replaced and you know I mean he's one of the main minds at the head of the leglock Revolution Eddie Cummins being one of them and I met a lot of the students you know Garrett Onan of course there's so many really good jujitsu guys now that are leg lock specialist it's fast and Craig Jones there's like a whole new crew of up-and-coming guys that are leg lock specialists I love it yeah it's really interesting it's really interesting because all the years that I did jujitsu it took like this transition like which only took place within the last decade like less than a decade where it really started ramping up back in the day if you did a Juju's if you were in a jujitsu tournament due to a leg lock or a heel hook the crowd would boo they would fucking scream they would square and if you won by tap like if you went to the Worlds and you heel hook somebody people would freak the fuck out that's so dumb it's crazy that's what it used to be it used to be that they thought of it as cheap they thought leg locks and heel hooks and ankle locks if they thought those were cheap moves but it's literally a part of the body well it what it is is people that didn't understand the defense so they would move the wrong way and get their legs blown apart and nobody wants to get their legs blown apart in training so they were discouraging and training and discouraging competition because it was ripping people's legs apart well it's just a lack of understanding what your shoulder is a very complex joint we have a zero problem manipulating the shit out of people's shoulders it's a weak joint a weak joint terms complex and yeah yeah and we have no problem with that nobody nobody says we got outlaw crying about that yeah somehow or another if you fuck your shoulder up where you can't wipe your ass that's okay but if you fuck your knee up we can't walk can you imagine if you can wipe your own ass well not a problem for you why oh for this with my secret toilet yeah go ahead I tell people bottom they're amazing they keep it clean and plus it's comfy it's like a warm seat as soon as I sat down I was like oh that's a good life is the good life yeah it's weird like what I mean why is it okay to yank on someone's neck I mean I know so many dudes with fucked up next he's like all of jujitsu is bad for your body fucking uh tingling going down my arm right now when I sit in certain positions Oh formally just wrestling in jiu-jitsu did you get it never happened no guarantee I know what that is it's a pinched nerve yeah means you got a bulging disc no that's what it means not all the time though almost always though the tingling yeah the tingling is all that a nerve is being pushed on by a disc yeah most of the time that's what that is till the wheels fall off yeah well but the wheels are not off well you can strengthen things and and and you can do a lot of have you ever fucked around with spinal decompression mm-hmm a lot of really cool devices that you could do at home hang spot yeah you put this harness on the straps to the door and it like supports your head like poles on your neck really stretches and relaxes your neck yeah that's fantastic okay really good yeah I'm gonna help a lot and yeah sign that and then after we have pieces of paper you could write remember okay I'll text it to you okay like I'll touch your pants really yeah I'll text show the staff because I'm a fanatic about helping people with neck injuries because I had a pretty significant bulging disc that was making my hands numb yeah I was really worried and my elbow was always in pain that damaged my elbow and it turned out what was going on as the nerve my disc was pushing as a nerve and neck and the ulnar nerve which goes all the way down to your penis my fingers it's like over here right yeah yeah yeah that was her mine's weird since I broke my elbow on her head I'm sure yeah it's all that inflammation and scar tissue and shit yeah yeah yeah but there's a bunch of different devices too there's a thing called the iron neck that I'd love to talk to people about - it's like a halo you put on those help strengthen all this stuff I need that yeah I'll show it to you after okay is it like Muay Thai you pull on my I'm fine right I'm totally fine but wrestling like this it's different yeah and it just yeah yeah yeah even jiu-jitsu is not as bad as wrestling for me John John Machado always says never trust your neck just don't trust your neck never think your necks gonna hold up some some guys like they'll shoot in for a takedown someone get them in a guillotine and I just try to go out of it never trust your neck yeah never trust your neck that sucks yeah neck is a weird thing these little bones that are held in place by tendons in this gelatinous mush in between them and in between is the fucking cord that communicates from your brain all the way down to all your limbs let's go we're in and we're cranking on that thing like this is the housing for the cord that keeps your body moving from your brain and people are getting your fucking chokes crushing your neck that's pricey now now when I do jujitsu and whole different mindset and really don't fuckin touch my neck yeah don't touch my neck fucking don't okay I'll sneak an elbow in there you put your hair up and buns and shit and like do did you just do hair yeah I try but ism yeah sleeves too weird do you I'd want to you can pull it off Ichi - yeah - all 81 it off yeah I've done it before you get a crew-cut you'd look a badass bitch with a crew-cut why not why not free come back fight look at your fucking it's it's not a bad move I'm all ready for you - you know I gotta at least keep some kind of a thing going feminine yeah hmm okay yeah so get my lines I'm gonna at least try to Rose namajunas fatally off I think Rose looks just as beautiful if not more beautiful she is she know if she was an actress she looks like an a-list actress doesn't she yes and she has that presence but she doesn't give a fuck yeah yeah that's a big present uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh beautiful she is beautiful but beautiful person like her heart and hurts yes yeah yeah no she's amazing yeah yeah yeah and they don't know I don't think they appreciate that as much well then will you appreciate it enough you know like how gorgeous she is like yeah she doesn't get enough press or attention or if she had if she had her hair and she played the game yeah cuz she literally looks like a mini supermodel right with little muscles like like yeah well I remember when she fought Michelle Waterson the karate hottie everybody was making this big deal out of how hot Michelle Waterson is who's very beautiful but those rose roses equally gorgeous if not more look it's a different type of look like Michelle Waterson would be like hosting a cable entertainment show enews or something right and Rose namajunas would be like the lead in a movie right that's the difference in beauty mmm she just has this like interesting look to her she has this kind of like a challenging beauty you know yeah yeah and it's even her expression yeah where Michelle Waterson is there's something much more comfortable about her beauty like she's really exotic she's like Thai and white or something right right yeah she's gorgeous but she's doesn't have something she doesn't have that challenging thing do you know I mean you know no I do not yeah you shave your head dude Tony I wouldn't look nowhere near as good as Rose well that's very nice of you so what kind of physical conditioning do you do if you don't do any iron next stuff no spinal decompression what do you do um I was doing a bit of CrossFit and a bit just fight training mm-hmm yeah I was so I've been out so long and when I started to get me getting back in like I told you Brian before we started I went fucking crazy and I was a bad idea at forty one at the time as last year and I had a total body breakdown where it hurt to hold my cell phone I like burning pain in my forearms just holding my cell phone how long did it take you to get to that spit that spot about four months of scar hard trick yeah like doing jujitsu so I was over at half Gracie in San Francisco and I was doing like it's a hard spot yeah sometimes I do fuck around I had a courtesy and ER yeah whenever I talk to somebody they trained in half so I go yeah yeah fucking you swam the Sharks yeah I did I did but it was how come you don't have kirtan oh fuck that guy he's a collector he'd collect he's just like that in person I'm sure he's just like that well we're both friends with Bourdain I just never got to me okay okay Bourdain was alive yeah I'm sorry about that um he collects medieval weapons and he'll shoot them I like how he fuckin takes videos where you just see his feet it takes videos just abyss feet those toes is not a penis fingers yeah there are many yes yeah yeah well those key guys man they just damage the shit out of their fingers I keep telling her his big toe looks like a like one of those dildos in the Castro like it looks like yeah it looks like a firefly disco reference yes yeah all those in the Castro yeah looks like a butt plug yeah it's that like that big it's a fuckin old guys their hands just turn into gnarled messes it was trap he was like a mountain troll yeah what else does he do yeah and he's a great cook - uh-huh and then also um fuck what does he do was he a band he does a lot of acid he was in a band yeah and he like buys instruments like I'm gonna learn how to play this and and then he's like building additions on to his house and didn't you start his own school recently yes that okay that whole transition that was like Game of Thrones oh really I don't know which I'm not I don't know that much about it I just remember like everybody had little groups and was like who are you with and it was just like yeah I'm not really used to that in my tie well it's not as I mean there's some of it but not like that it's happening you say many times there's been many foldings and unfolding are you with me my brothers and I'm just like no I'm with myself yeah I'm just a blue belt twelve year old blue belt O'Rear yeah well I guess I understand it because a really popular school could be incredibly lucrative you know there's so many schools that's one of the weird things about California the people like people who live in places without a lot of jiu-jitsu they would go crazy here they wouldn't know where to go within this where we are right now we could drive in three minutes and go to five jujitsu places I need you to recommend some from where from Ukraine okay I'll get you a bunch of places but I mean we're in the valley yeah I could take you this place she knows a place over here in Woodland Hills there's a place in Canoga Park there's a place over there this place over here further I didn't even they're everywhere think about that like being in an area where you should see oh there's places yeah I mean like one of the things when Bourdain was really getting in jiu-jitsu yeah he was training everyday even on the road you know yeah track easy well sometimes it's easy it's hard when you're a celebrity oh yeah and send me text messages about it shit now bone fragments cuz toots just be smashing him because you know they wanna sort of make an example out of some celebrity guy who wants to learn jujitsu so they're crushing him but you know he would go to like when he was in Bozeman when he was in Montana there was no jujitsu there so he had to go to like a club I think it was in Billings or something like that so he to travel to where they did this club and it was just a bunch of like enthusiasts they would get together it wasn't even like real teaching that's great you know and he would train with them play like have a TV with the video up sure were they the move if you have a good every year a good video and a good athlete you you learn something during that can-do attitude a little bit of elbow grease a little bit I mean I think there's never been a better time to do that than now with all the YouTube videos it's really incredible time even if you're not in a place with really good jiu-jitsu you can learn but you can definitely find sometimes you really need someone oh I hear now go like this oh yeah little subtle adjustments that someone knows from years and years and years of training it's all about the sensitivity of leverage mm-hmm yeah it's just that sweet spot I mean like in the in Muay Thai the Thai clinch it's just that like that little difference I like when they putting the elbows into like right in here and right like pulling into that little little hook area right behind you yeah I was working on helping some of the MMA guys at gorilla with their Thai clinch and one of the wrestlers was grabbing up there and grab the backyard yeah and it kind of looks like they're gonna make out I'm sure they just say that way maybe later not right now that is such an underutilized technique you know the a good plumb someone with a good mojito clinch I mean when you if you haven't felt it before when someone can really grow I remember when Anderson Silva fought Rich Franklin and Rich Franklin just did not know what to do with it yeah yeah yeah and you realize like the fucking clinch the way he would do too so lock down yet such technique right you know what's funny to me as a Muay Thai world champion or XY world champion is that I watch these things and I go through that's so fucking easy to neutralize mm-hmm yeah just gonna you know go like this thing what to do are you just like it's you don't have to be in that situation to this day there's still fights that I'll watch in the UFC where I'll see they're grappling and I'll just go jesus fucking christ get your foot what you doing yeah this is white belt stuff just surprises me when I watch that cuz I think like you know what do I know I'm like a high-level striker but I'm like you don't fucking know this and you're in the UFC you don't fucking know this I do not fucking know this it's you you're dealing with people that come from all over the world right like when Francis and Ghana fought steep a Miocic for the title right literally didn't is really recent have you ever want to watch that again yeah it was rough to watch ever yeah I'm terrible I don't really like watching heavyweight to fight that much why is that it's a little too slow it's usually not as technical that's true but when they land yeah hmm I know but I mean you can get people that are smaller and more technical and faster and they can land heavy punches too that's true but maybe cuz you're there live so you can feel the ground shake or me I'm just watching on the TV so I don't feel it did you see when Francis knocked out Alistair Overeem I think I did yeah you need to see it again okay I think you need to see that again because this is something that is something change my watches boom yeah watch this I know leave this blue this left hook bump but it's crazy that I know so scary and his striking is so dangerous that even Alistar a guy who's been around forever he fought so wild and open his hands were down yeah where was his head movement and where was his head movement I mean he was moved a little bit in the beginning the consequences are so scary yeah very little head movement very little some guys are picking up weight the muy Thai - ya know especially boys I know a lot of straight Center oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well when I think guys like Simon Marcus start working with Floyd Mayweather senior and then other when do you start working with them I don't know how long he don't know I don't know I just watch videos on like I wanna see one Simon Marcus number what is he improvement well I'm sure he's improving no he's still pretty young I mean Simon is only like 30 Simon Marcus number one on Instagram I think the real problem with Muay Thai and even with kickboxing is just a lack of promotion and a lack of understanding from the general public to me I get very excited whenever that glory event is on it here is whenever a Gloria van is on give me a little nervous it's been amazing year as an honor and pleasure to be able to work with boxing legend Floyd Miller senior before I left the gym he said kid you gonna be all right it looks good there you know but I mean you're talking about a guy with just a tremendous amount of understanding of boxing you ever seen when he fought Sugar Ray Leonard he's bending his uh uh he's bending his legs finally Simon Marcus oh he's shifting his weight too as opposed to like the muy Thai style uh yeah it's hard for him though mm-hmm he's yeah it's it's not like it's not loose and easy it's like right yeah yeah but he's okay it's hard for him to rotate yeah isn't it interesting because yeah he's a world champion and he's a devastating striker and he's funny a lot of people up but the limitations of the style that he imposes in the way the way he does it when he's trying to learn a different more smooth way of doing things you see that this diff Ness so in a the boxing they generate that power from the feet and the like rotating and the you know I mean like kind of like a gas pedal and a brake right like uh uh uh uh and wait I it's not like that when they punch they're like mm-hmm when you say say it like Express explain it for people just listening sorry so they like for instance the rear foot would be the gas mm-hmm and then the front foot would be the brake so you hit the gas and you're gonna go into this sprint but they're soon as you start getting the velocity for the spring BAM put the brake down and then with that counter the contradiction are the opposing forces it erupts out the top in from your arms and your fists into a powerful punch and I think with Muay Thai they just like step forward instead of rotating from their torso from their feet and their torso they're a benefit to that or complement the style of kicking probably more complimenting the style of kicking but I think that if you move your if you allow for rotation in your punches you allow for the rotation in your feet so you can generate more power in your punches you can still then take the necessary step out in an angle and then and then stepping high with your feet and get a great kick - like you just you can't you can have both you can't about what you think combines the two things the best profession petrosian's one of the best ever so Technic that was we were gonna watch Petrosian versus andy souwer yeah em asados face yeah about time forgot the sport the fuck yeah so good well Petrosian stills at the top of the game is a woman he hears these have been venom bun ten he lost to Andy wristy right was it Andy wristy that kod him what I have that's another yeah I want to deal with paper but I won't see this Giorgio Petrosyan 's Instagram Christie is this where you got Kayode or is this the sour fight this our fight this is a sacrifice he was so young here mate Wow I might not be in wristy see it you can't Google it while you're doing this can you well we'll get to that afterwards but yeah oh and so sour had this cut under his rye yeah and then it kind of goes like bleeding a little bit and then in his eye and this is assumptive on my part but in his eyes when you look at him like talk interacting with the doctor it looks like oh yeah yeah that's bad yeah yeah you know what I mean like what you'll its further down in the fight but well Giorgio is so technical and one of the more interesting things to me with Giorgio is watching him train because a lot of it is drilling they do so much drawing well that makes sense because then you can get out of the way mm-hmm yeah well he knows exactly what to do is his brain in his mind or in sync we what to do in the middle of a furious battle so that he doesn't have to think too much so see that Mossad is excited he's like excited this is exciting what's gonna happen not towards the end those fucking horses yeah yeah once it's awesome yeah Caitlin it's fucking amazing I just I just wish that kickboxing got more press and more excitement in America because I think it's more exciting than boxing is this more look at you I mean and you're seeing with them American champions you're seeing fantastic knockouts you've seen amazing wins I mean the only one who's really doing all the sports at a high level is Gaston this is after the first round yeah he's like oh shit what time when does this go to the distance um yeah yeah go get into like the end rounds when Petrosyan really starts tuning him up it's so interesting because he would just sort of find out where your openings were uh-huh where the rhythm was where to move and where not to move and where you're making mistakes like a computer yeah you can see him plug in the techniques to fill those holes and you'd see like the little subtle steps and you know he always knows what you're gonna throw next or where you're gonna be or what you're gonna do you know yeah he's so amazing and there's the cut he's one of the best ever for sure yeah and just an interesting guy to watch he does he doesn't look like he's doing much let me go that that was he barely moved right doesn't lick sours like now but Petrosian is just right there he's barely moving look at then just moving just enough yeah yeah yeah yeah somebody ko'd him in glory and like I said I think it's endearing both pull up I need to see that Giorgio Petrosyan record like what yeah it was really shocking and it was in the big Madison Square Garden debut they were theater yeah just like lanky mm-hmm power of power striker Thank You rusty is it rusty yeah it was he has fuckin heart and he caught Giorgio and boom the lights went out yeah first round - what yeah it was crazy and again this was like glory had seriously hyped up the fact that Georgia petrosian's like one of the best ever and undefeated fantastic record and Andy Risty maybe it was the beard I don't think it was I think you just got clipped and maybe it was also a lot of pressure right you know fighting in Madison Square Garden fighting on in glory glory putting all this stuff behind him and you know the thing is - nobody ever knows what the fuck is going on with a fighter when they're coming into a fight right you could be dealing with injuries sickness training camp bad weight cut girlfriend I was talking to a friend of mine and they were talking about how they were dealing with their coach drug use their coach had a drug problem and they weren't there for them for the fight and so they went into a world title defense like that she said it wasn't the first round I was wrong cuz it looks like here we are in the second or third this is the third this is the third so was in the third round my memories not that good see this guy just made it a brawl yes well he just made it ugly he's like no respect he also fucking hit super hard yeah that's a part of the problem surprising his Petrossian usually doesn't get entangled like this you know he's really good at keeping oh I'll go play it again they cease really good at dam up to him keeping space yeah hmm yeah he's really good at maintaining a good range for himself but he's getting all the tangled up here yeah I wonder what he thinks about this fight I would love to hear it I would love to hear like what was wrong like what what leading up to this fight it speaks Italian oh fuck I've done that before with Yoel Romero Joey Diaz translate for you over there seen that beam ma'am like it or not this is a 44 40 year old not on steroids jammed full of Jesus yeah like it or not he's a genetic freak yeah but you know he was on the podcast he was talking about he's like go to cue but he goes like everybody looks like me he's like there's fucking jeans down there but it kind of makes sense you know I mean the slave trade led to all these reading and not just that but also high level athletic pursuits right because they're just they put so much emphasis on athletes and so much emphasis on you know they probably have athletes fuck other athletes you know I mean if you get Serena Williams and LeBron James to have a kid what are the odds that kids not a bad mother fucker it's zero percent right okay would be a beast right you'd be a super athlete I should sell their egg or this bird so everything so put it together you imagine if like two super athletes just decided like hey baby I got an idea yeah let's just find out we get along yeah let's just make a kid like I'm not even not even like you know hey baby just like hey you want to just do a thing like here may not fuck it up yeah that's the thing but they like this contract yes but here's the thing and this I want to talk to you about because I know you had a rough childhood the reality is a certain amount of fucking you up gives you a certain amount of fuel that allows you to accomplish things that a person with a cushy life and always had a warm bed and always had plenty of love they there's like a you have a geezer right pressure yeah you have a gear that someone who lived a wonderful life with perfect environment and perfect upbringing probably doesn't have it's more like like okay I'll do it alone yeah like oh okay right but it's also the the need to do it alone the need to prove people the need show people yeah you know yeah yeah for sure everybody I know that's interesting had a fucked-up childhood really yep I don't know anybody that didn't you - yeah really sure huh yeah I haven't talked to my dad since all seven he's alive same name so cuddly and not bitter woman nice person and I have a lot of nice friends yeah but I've cultivated this yeah this is something that I've actively cultivated for decades and worked really hard to be a nice person yeah yeah yeah and I know the benefit of being a nice person like how it makes me feel how other people feel and I know that that spreads and it makes other people nicer and I try I work on it hard keep the wolf in a cage always let it out sometimes sometimes I remember one time when you and I were at a Muay Thai been together you were there and I ran into you there and it's funny watching fights with you because you you were and you were you were like gritting your teeth and and you like and then you look down amigos don't you don't you why don't you just fuck somebody up don't you want to just smash somebody's fucking face away but say when was this it was a long time ago in LA memory Ellie had that Pro muy Thai thing where who fought bull Kyle fought there was some good it was a good event oh my god so you know what that was it was muy Thai League yes so you know it was what I had an ACL surgery right and I couldn't fight that's right and I was supposed to fight right I was seething yes you were seizing fucking I was fucking and I was watching these fights and they were fucking garbage yes and I couldn't fight yeah yeah that was 2000 remember that yeah goddammit yeah yeah yeah I really wish that event took off cuz that was fun it was great having that in LA and Nesta who was doing the commentary as well and yeah Ben didn't Valentina fight not I think she did I wouldn't been very curious to see how valentina versus Julie kitchen want to turn out hmm yeah well interesting I'm just really curious to see how she does in the UFC 125 pounds she's a beast because she's gonna be strong at that way that's her weight yes it's not a 135 her just yeah like she looks like fighter fit mm-hmm like lean and cut ripped like even her legs when she was 135 her legs look soft you know she's still winning yeah yeah yeah yeah she dropped Holly home yeah that's crazy I mean she's Holly Holm is like a 145 or probably you know like well she's horribly comfortably at 145 it's not like oh they're going a 135 or going up to 145 she's like a big-ass 135 er and she went the distance with cyborg yeah at 145 we're just so fucking that's a statement in and of itself yeah yeah well it's the boxer yeah so they're used to getting it different yeah yeah you know yeah and I think she got fucked in the the title fight when she fought a Deronda me I think she should have won that fight for sure to do and I send the cheap shot the cheap shot - sheep cheap shots two of them after the Bell one of them had significantly hurt her and I think points should have been taken away for sure yeah it's crazy sport Holly Holm was amazing she is because a as a person mm-hmm no never matter of it she's a nice person over she seems really sweet and she just seems like I was listening to her interviews you know it's just man she seems just like a really up lifted genuine person you know a super humble you know she really is which is one of the weirder moments why was such a weird moment rather when Ronda Rousey at the weigh-ins was like you fucking bitch yourself you're fucking fake and yeah center fit and it was weird it was like almost like she wanted her to be the enemy that she get amped up to kick her ass so sue sang a bunch of things that didn't even make sense maybe in Ronda was kind of at a breaking point to just as far as like workload stress level expectations you know obligations and when I saw that weigh-in actually I watched that probably at least five times like I just replayed it when cuz I like to watch people interact and how they react I love it yeah and I noticed like when I saw that I'm like oh Holly's got this and I wish I'd fucking bet money which I did but I was watching that I was like oh just thought because Rhonda seems so emotional um it was the way Holly reacted that's why mmm she just she's just like Rhonda came in her space Holly just like um stepped back like kept proper distance you know like defensive distance and super super low-key watch her reaction yeah she stayed calm for sure yeah that's that's skinny Rhonda - that's weigh-in Rhonda depleted yeah yeah she was kind of she was too public how much different names weighing in but they tied up and how he didn't give any ground either she's just like she stayed calm she she backed up but like she backed up like I'm ready to hit you backed up she didn't back up like uh and then so Rhonda was super like emotional - she was funny she was like I was just trying to get a drink yeah I just thought I was having a drink I don't know yeah yeah that's great and then Rhonda was like she was super much right I said you never saw her like that you're like what the fuck yeah yeah I think you nailed it as far as the breaking point yeah she got sucked into all the Hollywood bullshit they were putting her in movies and TV shows and chews on different talk shows - like songs could she came Velasquez could she know it's like oh my God look what she's doing to these women could she remember that right yeah it was like wow you know look I was a possible yes I mean she is now now she's a WWE Superstar it's just a different kind of super bra you think she should yeah let me say that I don't go out like that this is Miriam target now it's a different person it's just she deserves better than to go out the way you know her last fight well she deserves she's actually what she got she's no no this is what I think she's better than that I think you're right I think you're right she's better than I think oh it's bad that she got punched like that no no no no I'm saying she she does she deserves better than that to like represent herself yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't think that matters to her as much as it matters to other folks I think she really cemented her legacy as one of the greatest women's MMA champions ever and a pioneer but I also think that women's MMA has evolved so fast that within the brief time that she was running shit the sport passed her by and when you see the one that I was always worried about with her was Amanda because I was like Amanda Nunez has a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and nasty hands like to meet you know to write um I think she has some judo I don't know what she's I don't know she could be but I know she's a black belt in jujitsu and I know she had heavy hands my thought was at Ronda although she was developing good striking skills she's known for judo in her arm bars that's her big thing and the striking skills were sort of like something that was happening along the way and she was starting to catch girls but she was catching girls like betch Kouhei and you know and Davis yeah and and and beating them down when she gets him down that they're not nearly on the level of an Amanda Nunez like you're not gonna catch her like that oh right exactly and my thought was that if if it was gonna go down it was gonna be Amanda because a man to just hit so fucking hard and then so when she came back and immediately far for the world title against Amanda she needed it gimme fuck yeah she needed well she needed a different camp and I think that's fair she needed a lot she needed a revamping of her approach she need a lot of things she need a lot of things because people knew first of all she never shoots for doubles she's not taking you down with the lower body attack it's always upper body and so he's a clinch and she clinches with her left arm I mean Greg Jackson and Jackson Winkeljohn they all figured that out and then Holly had the solution for that yeah yeah you know and also there's other thing is when you get fucking head kicked into oblivion that way yeah like you need a lot of time off a lot of time with no sparring no nothing especially just being so high like being so untouchable and high mm-hmm getting coming crashing down to earth like that said rough that's a definitely like a big who am i moment I think I'm yeah well there's a whole world too right but you were talking about you trying to figure out who you are when you couldn't train anymore yeah and I had that on such a like small skier a private pareo private school and her personally but private yeah yeah and hers is the world yes and like in a home world and mine was like more tragic and hers was more humility humiliating mmm you know how was yours more charger it happened in third round of a fight world toy a fight Mme it wasn't a clear like it happened want to take down it wasn't a takedown that worked or tweaked my knee or grabbed on my knee or it was um I pushed against them while my body was like this parallel to the ground mm-hmm and I tore my own ezl yeah so it was like why is that more tragic because it was more like no no no no no no no I think it's more humiliating to get knocked out in my opinion to get knocked out sure than it is to get like injured out like like tear tear out like still fighting and then you'd step back and you everything slips and you fall right cuz your knee can't it's gone yeah you know that's what I mean when I say tragic Oh or if you're like winning the winning the fight and then unfortunate yeah yeah yeah so it's more unfortunate and then your identity stripped away but again yours is private hers is public but at least I understand what it's like to not be that person who you you counted on you being that person it's part of your shield that you put on to go through the day yeah for sure for sure yeah you know yeah yeah her persona she's damn good at it too and then it's like stripped away well she was the first well Gina Carano was the first right that people sort of identified with like wow here's this pretty girl who kicks ass and this is crazy we never seen this before but is it a smaller scale people didn't they didn't kind of understand who she was or what she was wasn't nearly as big yeah it's tiny in comparison but then when Rhonda came along it was like this perfect storms like the UFC was huge everything was taking off and then here's his girls just fucking everybody up hers hers was much more violent to me than Gina's like she'd like you're getting slammed right and just like you know what I mean and broke yeah basically like gruesome yeah super curse when she fought me and cranked her yeah it was amazing snap their arm in half and she's still not tapping it's like tearing the chicken yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah me she was a badass for that one now during all this time I mean this is when Rhonda's taking off and when Holly's taking off and Amanda newness is taking off all this time is when you're at your peak you're at your peak as a fighter and then you're dealing with all these fucking injuries and you're working your way to get into this circus I mean you're working your way to step into this arena I mean this is like ultimately this was your goal what the fuck is that like to be just sitting down there dealing with all this bullshit watching everybody else do it yeah maddening well I think about the time that I was sitting next to you watching those fights yeah fucking smash make me fucking nervous it was worse actually so that time I only blew up to 165 and this time I blew up to 186 yeah yeah who's big well you used almost 190 that's almost one yeah it's 200 yeah exactly exactly and I was um I've drinking and was an eating ride and I was yeah tough so how'd you turn around ultimately I think so I taught Rocksteady boxing it's a rock Steeda boxing is a program for people with Parkinson's disease and it teaches them how to box and that helps them with their symptoms and their quality it improves their calling her life and gives him the sense it gives him a community to to be in and the interesting about Rock City boxing was I thought I was going to be it was a terrible fit and it was terrified that I was gonna hurt them and it actually was the best fit and they loved being in my classes and I love teaching them and like honestly they healed my heart like they healed that not good enough that I felt wow yeah it's pretty crazy so that's what so teaching and helping people yeah what brought it around for you yeah I mean and like seeing understanding that I could definitely understand like my body is doing this and I want to do that and there's I can't do anything about it you know and that frustration and it's infuriating and I'm like watching them go through what they they go through and it's just incredible and they just show up and they they they just work so hard and they're just fighting it's great little grandmas and grandpas Wow yeah did you see the rock city video know who / the / yeah / did a mini documentary on me oh no yeah I've never seen it yeah how long is it mini documentary can we watch a minute now we'll get kicked off the internet if we pulled it off you put it on YouTube the people always claim it or we got our videos taken down unfortunately Oh watch it afterwards and I'll tweet it yeah yeah yeah put it up that's fucking awesome thank you and I'm a he it might make you tear up a little bit what's your up easy let me do I'm a cracker it's not just like sad and like I'm happy I'll cry actually after you asked me to be on this a podcast I was having moments there's like kind of crying all ever since cuz it's just like yeah I was just like holy shit cope for me coming back to fighting its Kurian was like we were talking about a game plan about coming back and I'm he's like okay so this is what I think I think you know getting the right fight like getting a moyes high-five maybe WBC diamond belt and that is like all I wanted when I was active fighting 5 year that's all I fucking wanted like it broke my eye hurt my heart that they wouldn't sanction that for women was so frustrating to me and he's talking about that and he's like yeah we'll get this fight and then that'll be your way to come back and I'm like I don't give a fuck I don't want another world title I have enough like how much fucking good enough do I need to be I'm done I think I just wanting to be paid like just fuck you pay me that's all I want I gotta and so when I you say that but once you start preparing no I'm still gonna do it was fuckin best of my ability yeah but I'm not like I would take a fight that's $1,500 $3,000 for a world title like to get a chance to fight for that world title like now I'm like hell no you know I will take an on world title fight that pays more over a world title opportunity well are you looking to compete now in MMA are you looking to compete and muy Thai are you looking to compete in kickboxing I'm looking to compete in whatever pays me you're in change yeah yeah you're in yeah so dollar mode when you asked me to be on this podcast and it was like holy shit so this in turn would get my followers up which in turn would make it so I could get paid more the next time I fight do you see that I'm super saiyan yeah and I was just like oh my god this is so like thank you so much and I was just like you know I was just feeling like I was welling up with tears and I felt a little nervous I was like oh my god there's like how many subscribers on the shit oh geez well I was like you seem like you're doing a good job not to it Mike reducing today no but um what I said to myself because I do did feel very nervous and I do still but when I said to myself was like well it wouldn't be happening if you weren't ready so this didn't happen before when you were active fighting you're winning all his world titles like you weren't ready so you're ready now well that's a good attitude yeah but I would have had John back ten to you I'm sure you would have been fine no no I wasn't ready really yeah yeah for sure because I think I didn't know myself the way I know myself now I didn't trust myself I didn't have everything taking all my strength taken away from me Brian and then come out of it by me yeah I mean like one of the things that the rough city box and got me back and like helped heal my heart but so the other thing was like I kept trying to train I kept trying to get better I kept trying to you know and lose weight and but my name is still fucking with me and I'd get inflammation and this and that and so finally I just said you know what I think Dominick Cruz did this to where he's just like maybe I don't get to fight again like maybe that that's just what it is and I I'm not crying you're crying okay I've cried on this pocket I made peace with that and then things started getting better I don't I don't know why or how but like somehow like hating it wouldn't let me move forward like it's just kept holding on to it like what it wasn't working or I'm gonna just let okay then I don't get to fight again all right let it go and that's when it came back to me I don't know do you think that I think well I think that for the average person that's watching this and doesn't understand this fixation on fighting I think it comes back to what we're talking about before that it's so difficult and and so rewarding and so impossible and you're you're finding out about yourself during this struggle and then it is my therapy yeah it doesn't like so I used to do a lot of drugs like I used to do math where I weighed 126 pounds I'm five nine that's not normal for me and I did so much partying so much drugs so much like self abuse and then I started training and I used to smoke a pack of Marlboro Reds a day you know I would go on benders and stab like four or five days in a row you know and I started training Muay Thai and that's when I stopped like it wasn't immediate it wasn't like quit cold-turkey you know I just like over time as I moved towards the goal of fighting and it took me I think five years before I fought so I started training my weight I took me five fucking years and I stopped doing drugs I stopped partying smoking I stopped you know I started having a more disciplined disciplined regimented lifestyle and it was just through fighting some people get sober through working the steps training was my steps training was my way of getting to know myself and getting to sift through what wasn't me and what was me I was told a lot of things that I was when I was a kid and I come to find out I wasn't those things I'm hard-working I'm disciplined I'm intelligent I mean you know I'm all these other things that I was never told I was you know and it was all through fighting so yeah well fighting gave you a venue it gave you both than training yes but I think fighting made me know because if only I'd trained I wouldn't have gone as deep as I needed to go to get to the shit right that fucking like you know the hard crust layer that you got a fucking right dig you under and like get in there and stuff yeah I'm gonna polished yourself up a little bit you have it it wouldn't it wouldn't have healed you changed my makeup or even allowed me to be Who I am you know yeah like right now it's kind of a trip like I feel like I'm in bloom I'm just learning faster than I ever have that's easy and like you dave was tripping out on me cuz he was watching me training or watching stuff I was doing and it's so much easier to do the things without bullshit in the way bullshit in your brain yeah yeah bullshit and my brain my emotions my like these limiting beliefs about myself it's so much easier and they are to finally be able to be in a space where I'm like okay you're doing this what am i doing okay I'm not matching what you're doing or what are you feeling what am i feeling where I think a lot of people when they first start out they just do what they're told instead of questioning the concept questioning the you know so it's it's just I think the more mature I get the easier I know the more I know myself so the easier it is to get the information that I need to master the thing but this is always the the big race their big race is to achieve maturity before your body does yeah before your body wear and tear on this body especially anybody in combat sports I'm a divorce at 42 yeah and to be able to achieve enough mental maturity while your body is still pliable and and and viable it still works and you can still execute you still have vitality centimeters Jones and amazing fucking amazing he's so amazing yeah and and I'm not even thinking about all the incredible things he does within a fight I'm thinking about his post-fight interview oh he's fantastic he's amazing ya know he's an awesome dude he's so just like right there yeah isn't he yeah he's like no this is what I do and this is what's gonna happen and we plan for this and that's it super matter-of-fact well his coach Matt Hume was one of the grades absolutely meet that guy I just love to watch that training happen mm-hm you know just like get to get to be able to pick up on the the energy and the magic in the room well I'd like the fact that he's now going to one Fc and one FC is gonna pay him a fuckload of money in the um you know season this weird state where the reality financially about the flyweight division is is just not a big big sell it's not like people are dying to watch 125 pound dudes fight people don't like tiny men that's weird yes he's gonna take that as a quote there's gonna be a picture you back with belts on there other man bits or so that's also a thing that people don't like but that thing is like see I'd like I said I don't like watching heavyweights fight right like I like watching the smaller weights fight cuz they're more technical well he's as technical as there's ever been and he's he moves seamlessly if this what I was talking about being about being able to be authentic express yourself for a moment to moment mm-hmm you know and not have to like play it safe and stay back and stay outside and away and yeah he's just in there and he flows he also does what we talked about earlier where I said that I don't think you should ever fight stupid that you should fight with in the best the way so you could express your abilities and your techniques the best situational condom yeah on every I mean even though he's being offensive he still has protection right right that's an situational conversational condom it's a funny way of putting it yeah yeah that's true yeah is um what are you leaning towards you mean I know you're saying like what if you get an equal offer an equal offer in Muay Thai and equal for an MMA what would you lean towards I would want to do MMA but boy time would be hey man wait eyes never fucking love me back whoa Sarah shit right there that's it man no one loved you back no so some deep childhood shit right there Mary yeah Mary the world world champion childhood like my baby beginnings as a champion so do you also first of all you have a massive advantage and stand-up over most girls in MMA that's awesome but it doesn't it doesn't matter if I don't make the adjustment of course you know of course so I can't think that like oh I'm better right because like often times with a lot of MMA MMA fighters and Cesar Gracie said this I mean he's like in MMA the girls they're like pit bulls like they don't have the technique but they have they have the they get by on the toughness mmm so like with a pit bull you like you have to kill it right yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of that for sure and that will definitely fluster the fuck out of a high level striker I mean look at the protrusion and wrist diversity Christie yeah yeah a nd versity is pretty high level too though but I've never seen and not that I've watched all of her children's files but I've never seen him get entangled like that that often true that is not and Christie just made it ugly yeah he made it a brawl is she watching a fight it's an interesting right but who knows like I said who knows where he was at what was going on in his head injuries sickness who knows what happened that beard yeah the beard yeah I don't know cowboy Cerrone looked as good as he's ever looked his last fight yeah but that surrounding is not petroleum promotions like sexy he's gonna sexist and oh tell me Donald Donald Cerrone he's not sexy not like the way Petrosian is like everything Petrosian it's like pretty the things he does the way he fights it's pretty Oh a supersized it's like party he's sexy he's like Petrosian he's Italian okay yeah Giorgio come on okay George oh yeah I see what it means Dom locked him up made him less aerodynamic mmm okay I don't know about that I'm a big believer in beer power so my dad had a beard growing up and now I see all these 30 year olds 20 year olds hipsters with like their beard oil and their ears and I'm just like I think gross I have a real problem with beards with men that look like they would break real easy you know I can't stand men with skinny necks yeah that's uh that's uncomfortable like buff dudes with skinny necks that means they're not doing any cuz I'm just like that shit's not real right I know you're getting depressed girls yeah that's not really no you can't fight your heads barely hair it's like a roll country where they just like that and rip the head off the chicken well it shows a severe lack of core strength cause like if you're doing like deadlifts if you're doing anything with your traps you're gonna develop a thick neck yeah if you're doing anything where you got a choice things up off the ground you've a look at those motherfuckers in the Olympics that do deadlifts they have giant ass now they're not grabbing anybody they have huge necks okay yeah because they're doing this all the time that's all fucking the neck and back and the whole spinal column has to be strong like scary man it's guys shit yeah hmm lilia poser poser Wishon huh oh yeah has the modern male always yeah he's got no neck look at that Posterous that is a preposterous neck yeah I feel like if you had kicked him he might die right it's not his head's not gonna stay attached he's snapped that shit down yeah look at Tysons day look at that yeah Jesus he's like shit blending that was the dark days right before that was the court but when they were putting him in jail for rape yeah did he do it what does that article say if you have a no I don't I don't believe he did I might be wrong but that girl she falsely accused someone of rape earlier yeah if you have a thin neck you're my most likely a beta male how about take out most likely what how about just you are you are a beta male who's out there ranch it with a thin neck yeah your mom's house got this guy you probably owe that net guy damn long neck what do you mean that's the longest who's this guy oh I thought I have seen that guy yeah I thought you're gonna bring up that guy who's been in the internet memes the dude is now fighting mm a black guy whose neck starts at the top his head and goes straight down is that real he's got the craziest neck ever is just had a weird neck oh I thought it was just like distorted oh oh that's real no there's a bunch of pictures I've been seeing that yeah I was just like oh they just did the face I made it they didn't do the thing that's do does a nutty neck you know some girls have giant tits nice guys just an egg yeah I mean some people didn't have I'm a huge chance he's gonna start fighting MMA but what's he from I don't know why Florida wait I bet he's from Florida look at it leave his neck man he got arrested again what does it say yeah when did he get arrested look at his name well someone's gonna teach him but what is going on with that neck that's his real neck that is fucking crazy that's like he's got a double neck maybe he just says a small jaw no that is a big neck whatever his parent look like um I bet they have giant next to but that just launched another dad my mom first police mugshot showed off his really big neck this time he's not smiling so it's the same same yeah so he's probably power lifter or something like that yeah and plus got a fucked-up neck what a dream I don't know no need to blow his poor man spot up all right fucked up neck but I take his neck over the skinny neck knowing with you know I maybe his neck is like genetically fucked up like that and maybe the guy with the skinny neck just doesn't work out like the situation that's that's what it's not it doesn't bug me when somebody's just they have you know the slender neck but when they go through so much trouble to look like an alpha male right but they have that little chicken neck right and then they're posing like there that's gotta be my issue with you like as a woman like the way you interact with men as a world-champion muy tarde woman yeah you figured that out you have to have a hard time with the men I do how about you do I do yeah cuz you need to get a real one like a real real I just selling way it's gonna work doesn't know yeah imagine it's hard out there for a pimp it is right so I had is a great boyfriend but we went out of country we fought on the same card he fought the day before me I fought the next day during the fight he almost gets knocked out as the sky is mauling him he goes like this what do you think I was thinking um not good dogs the boyfriend the boyfriend the boyfriend was like yeah you didn't like it fuck now to turn you off oh my god so much whoa I was like dude you're getting fucked up and you drop you as you're falling to the canvas you kneel still need to go fuck you so the way miss Diddy beaten was fuckin with you wasn't just that he was getting beaten yeah I don't care if it wasn't yeah like you gotta fuckin like take that shit okay yeah like you know like a champ or like I like a fighter right yeah you can't be like wow the end yeah great first way for it was great maybe sometimes it's like that's the problem it's at the balance the ones who are not gonna be great boyfriends are the one that are gonna turn you on they're ruthless yeah yeah like I can balance that shit I gotta be ruthless yeah like gentle mmm not well I mean I'm sure some can sweet kale chips it's great yeah I get it I don't get it some people can yeah yeah but I mean I think your requirements particularly as a fighter they're gonna be extraordinarily high as a world champion fighter yeah yeah yeah I said it was better off dating a guy who's like a Navy SEAL or something who can't fight Oh or maybe a fight but he's not a fighter yeah doesn't yeah he knows how to fight he's a killer he's a killer not as an eider it's not in there mmm-hmm fight maybe like you could relate more good yeah personally I'll try it out and I'll let you know well I think that I've noticed this I mean except for the ones that are lesbians I was look at women who are fighters mm-hmm like they're limited in their dating pool yeah because girls who are fighters they don't want to date someone who can't fight the last thing a girl wants who's like a professional fighter or if somebody was really smart you know yeah but even the guys really smart because it because then they like as long as they ace me somewhere they have to be really fuck you're like no you can say that you're trying to find a nice man you like maybe I can compromise no you need a killer no it would bother me about that was like you're a fighter but you're not being a fighter right I'm just like not savage enough oh well you're worried that if the shit hits the fan that's what every woman is worried if the shit hits the fan how do you react how do you react and you don't really know until you see someone react when the shit hits the fan and when you see the shit hittin the fan you see them going to Ikes oh like fuck I can't count on you I think he would have been better outside of the fighting situation outside if the shit hit the fan oh so it so for me it was definitely like Ryder's ego like nah dude you need to have more pride than that well how you do anything is how you do everything okay all right maybe yeah especially under duress I mean penis Jakes people panic people learn from those mistakes I mean there are people that fold in fights that come back way stronger and will never fold because they folded before they felt it because a mistake you know you you you make a split-second decision in the middle of a fight and you know something something inside you you you you it exposes weakness that maybe you weren't prepared for the world to see and then when you feel the pain of that weakness you make a vow that you're never gonna experience that again that's entirely possible I feel like mental strength is not I don't think you to have it or you don't have it I don't buy that shit I think you can develop it I think you can build it and I think mental toughness and just the ability to persevere is something that you can cultivate I really believe that absolutely absolutely all shying away and feel you going hey motherfucker you know when you're getting a hit don't don't do any of this shit maybe needs to hear that so then when it's happening they go fuck that I'm not doing this anymore take deep and step to the side or clincher just like go out like a warrior yeah yeah or figure your way a better better response to the situation then again sometimes you get clipped in your neuromuscular system just goes up and everything is just off it's just you're not responding right cuz your your systems getting shot but it was more like I got away from me that's not good yeah I don't like that Miriam which said two and a half hours what flew by it's 4:30 that wasn't scary at all I told you my friend I'm gonna take care yeah we're all good man listen will happy on again when you have a fight scheduled and we'll pump that shit up okay let me know when let me know what it is you're not laughing whatever may be right they're doing a lot of that you got to go to Wyoming and do it on a ranch or something right hey well does it pay well yeah does it uh-huh way more real I know somebody that did four rounds for ten thousand four rounds for ten thousand yes you say that like there's not that's a lot of money for for that mm-hmm for just boxing four rounds about boxing bare-knuckle what if you break your hands we'll talk tell people how to find you on Instagram on Twitter all that stuff Oh Miriam
