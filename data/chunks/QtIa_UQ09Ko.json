boom what's up Frankie how are you right now good to see you man it good to be here yeah we talked about this many times we have you know my buddy Chris Tagore I got a shot him out because he got me listening to you you know years ago and I he's been telling me to come on this podcast for forever so I'm fine I'm glad to finally get it done so shot at the Chris I know he's listening hi Chris so you got your own podcast now I do me and Roger Matthews from Jersey Shore Fame he was the ex-husband of JWoww so we the champion - tramp camp in a trance yeah that's hilarious that's hilarious so what's happening man you just got off of the chan-sung Jung fight and what's next what are you up to I'm gonna go down 35 yeah you know how much to walk around it I'm probably like 56 right now Wow you know so 4:45 interval Marlon he's got to be bigger than you right Marlon is about a little bit bigger than me I think so too he walks her a little heavier he's a little bit more of an eater and I am did that guy I can I have a hard time believing he makes thirty five sometimes you wake him he's so Jack that's such a small waist no mum he soaked his legs and shoulders are so big but his waist is kind of small so maybe that's how he carries it so have you done a cut like that before I haven't been but I mean my last fight I think I was you know getting down to 45 got down at like forty four point five I mean it's only eight and a half over where I gotta be four to make 36 and it was such an easy cut for this last time so it's you're you're an interesting situation man because like you won the title at 55 and you didn't cut any weight at all and a lot of people like well fuck man Frankie Edgar can do because you the thing about you at 55 is you were so durable like that was one of the craziest things about some of your fights like the gray Maynard fights yeah fucking a man who repto Speights Yves Lavigne both of them now the first one the first second one anything was Josh Rosenthal well shout out to both of those guys because a trigger hungry referee who's got an itchy trigger finger they would stop those fights now I think nowadays if someone might stop it yeah yeah then I feel like they let it go a little more I mean so of course there's still some times they let it go a little it depends you never know it all changes it's such a weird thing right it's like the referee is trying to help the fighter they're trying to make sure that the fighter doesn't take unnecessary but you know more than once you see fights stopped we like all that guy wasn't done right he was he was getting through a bad patch and that's part of what a fight is about it's like trying to figure out how to survive for sure I always want to bend in for the doubt I you know yeah I don't want to get unnecessary punishment of course but I'd rather get to benefit data I've never been turned off even with Ortega and chan-sung Jung fight I got rot both those fights even though I got rocked in my other fights these fights I kind of was more coherent I'm not complaining about stoppages or anything like that you know I could see why they stopped it but in the great fight even the benson henderson fight where I got up kicked I don't remember any of those fights you know I remember like three four rounds of those fights just because it was so wild is it getting hit yet because I got hit and I kept getting it maybe maybe that's why I remember the Ortega fight I got rocked pretty good and I remember in my head saying all right just short time left let's get through let's get through it obviously didn't make it to the end and you know but I did I remembered being coherent even this last one would but uh Korean Zombie I remember the ref saying you know you got to do something down there you got to do something down there and okay no I was trying to do my best and my body maybe wasn't reacting to I need any to me but uh yeah you know I never been turned off you know I don't know if that's a good thing or not but I know it's a good thing either it's like some people say if you get turned off it's better because then you you're you don't absorb as much punishment or I heard that argument but then if you do get turned off your body gets turned off easier next time that's that's pretty true yeah like yeah yeah as it get cracked it can't kind of continue to get cracked and get rocked a little easier I'm hoping that's not the case from me well it's not it's more of the actual knockout itself yeah yeah I think like a bad knockout yeah it's crazy that you have had a bunch of fights we don't remember most of the fight like that that's the thing that a lot of fighters don't necessarily talk about but it's a reality of hard fights yeah the second fight with gray were evil evene was that the referee I remember I think the fourth round mark by coach mark was like you know telling me one more round than my head I'm like one more round what happened to 3 & 4 I didn't wander at all and also I when I dropped me I rolled my ankle really bad probably a grade two sprain and I remember in the fourth round coming - if my ankle was hurt man like what happened I have no idea what my ankle and even got walking back you know I was just kind of you know I don't know sometimes you get rocked you get depressed for some reason I noticed that even in the gym I'm gonna get what I get rock they get a little bit of depression going on for some reason like what does it feel like when you say depression like why God why middle ball you know you're just down on yourself you know I was emotional I think it was crying after the great fight in the locker room I think they have camera back there and there's a video of me in a second fight when you stopped him not the second fight but the the second all that was a second fight another fight the third fight you stopped the second fight you want the fucking fights that you had with gray were so crazy they were soaked he was so big yeah he's a big boy man I was so big for 55 you know and you were a guy didn't cut any weight at all nothing I was little you eat breakfast on weigh-in day wow that's crazy yeah we did you ever think back then about dropping down what were you just like fucking I'm the champ well that's why I was like a champ why should I go down I mean I'm winning I'm beating these guys yeah even the best his face they were super close you know I could have went either way and but I just felt you know alright I'll go down now I lost two in a row here but you know what more can I gain from here let me go down to 45 and that's that's when I fought Aldo for it for the UH for the 45 pound belt when you think about it like if you had a chance to do it all over again like if you had an engineer your career all over again would you do it exactly the same way would you fight a 55 well you definitely would against BJ right yeah I mean I I can't you can't go back and change this right now it all worked out for me you know I got a world title I had a printing to have a pretty good career there's always things you wish you could do differently you know you just I can't be that guy that's gonna say I wish I did this wish that things went the way they went well they went pretty fucking good yeah I'm not complaining you know on the BJ Penn fight I remember the first one in Abu Dhabi I was there for that one oh holy shit yeah you know that was those a big victory man and I want those big yet if the second one was probably even better just was like you know mortally won you know and I felt like to like you know BJ had my back in the in that second fight and you know I thought you know get your back back then you're in trouble and if it would offend I think it reversed them so I kind of showed a little bit of all my complete skills in that fight and all the guys that I've ever seen fighter never seen anybody who controls people with the legs the way BJ does he's got the craziest dexterity on his legs he does I heard when he was younger he could stand up and put his leg over his head standing up Jesus cry yeah I don't know if that's true like just lift it up and not even grab it and not even grab oh that's true seem jump out of the pool - that's pretty wild ya know he's incredible athlete yeah and his his physical talents were unusual but he worked on it like this other thing a lot of people don't realize that there's some great videos of BJ stretching right and he would stretch with bands so he has all this crazy like he would grab his foot like put her on his chest he's got bands and stretch the shit out himself so it wasn't just natural ability it was also like he'd realized well he realized that his legs were like other arms like cuz he when you were in his guard he would just reward those legs would come up and just pinch you down and and his mount he would cross his legs underneath dudes and his back mount was incredible yeah he was one of a kind I think you know on the ground and just as a fighter I mean I looked up to him coming up you know he was the man like him licking blood off his off his hands you know I mean I was actually with him we were each did the UFC gym 10 year anniversary up in Concord demos there and BJ was there so I was hanging out with EJ Beach is good dude man we get along really well is uh is he is he done fighting or was he gonna do I don't I think he wants to fight I don't think Dana wants him to fight but I'm pretty crazy brawl in Hawaii yeah yeah people are also like oh look at pizza you're getting mad at a fighter for fighting uh you know come on is it that surprising this is a funny way to look at it right like of a singer get a fight like a fighter fighting like a basketball player I'm gonna pick up get exactly can't get mad and for that it is kind of weird when you stop and think about it you know I mean that's the nature down in Hawaii I think a lot of people get down that's how they get down over there yeah they get down yeah tough motherfuckers in Hawaii yeah for sure you know that fight that was so sad to watch like that Duke clipped him with a left hook and dropped him and bounced his head off the concrete like fuck did he say hit me he said yeah I hit him and then he came back he went out he flashed out and went down and then I don't know if the video was continuous or what but later is a video of him having a gun back that smashed them god damn yeah and you gotta be Kevin you never know a gap in the street fight so yeah guys go home open the trunk come right back yeah that or I mean she'd throw some on their head and they don't wake up that's a big one yeah you know that happened to a buddy of mine in Long Island Kevin James actually the the comedian yeah his his buddy he they were working together as bouncers and he was working with this guy and this guy got a fight with a patron punched the guy knocked him out the guy fell banged his head off the ground died wow dude wound up doing jail time Wow and that happens I heard a story of some wrestler kind of same thing down to a fight peeped guy up smiling on his head and end up in jail oh my god he imagined a wrestler like a Doyle Romero how can some flexing you on the street well on the fuck that's it's over forever absolutely yeah it'll flatten the top of your head you know yeah another freak man oh he's the freakiest freak out all the freaks you got like Brock Lesnar whose likes got some freaky Viking genes like for sure yeah you don't make any sense you see ever see photos of him when he was in high school huh dude I got freaking high school Wow yeah we hear us he was a senior and I was a freshman and we're at Russell at Nationals together and I remember just looking at being next to him like damn how the fuck is this guy even real yeah this looks like an action figure yeah he was he was the biggest physical freak I think I've ever seen but then you got in Ghana who I think is more of a physical freak yeah yeah you know in Ghana too because I'm a hundred percent positive in Ghana's on the net that guy's all-natural yeah just you know salt mines whatever dirts and Sam well he's got a photo on his Instagram today of him chopping wood everything he does terrifies me he's so fucking powerful man that guy about all the guys I've ever seen the heavyweight division he is for sure the most powerful that uppercut he leaned on Alistair Overeem was man I thought he decapitated him yeah it's like his head flew it's like the back of his head touched his back like there is a disease breaking rocks I guess his stake into the ground that motherfucker has pow oh yeah he has like the most ridiculous punching power costume right oh yeah man well he's a natural 270 plus and apparently he's been lifting so he's even above 265 right now he's gonna have to cut weight that's way yes Wow yes guys fighting next huh Roza strike is badass that's a really good fight CAK one guy I don't know where he did his kick boxing career pull-up Giardino rosen strike try spelling that good luck you got it really come on I don't know how you fuckin spelled that correctly but Rosen strike the thing that's scared me about him when he's fighting I'll stir it was like he was walking right through Alistar shots which is the craziest and Alice there's no joke I mean yeah takes people out of he used dude when he was on the sauce and he fought Brock that when he was Overeem yeah here it goes so he fought in a bunch of different organizations danger zone yeah does it so so slam where is he from Rosen stroke right let's see it's Suriname Suriname me sir isn't that when I say Tyrone Spong yeah Terrence Martin man yeah yeah yes bong was supposed to fight Lucic in a heavyweight fight when Asik moved up to heavyweight in boxing you know Tyrone Spong is all yeah it's all boxing now is he oh he's only only boxing yeah did you see he was supposed to fight I'm thinking a big baby Miller was supposed to fight um Johnson that's right yeah Joshua right Joshua is testing yeah yeah yeah yeah um tyrant tested positive too no I was thinking of maybe Tyrone tested positive before he was supposed to fight ooh sick but he said it's bullsháá and then he I think he was actually cleared of it but it was too late they'd already set up this other fight through sick he's a dangerous guy I think there's a lot of people that are gonna avoid Tyrone Spong yeah he is he hits fucking hard and he's a savage he is he's you know his last did you ever see his last kickboxing fight he broke my leg was like yeah against Turkish Tyson right gosh gone what's his name Turkish nice all right oh Jesus why can't I remember his name he's in the UFC now yeah you made me forget his name what happened Gohan sock don't go come on sock yeah Jesus Christ it's early hey Saki he's had a tough transition to MMA but he's still a bad motherfucker huh and in fighting and kickboxing man he was one of my favorite guys ever to watch Saki had the nastiest left hand he would throw like left hook left hook left hook you know left hook to the body left hook to the head left hook the body would bang bang bang you know like fast as fuck for and for a heavyweight ridiculous hand speed yeah I mean I think all these athletes are getting better and better as it goes right oh yeah for sure it's kind of crazy yeah we guys are athletic as hell too when you stop back and think about your first fights in the UFC when you first got started like what what stands out as being like real different about seeing the younger guys coming up today the young guys just more complete mmm and they're they're more athletic I think back when I first started we were just guys I wanted to fight we were tough guys you know the wrestlers always did well cuz we're you know compete our whole lives but now these kids are polished right away and then you seem like twenty year old kids with crazy skills yeah they're polished had been doing it for five years already you see that kid Edmond Shabazz Ian yes yeah fucking incredible he's like I think he's 21 now right and he is just a fucking murderer man yeah it's crazy it's amazing that um eighteen years older than somebody's kids when do you think you're gonna do this anymore I don't know you know I always I have three three rules is uh as long as I'm enjoying it and I want to do it as long as I'm competitive I don't want to lose fights to guys I think I should be able to beat and as long as my body holds up so how old you know 38 so for the lighter weight divisions that's older that's all they're here yeah yeah I mean I I feel good my body feels good I mean I was always little injuries here and there but I enjoy it it's still fun you know my last couple fights didn't go to I wanted to you know what Holloway obviously I thought I gave him pretty good run he's a big dude it was tough to kind of close that range and I was in on some of his legs I couldn't really move him he's felt like he was part of the part of the kaika tree you know and then you know took that fight what crane zombie and obviously didn't go as I expected but uh you know I got a bounce back from this one but when you think about your preparation like between when you first started to now like as you get older is there anything that you do differently I don't spar as much I think III would spar three days a week always um five rounds you know four five around five six rounds sometimes now I kind of do two days a week that was a little push push and pull for me and Mark Marco wants us always pour in a lot oh really he's big into sparring and I I cut em too I feel like the best way to get in shape for a fight is by fighting you know right and we have good sparring partners not trying to kill each other right um you know but our team when I first started it was me and a couple guys that really were in the UFC now it's it's you know it's the bunch of hammers you know you know I saw that Mark Henry camp is insane I mean yeah he's a special guy there's so many like top-flight guys come to him from all around the world you know like zabita toby is mean how do you get from Dagestan to Jersey yeah they all they all do they all they all do this they say they're coming they all fly to Moscow they stay at Moscow for a couple days and they go to Brooklyn stay at Brooklyn for a couple days and they come down so they said are coming the next day to Lee three days later say that's the rounds they make why do they go to Brooklyn first I don't know there's a big dog insane community up there guests I guess I don't know if they take him shopping or something but I never knew Daghestan was a place so I heard of khabib yeah I mean I might have maybe heard about it but I didn't it didn't it didn't feature in my mind it's like a prominent martial arts spot yeah well I knew uh sati EV the wrestler Lisa from Chechnya right there and he was I remember watching him when I was in high school and this guy was just unbelievable I think he won I don't know how many World Championships like 10 he was in 10 straight World Championships with Olympics and worlds and he's a Chechen fighter and that's that area this past World Championship essentia chechnya and dagestan which is like the size of Georgia the state won the world just people from that area would have won the World Championship and Ruslan Wow I just can't fathom that well they're just hard people man yeah you see that basketball game that they play you see Harris's yeah yeah Harris productions shout-out to will yeah wills the man wills the man I love that guy he's he's a cool dude he's a great guy and he gets embedded he does he goes to Dagestan he hangs out with them he eats with them he plays that crazy basketball game with it and he's like he's a semi-professional yeah he's a huge guy he could have been a like a real I mean he had a bad knee injury when we run college but it's hilarious watching them play that basketball game where they grab ahold of each other and drag it to the mat and submit each other I just think I found the bed you know but at least I dribbled the ball no it's like rugby slash basketball slash MMA yeah that's probably only way to get scores some buckets though I'm here though like it seems like they might have invented it right it doesn't have to be has to be do you think like I mean I wonder if it's prominent in Dagestan or was just that camp wrestling they play handball they called handball or used to call Gator ball where we have like soccer nets are like field hockey nuts and it's kind of the same thing we you like three steps you pass that you could pass the ball no dribbling and then you know it's a bunch of rustlers playing so we're all tackling each other and everything so we kind of always used it up we never did it with basketball hoop so I guess that's that's a little different well we'll said that that's how they warm up they just get out there and like for one hour they'll put this crazy basketball game yeah and then they go train that's what yeah we stood out with the handball or Gator Bowl we used to call it it kind of makes sense that that would be a good way to warm up right because it's competitive you're running around a lot it's fun yeah fine and so I'm just doing the same old routine but it's interesting that even him even khabib with that crazy camp and all those monsters that he trains with makes his way down aka to Train yeah America that is something always wonder even the guys that come to us I'm like these guys are all so good why don't they just train with each other at home but I think they liked the fact that they're clocked in when they get here yeah you know they have no distractions and and the coach I think they come here for the coaching yeah I'm sure I think it's just a different look a different perspective is probably beneficial but just the fact that you know so many elite fighters from all over the world still want to do their camps either at a TT or with you guys or aka or you know there's just so many different places that they travel - have you ever gone somewhere for a camp or you just locked yourself down um no I've always did all my camps in Jersey earlier my career though before I mean mark had mark even before I start training Ricardo and Enzo and those guys I went out to a Kay actually with Thompson David Thompson chaucer's is the man ya know I listened to him mom a little bit um yeah he opened his house I say to his house for a little bit he was he's a super good dude he was kind of a veteran at the time when I came in so he helped me out a little bit a couple couple weeks there hanging out at ek and I just want to be home I know I wanted to be stayin Jersey yeah well you with your family and everything like that I get it but I think there is probably a benefit for a fight like a lot of great boxers used to go to the Catskills right and they would do their training right there and then like a lot of guys today they go to Big Bear my like triple G goes up there and a lot of other fighters have their camps up there De La Hoya always did his camps up at Big Bear it's like something about a camp that's very attractive to someone think of always locked down right right yeah you like it yeah your television yeah yeah I uh I need I need my family around me I need my friends around me you know I feel good in Jersey and I kind of I feel like I built I built it I built it up you know that's that's what people come come to me now you know not only me obviously for market Ricardo probably more so for those guys but I showed them that it could be done here and that's why you know we have that you know that miss fear that we do I think that is true I mean you definitely were one of the most successful pioneers of MMA coming out of there yeah yeah so uh you know it's cool to see all these young guys come and train with us and and we have a pretty good team now Plus Eddie Alvarez is there and he's you know been he's a pioneer as well so when you see Eddie go over to one Fc does that any of that ever look attractive to you I mean for sure the you know if I actually only have one fight left on my contract now oh you know you know but I've been in the UFC I'll be it'll be 13 years I've been the OC coming in February please see my team I went over there and Mighty Mouse you know I mean money talks you know especially at this point exactly yeah but I mean honestly if I if I was being straight up but where do I want to finish my career of I do want to finish in the OC you know I mean it felt like I got in UFC five and oh you know pretty much grew up here that's crazy so it'd be nice to finish it here but you know everything has to make sense well you know you're still near the top of the heap right I mean you just fought max Holloway how long ago was that in July yeah it's not that long ago it was close you know obviously the fight with Korean Zombie I mean I I feel like I didn't get a chance to get going you gotta be a good shot motherfucker he does hit hard you know and you know I was really down on myself that was tough that was a tough one um I was really down on myself for a while you know nobody takes loss as well no one competitive yeah no one competitive and I definitely took it pretty bad and Christmas was right here and in my head like I I took the fight on short notice but in my head I never once took a fight and didn't think I was gonna win how many how many weeks notice did you take about two weeks mmm I was in shape I was training you know not like I was training for a fight but I was training pretty good and I just believe in myself I throws I go there you know put this dude away and come home and enjoy Christmas but it turned out to be the opposite you know and a little depressing during Christmas time you try to be nice with your family and and you know love them with your family but you know what's weighing over my head is I just got fucking tko'ed yeah yeah that's the emotional side of fighting like the emotional side of losses like when you see guys just weeping in their locker room and like remember the hardest one for me was Aldo after McGregor knocked him out and he was just in his locker room just weeping like goddamn that dude that's a tough one so you know that's that's gonna stay like an infamy you know I mean you know forever and oh wait Congress by the worst guy cuz he's gonna tell everybody about it everybody's gonna want to cover it and that's the way it goes it was such a picture-perfect punch - yeah I mean he slides back only drops out left hand and I was in the crowd and I was I was told I was getting the winner of that fight and the one that went down like that I just knew that wasn't gonna happen really yeah I just felt it like I thought I thought I was gonna win back then we didn't I wouldn't know much about Conor I feel like at that point you know so I thought Aldo was gonna win and I was gonna get a rematch with him and then when when when Connor did that and here I'm talking about go I'm gonna go up to 55 my dad was my chance yeah yeah that the Aldo fight was crazy because I think that was the first time that anybody ever really disrespected although yes Aldo was the fucking man for so long I mean he doesn't the crazy thing about Aldo is he's still only 32 years old yeah like we were talking about that with the Marlin fight right wait you know is he really you know they've been following him since the WEC yeah I mean he was like 20 then so yeah kind of has to know yeah I mean who's WC Champion a long time ago man yeah you know I mean you go back and think about when he knocked out Cub Swanson with that flying knee that was a long time ago I was like a double name I asked yeah - he was so fucking athletic explosive know what when did he stop throwing leg kicks I don't know man I wonder I would like to ask him I wonder if like he's got injuries or something like that maybe nobody thought the first time he threw a leg kick and then I took him down on it and the second one and then he stopped that's the last time you do a leg kick and bolt our fights it's crazy because if you watch his early career like watch the Urijah Faber fight it is one of the most horrific displays of destroying someone's leg you've ever seen in a fight yeah it's so fast man there's no loading just now yeah that's the thing no loading he would just just whip those hips in right well you know he was a soccer player like a really good soccer writer you ever seen videos of him play soccer I see him a jog little ball he's like a pro oh yeah like he could have been a professor and I think soccer players first of all their legs are so conditioned because they're doing although they're basically sprinting all the time they're running up micronics miles a game I heard yeah and they're going left and right and left and right there way side to side like they apparently have the highest instances of ACL blowouts yeah yeah it makes sense oh yeah but because of those legs you know although just he was like a whip those legs were just cracked that's my thought when him immoral we're gonna fight him like we're gonna see some leg kicks but neither really you know got him off I wonder I wonder why Aldo stop throwing leg kicks I really wonder like wonder I mean he's got something right you know some injury maybe a hip injury yeah could be a lot of those kickboxer guys as they get older their hips start falling apart you know it seems to be a big issue with some guys like John Wayne par needs a hip replacement right yeah I mean he just had his last fight he won in a boxing match yeah I saw that which is great huge for the man dude he's such a good guy to follow yeah he's a good energy good such a positive dude and so is his whole family he's just like he's a great daughter do not like 30 fighters apiece yeah she's a beast man I think she's like 14 now she's amazing yeah he's he's something special but the poor guy he's been fighting over the last year or two with a really fucked-up hip yeah like me it's falling apart man they're like you got to have a hip replacement the whole insides just torn apart all right I'm not looking forward to the future man I'm just you know what I'm looking forward to the future with regenerative well yeah well yeah well you had stem cells I had some stem cells in my shoulder you won't you don't give it enough time no the thing about the stem cells is it really takes like four or five months before it actually likes an eye and starts healing things and a lot of guys like yourself I mean you don't you don't gather any dust for shopping at the vet but that's a problem but the one in my shoulder it did help it had a line I bet no early onset arthritis and they did the Wharton jelly yeah and I got that and it like six weeks later you know it's like I don't know I want another round I feel like I don't know if it works like that yeah another round would definitely help yeah but I think really Panama's the place for you right here yeah that super sauce yeah my next jacked up to a little bit so I wonder if they get I don't they help that stuff what is up with your neck I got a I guess stenosis oh so your your discs are shrinking yeah yeah my dears and the holes are the nerves run through its kind of so I got its toys uh actually it's kind of like a little bit before Holloway more and more so after I got an epidural on my neck and I was getting the tingles down my arm weakness in my hand a little bit and the epidural really didn't work but I just did therapy and it got better but it still bugs me a little bit there's a place they I think they have an office in Dallas they have one here in Santa Monica and then there's a place in Germany it's called lifespan medicine and they do this procedure called Regina Keene right androgenic een is what you've heard of it yeah Kobe Bryant rest in peace yeah he went to Germany to get it back in his day and so did Peyton Manning went out there with other athletes and Dana Dana actually went out they do it in u.s. now they do in the US now I've had a bunch of times I had it done on my neck when I had a bulging disc that was doing the same thing my hands are going numb yeah and it fixed it I also had a recently on my lower back because I was getting sciatica same shit that fixed it it's it's basically more potent version of platelet-rich plasma like they heat the blood and they they add something to it and it's just a radical anti-inflammatory and it's you know it's good because it's also it's your own blood you know they take your own blood out spin it and do this procedure to it and then it takes like 12 hours I think 10 or 12 hours for the it to become this they it looks like this yellow serum and then this yellow serum they inject into all your discs I'm telling you I had my friend Dean del Rey go down there Dean had a real fucked up neck from a car accident some lady he rides motorcycles some lady fucking clipped him he went flying it fucked his neck up to the point where we're he's a comedian we're hanging around the Comedy Store and he gets nervous if anybody comes near him like he's worried someone's gonna accidentally bump in them and because he was in so much pain because he was like real stiff and so I sent him to that lifespan medicine place and dude he was fixed up like within a week or two he was back Wow yeah yeah I would love to be like a pincushion but he poked at me everywhere well they can do crazy shit now but it's a lot of money and yeah if you want to travel to all these different spots but it's there's real benefit in this my hope is that it's like cellphones remember when fucking cellphones were giant they cost a billion dollars they were so expensive and now you can get a cheap phone like I saw flip phone the other day at Best Buy for 50 bucks Wow also you can get a phone for 50 bucks that's amazing yeah so hopefully stem cells goes that route that's what I'm hoping and I'm hoping that see the problem is like health care providers like if you have insurance the insurance doesn't want to cover any of that shit I know but doesn't make sense they want to come for a surgery but a surgery is 30 grand I always wonder like what's the politics behind that is there they I'm sure there's some yeah someone's got money always goes like the hospital's deal with the insurance companies and everybody's working together and no I'm making money but they don't want to cover these things because they're treating stem cells like it's a drug and so they're there they're treating it like what you're doing is you're taking a drug so these drugs have to go through that same evaluations that the FDA has but if they do that it's kind of literally cost hundreds of millions of dollars both the FDA didn't they just say CBD is no good they're so crazy those people are awful if they said that anybody who said CBD is no good you're awful yeah that shit is so good for you the oxycontin I think is FDA approved well I think it's the same thing they think of CBD as an untested drug right but regardless of how many people have positive effects from it positive benefits from it the way they look at it is like this stuff is in competition probably with like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen as long as ones right but CBD so much better than all those things yeah I might I mean it's natural to it yeah do you do it you take it I have yeah I take it yeah how much to take I mean I'm I need to build a more consistent with it you know I'm just like you know my wife I'll go get stuff done and standard how do you feel I'm like I feel pretty good I don't know I always feel pretty good so I'm like such a bad gauge on that stuff there's a problem with really mentally tough guys cuz mentally tough guys don't even think about what things feel like they don't fuck it I'm good just gonna go yeah yeah look at Kane like Kane literally destroyed his body because he was so mentally tough yeah oh yeah because he's such a fucking savage that he'd like he's had everything blow out on he did his knees his shoulders his back his neck everything's fucked up when I was when - aka this is before he was in the UFC and I went out there and I seen him sparring with I think Paul Buentello some other like UFC guys and they were just rotating on this if he was just putting these dudes away and they were gonna roll now I'm like who is this kid that guy's gonna be good no shit for he came to the UFC there was so much hype around him everybody was like this motherfucker doesn't get tired yeah heavyweight you don't see that not like him mmm his cardio was insane I remember when he fought big Ben Rothwell he would put it on guys and they would have that 100 yard stare where they're like what what fuck like what is happening to me how is this guy not tired it didn't make sense he was like a lightweight yeah yeah but 240 pound was 40 pounds and great wrestling great jujitsu great everything yeah boxing's second to none yeah you know and just surprised you with his body right because he didn't look too bright look that guy eats a lot of burritos right yeah yeah to this day I think in his prom I think he was I mean there's like the argument is him and phaidor those are the two arguments and then ste pay for his accomplishments right I mean I would have loved since t pay versus Kane when steep a wouldn't came was in his prime yeah that would have been great that would've been amazing but you know it's like this that that model of the heavyweight list the Cain Velasquez model I don't know if anybody else could do that like I don't know I think his his cardio was almost like supernatural I think you know people people say I've got good cardio and you know I could push always and they're like you know what is it from I think it's all mental more than anything I don't know maybe some people are born that way I feel like even the summer time when I wrestled in the summer I wasn't like in Russell and season shape I was gonna be the guys in better shape just cuz just your mind just my mind yeah I think it's most of its might everybody's like do you get tired I'm like fuck yeah I get tired I just keep going and I think everyone gets tired mmm couldn't you see some guys that you know are really really good and they've just scared to get tired so they're scared to push them I seen that in Russell a lot you kind of see them a you know some guys were they just scare the attire so they don't push it too hard yeah that's real right yeah yeah yeah there's some mind game going on we don't want to drain the battery right you don't want to like it seems like Marlin against Aldo there was a little bit of that like yeah yeah easing off the gas right especially after this Idol fight yeah and I was in I was in the corner from Marlin and it was going great that first round I'm like man this is great the pace is like wow Marlin likes it you know it wasn't too crazy and then pseudo turned it on and I just seen the look in Marlins face I'm like ox in the second round he got up looked at me and I was like you know I'm trying to pump mop like come on let's go by just see to this my first round looked like Marlin was gonna establish himself as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world yeah I mean he was so good he was his kickboxing was off the charts that fucking left leg switch kicked that he has to the head he's like a whip is crazy the way he does it yeah it's so light and effortless he just swings it up there and he did there it was when Marlin Edson came in they camp my legs hurt for a good couple months Edson's terrifying his switch kicks the fastest shit I've ever seen in my well yeah it doesn't make sense I don't even know how I move that queer yeah he's he's a freak he's like he's super tight too sure that's why he he's like a rubber band you know I mean let's snaps if it goes fast super tight looking what was like and just like not he's not very flexible really yeah I mean he could wheel kick and do all that stuff because I think it's just he was doing this is a kid right those bodies made for that but as far as being like a flexible guy he's not very flexible I mean I'm not very flexible either but I'm not kicking like that's interesting I would have thought that guy would be real flexible yeah what about Marlon Marlon spied a little bit more flexible he still he's still not very flexible either that's crazy how does he throw that switch kick to the head like that I just think their bodies from doing it forever they're like made to do that Wow yeah and their will kicks like crazy yeah but as far as like touching their toes you know we do yoga together and you hear Marlon how often you do yoga I try to do it once a week when I'm not in camp when I'm in camp I don't do it as much because I kind of takes away from something else but I try to do it once a week hot yoga hot yeah yeah I love and everyone that's never done it they need to fucking do it yoga my bro it's hard as shit hard as shit I know no bullshit I've been in some yoga classes and if my boy wasn't in there I might have walked out because I'm tired I like this guy see me walk out the place I go to they don't let you leave yeah oh really no I can't leave you just make commitment when you here if you can't take it to sit down yeah and RIT and try to rest it off you know try to take a couple poses all right try to get your heart rate back down but it's hot as fuck I've done some yoga me and my wife went to yoga class once just me and her and it was so hot and the ladies like how you guys feel what they eat and I'm like quiet please when they say it's too hot it's one of the most underrated difficult exercises because you think of it as like housewives or moms right now like a bunch of gals bunch of hot girls and yoga pants yeah I'm only dude in there sometimes yeah me too sometimes well there's more guys in my place now look it's starting to see that sometimes it's actually half in half which is kind of interesting yeah I mean it's which I think it's great for you yeah I saw my eye - like when I say I'm done fighting I'm sure it's something I'll do more often well for me too it's like a 90 minute meditation session - yeah it's all you're thinking about is those poses all I'm thinking about is concentrating on keeping the maintaining a steady breath and then holding the positions as long as possible yeah yeah and I like just it's like you know the instructor or yogi is giving you positive affirmations I mean so it's a little wonky but you know it's always like a good a good message yeah sometimes some of them go a little bit crazy some of them try to give you life lessons yeah well yeah well I'm then also like ah this is your lower intestines getting no what do you mean I'm over yeah yeah it's massaging your descending colon no it's not it's definitely not you're just stretching stop I swear like a maniac in there yes it's great it's definitely good for you oh my god you can lose amazing amounts of weight in there but I just think like for maintaining strength in your joints and strengthen it always feels to me and maybe this is just my head but like it's helping all the connections like shoulders and hips and knees and like all the other stuff that doesn't necessarily get the same kind of workout when you're just doing regular stuff right weight training your kettlebells or kickboxing whatever you you're working out like holding your leg in one certain position and like leaning forward and just maintaining no static holds yeah yeah I feel like it tightens all your connections up and it also increases your range of motion and it just opens you up you know I feel so much better when I'm doing yoga and I would like to do it more often be honest oh yeah I just I don't want to miss hitting pads and all that stuff that's the thing right it's like for a mixed martial artist there's so many skills to concentrate on there's so much if you're a boxer what are you gonna do you got to run and you get a box yeah that's it right you know when you're a mixed martial artist god damn you gotta think about everything and you don't want to overdo one under do another you know how do you know what to do I you know I came up with a formula and seems to work what's your formula I got you know uh just my schedule is I do Jiu Jitsu monday-friday ice bar either well used to be Tuesday Thursday Saturday I'll wrestle Wednesday and Friday and then it's trying to condition in between all that Jesus yeah just hearing that makes me tired but look what is your strength conditioning schedule I do that Monday and Wednesdays Monday and one yes and when you do it do you do it before MMA training like I usually do grab or wrestling before and then do not after really yeah why do you do that that's just the way it kind of worked out for me so do you do it the same day I mean I mean the same time of day like noon like you do your no I'll just do it morning I'll do jujitsu wrestling and then at the afternoon all OH give yourself a chance to get covered yeah yeah although it's like it's like 10:00 and 2:00 so it's quick just enough to eat yeah just enough to eat and drive you know Jersey is a commuter state so I Drive everywhere man I noticed I there's only I don't think any none of the place I trainer I'm Aaron Thomas were in my town so right I'm always on the move how what Jerry's got a lot fuckin traffic to it does but it's like it's not dicta below yeah predictable traffic you ready man you know if you miss the rush hour you're good here you never know what we in until seed I've been coming home from a comedy club at 2 o'clock in the morning I hit bumper-to-bumper traffic oh yeah that's crazy it's just too many of us I was actually even realized I've stayed right across the street from the Comedy Store Oh which place we want monitoring Mandarin Mondrian right yes see that when someone says something wrong sometimes you how do you say it right the Mondrian yeah that is right across the street yeah I didn't realize till I woke up the next day oh shit I should have went in last night yeah it's anytime you want to go therefore even falling not there just let me know so today yeah so when you are in Toms River like what is a typical day for you when you when you leave your house like I got on a Monday morning like what what time do you get going what time to eat yeah I get up like eight o'clock I guess I'm an early guy I get up at 8:00 I'll eat something I'm out of the house by 8:30 8:45 get the Ricardos for like 10 a.m. practice 9:30 practice practice for two hours drive back home which is like about 45 to an hour and when you're practicing you practicing with the key no no gang never not in a long time your card Oh actually believe it or not told us not to really yeah I said easily he said the gig will always be there he said you always go back to the gate when you're done he's like right now it's not applicable for MMA I'm so glad he said that yeah man that is I don't know hopefully don't get me a nice well that was a giant problem with like so many Brazilians were so connected to the ghee that they would be offended if you didn't hang with again I get really mad at you that's what I thought when I first went oh my god maybe stuff now you know yeah yeah we did a little bit you know that's what it's it is good for you it's good it's for defense I think it's good for people like myself where I use a lot of wrestling and athleticism for my jujitsu because it kind of takes that away and makes you you know pay attention it's a technique yeah it makes you concentrate on defense because you can't just muscle out of things right and with a lot of Fighters you know especially like real explosive guys they get used just yanking out things and you know when someone's got collars and grips on your sleeves you can traumatically think about what you're doing hmm yeah you gotta pressure you gotta have a good position you have you got to be patient too you can't expose yourself because you're impatient you just want to get out of a spot all right yeah that is that that's the positive aspect of the gay the negative aspect of the gi's when guys go from the ghee to MMA and they're looking for those handles and the handles on the area yeah but Eddie always told us just do the ghee but don't use collars don't use collars and sleeve so my gig aim was really just no ghee in a ghee yeah honestly probably when I did the gay I've multiplied didn't grab as much as clean so he wasn't used to it in desperado time so I'll grab the ghee yeah you know fucked up but for the most point I think it's you're better off just using over hooks and under hooks and cable grips and just working your same positions that we do in noogie so then you're doing the same game always yeah but I'm glad Ricardo said that because to have such an accomplished resilient jujitsu artist like him who's got this gigantic school and who was a accomplished fighter himself and now as a judge right to have him say that like yes yes prefer a long time people got so connected to this idea that you need to do the ghee in order to be good within MMA which is nogi yeah yeah I mean you know even like Gary tonin and Gordon Ryan think those guys are gonna give very often it's very rare yeah yeah I think I think that Gordon Ryan has done some matches recently in the gay maybe Gary Tona - I mean they know how to use it yeah yeah yeah but it's uh you know it just makes everything more you know it's just there's so much more friction so much there's so many things you can do in the key you cannot do in an MMA fight or in a noogie contrast yeah it's really just not applicable at all so that's good we don't I want to I figure when I'm old I'll put the Gion you know yeah yeah well it's you could I mean there's guys in my jujitsu class they're in their 60s yeah still rock that's what's great you know you nice and slow it's uh it's something I'll definitely doing the future so you go there you do that class and like how far you're driving a lot to all these different yeah it's almost time you get in your car a couple hours a day oh sure so me not a fucking car yeah yeah I do I got pine belts much ship so I get the driving Mesa RAM or Silverado oh you got a deal with yeah I Drive it for the demo oh then I turn in for a thing but I uh I got a Cadillac cts-v - I know you're in the concert I love cts-v yeah those things are beets yeah it's fun I got a little stage to tune on and style really yeah it can move him well that's a fast car that's a good Italian guy in Jersey car yes perfect so so how far have you ever thought about living somewhere where everything you just so connected at Toms River you'd never move yeah I mean well now Nick cotone is in brick - and he has a huge facility in bricks well it's where we do a lot of our sparring as far as this way 20 minutes away so that's uh you know he's been met he's been there for now a couple years and he's like a 30,000 square foot gym oh really - full cages bunch of mat space oh wow oxen train yes it says phenomenal facility what's it called nikka tones mixed martial arts cat okay cool that's awesome man it's amazing that these gems are they're so good now it's like it was so hard in the beginning to find one facility that had this kind of place right even the country these are only a couple gems whether it was an aka or Jackson's or when I first started I graduated college and it was like even May graduated college I have you know ultra fighters the first seasonal time fighter was on I think was uh they had the finale in May watching my teammates on my bid I'm giving this a try you know Koscheck was a was on on the season he wrestled for Edinboro sort of clarion we're in the same conference so I see him oh my god man look he's doing pretty well give this a shot so I found a place to Train in Kurt Pellegrino actually had a gym in in near my town so I called him up I knew him through wrestling he's like he's like I'm actually moving to Florida he's like but you can come train here for a couple days before I go my guys so I came there and a new guy was taking the gym over and so that's where I ended up staying and the gym was no bigger than this room here Wow you know and you see all these young kids have this 30 Town Square facility I'm like dude you guys are fucking spoiled man yeah yeah it's a different world now I mean it's there's only there's no other sport like MMA where if you go back to like the 90s and then you look at it today it's unrecognized ah yeah it is it's just martial arts is change like you'd say at all time you know how quickly UFC or MMA changed martial arts forever yeah we'll never look at it the same way again martial arts have evolved more over the last 20 years and they have over the last twenty thousand yeah and that's just I don't think anything that's done that go back and watch UFC one and then go go watch UFC 246 it's like what the fuck man like everyone is so evolved now and even you know across weight classes it's just it's just such an interesting thing that we figured out how to do it right yeah I mean shit even when I started 2005 to now it's changed the whole bunch ya know for sure yeah I mean 2005 was when the Ultimate Fighter was on I am dude how crazy is a Diego Sanchez is still out there in rouen it's amazing he's the last of the Mohicans it really is right he's the last one on that show yes oh for sure yeah I mean Stephan Bonnar's long gone right Forrest Griffin's long gone he's working for the UFC now and fucking Diego Sanchez still still screaming yes you know in cartwheels he's a special dude he's crazy yeah he's a wild motherfucker man yes he's uh his outlet he was kind of strange on the show oh yeah but just like he's a different different personality he's weird definitely weird but he's also got a mind like a fucking bank vault yeah hence yes I mean his will is unbreakable that guy does not quit he's lost before he's been stopped before but you ain't getting him to quit I'm heir when he fought BJ just kept calling yeah I said split open with the head I was crazy this guy's nuts ya know I mean in all of his fights I mean he's he's an animal I mean yeah and he's such an entertaining guy I mean you think about some of his fights that he fought even at 170 against guys like Jake Ellenberger or Martin Maher began and Kampmann had his face hanging off I mean a giant cuts all over Diego's face and in the third round Diego's chasing him is chasing him my god damn he's tough his willpower second to none I think it's insane it's insane and he's still out there still out there throwing yes yeah it's it's impressive I mean these guys are setting the bar high you know yeah real hard yeah and it's interesting like Diego I've always thought was like a guy who could have benefited from a 165-pound class I feel like the UFC I've been saying this forever I'm a broken record but I think they should reorganize the weight classes and put weight classes every ten pounds yeah there's too many big gaps like the 85 to 205 pound gap that's crazy yeah no it's not so big I mean if they have tightly like they have plenty of fighters right and there's plenty they just should move some of these weight classes around I think that even dos anos to him and chiesa you know I think dos I'm surprised 65 pound there probably looks so much smaller in Casa 2 chiesa how the fuck did he ever make 50 I don't get it man I I seen him you know after he made him my dude you were always a 70 pounder yeah always I just was really impressed with how he was able to control ha failed dos Anjos I mean I didn't get to see that the fight I was actually flying down here but yeah I seen you know highlights me I think it took him down five or six times yeah man he's a fucking he his arms are so long they were in positions where a lot of guys would have to kind of like hold on but he could reach all the way back around clap his hands together like oh what an advantage that is it's like when I train it's a beat so I feel oh like six - yeah I can cover my head and my toes and he's only you know it's only half of him he's got the weirdest style man because his style is like you know he does like scissor takedowns but it's got like a lot of wheel kicks and 360 roundhouse clangs ooh right it is comfort right it's a real comfort but also with and I think it's it's it's a form of kung fu oh yeah it's kind of food yeah yeah he's he's one of the more unusual guys in the in the sport yeah he is he's got a quiet demeanor too you know lately said Abraham Lincoln he died he does as soon as he walked in there so everyone said well everybody says to that you haven't even seen what he can do like in the gym you see what he could do and like I was talking to mark about him and he's like dude this is like back before zabi but had really made a name for himself and he's like that fucking guy in super town yeah I was really impressed with Calvin cater though in their last fight yeah you know um that third round who seemed like a be kind of lost some steam yeah well I won't started coming on I might be one of the best jobs in his fucking right hand to the right-handed knocked out Lamas with the tude oh man yeah Calvin he's on another level with its striking particular with his hands like he does a lot of training with boxers yeah sure here - he's a Boston guy right yeah and only getting better you know he's only - yeah he's he's just beginning to get into the top tier of guys you know I mean he beats Shane Burgos with that beautiful knockout and the Ricardo Lamas knockout was too spectacular so Lama said you know fought for the title Lamas was the top guy and then there's a beat fight when's a beat is like right there at the very top of the heap at 145 and who knows what the fuck would happen if that was a five round and I know cuz Calvin was putting it on him he was at that point and when Sabae took him down the third he basically just hung on in the end yeah just sound the way yes yeah commas dangerous he's dangerous and getting better and he's boy what a fucking division man your division found five that you're leaving the division 35 no fucking sweeter let's be real you know killers there too but you'll be a bigger car yeah I mean I just don't don't think I'll be the biggest guy either at 35 but I'll definitely be you know much more comfortable to the rest of them what was interesting because even when you're fighting at 55 a lot of people were saying that you should be 35 yeah like you by hmm might be right I'll give you weighs 55 a lot of the guys that weigh 55 compete at 35 yeah yeah shit which is oh my god Lockhart towards Lockhart was on oh yeah and he's sitting here and he said I can make 25 slow down George that was a mistake yeah that all the there's only two well he his was real bad all the way up and to the weigh-in TJ the way he looked you know he looked like a like he was starving to death that's what he looked like he did his cheeks were sucked in its face was suck Dan's really bad decision no even cuz he had it you know do to try to train yeah it was just terrible you know 35 he was the fucking champ and like a really good fighter hey 35 and to take that stuff I don't know you know Cody Cody Cody Garr Brandt was accusing him of taking and even before then yeah he said he didn't cody's actually training with us now - oh is yeah oh that's a good move for him that's a very good move for him and Mark been working together there he was out he's out for a week he went back east old you know he's still in a alpha male that's right you know he was talking to me about that mark was like giving him some real good pointers on some of the things that he does or exposes himself right how to make sure he's more protected and make sure he's more more elusive more difficult to read right do some different kind of things but yeah you didn't put us for a little bit now he went back to alpha male bees coming back and finished got sick hands sick hands i got you know i true you'll see Marlon Seagal these guys what Kody's hands are so fast man yeah he's fast as far can he get there is he can come back man he can come back he just you know he had that fight with TJ lost lost in the rematch and then lost again to pedro muñoz say like god damn like he's just so game but all three of those fights i mean he was he was enemy he had those guys rocked big you know and that pedro muñoz guy has a chin made out of fuckin steel must steel and you know and he knows it too he's like he's like I'll stand in front of anybody yeah he has that belief in himself and one of the nastiest guillotines in the game yeah that guy's got a fucking sick clamp he gets ahold of your neck woo thank me in trouble yeah it's um it's a fucking that division that whole division that you're about to drop down into yeah that's just as scary as a division you're in now yeah you can't go anywhere nowadays you know yeah there's no picnics there's no there's no easy something easy even for the ladies there's no there's no easy ladies division they just exist every way clashes getting deeper and deeper and that's just the progression of the sport you know I mean you know even when I first started it wasn't at you know maybe the top five top ten now you got top twenty or you know some some good some dogs you know yeah what do you think you're gonna do when you retire I don't know I don't know I I have a I'm enviable UFC gym I have one in North Brunswick New Jersey one a Riverdale you know kind of partnered up with a couple guys I'll definitely stay involved in this sport how does that work does the UFC contact you and say hey Frankie you want to be involved in one of these gyms um I think we sought them out they sought me out type thing you know but that process took took a while to get to where we're at now I started like inquiring about the UFC gym back in 2014-2015 they must be popular as fuck though right they're all over wanna train at a UFC gym yeah you would think I think some people are just they think when they think UFC gym by God I'm not wanting to fight anybody but it's not even like that you'll see gyms with family atmosphere man you don't have to go take a fight class you can go just train and or take a martial arts class you know now when they have these UFC do they have like sparring classes jujitsu classes they have everything they have everything yep so it's just like a fight jam it's like a fight now it's more I'd say it's more like an LA Fitness like the LA Fitness fuck to fight gym yes exactly exactly love child LA Fitness in a fight jam yeah and you train at those places I'd do something from time to time yeah you know what I mobile you usually go up there and teach a class or seminar stuff like that when you train with Mark where you train with Mark his basement really yeah or Allah or like nikka tones but but you mostly his basement we start out in his basement how BIG's his basement it's big he lives he owns a pizza raid this pretty well he's got he kills it with the piece of business no bullshit it's some of the best beats in Jersey and nobody else that's a big statement cuz Jersey a piece and his very good no I'm not lyin where's that New Jersey Pinos pizza he knows pal Frankie sent ya and so his basement he has decked out like a gym yeah it is it uh it started yeah he's got like whole workout stuff like a full you know full basement pretty nice house um then he put mats on thing and you know what splotch like our posters are up there so it was cool that's cool yeah but I started with Mark and literally in 2005 and we started in the basement now did you have any striking experience before that none just just the seaside boardwalk that's about it so what was it like going from just baby straight wrestling to learning how to strike and wrestle together it was uh it was learning process you know early in my career I was able to take everybody down in those early fights but I had some pretty good fights even before UFC I fought the Vidia start of something to videos he was this Ukraine type fighter on a heat for WC he'd beat some good guys so he was decent I was able take him down then I fought Jim Miller actually my last fight for UFC no shit yeah we had a crazy fight so you know I I had good opponents right away but the striking you know it it something I really liked I was always in the box and growing up I was always in the fight and I you know jerseys you know I'm not from the hood by any means but everyone fights where I'm from you know it's kind of like cease everyone goes to Seaside look for fights that's kind of later of it yeah I mean you hear Joey Diaz talking about it so yeah Jim Miller's a fucking beast he is a beast I'm so glad he's healthy now because that guy struggled yeah so long of lime dis yeah my wife has it actually does she feel in dealing it's 2007 everybody gets it in the East Coast yeah that's crazy how many people have you know and it's just they say that uh there was a we did this this group we looked at this map online of all the areas in the East Coast where Lyme disease is prevalent and how what percentage of the ticks have it it's bananas oh yeah it's it's my wife in Iran acquitted too because you know she's had to go through a bunch of you know treatments and whatnot and they're still with her right now it is it's not as much but she's got like bunch of issues like autoimmune stuff I don't you know and she's caught she's doing she's does the IV treatments sunlight therapy it's like when they take the blood out running through UV then put it back in yeah yeah she's done a lot of a lot of that stuff and she does she's starting to feel better with Jim I think you changed his diet I think that was a big one just really started eating clean yeah my wife eats pretty clean she's a you know kind of holistic ish type person yeah the the the Lyme disease thing's fucking terrifying because for a long time they were diagnosing it incorrectly like people didn't know whether it was my disease and people come in with all sorts of aches and pains and if they didn't have that big bullseye mark on them where the the tick bit them the doctor really had no idea what was going on and some doctors didn't have a lot of experience with it right I got it when I was young did you yeah but I've seen the tick so I got my medicine right away and and I was fine but they say if you don't see it a tick and then you still know you have it and then if you don't get our medicine right away then you're fucked it's in your I ever say like it's not even that Lyme disease it's the others the other diseases got attached to it yes well there's the thing called more gel ins have you ever heard of more Jones yeah more gel ins is a disease that a lot of people think it's like a like a psychological disease they think that like you're imagining things because they would imagine though like fibers were growing out of their scabs and they scratch themselves like crazy right but I had some good in so we did a television show called Joe Rogan questions everything yeah and we we had some one of the conversations I had was with a doctor who has Lyme disease and that's when things got interesting because he was aware of it not just as a person who has the disease but also as a doctor and he said one thing that all these people that have more Jalen's have in common is that they all have Lyme disease and he thinks that Lyme disease is not just one thing that it's a host of other things that are attached by Lyme disease like non-identified pathogens yeah and that some of them have some sort of neurotoxic effect that changes the way you see things so he was seeing things like that weren't there like he was seeing worms crawling around on his eye that weren't even there they weren't there and he realized like okay this is probably what more Jones is like these people are thinking that things are growing in their skin but there's nothing there but it's really because the Lyme disease and all the other toxins and pathogens that go with it are fucking with your neurology yeah they're fucking with your brain yeah yeah my wife said brain fog is probably the biggest thing that that bothers her you know and she went through a period where she was always tired and it's crazy because my wife you would never guess it because she's super high energies works out every day you know she pushes through push through it but it's definitely something she has to constantly treat you remember when people had chronic fatigue syndrome yeah where'd that go no this is not like a thing that everybody always had but I didn't excuse that excuse I can see that that's you this he's mentally tough how do I feel I feel go let's go that's it I feel good you know I mean my wife it's if shouldn't it's just expensive to haul he's damn true oh yeah and well Marcus Davis all of his UFC money he spent treating his wife for Lyme disease yeah he wound up he's a prison guard now I'm worried yeah I think he's still doing that you know he's good buddies with Della Grafton yeah yeah Telegraph that was keeping me posted on him but he wound up like his wife got real bad I think he's more than a quarter million dollars yeah just stop treating her not that much I mean unless my wife's not telling me but haha it's fucking bad my friend Steve Rinella he and his son got it and the doctors didn't recognize that the doctors he was like I think it might be Lyme disease the doctors didn't think so then his son started getting Bell's palsy so fat half his face and his son was little I think he was like four or five half his face was going numb yeah it's having that happened to my wife actually Bell's palsy - one time yeah I think she got a flu shot she said and then came home she got Bell's palsy Jesus Christ yeah it's a fucking creepy disease man it is because no one seems to know what to do with it and you know they had a vaccine for a little while but the problem with the vaccine was people were and this is including my managers dad took the vaccine and got Lyme disease from the vaccine I bet you parried the flu shot like I've heard get the flu shot and they get the flu you know I've heard people get sick when they did the flu shot but then I've talked to people that are vaccine people they're like no you probably were already getting the flu and the flu shot that you got was the wrong one for whatever flu was in the area well I also heard - they give you the strain from last year and then there's the new strain this year so it's not even really helping you well I think there's multiple strains each year and I think they're basically just had just batteries are guessing I don't take flu shots now hell no yeah but I I think they do work if you get lucky yeah not the right one I mean I believe in vaccines for sure but I don't think that it always works and in the flu shot case I'm not sure because like sometimes sometimes they just get it wrong like they have the wrong strain right right what do we know we know I know it's it's a touchy subject any morons with that with the Lyme disease but mine say there's a conspiracy theory that that's the government without us in the wild well there was a conspiracy theory that there was actually look this up Jamie because there was actually something about this that we're talking about recently where they were looking in there was they were investigating the idea that Lyme disease was a biological warfare weapon I accidentally got released but this is through like legitimate channels they were investigating us it wasn't like some fucking tinfoil hat job they release it on the East Coast yes right not not where they wanted to release it I think it got out I think the idea is that somehow or another this disease had accidentally escaped their labs or while they were in the middle of treating people is it tick the only way you can get Lyme disease I believe so yeah and it's the ticks I think it's deer ticks I think it's places that I have a high population of deer also have a high population these ticks and then when people get it it's less you know most of them don't realize they have it until it's too late yeah so you don't realize you have it and then you miss the early rounds of antibiotics which can knock it out and then you get this chronic like Jim Miller has and your wife at house and yeah my buddy Steve Rinella that had it he was fucked up I mean bad for at least six months when I saw him he looked like he had lost and he's a slim guy but he looked like his lot he lost 20 or 30 pounds and he was just said he'd just been dealing with the the Lyme disease I have to kill them I mean not kill them but just just really diminished Itamar yeah yeah it's fucking it's a weird disease man because you you can't find anybody who doesn't know anybody who has it yeah he's car yeah everybody knows a brother or cousin or a wife someone has it it's great and I love running the woods and trails but like in the summer time it's like man just to get ticks throw my kids oh no my kids going out and it I think it takes 24 hours for it to set in so like once you once you do come back if you have a tick on you just have to reject yeah yeah so we do every time we go in the woods take checks how do you get him off you though if like it's what if it's like in the middle of your back and you're by yourself yeah I guess you're like one of those back scratchers or something was Lyme disease created as a bio weapon is this a legit website it's yes how stuff will house the house stuff work so it's not oh unlatch it that's that's legit how stuff works is very legit I just sort of read the whole article it's sort of unproven but there are some people I believe that things that this is a thing it just would be very hard do is with the tick says weapons issue made headlines back in july 2019 thanks to the US House of Representatives Chris Smith our New Jersey Republican New Jersey who introduced legislation legislation directing the Department of Defense to review claims that the pentagon research ticked bass bio weapons in the mid 20th century the amendment passed Smith said he was inspired by a number of books and articles suggesting that significant research had been done in the US government facilities including Fort Detrick Maryland and Plum Island New York to turn ticks and other insects into bio weapons imagine if those cunts created a fucking disease and now everyone else has it what the fuck because it's mostly out there that's what's fucked up yeah it is it is a lot lime isn't lime a place in Connecticut yeah what is that why they named it Lyme disease I mean I think that's why they named it that yeah the view heard of the Rocky Mountain tick it's not kind of the West Coast version of well it's Texas I think or the Lone Star tick that's different the Lone Star it makes you not like meters yes alpha-gal alpha galactose it does something I think that's the word it it makes you allergic to music to me yeah so you you literally go the rest your life and you can't eat me if to eat like chicken and fish shoot me what is that the first cases of it were there in 1975 yeah the goddamn government they're creating bio weapons I'm not surprised no I talked to the Soviet Union guy when I was doing that television show and he was saying that they they had all sorts of bio weapons that they were developing over there gotta be giant pits filled with anthrax one whose other tics in other countries their Lyme disease in other countries that's a good question that's a very good question that would that would like sort of explain while we're in conspiracy Vail having something chrono virus stuff yeah conspiracies about it yeah what's the conspiracy is like a level four bio weapon facility opened in one recent not too long ago and before the suggestions are online oh no I'm I'm not saying it the suggestions are online something might have leaked just like this have you consulted with Sam triply already Bravo I have seen tweet from who from Sam we're heading I think Sam's retweeted some stuff of course of course yes I've seen other stuff online too Wow I mean I think whatever news is out there there's always some conspiracy theory that goes with it right that's true even if it's like lock look I saw conspiracy theories that Connor through the fight or a cowboy through the fight with Colin and I had my cousins like oh I can't believe cowboy would do that I'm gonna do what what crap do what people are crazy yeah yeah yeah I I was upset at Steven Naismith and I made a video man come on listen Steven Naismith I guess I should respond right you're very entertaining guy I like you a lot and I appreciate the props he gave me in that video but you're wrong yeah cowboy got cowboy got fucked up with those shoulders in the clinch he had Connors arms tied up and they're in tight spaces Connor dips low and slams this bone of his shoulder into the nose and he's at the beginning of the round Connors a fucking super explosive guy super explosive all muscle just fucking pulled tight at the beginning of the fight and just bang bang he got off good shots and cowboy was confused and he was flustered flustered I I don't think that those shots maybe rocked him they broke his nose a night that could rocky I guess he's got blood pouring out of his nose so he's not breathing out of his nose now and then all the sudden he's like fuck my nose has already fucked up and he hasn't even punched me right you know it was it was unusual like I could see if someone has a peripheral understanding of the sport and you see that having like come on man or even guys like Mike Bisping like Mike Bisping it was like fucking shoulder strikes come on shoulders right now but that said Mike Bisping is without a doubt one of the toughest human beings has ever walked the face of the planet like if you lost an ear but I got another yeah yeah it's like one eye come on he doesn't give a fuck you fought a giant chunk of his career against the best fighters in the world including win the title with one eye yeah Michael Bisping is a fucking dyed-in-the-wool Savage yeah so if he's like shoulder strikes that said the soldier strikes didn't end the fight the shoulder strikes definitely got him off on the wrong foot then cowboy threw a kick to Connors arms and then Connor can't counter with a head kick Rach how much bad see his legs go and then Connor hits him with Pistons so hard people could say it was a work he broke his fucking orbital bone yeah and then but Steven Naismith said that he felt like cowboy quit he did not quit he got smashed someone quit again their nose broke and rocked and a broken orbital you can't say he quit it's also who you're talking about you're talking about a guy was the most fights in the UFC the most finishes in the UFC the most head kick knockouts in the UFC the most the most bonuses in the UFC cowboy is a fucking legend he is a as tough as they come he's lost before every human can lose especially your fighting guys like Darren tail and Jorge Maz Vidale and and these fucking animals that he's fighting he's fighting the cream of the crop or Connor and Connor broke literally broke his face he broke his nose and he broke his orbital bone so so Steven Naismith responded and then Connor responded yeah I seen Connor told him to apologize that's right he is right I mean give Connor of the credit a little bit I think the problem is Steven Naismith who's a very entertaining guy and is very knowledgeable about other sports this is not his wheelhouse and also that style of dismissing athletes and putting people down like kind of made his name that's how you made his name and it's fun to listen to he's he's a fun guy to listen to yeah he talks great shit you know but I wonder I I mean I'm sure basketball players are kind of saying the same stuff we're saying when he's criticizing basketball players though or football players you know you mean oh I'm sure I'm sure I mean I don't know too much about that Jamie you're a sports fan right did they criticize him too he's respected for sure yeah but the show he is on it's like every day he's got to wake up and give his take and they gotta talk about it for an hour too and a lot of the take it's like the controversy is like good yeah they gotta talk about yeah and he had a radio show for three hours he did after that so like yeah blocks all day long and right yeah and you know and he's entertaining that's what people like to hear like to see here somewhat passionate you here him and Teddy Teddy Atlas argue after the Conor McGregor Floyd made with a fight yeah Conor McGregor made the best chef in the world be a fucking fast food club that's basically how they're like back and for the two of them yelling and arguing it's very entertaining yeah I just think that's that's his position all right I just think that this sport demands more appreciation more respect and it demands a higher level of reverence to the athletes who literally put their lives on the line it's a different I don't think you have to say the guy quit to descript describe what happened no you could just talk about what Connor did that was so special look the guy finds tricky ways to do things and those shoulder strikes look we've seen guys do shoulder shrugs before but we never saw anybody do it successfully but you got to think about the UFC is a lot of what happens in the UFC is someone at all these fights finally does something and then other people start doing that thing like remember when no one was throwing front kicks to the face no one yep all the sudden Anderson knocks out Vitor who's like one of the elite of the elite strikers knocks him out with the front kick of the face you're like what no but and then you see everyone trying it nobody ever did it I don't remember anybody ever even in kickboxing people very rarely through a front kick to the face just wasn't you know they would teep right face but that even teeps to the face it was immoral arrange thing yeah all you would like push in his face right like you very rarely unless someone caught it perfect so I gotta get knocked out with like a snap front kick with the ball of the foot now almost like an uppercut the way it comes off yeah - it's a fucking devastating technique yeah when done correctly I mean Justin Buckholtz got a KO with it outside of the UFC that's devastating lyoto machida did that jumping front kick - Randy cool right yeah nice Randy Couture with a fucking front kick to the face that's a legit technique but then you see everybody doing that like low calf kicks right yeah first guy I ever saw do it was Benson Benson really Benson Henderson really got into those low Cathy and me those are rough man yeah but now everybody throws those necks you got to think of how many years went by before people were not throwing low calf kicks I guarantee you now when people get tied up in the clinch and someone's holding someone with double over hook sore whatever I don't remember how Connor had a hold of our cowboy over on the right oh yeah when someone's tied up in the clinch and you can't strike you're gonna see guys this is a bone man it's a fucking bone right there and if anything it's just something to distract him you know to move to something else but this where your shoulder at the top of your shoulder that's fuckin hard yeah yeah you know it's not the ideal thing to strike with but when there's nothing else there there's something there yeah it's I could see how Steven Smith would not think that that was effective I could see but for me it was clearly effective there were hard shots there's a lot of power behind it there's a lot of explosion Conor dipping his level and coming up and slamming into it it was correct kind of crazy but even if you take that away the head kick and the punches to finish I mean yeah it's quick there he's not quit he got beat down he got beat down smashed by a guy who rises to the occasion the Cowboys had problems in the past with these really big fights and yeah he looked nervous as fuck and he talks about it openly there was a video that they play which I don't think they should have played before the fight because he you had to hear that so they're playing a video of him describing how nervous he gets before fights and how he throws up on stun and also about how he's kind of faking it lieutenant like he's fine but he's not inside I'm freaking the fuck out they played that before he fought I'm like why think about even more yes that's what I was thinking I was saying fuck he does not need to hear this that's why I'm in the locker room when I'm in the locker room and the TV's on I'm always like turn that volume down I don't wanna hear anybody talking about my fight turn that shit down good for you I mean I'm cognizant to that when I see a guy in the locker room and I'm talking and I try to pop him up yeah I want them to feel good yeah show up yeah well when you come out man that biggie song yeah that's uh there's something about some fighters and songs you know this like there's a connection to those guys that every time I hear that song I think about you yeah man always I started 2009 when a fourth shark it was the first time run out to it and I was like man the most shady Frankie baby no this is it big E's probably my he's if he's not my all-time he's like top three it's like not my all time but he's right up there yeah I think biggie might be my guy - I seventh grade I got that ready to die cassette tape and listen to this okay I listened to till I couldn't listen to it no more yeah well I was on Newsradio oh I was doing a sitcom and I remember I listened to that fuckin hypnotized song like ten times in a row oh yeah I was like god damn that's a good song yeah he's his flow was so entertaining he was he tells story better anybody oh man he was special dude he's a special dude did the the feud between him and Tupac the fact that both of those guys got murdered was crazy right mocked man yeah oh god how good would they have been as they got older - no biggie Oh epochal he had thousands of CDs mixtapes you know come out after his death but they only had two albums really you know they didn't have much much material isn't that crazy that Park puts so much shit down yeah man he was uh he was like an activist too you know so his everything was kind of politically charged and everything well he was unbelievably prolific yeah like he wrote so much he like after he was dead they released like five hours yes that was crazy loose stuff yeah where is all this shit from I remember then they did the whole erasing cube of recording that's I remember they had the hologram was it good yeah yeah right that was so creepy I was like what is the future gonna be like we're gonna see chance job went up there saying yeah you know like legitimately they're gonna be able to do that in the future that's true they're probably gonna be able to write new Janis Joplin songs and have her singing in a hologram and you won't even be able to tell it's not really her they just put I just listening to the radio yesterday a Chester Bennington from Linkin Park his first band he was doing he was like 18 they had recordings of him that they just put new music to and re-released the music oh wow by grey days or no gray or something like that I heard it I didn't listen to it myself but I heard it's not bad that's up he was yeah I know that was a bummer a lot of these guys they I don't know just like a lot of artists seem like they're conflicted in some ways it's one of the reasons why that's so good yeah I couldn't Chester would sing hymns like he was wailing they're like screaming you know there was something about his his that the angst and the anger and the energy and the emotions and the voice that was why he was so good and you know sometimes I like Linkin Park he just listening cuz they jam and then you start listening some of the words like man this guy was gone for a while yeah he was going through some shit for sure yeah it's just it's so hard to believe when someone like Chris Cornell or someone like him takes their own life like they were good they were good friends right I believe so yeah one of them didn't he kill himself on his birthday or something like that I think so something sad like that but again two guys with us insane voices means Soundgarden god damn he was good and definitely yeah oh damn but it's like it's almost like those guys that have that insane and women too that have that insane emotion in their voice like they're just so they're so torn and dry afflicted yeah yeah that's what I mean pour it out you could see it here dinner and their voice their hearts pouring out I think that's what it is yeah yeah yeah it's um it's a bummer it's a bummer but the Tupac they don't do that anymore right that fucking hologram the Tupac hologram was built like Marlon a little bit yeah yeah it was way more Jack the Tupac ever was like this Tupac been doing fucking CrossFit yeah it's been doing f45 for the last five years while he's in hiding yeah again after it yeah there's a lot of guys that yeah there it is like look how there's like Wiz Khalifa looks now yeah with Khalid yeah there's a good video the other day with Khalifa hit in the back like oh my god damn Wiz Khalifa Wiz Khalifa's got good technique hey he does he like doesn't eat I try fights or he doesn't yeah yeah he's doing a lot of more time but he's got crazy ABS man the two is fucking jacked he is no fat on them any smokes weed all day my guy all day is weed legal in New Jersey now how's it work Medical is yeah you have to have like a real problem right no I just have headaches can you have had anxiety cough yeah I get that yeah right there's weeds cleaver yeah yeah he trains hard man yeah that's cool it's always going these guys do do this stuff brings light to our sport yeah snoop trains too yeah yeah yeah there's there's some videos of snoop training and sparring online it's awesome I love it I love it I mean it's just great for you too even if you don't ever plan on fighting its to me I mean you know I'd rather hit pads and kick a bag and run on a fucking treadmill man oh it's so much more entertaining these people people realize that they would do to like it a lot more to do you run it all I do run I like to run I but I don't run for my camps or anything I work I enjoy running well you known for your endurance you know and when you when you would train how much of you did you do any cardio specific workouts or was most your cardio done through fight training I mean I did my strength conditioning stuff would be a little cardio base you know just like circuit training and stuff I actually started working with new strength conditioning guy young kid may is 24 but super passionate really into into how do you find someone like that you know I just actually Todd Frazier who's actually on my podcast we just dropped released the episode today using for the Tramp champion to track he he's a pressed McMissile player from my town and I asked him where he was doing his offseason training and you know what this guy this guy does RP give your RP are reflexive performance recovery or something the reset performance recovery was that he does like these certain things that just reset your nervous system I guess like I'll bang on your back banks on your back bring your back and then you do a test and like you're you're you're you're stronger anyway yeah it's our PR reflect is that real yeah every time once I'm not a voodoo guy and yeah but he you know has one where you shop tit that my inner thighs I'll go up and down like four times and then he'll do some more tests that help make me go like a beat like a sit-up position and he'll try to push me down flat before I did the test I pretty much couldn't stop and then I did the test him was put his body on me and I could hold them up really I donno if it's mental but I always feel I feel good I'll come in and I'll come in the training and I'm like and I'm you know I feel a little shoddy and he puts me through these tests and some hurt like sometimes he goes up and down your sternum on your ribs and like it's supposed to make you feel uncomfortable and you're supposed to relax and kind of wakes me up gets me going hmm and the idea is that it jumps your reflexes up yeah I mean again dummy but yeah I don't know it either I I know for sure that like deep tissue work does a lot right deep tissue massage the way he explained it to is like I couldn't do it to myself like what one of them where he kind of goes and he hits up my IT ban on my left mama inside and outside of my thigh and it hurts to the point where I'm like I'm like they're almost riding in pain you know I'm trying to relax and do it but you can't do it to yourself like he says you can't tickle yourself because you know the pressure you're giving yourself but some of us get icky so someone else that do this to you it isn't tickling like do you don't have control like cuz like I can do the same pressure that someone would tickle me but it's but you do but you know the pressure you're giving yourself that's what was explained to me okay so like don't know what the pressure they're given to you and I think that does some of your nervous system what do you think tickling is from do you think it's from like evolving to get away from bugs like you see so you feel something Manya yeah yeah then that make sense yeah I got spiders on you or some shit yeah yeah I'm yeah I think everything has to go back to that stuff has to or why do you hold your breath when you're when you're like nervous or you know like you gotta breathe breathe like hold your breath bike is like you're in the middle of the woods and something fucking hunting you're like you don't make any noise maybe or maybe just your body's just panicking because so much pressure you know you know so much adrenaline so much freaking out your body just tenses up yeah that's a thing about fighting right we're guys when they're swinging in a big like big exchanges they don't they don't breathe and they get tired right yeah yeah like you know I don't know you have those coaches that are like okay guys breathe Coates tell me to breathe in the corner no I'm like no if I know how to breathe here right well does that drive you crazy when you hear corners that don't give good advice at all finish them yeah thanks get up man get up no shit go out there and kick his ass yeah that's why I was lucky to have you know guys that pay attention to detail like Martin Ricardo minute guys are uh top-notch technical yeah cool they're not giving you that you know sometimes you do you need to take some time some guys I think mark got some flack for the Marlin fight where he was in the corner he's like your mother raised you but you know and some was like why is he talking about his mom's because he knew he didn't need technique he needed some motivation at that point was Marlon too big did he lose too much weight to get down to 35 and was he depleted or was it so who'd oh just steamrolled him I just think the moment you know I think Marlon hit him with some good shots and mm-hmm he hit him with some good shots I hate cake the right hand yeah and I think the fact that pseudo just took and kept coming forward I think kind of just demoralized Marlon a little bit like why in my eyes pseudo was not going to be able to take much more of the legs oh yeah no way I thought I I for sure in that first round I'm like this fights not knowing the distance yeah I thought Marlon was going to keep chopping at the legs but Marlon let's - whoo - close the distance and once he lets the huto close the distance and get a hold of him started hitting with knees and I was like oh Jesus Christ yeah yeah so who doesn't even like I mean Marlon it was in that Thai clinch - I mean dude Marlon knows how to deal with a clinch yeah and he just wasn't even reacting to it because I kind of let him hit him with the knees I felt like home all sits like I felt like he was just depleted its it seemed like he didn't have the energy to fight the kind of fight that pseudo is well on the fun especially so huto at 35 right so who - at 25 he's draining himself a little bit but - who - at 35 was much healthier yeah and just fucking guys just tough as shit man he has a winner's behinds away fans I mean he's got a winners mind you know and his the videos that he makes a pretty ridiculous super ripple seed come on bend the knee I mean I guess that's you know everybody's gotta have a stick now you know I guess they do because it keeps them out there it's it's just it's weird cuz this sport is part of that right it's like part there's it's part promotion but it's also performance it's like guys like Connor or the perfect blend yeah like he's just just beat him himself but Connors like it's entertaining it's funny some of these other guys man it's just a forced and it's rough but look like Colby Covington Colby Covington shit talked his way to a goddamn title show yeah he really did in the end yes long he's ass but he's also very good very good you can't not be good you have song it was a feeling took they wanted to cut him before he fought in Brazil do you know that yeah it was the last fight on his contract he's going over there to fight Demian Maia and he just talked mad shit he's gonna get them on tracked him he's like yeah that was what that's what did it I mean that's literally what did it and then that character just took off you go and look at the early versions of that character he had nice suits like he had a like a real crisp suit like Connor would wear but then later he's got these it's like it's part of the fun of it yeah he's he's wearing bullshit he's a madman to a character rock man he he fucking figured it out well how about Connor he's kind of made a little 180 type flip on his person he's still funny still you know mouthy and stuff please not be and he seems like he's trying to clean his image up a little bit you think with cowboy you think that's it maybe his cowboy cap was kind of easy to get along with and whatnot or my it's just that he's been dealing with so much you know would the could be fight he's like you know you've got a that proper 12 he's got a total line a little bit yes right I mean you know I think proper 12 is an enormous amount of money for him I mean he's making shit tons of money I was in Vegas that fucking those billboards were everywhere yeah on cars and shit no these he was sponsoring the Bellator cage - was he yeah good for him I yeah I wonder but I also think I don't think he felt like he needs psychological warfare with with cowboy I feel like he thought from the beginning that he had a giant advantage over cowboy yeah you know like if you go back to an old press conference were talking back and shit to each other he's like you're stiff as a board right fucking break in half I think he just felt like this fight look I could just be a nice guy with this guy all right but with khabib I think he felt like he had a fuck with them I feel like he felt that he had to get khabib emotional the same way he got although emotional but that shit didn't work that motherfucker's uh he's a vault he look in his eyes you just see nothing but doom yeah he's he's uh it's just those people over there that's they call it the step where they're from right at the step that words would be considered the step well Mongolia is a step right okay isn't that close to Tara's I'm not doing I don't know is it the hard part of the world though yeah no that was did you see when he won when the fucking they have a video the streets the stones and everybody lights on their cars honking their horns fucking screaming out the window yeah dude shoot machine guns up here yeah yeah he's he's a fucking terror man and I am so interested in this fight coming up with him and Tony Ferguson I am so interested in that fight that's a crazy fight whoo that fight is everything to me that fight I don't know how Dana White is doing these press conferences talking about matching up Connor and could be yeah I'm like hey hey we got our hands a boogie man because the boogie man is right now a big bear fucking doing kicks on trees and shit Wing Chun dummy and Rock says he doesn't build his own gym yes builds his own gym he does any Bravo to him about it cuz he does his camps like he up some lose jujitsu right he he talks him through it Eddie Bravo will talk you through it rather he goes up there he'll he'll get a house up there like rent a house or he has a place I don't know which was but then he builds everything he builds the racks for the bags he builds the fucking he mats the rooms he does everything himself he is a unique human being yeah and you want to talk about cardio that guy is the freak of all freaks because he never even seems a little tired not at all and keeps coming forward keeps coming forward never seems even a little tired and everyone he fights looks like they got they got mauled by a leopard right everyone's face is hanging off like look at this shit that he does headstands and stuff in the breakdancing right yeah but he's always doing this kind of shit like weird kind of exercise look at this just standing only on his head that's a good way to blow your discs out yeah that's how you get stenosis okay this shit he does but that's every kind of training were and like no one's telling him what to do either no he does on his own you like guys who've gone to camp with him say it's like okay today we're gonna ride hills like he just decides yeah like what we're gonna different kind of different dude yeah well and Eddie told me that his cardio is fuckin ridiculous like they'll be doing these hill sprints and he'll do these hill sprints with his other training partners and he's lapping them he runs all the way up and all the way down and then although and then passes them as they're still up the first time yeah he's a freak yeah that's interesting fight it's our fucking great fights that's why I don't understand what Dana is not like considering the fact that Tony Ferguson would win that fight what is he you think he's implying that khabees already got this one they're talking about kabhi versus Connor because look that's the money yeah yeah Jim changes but from what I hear could could be won't won't won't fight him he said he fight it for 100 million dollars that's what he said yeah he's gonna fight him I think his dad said that his dad said you know that he'll fight Connor for the same amount of money the Conor made fight in Floyd Wow but I don't know if you could get a hundred million dollars in the UFC do you think that flight def fight Conor could be will be big a big problem is Dana same thing he's big as could be bara Conor Floyd that was a pretty big fight yeah Floyd brings a different thing to the table right Floyd brings all the hardcore behind fans and the fact is polarizing yeah and he's the best boxer of all time I mean you you stop and think about the amount of times that guy's been hit over a period of 50 fights it's insane yeah his defensive skills and his ability to size up an opponent and figure out what the guys doing and then start to break him down systematically best there is he's the best he's the best he's like there's been guys that have been incredible and they're they're like up in his level all you know like all-time great fighters but in terms of not getting hit I don't think anybody's been as good as Floyd yeah that's agree so to have Connor go in there and fight him a guy who's never had a professional boxing match but it's fucking up everybody in MMA and all these people think he has a chance and there's all this hype behind it all his craziness and the fact that it was this sort of crossover fight yeah it had a lot of time ever yeah well basically I don't think James Toney even trained MMA for that Wow I was on that card that's not for PJ second time oh really that's right that's right yeah as soon as Randy ankle picked him I was like oh you had that fucking animal on top of you Randy KOTOR in his prime or yeah I looked up to Randy big time coming up you know what a great guy he is he is I still seen us run into him nowadays he's a super solid guy he was so calm when he got into the cage it was so crazy like I mean he was like the firt one of the first guys ever like he's getting ready to fight they're ready to announce when he looks over at me and just links and gives me a big smile Mike this guy all relaxed and shit is saying hi to people he loved it loved competing loved being in there man and didn't even start fighting to lose in the third yeah yeah he's just wrestling I was a that's why I was able to fight so long - yeah yeah maybe yeah maybe yeah it's um it's kind of crazy when you think about his career too you know light heavyweight champ heavyweight champ came back and won yeah Pete Sylvia that was crazy when he dropped Sylvia with that right hand like what the fuck I was worried about him in that fight I was like you think about like guys like chocolate hell knocking him out what is Tim Sylvia giving he's enormous you know on Tim Sylvia back when there was no testing him Sylvia fought Rico Rodriguez people forget Tim Sylvia was not like this doughy guy back then you know like when he when he fought you remember that fight we fought Rico yeah yeah that's scary Tim Sylvia oh yeah he had a back like a fucking brick wall he was huge and he had a cut weight to make 265 I remember he had to come back to the scale like he missed it the first time that was back in the old days huh yeah so Rico mcgerr when I was wrestling in my junior senior year high school so was like 98 99 our manager on a team said her brother fought in the UFC I'm like this one you know yes she wasn't as popular I'm like get out here he brought her for the old city and it was Rico Rodriguez and her stepbrother and I ran into him one things like I used to date my sister back in the day I'm like a little bit Rico Rodriguez is a bad motherfucker yeah he was one the first real high-level jujitsu guys Nazis around Jersey law what's he doing these days he was coaching you know Jamal Patterson he's when I was blackballed oh yeah oh no chef coach him wrestling or dodge yeah yeah yeah Rico was a beast man and you know that guy fought a giant chunk of his career with a blown out ACL oh really I had no ACL he just like rehabbed his knees I rehabbed his legs like built up his monsters gone strong yeah yeah like I think they say your hamstring is like a big part of it like if you strengthen your hamstring up but most people can't do it like most people when the ACL is blown out like they they can't they can't compete right yeah Rico Rico could I swab supposedly dos Anjos has a blown-out ACL oh it does he know supposedly he's been fighting it yeah yeah that's what I heard I need to talk to him yeah find out that's a fact my knees always been always been good yeah thank God never any problems none I mean I've had LCL tears MCL tears but never surgery or anything real meniscus surgery nothing no wow man that's rare right everybody's knees are fucked up there was ice layer Russell never worn knee pads in my life yeah really what if that's why no no can't be but uh like you know Bisping just got his knee completely replace yeah that was scary I was like god damn he's only like 40 yeah and don't the only last ten years yep I think sorry we've tried it stem cells first that day or is it maybe I don't know has to point it out I don't know I mean they wanted to do that to my mom they wanted to give my mom knee replacement but I sent her down to Panama and she's fine now yeah dude crazy it took 8 months I was really worried that it wasn't working because like I talked to her you know afterwards and I talked to her up to like 6 months she wasn't feeling anything different and then she started to feel better and then like 8 months later the pain went away it was gone that's amazing yeah and then I sent her back again and then the second round she's doing but here's what's weird when I saw her for Christmas she looked younger really yeah I was like you look great they just inject the stem cells in the knee or did they put them in both knees and they also did IV and they do it for three days so you just get Biraj down yeah they just fill you up and then you walk out of there like oh I wonder if that stuff helps Lyme disease I bet it would yeah they say it has to go through brain barrier some right mmm I don't know the blood-brain barrier yeah well I mean it's they inject the stem cells intravenously you have to talk to doctor Riordan yeah he'll he'd probably be able to explain it but I mean I think anything that boosts your immune system and helps your overall body and the idea of doing it intravenously is that your body knows where to utilize it your body knows areas that are troubled it's weird that your body has some strange innate intelligence to know who knows we need to yeah it knows where the injuries are like how is that working and knows what's wrong with your brain like how's that working yeah as long like with it yeah what is it doing tracks I guess it attracts it right yeah actually where it needs to be yeah I'm really excited about the future that ship because I think you know I talked to dr. Jeff Davidson from the UFC and he just got back from you know dr. Jeff yeah yeah he's awesome he's great he's the one who got me into stem cells in the first place he's the one with the one in my shoulder me too did you do dr. rowdy McGee or did you no I did do riding McGee way back at times the first time stem cells was in my groin hey yeah but I give it's worn muscle some I like a sports hernia oh wow I had seam surgery Susman had oh really yeah yeah damn same wheel it's the same guy - it's got dr. Marrs he actually invented the surgery if you call it a sports hernia he gets mad yeah because it's not a sports hernia it's a core most injury mmm well what is it how does it work I think they cut my tendons in my thighs and also in my abs caught him completely off and then resold him together whoa it was painful but for a one-week super painful well maybe two weeks super painful but literally six weeks later I was kicking a heavy bang really yeah it's amazing you do physical therapy the day you get out the next day I'm a physical therapy Wow yeah and it was bad like I had this I probably I was dealing with it for like two like two years it would come and go get flamed up or I could even COFF down there or I couldn't you know it was pretty bad more than one time I went to get finally get checked out and get the MRI I went to the doctor by myself drove up to the city and came home I didn't eat anything like I mean I had to park my car walked at a damn doctor and was like you know couple blocks in the city took me forever to walk anymore so I didn't stop and eat I just kinda come home I parked my car and I called my wife like you gotta help me get out a car I can't I can't get a car so I get a car I'm walking I literally passed out walls walking whoa she caught me I had to crawl into my house hold on to my house shit I was like damn so I got that surgery and it was the best thing I probably the best surgery I've had that's crazy that it was that bad so so painful so pain was probably cuz I what didn't eat that's my passed out all that stuff but yeah that was that was rough well I hear about a guy like you passing out I'm like okay that's the first time so they detach the tendons yeah the ligaments does attendants must be tendons must be tendons yeah they cut the ones here like up my thigh and then I guess like you have it connects on three points like by your leg so what was wrong though it was tearing it was like playing like it was pulling each side was pulling the other side so I was getting tears everywhere and so when they do that they cinch it down again and then how does it better six weeks later then that next day I go there and I start doing like the foot foot exercises they put the bands on I'm doing all that stuff and I guess they just just strengthens up Wow that but it's crazy that six weeks later I would say that's not a lot of healing yeah six weeks later and he told you you'd be good to go six weeks later yeah so how quickly after that could you have fought I fought that may I for that surgery in January I fought that May the first time Oman came in here he had a bag on his waist that was draining he had a hook like yeah yeah he had both sides I only had one side I thought yeah I was like what the fuck is that like he took him a long time to recover after the the do Mike Mike downstairs was all jacked up my balls were so fucking bitch really oh my god he's well up huge do take pictures of course right like how many balls are it'll yeah yes there's a hockey player Sidney Crosby remember I told you he recently got this surgery and Odell Beckham a popular and fell receiver just got this last week a doctor in Philadelphia dr. Meyers does everybody imagine one dude specializing the guy's not even like a surgeon I think it's kind of crazy what he's not like a he's a kid he's not a surgeon for like orthopedist orthopedic doctor he created this surgery though that must be a surgeon athletic pole Bridget does that son right sit again athletic poopoo bald yeah why do you sit why don't happen when they invent a name why invent that name why of why football pool ball what does it mean what does pool ball game mean Ryan disruption ah also known as growing deception yes sportsman's hernia but he told me is like it's not a sports hernia persistent groin pain during exercise where there's no evidence of clinically detectable hernia athletic pou ball gaya is not a true hernia but it's considered an overuse injury which the external oblique muscles and surrounding tendons and/or traverse abdominis or internal oblique muscles are worn down or partially torn so this is proc a conservative treatment consists of Rath medications or physical therapy of conservative treatment fails surgical treatment maybe could suggest that as an alternative the procedure may be performed using a laparoscopic or open anterior approach polypropylene or polyester mess is suggested mesh is suggested to correct the identified abnormality however there's no data from randomized studies to confirm effectiveness of this surgery well let's hope some doctors just figure something out yeah yeah he's killing it - I mean vert you know I don't know bunch athletes but there's a bunch of famous athletes that I went to that guy it's crazy that I didn't know that that was a persistent injury and then all these guys have it yeah I've never even heard of that before yeah I mean I didn't know what it was until it happened again that's probably one of those things are being too tough for your own good right like I just kept pushing through just almost before I got that I got an epidural in there that was crazy literally they go through private by my pubes and that way oh Jesus it was like six inches long I'm I'm in the doctor's office I got my jokes practically out you know and he's putting this thing in I'm like done and also he puts the medicine in when he put the medicine in that's when it flared up I'm screaming fuck take it out take it out he's like that only lasted for like a couple months and then he came back so epidural just kind of numbs it right yeah it does I've had several on my back have you yeah I back surgery was 18 actually you did yeah what kind just Dec t'me oh so a little bit of a miniscule ittle bit of the whole stiff yeah yeah they cut it out but pretty good it does work good but there's ways around that yeah certain names for each Tina Pasha I was 18 year old no actually a lot of people that I had it in my neck and they were talking about me doing that but for Jana Kane cured it yeah they were talking about doing it like I went to one doctor and he was like you probably gonna have to get the disc trimmed that was eight years ago yeah what's there was a 20 now maybe yeah yeah at least at least let's say at least five years ago six years ago it is I've no pain in my neck now you know another thing though that iron neck I fucking love that yes I've been seen I see people using that I got around out here you wanna try it yeah yeah dude it's the shit it's the shit you put that thing it is the single best thing I've ever used for developing neck muscles and for jiu-jitsu and wrestling it's fantastic too because it's attached to a bungee cord right right so the bungee cord is a 50 pound cord and you put this halo on and then you pump it up like a Reebok Pump no lumps and you pump it up but it gets tight to your head and then you can control the amount of resistance when you turn right because this it's it's actually got resistance when you turn so you pull back so your neck is holding this 50-pound cord back this way and then you're doing this yeah I've seen some I know I've seen someone had that attached like you know a gym equipment yes and then their shadow box oh yeah well the idea is it's like your your neck is constantly resisting this like when dudes are trying to snap you down pull your neck down or you try to posture out of triangles and shit I like when do you ever work out your neck in that way yeah and most people when they work out their neck they put on them harnesses on which is you know does something but a lot of doctors will tell you that that's not a normal action for your neck to be lifting weights with and you could do some damage to your I don't know if they're right or right no I don't know but I know the iron neck you don't have to do any of that shit you so you it's basically just the muscles in your neck and you're not making your neck hold weight at a weird angle like this way it's just straight your neck is always straight and it's turning it's just the muscles are getting exercise and everything gets stronger I know Corey's into it yeah yeah your core you understand about yeah yeah I'm just wondering if it's good if you're tight you know if your neck is bad well according to them they've had people that had neck injuries they rehabilitated it with that because it strengthens all the areas so I say if this is just me talking but if you have an area where you have an injury and it keeps getting hurt if you strengthen all that area around that it's not going to be as mobile right so you're gonna have more control and it's probably gonna protect it more that just make sense yeah but I'm a big fan of that product that's I love once and that was a football player that figured that I really yeah was the gentleman's name the figure the guy who came and he gave me a bunch of demonstrations and shit but it's great for football players as well and they and his idea was that it was also going to help prolong people's careers because it prevent more concussions because you're not just you have your neck and you're not gonna get your head snapped as easy you're gonna be able to withstand much more impact you know it's they fight it's it's so interesting that all these people that are involved in athletic equipment they figure these things out like what woody how do we strengthen a core better how do we turn through the neck better how do we do this how do we do that you know glad there's people smarter than me out there well you can't be you can't be on top of everything Mike Charlie say his last name McCauley Mike Jolly that didn't sound like you said that the first yeah okay yeah anyway Mike explained the whole thing it's it's a very impressive piece of equipment I love it yeah I mean oh that's the first high / - I got all of that that's great yeah that thing's the shit yeah I want to get a belt squat belts quavered belts we don't have one but we saw that when we were there they want they offered it to us the West Side barbell yeah yeah come down put it in here we'll help you get it sorry cuz yeah a lot of load on your body without havin to load your back yes yeah without fucking your back up yeah and guys do shadow boxing and shit with that yeah see now yeah and I'm like oh really increase your ability to punch and to push off of stuff never use the it's like a wheel needs like centrifugal force Mel upon it it makes it uh shit a wheel it's like a wheel that wraps around so you could do lifts and the more the quicker you go up the faster it pulls you down hmm I feel like they had that too didn't they have that at Westside barbell he's got all kinds of crazy shit down there that guy Louie Simmons he's a mad genius psychopath yeah yeah I've watched I'm head of stuff he seems a nut he's nuts and having him like show me all of his stuff and like God we did a podcast with him right right I remember I let's do it yeah it's pretty cool yeah his place yeah yeah yeah sitting across from him at his desk he told me that he got his shoulder replaced and then the day got back to the gym they made him max out bench press I was like what the fuck man I think they told me to do it I do it and he's like talking steroids a bad for you directions 260 yeah they never get off that's the thing yeah you can't no but I mean everything is on there who was telling us this was it Rob Tierney was telling us this that he he had his bicep replaced his bicep tendon because his bicep tendon blew out and so he had his arm in a sling and he lasted like a week and he got tired of it and just straighten his arm out and popped it off so he could lift again what yeah so it was both of his biceps oh there's me yeah Mike stupid fucking paper boy hat that's a cool machine man yeah very cool there's Louie yeah he's got I mean everything what is that thing different - yeah oh that what does that thing do I morph right foot ball players I guess but he was showing it's like it's a belt squat I think oh no it's like a thing you hit yeah I think you have to have yeah oh okay so you put the belt squat on and then you hit that thing right hmm yeah well those guys man that Westside barbell a bunch of fucking animals down there yeah he's like the trains like the world's strongest people right yeah yeah there there was a bunch of freaks like that dude it was in there working out while we were there super strong human beings yeah again I'm happy the people out there that are smart they could figure those things out like Louie Simmons invented that reverse hyper because they told him that he needed to get his disc fused right yeah he's like oh do I really hold my beer yeah figured out like the best way to decompress your lower back and to strengthen that area it's that machine's yeah it's great sometimes I feel like I wait till my back hurts to use it that's my way to me too I tried to do it twice a week I try to get in here twice a week and just do a few sets and I kind of make it a little more consistent with that because it strengthens your lower back in a real weird way that's hard to reach any other way it is and I like how it gives you the traction - yes the like yeah it gives you traction but it gives you like what do they call it active traction right so it's like decompressing active decompression yeah it's awesome man I love it I love those teetered things to hang by your ankles like you know give your first inversion yeah them too I got the inverted table which is great with hanging by your ankles but then I got another one what's the other one called the Dex the Dex that's my favorite where you hang by your waist hmm it's just just from your waist I feel like when you hang by your ankles it's great but it's like the weight is going from your ankles and your knees yes yeah by the time you get to your back and how much compression you're not yeah it definitely is not again but I think the Dex really targets the lower back amazing I see people have the ones that lay down and then they attach that on and pull them apart yeah I haven't done that one that's the Dex the Dex decompression one I fucking love that thing so you grab a hole those handles and then you let go and then you're you just drop down and it's all the weight is like decompressing your lower back and you could do like yeah you could do back extension more yeah yeah I think that's what they're called yeah you could do those on it too I mean you could definitely get a workout on if you wanted to but for me I used that after I'm done working out just to just I feel like if I'm real consistent with that with that and the inversion deck in the reverse hyper I keep my back healthy yeah yeah I got I got a I go to a therapist get stretched out like once or twice a week and I do a a a RT back to all these therapy oh yeah that's great yeah now when you like when you see like there's different schools that thought when it comes to strength and conditioning and the more radical Stern school of thought was the Marberry Novick sort of a school of thought which you see Nickerson does with who's doing with how fail dos Santos and a lot of guys where you concentrate almost entirely on strength conditioning and the idea is like you already know how to fight like you know how to fight and the real thing that fucks with guys when they're fighting is their conditioning and so they're putting these guys through these radical plyometric and explosive exercises and then just like push and that comes first that is more important than anything and that's when BJ was at its best if you go back to like BJ we fought Sean Sherk right BJ when he fought Diego Sanchez he was training with Marv yeah I'm I think I'm on the opposite side of that I mean I conditions never been an issue for me maybe that's why I have this take I feel like I want to feel good on smaran days those are the most important days I need I need to feel good mm-hmm so I feel like sometimes you spend you put yourself out straining condition you come to spar the next day you're not gonna have a good performance that day yeah I could see both ways of thing I could see both i meanthe I think there are probably some guys that maybe that are afraid to get himself tired that you got to make them get like he's not gonna push themselves that much when they're smart if they're scared you're tired but you could push them hard as hell when they're not worrying about getting punched or worried about winning anything that's good thing about strain condition you can really push yourself without hopefully getting hurt as well I think a lot of strain condition people that they they just want to put the cool videos up and right so you know put the chains on and do this and flip the tire I just want to keep it simple man I want to I I heard someone say you want to leave a stri the condition working out feeling better not worse yeah yeah that's that's like the pavol taught saline idea you know that you you you don't ever go to failure yeah and those kind of things you're just trying to strengthen things all right yeah it's it's interesting because the sport is so new fairly new that there's all these different schools of thought about the right way to do it and you really don't know and so while you're going through your camp you got to go wow hope this guy's right yeah you know and well there's definitely a right way in a wrong way but there's also your way in my way and they could both be right yeah right yeah but I mean some guys like long slow running sessions some guys like hill sprints some guys like mostly plyometrics and organized you know Tabata drills and rest like that for strengthen conditioning and then these guys like Nick Diaz just like doing triathlons and check it out yeah I but this new guy and whit it's like much more detail my last time condition guy was great you know never not she so but he was just kind of just go and we just just work out this guy everything's planned out way ahead Wade what I'm doing so what kind of stuff is he doing all different types of modalities I guess you know he kind of switches it up I do the UM it's another thing to a lot of its breathing stuff for warm-ups and whatnot I can't remember the name of it it was along with that our PR stuff I was talking about but yeah it's a lot of it's breathing before and after and hold breath holes I've been doing a lot of that stuff and also it's like lung conditions yeah long conditioning for to warm up and cool down too yeah breathing exercises are very underrated you know like if you look at like what Hicks and Gracie used to be able to do they're kind of like fire-breathing yeah yeah you know like you can literally strengthen your lungs there was this dude that I used to do yoga with his name is yoga Rey and that wasn't his full name who's a lead singer in a band I forget the band I'm trying to remember right now god damn it anyway we always just called him yoga Rey but he had amazing cardio and he had amazing cardio specifically because of his breathing exercises like he didn't do cardio he's just doing yoga and Jiu Jitsu but it see guys never get tired yeah because he would do all these like radical breathing exercises so his lungs were like a strong muscle yeah that's that's what days guy always work your diaphragm mm-hmm yeah so what other kind of exercises have you do that's different like what him I he's really pay attention my body position and stuff like I cuz my back is bad I try to stay away from deadlifts and this and that but since I've been with this guy I've been able to do all that stuff really yeah yeah just because of making sure you have better technique technique you know the key oh he says you get if you want to feel your abs in your hamstring if you feel your abs and your hamstrings and all your workouts your back poly safe so he's oh he's he's always touching me making sure out make sure he's a fire make sure he's a fire and you know and socially your abs are firing in our hope like say I'm doing a bench or something he'll put like a towel underneath my back and like I'm trying to pull it out make sure you keep it pressed pressed on the floor so I can pull it out that's protecting your back so he's just like really cautious and just knows a lot about exercise and so you go to him on you say a couple days a week two days a week yeah do you do any like cryotherapy or ice baths and that I know I've done cryotherapy a couple times I just don't have somewhere super close to me I feel like you've want to do it you got to be you got to do it almost at least three times a week yeah I think once a week is not enough really the benefits of it yeah it's uh it's fucking awesome I'll tell you that I love doing it I would I would suggest anybody that if you can get into one of those things do it do it whenever you can yeah apparently ice baths really good too ice baths like ten years ago and my dick hurt for like a half hour after that sound like yeah I'm good that's hilarious what about sauna yeah I did a sauna I love the sauna I don't have one in my house my wife has like a little teepee sauna it's like a red light one you can go in and your head sticks out is that good you lay down it's not bad it's not hot enough I feel like Scott have you got my wife's entity the red light one as opposed to the heat one right to me I think you got a software free really get the benefits I think so too yeah I mean I don't know about infrared sauna because I've never really done that but Laird Hamilton was saying that he had some skin issues that he got from infrared yeah but he does some wacky shit man like that guy puts an air assault bike inside of a sauna and then puts oven mitts on and because I do hot yeah and he's sprinting in there like Jesus bro yeah yeah it's not yeah that's a freak he's a real freak we have the Russian Russian banya kind of bought it you know in Jersey they have like just 200 degrees sauna in there she's crazy 200 degrees feels like it ELISA and then they beat us dicks yeah I did that too one time yeah and I was left on my Russian buddy so they were talking on for me and everything they're like I would give them the real treatment and do you go in the cold right after they do because that's what they do right they jump in the water cold water back home I did I did it all I did like they got some more value F who should be in the UFC he's not so Dana get this guy some more in he what weight loss he's a 35 er he's tough man he's uh he was wsof guy very good only has one loss and he avenged his loss but um he's been trained with us for a long time world series of fighting is what professional fighting league oh yeah AFL yeah yeah no that's what Rory is now huh why McDonald went over there yeah that's interesting it's actually gonna come on here with Eve Edwards I'm gonna talk about it that should be fun yeah he's uh he was that belt all right and then he was a belt or lost his title or excuse me lost a fight to gag our Mousasi and then lost - all right yeah Douglas Lima beat him in the rematch lost his title there beat Lima he had some good fights over there you know but I think he just got a big offer from the PFL they're looking for a big name yeah they're giving away a lot of fucking money I don't know how long they could do that for right a million dollars for people who win like if you win tournament was like seven people won their last end you know how do they do that yeah that's a lot of money it's Kevin Hart behind it busy yeah he's an investor Kevin Hart is yeah pretty sure Kevin Hart invested everything a guy is he's such a genius in terms of like hey this dude he is I don't know how he sleeps I know what we're how you sleep though either hi my hard work is an illusion I don't know man you but you're like you're into so many things you know yeah like I feel like damn Oh time for shit I do a lot of stuff but it's not hard like this is not hard this is fun like stand-up not hard it's hard if you suck it's hard whew bombing it's harder preparation no no yeah there's some preparation but it's not working in a fucking sand mine yeah well yeah it's not it's not that it's not real hard work as far as hard as in like laboring but it's still time-consuming it's time-consuming but it's fun the hard part is like the discipline things like forcing yourself to write that's hard forcing yourself to go to the gym that's that's the discipline in most things in life is hard once you're there doing it it's mostly fun yeah like people who kind of exaggerate the difficulty of a lot of things you know I just you know you're into bowhunting you're him I I want to get up I don't have any hobbies find Jim Miller he'll take yeah well Cory Cory oh that's right that's why I got a boy that guy's constantly hunting yeah gets up works out goes to the hunt does back works out again when he came here he brought his bow no
