the girag an experience yeah and he's like like a scientist should have died after the appendicitis this is one of the week I just it's just no way he's like one of the rare guys took three Jitsu classes I tapped out for good I'm out I'm out you should cut elbows hurt come come on me tonight man look I know I'm not a man with love don't need to go down there and have it reinforced all you guys could just be fresh your size it'll calm you down make you feel better dude I'm like the comest I've been in my life I'm always gonna sound like I'm in a bad mood because I have the East Coast accent right look dude you're fuckin phony calm down you're like you're you you smoke weed no I come down from exercise to really doesn't necessarily calm me down as it does make me a little more sensitive red van you buying this I think weed calmed me down uh yeah dude you are a completely different person like when I met you in in like 96 97 you a good guy but you were the most intense fucking dudes I never liked this switch somewhere in your life was flipped and the shit was on I don't even know how you slept you were like you were like fucking goal line defense middle line bag that shit doesn't mean anything to you I'm using sports analogies like you were fucking intense dude and I'm a story I heard about you at Taekwondo vents I believed all of it after meeting you for like literally about 25 seconds well I I was transitioning then mmm still that was still just a few years I'm like a guy trying to expel all writing no it's true he's transgender when I was uh when I was a young guy crazier when I was younger I'm going 3 my entire my entire childhood was spent competing in martial arts tournaments from the time I was like 15 so the time I was 22 is my last fight so do you think it made you like that or it tapped into something that was already there I don't think I would have been that intense if I didn't have to deal with really dangerous shit on a regular basis it was the fact that you were fighting in tournaments on a regular basis and nothing ever happened to me I never hurt but I easily could easily could as a Gwen I should have zagged and got knocked the fuck out it just never happened I only lost once in a kickboxing match and that would not not that I didn't lose before in Taekwondo but lost once by stoppage the only time I ever got stopped is in a kickboxing match that was the third fight in a day and I was terrible nutrition back then always getting sick you know didn't really take vitamins and shit and I was on the fence back then I was like doing stand-up and fighting at the same time so it wasn't like a bad knockout I got dropped by a left hook and then I got up and my legs just wouldn't work and he hit me again and I fell down again they stopped the fight like it was just he had hit my jock in the perfect spot and everything gave out and I was thinking about it like when I was when I was going back that there's one of two things I'm going to do either I'm going to go fucking crazy now and rededicate myself and try to be a world champion kickboxer and just use the fact that I got tired in the third fight of the day as motivation to just run extra miles and do extra plyometrics and do extra rounds or be a stand-up yeah no-brainer way I'm built Yeah right like I can't there's no there's no reward in that there was no ultimate fighting championship back then there was no so it's like I had a reprogram my brain I had a probe my brain was used to always thinking about martial arts competition that's all was was dodging kicks landing your own you know getting in closing the distance and you know and forcing your game plan that's what my whole day was spent fighting in my head even if I wasn't fighting I'll be fighting in my head what I was when I was uh like I had girlfriends we did sleep over and I would I was already loved with Owen Cicero kicks in the middle of the night like boom like my my whole body would jolt like a kick because I was having a fighting dream so terrified all I was constantly terrified I got really good at it because I was absolutely horrified of it I just didn't like I just did not get my ass kicked and and I was already doing it I'm like well this is what we're doing that we gotta get really fucking good at this cuz I this is not something you can half-ass dudes are kicking dudes in the face and knocking people unconscious like this is fucking terrifying I saw happen so many times sod - happened to good friends I saw it happen to people who are better than me they just fought the wrong dude at the wrong time which easily could have happened to me it didn't but it easily could have like our instructor never protected us at all he put us even lower like kids were teenagers he would put us in the men's division and you know and tell you like you're good enough to fight as a black belt when you were like blue belt or red belt he was just he wanted to see who was crazy you want to see he wanted to develop a team of people who didn't give a fuck that's so funny that you could do that with kids like that kind without he was on the like at the very least local news you know it was very cultish though the martial arts schools are very cultish it's yes sir no sir it's all like them almost military you know like it's always bowing when you see him you know this all you always bow you always calm sir it was very I can I can I never been able to exist in that dynamic and I don't no matter what it was like there's no way I could uh I needed it I grew up without a dad I grew up without I have a stepdad but my real dad I knew he was alive and I didn't communicate with him so it always fucked with me so I needed some sort of intense discipline to get my shit together the first time I ever felt like I had any control of my life at all was when I started doing martial art so it's like whoa finally I can fucking get good at something like this I'm good at this shit you know but so that's why I was so wound up first at me it took me a while to relax you know it's so amazing how we've been able to cut that out of our lives that whole food gathering nonsense like while I was watching this mountain man show watch this poor guy with shitty rodeo knees he's going out looking for deer like trying to get a deer some meat for the freezer while he's looking for bears constantly like what what an amazing change of life it's happened where they figured out how to cut out that hole gathering food that was already bad enough bad knees looking for a deer and then he does the the over the top while looking for bears yeah it's amazing you got to watch the show - great show that's why I just watched it last night for the first time I'm comfortable being in the matrix hey you know I'll starve to death and it'll be a brutal month and then that'll be it I don't want to be walking around my bad back out in the fucking woods trying to shoot deer in the face trying to gut it with some sharpened stick oh yeah me alright I'm part of the week I'm not supposed to be here that's just like you you'll tap back into your uh when you through kicks in at night yeah I'll just grow a snake like a mountain man beard that's where animal skins make my own Spears I did that's the name of good Bruce Springsteen album make make my spear know what when I through kicks in the night let's who kicks in the night when I do kicks him online where are you kicks you learn if you said something have to be like a breakup and Marjorie would man be yeah it's something about being young yeah getting out of the town yeah and then getting away from all the buzzers and then you go into the course when I see kicks of the night you
