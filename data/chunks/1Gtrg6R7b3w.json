four three two one all right we're live what's up man let's stop dude what's hilarious folks I have to tell you this I did a podcast earlier today and he said why is your second for the day he goes impressive endurance do you know how fucking ridiculous that is for you to say this is a guy who walked across an article a day to take you 54 days by yourself by myself trekking across the fucking frozen tundra it that was an endurance speed of its own yeah just bad real endurance feet I'm just sitting down talking to people oh my god you talked already for two hours how do you do it two more hours here we go yeah easy yep yep - what the fuck were you doing just just getting back actually still uh still practically have the snow on my shoes yeah I got back about a month ago 54 day journey first person in history to cross the entire continent solo unsupported so no resupplies throughout the thing no no aid no wind kites nothing just me dragging 375 pounds sled across Antarctica I can't believe it only took you 54 days yeah that's it's so big on a map how long do you think it would take you to walk across America well you got so we usually look at an article to map this hilarious I show people picture of Antarctica you're smart guy you probably notice but usually people see it on a map projection because it gets flat right right it's actually circular yeah so I went from the edge of the wrong ice shelf to the via the South Pole to the Ross Ice Shelf so basically kind of a diagonal across through the center and then back to the other ice shelf what do the flat earthers think about you're traversing this this area this is what you did this is how you there it is exactly yes so he went to the center of the fucking earth basically there it is the top of the pole yeah bottom of the earth you know standing down there holding everyone up on my shoulders Wow so you were at the South Pole and then he trekked over to the to the ice shelf yeah there son it's funny you say about the flat earthers though because all jokes aside I've been getting a lot of trolling on my Instagram page I've got guys going like oh I was doing this speech the other day people are super nice come up in the Q&A afterwards want to shake my hand take a pic sure whatever and this guy walks up in this real earnest look on his face he's like so I really wanted to ask you how was the whole and I was like excuse me he was like you know the whole at the center and I was like um give me a little more he was like you know like when you got to the edge and I was like oh man like you're really asking this question right now like we were talking about I didn't quite know where to go with it I was like yeah there's actually at least I didn't see the edge and the curvature kept going and I made it is such a strange thing to believe but people do and that people think people are trolling about that and you know what it actually started out it's another 4chan thing you know did you know that it's well I'm sure there was probably somebody believed it before that but it started off people were trolling on 4chan then eventually people just started actually going whoo yeah it is flat and then they start believing it and videos YouTube videos popped up there's another YouTube video someone linked to me the other day and I thought I had like I thought I had like a few hundred views but at 28,000 views there was these all these guys to man like call and proof that there's not a wall like the wall like there would be like Game of Thrones at the edge of the world there's this whole comfort station but there's another 28,000 people it's proved that Colin never actually went oh he's a New World Order shill well the other the other funny one was that we got a bunch all the Instagram pages I'm out there alone completely by myself but I want to share the whole story through my Instagram to like share the journey with people inspire others to do whatever they want to do and I kept being like want me he's not out there alone he's taking pictures I was like the film crew it's like guys have you never heard of a tripod and a timer watch Survivorman exactly so it's a funny comment along those lines so your sled was 300 and how many pounds 375 pounds to start so basically food and fuel was the main the main weight so people I called my project the impossible first that's sort of what I named the project because several people attract right there and there so not only you walking you're dragging this big-ass heavy sled yeah yeah and look dude people so people have tried this you know going back a hundred years to Ernest Shackleton saying if it was possible and then the last few years some really experienced polar explorers have given it a shot and one guy actually died less than a hundred miles from the finish line because of you know lack of nutrition and some challenges with the weather and things like that but people called it you know people after that we're like it's impossible and the reason people thought it was impossible was because you can't get resupplies meaning if you feel your sled with food in a certain amount you actually can't drag the sled anymore so the whole math equation really was figuring out just how much food and fuel I could put in the sled the fuel melts the water so I melted the ice into water essentially and that equal to 375 pounds and to be truth I could barely pull it on the first day like a one hour into getting dropped off I'm dropped off completely alone out there in Antarctica I planned this project for a year you know and I get dropped off and after about 1 hour pulling 375 pounds sled through the snow it's minus 25 degrees out I'm crying I'm literally crying and the tears in my goggles are starting to freeze and I'm like oh my god so I pick up my satellite phone and I call home to my wife Jenna who also creates and plans all these projects with me and I'm like babe I think we named the project the right thing the impossible first yep it looks like it might be impossible to keep going one hour into it that was about dirty poetess sled told everyone I'm gonna do this and I'm already having those doubts pull up but you know fortunately I was able to get a little bit further that day and fifty four hour days later I made it to the end how far did you get in the first today well it's funny cuz we showed just show the map actually you know it starts on the ice shelf which is basically the frozen sea ice and there's an edge of that that's thick where the continent starts and so I have a waypoint on my GPS that marks that so the plane that drops me off actually dropped me off on the ice shelf before the continent starts and my first Waypoint was kind of like the actual start and so one hour and I haven't even hit the real start so when I call her on the phone she's like because she knows the route she's like well how far are you from the first Waypoint which is where the actual start isn't I'm like it's point six three more miles she's like it's half a mile you have a thousand more to go like get to the first Waypoint you know and I was like okay okay so I you know rally myself got to the first Waypoint and then finally got in my tent that night and just kind of took a deep breath I think I was just overwhelmed by the magnitude of it I mean imagine being a speck in the middle of Antarctica loan these crazy temperatures you know all the excitement but fears of the journey ahead and 375 pounds on my back when the sleds you know when the snows deep too loose snow makes 375 pounds even even heavier than if it's like light you know I see a consolidated so yeah it was it was a rough start to say the least did you do any sort of a test run pulling the sled anywhere else yeah so the training element of it was pretty cool so this was I actually set a few other World Records previous to this in the mountains and things we could talk about if you want but the the last year is I really committed to this project I yet decided to obviously start training specifically for this I needed to put on about 20 pounds of muscle I'm usually six-foot 165 pretty lean I'd race triathlon professionally for a number of years and realized I needed to be a bit bigger because I was going to lose so much weight and I found an amazing coach in Portland Oregon where I live this guy named Mike McKay oh I don't know if you've ever heard of him but I know you've had you've had David Goggins on your show I take it so Mike actually surpassed David's pull-up record Mike did 5804 pull-ups in 20 hours I think Goggins at about 4000 which are both insane to me because I can use another thousand and he was where Mike was wearing a 30 pound weight vest mike MacAskill absolute absolute legend so wait a minute wait a minute where did 5000 fucking chin-ups with a weight vest on dude I barely can do 10 I'm right there with you add like pull-ups or not I've got some other physical strikes but the pull-up Department is not not my strong suit get this to just just cuz I got a I got a big up my bad for a second that's his fourth row great he also pulled f250 truck 20 miles across Death Valley in a harness so I'm trying to look for the best guy to teach me how to pull heavy show the guy was like this is the guy love these people I just make you feel like such a pussy the greatest thing about Mike you know big strong jack dude but like super soft-spoken she's like he's like ya did this pull-ups it's cool like so it I would basically fucked with that record so hard he could die and like come back to life and live a whole nother life and no one's ever gonna do it yeah so anyways my training he was the guy I went to him trained out of this gym in Portland where he trains out of and he just he got me bigger he got me stronger but he also did all sorts of badass crazy stuff I mean there's a physical challenge but it's more of a mental challenge than anything so he had me you know my hands in ice buckets doing planks to get my heart rate jacked up and then he'd be like get out of the water then I pulled my hands out of the ice buckets do you know I'd be a seated squat against the wall but then he would hand me Legos and so my hands are frozen my feet are in ice buckets now in a plank my heart rates you know 190 and he's like put this Lego set together so the dexterity of my fingers the mental acuity to get there is what a fucking savage this guy is yeah yeah he did that for veteran suicides yeah exactly so he's got really really important missions behind all of his projects he calls him 12 labors and over his life he's trying to set 12 route world records and various things people that are just they're just designed different yeah yeah so he's the man but like this crazy training he came up with for me that was like the ice the water the mental acuity all of this was like he was like yo you're gonna be in Antarctica if your tent blows away when you're pulling up you're dead like the stakes are that high 50 60 mile-per-hour winds like absolutely crazy so if you ever have an issue like that well you thought the tent could blow away I think I don't know if you have it there's a clip on my Instagram I posted a few days ago of me of me setting up a tent in a - 80 degrees out 60 mile-per-hour winds it's pretty gnarly but yeah I mean there was one time when the tent almost did blow away for me yet there's this one there's one other one this is me getting in the tent looking like an absolute disaster when I get help with your audio but that's me that's me well you're pulling ice on a massive storm and I just so hard to get the tent up I didn't know if I was gonna be able to get it up or I was gonna have to just keep walking Jay hoping these tadpoles hold man those really intense how do you stay warm in that tent so it's average temperature is about minus 25 minus 30 in Antarctica but like I said when the wind jacks up I know if there's the other clip of me setting up the tent but if you get a chance to see that it's you know it's about giving about minus 80 outside which took it's hard to wrap your mind around that but I've tried to put it in perspective by saying I could take a cup of boiling water and throw it in an air and immediately turns ice like that's that's that's the temperature we're dealing with yeah this is me trying to keep the tent poles together usually have someone else to hold on to it but I'm alone I'm completely alone out there so this is me struggling with my tent just trying to keep it up I've got it you know tied down to my sled they're just battling battling the winds and the state like I said the stakes are high if that blows away I don't have a spare tent I've got no extra weight in my sled to hold spare stuff so it's it's it's do or die quite literally in a moment like that of a patch kit I had a couple things repaired a sewing kit a patch kit stuff like that but if the tent itself or the tent poles you know the part pretty much and also you have to set up your tripod and film this and then press stop and go back and sudden how are you keeping these batteries juiced up no this isn't the film crew man that was following me around that write of the flat a film crew near the ice wall the no it was basically I had to keep the batteries warm by keeping them right against my skin so I keep the batteries right against my skin my body weight would keep it warm and the second I wanted to take it out I pull it out real quick hit play and then it would you know usually it lasts a minute or third enough to get a little clip or something like that you couldn't just let it run but then it would you know completely freeze even a full battery would be you know on zero battery by pretty quickly you using solar panels to charge it yeah so one crazy cool thing about Antarctica at that time of year is it's 24 hours of daylight and so the Sun never sets so even when I'm on my tent in the middle of the night I mask your plugs to kind of pretend like it's nighttime but 24 hours of daylight so solar panels keeping everything charged cameras phone batteries all that and are you traveling with are you using GPS yeah so I had some waypoints the GPS waypoints that kind of led my path to the South Pole etc but mostly actually using a compass so I'd look at my GPS maybe once every week or something like that just cuz I'm bearing the juice is actually just easier because so I basically had like a harness in front of me that would have my GPS or my my compass it's kind of off my chest more or less because some of the clips we saw the sun's out but actually more than half of the time the clouds would come in so be just complete and utter whiteout I couldn't even see one step in front of me and so I'd actually have to just stare down at my compass keep it on this bearing and so imagine you can't see anything can't see one step in front of you I'm pulling it you know 300 pound sled 1213 hours per day not listening to anything really can they dead silence and just staring at this compass bearing all day long so going crazy I mean the mental side of it was by far the most interesting side of it for me you know have a lifelong endurance athlete but really kind of an exploration into the mind is what it was for me and while I was curious about it so spending all this time in silence I've done are you familiar with a pasta meditation yes so I've done a couple of these ten day silent meditation retreats before this which is 10 days no reading no writing no eye contact kind of dove into that piece of it but 54 days alone in Antarctica and complete silence was was next level of that for sure damn dude that is so fucking impressive believe you did that now when you're looking down and it's an utter whiteout and you're looking at your compass and you're dragging this shit behind you like D are you doing anything in your mind are you like saying songs are you what are you doing um there's a couple different things but really what ended up happening is I started to be able to trigger these flow States so you know as a lifelong professional athlete through different capacities in my life you know I've tapped into that you know I was a swimmer when I was a little kid so swimming laps in a pool sometimes I would like kind of just happen to this like timeless space where you know maybe 30 minutes would go by in two minutes or something like that but I never really knew how I got there just would sometimes tap into it sometimes not you know the zone flow state whatever you want to call that but in Antarctica I went in with the sort of attention about intention of exploring that space in my mind and so as I got more and more into these whiteouts into these compass in staring at this compass staring at this expansive landscape I started to find ways to actually trigger that flow state in my mind and so it got to the point where I could for several days at a time be in this deep flow state so you know my day was about 17 hours everyday between getting up boiling my water getting out of my tent in those crazy conditions packing my sled dragging it for 13 hours setting my tent back up in these storms but I got into the sort of sequence of being so present with each step each next sequence that it ended up being in this really timeless spaceless place in my mind of true high performance that was almost like the most deepest peaceful meditative state that I can possibly imagine it was it was very profound and beautiful to get there in my mind no are you boiling this water in your tent like yeah so it kind of a slightly different white gas fuel stove so not the canisters where you could throw away but that gas that you could refill the stove but a stove with fuel basically the way my tent was you saw the outer layer of the tent there there's actually an inner part that's a tent so that there's a vestibule where basically there's snow inside the doorway but not outside outside so I would shovel that snow from inside of the tent vestibule into my pot and be able to melt the water that way and drink about six liters of water every single day when I was out there no it's a lot of snow a lot of n takes a few hours to melt that but people don't realize this in Arctic is actually the largest desert in the world so it's actually very dry it doesn't snow very often but when it does of course never melt and the South Pole was at 9,000 300 feet so not only am I in this desert but I'm at altitude doing this thing did you train it altitude use like one of those tents to sleep in or yeah so this this gym that Mike and I trained at it's called evolution health care and fitness in Portland they actually have an altitude room there so that it's not even a tent but they actually have a full a full room where you can you know got rowing machines it's got treadmills it's got all that simulated up to about 14,000 how big is the room it's about 400 square feet I still is big I mean it's not like you know yeah it's like a proper room I've been in some of those tents before when I was racing triathlon many years ago a lot people were starting to sleep in those tents but a lot people have a hard time and then they get warm and stuff like that and a lot fighters use them as well but but yeah it was pretty cool to have a full room that you can actually you know be in and move in probably for to stimulate some of the high intensity stuff yeah and so it would take you hours every day to make your water yeah I would say I was boiling water for about 3-4 hours per day so an hour two in the morning hour two in the evening it takes a lot of energy to boil you know frozen snow when it's that cold out she had to care I had to carry a lot of fuel that was the others really happy I was gonna say that's like hundreds of hours of fuel yeah so I took about 17 liters of fuel so that's what six gallons or something like that how did you know that that was gonna be enough I did some practicing beforehand I in 2016 I did another world record project where I climbed the tallest mountain on each of the seven continents the Seven Summits as well as went to the North and South Pole but much smaller polar expeditions a week basically across in the last degree of latitude and so when those expeditions alphas on Everest during that time Denali etc all of that in 139 days but I did that and that kind of helped me get a sense of it but honestly it was also best guess based on talking to people different experts in the field you know diving into that but you never know is it gonna be enough or too little I decided too much when you when when you finally got to the end how much do you have left so my final push I actually I woke up on the morning of Christmas Eve 24th of December this past year and it look I was 77 miles from the finish and I've been going at that point at the beginning of the trip I was only going 910 miles per day towards the end I started going about 20-25 miles per day so I said you know what like I'm about three days out and then I thought to myself maybe if I could push really hard these next two days I could do it in two days like 215 plus hour days like really get into it and start looking at my fuel and food supplies and like they were pretty low I had enough fuel a few a few liters of fuel but I actually only had about a day or two a food like real substantial food left and so I woke up and I was like alright let's go for this and in the actually deepest talk about flow states that was the deepest flow state of my life I woke up in one hour and that day it's Christmas morning now I wake up and I'm just locked in and I just came I didn't tell anyone back home didn't tell my wife who was tracking me they had this GPS tracker where they could follow me but I was just in my mind I was like you know what not not three days not two days I'm going straight for it and so I did a final 32 hour continuous push on day 54 77 miles straight dragging my sled all the way to get to the finish line and one continuous push no music no nothing just like in my head in this in this crazy flow state of I don't know high performance and it was it was it was a crazy final push to get there but made it right before the food and fuel ran out oh my god there's no one there of course right you crossed the finish side you're like done this no one in the world has ever done this applause nope I was at zero and so what do you do when you get to the end you said hey I'm done come get me yeah yeah take for them to come get you it took me a week to get out of Antarctica totally took actually me four days to get out of there but there's a crazy other component to this which is no one in the world had ever done this before like I said a few really talented people some of the best explorers in the world had tried recently one guy died and it just so happened there's a really specific season when you can attempt this but another guy was attempting this at the exact same time as me a British a British guy who's a equivalent of a Navy SEAL you know British special forces the living most experienced guy in Antarctica has actually pulled 3,000 plus miles in Antarctica now on various expeditions and so we got dropped off one mile away from each other to begin this thing and obviously I was the first I did win this race head-to-head and at the finish line I waited for him for a few days because I want to congratulate him because he did ultimately finish but you can only imagine I would go going back to that first hour where I was like it's impossible it was also like it's impossible and both oh by the way this Navy SEAL dude who knows more about Antarctica than me he's often going I can see him at the distance just like leaving me in the dust but fortunately after day six I caught up to him you know I waved to him and this weird like passing of the torch moment like I was passing him and then I never saw him again until I finished and I about 70 miles ahead of him about two and a half days ahead of him that's gotta suck for him got this motherfucker I brought it home for America man you know appreciate that we all we all appreciated that but still that's gotta suck for him yeah so I actually even though I finished and the first thing I could have kind of wanted to do I haven't had I've had a shower when I have it I actually to save weight so I could get as much food and fuel in my sled I brought no extra clothes no extra pair of underwear like literally no extra pair of underwear no no so where are you shitting out there everyone wants to know this so let's just get it on the table I'll give her a skate basically I described that vestibule situation so one side I cook in right if the wind is calm I get out of my tent dig a hole and and you know go shit in a hole basically but when it's real windy like those storms I just watch like you're gonna get frostbite if you try to you know bend over pull your pants down once -80 out right so in the vestibule of my tent not the side I'm cooking on but the other side where I'm still inside covered I dig a hole in there and that was my morning routine get up at 6:00 a.m. start pulling my water on one side of my tent and it's not glamorous it's not a pretty thing at the bake of actually to me this is very cool but also not glamorous within one degree of latitude of the South Pole so the last degree of latitude 89 degrees south poles at 90 degrees basically 69 miles or 60 nautical miles circumference around the South Pole Antarctica being as pristine as it is they have all these laws about environmental conservation which to me is amazing being someone who just loves and is a great steward of the land they actually say you can't even leave your human waste in holes here even there's nobody out there they're like we want this to be completely protected area and so yes usually my sled was getting lighter most of the time because I was eating food every day and burning fuel but in that last degree of latitude to the South Pole and crossing it I was shitting in a bag wrapping it up and putting it in my sled and having to carry it with me so yeah Wow it shows discipline [Laughter] something a lot of people have been like yeah yeah put it in the back fuck you ones up there who cares if I take a shit up there it was tempting but you know so I grew up in it going out in the outdoors it just has Leave No Trace principle that I really love and in particularly Antarctica one of the things about Antarctica it's one of those places where imagine you've traveled far and wide in your life and there's some few places at least in my mind where you just you can't put it into words until you've stepped off you're there and for me this is my second time in an article both times you know this big cargo ship basically lands you on the continent then you get in a smaller plane to get dropped off to where I needed to start on the edge of the continent but both times stepping off the plane I'm just shit-eating grin ear to ear on my face because I just am like whoa what is this place even the second time seeing it I felt like my cheeks were sore because I was just smiling so big of just pristine beauty the blank canvas the I mean you look out on the landing like human footprints haven't touched 98% of the continent something like that I mean it's untouched and so shitting in a bag if I had to do that to do my part to that way did you drag at the end it was about three used the bags one per day four at that section is about a hundred twenty miles it took me I don't know a week or so to cover that distance so yeah added added weight to my sled rather than subtracting during that was the middle part of the journey right around the 30th and fortieth day now how did you calculate your nutrition so the nutrition journey was actually fascinating and to be honest in my opinion people said well well how come other people died trying or why did other people not be able to do it because one other guy ran out of food and so when I was looking at this journey you know we again we're calling it the impossible first like how am I going to make the impossible possible and I thought that the nutrition piece of it was going to be huge I actually my dad's an organic farmer in Hawaii like whole food health and nutrition has been a big part of my personal journey and so I found a company that was really in it with me so this company called standard processed they're a whole food supplement company I'm really involved in chiropractic as acupuncture and they I presented them with this and I said hey what do you guys think like is there a way to like figure this out and they're like well we have 20 of the top doctors nutritionists food scientists you know on our staff and this Innovation Center around nutrition like come in the lab with us and so they'd never done this with an athlete for but they were intrigued and so I actually went and did a years-long worth of you know hundred plus blood tests vo2 max tests all this fitness testing all around my physiology and they created ultimately a custom food solution as I bar form essentially called the column bar that was all whole food ingredients it was no you know chemical derivatives or anything it was you know coconut oil you know seeds nuts you know all these different pieces of macronutrients as well as micronutrient blends that I needed but custom tailored to my physiology and that's what I mean that was the bulk of what I ate I ate 7,000 calories per day I was burning 10,000 so even at 7,000 I was losing about a pound of day a weight of weight almost to my bodies that's why I needed to get bigger but these column bars just burned super efficiently in my body like it was just the perfect blend of everything so eating the same thing every single day or 54 days might have gotten a little bit boring but my body was just it was actually pretty dialed in Wow now when they did this and they they made these custom bars for you did they know I mean how did you know how many calories you're gonna be burning where you're pulling is 300 pound sled was it dependent upon the conditions like if the snow was more packed or icy yeah more difficult if it was soft right 100% so I mean we had to use our best guess honestly we had to just say let's use our best guess I guys had a bunch of smart people smarter than me we're in this room all these doctors these PhDs around this and we had to make some assumptions and ultimately they were like okay you're gonna burn 10,000 calories let's get you 10,000 calories in these bars and we started running the weight on the sled and we're like that'll be a 500 pound slit like we can't carry that so it's this equation of like can you make this LED light enough to pull if we can get the nutrition right how efficiently does that burn in your body how much can your stomach absorb you're hungry the whole time more or less yeah far yeah I was I was ready for a big fucking meal which was the first thing you ate this the first thing I ate when I got back was a big burger but you might call me lame for saying this but I'm just gonna say cuz it's the truth what I craved was salad man what I craved was just something because I you know I mean I've been like this freeze-dried filled this like chunk of column bar which got me through but it was like something green and alive and so I big salad like avocado and sadly no I had a big burger too but then of course I eat my stomach is shrunk right I ate this big meal and I'm like oh my stomach cometh hurts but motional II I was like I'm back in the real world baby so it was like it was everything I could get my hands I would do a buffet just like my stomach was hurting but I was like I'm not gonna stop and I just started eating like whatever croissants and bread it was all the figs so I would imagine your body would like you probably craving all that life like live things green the exact vegetables and fruit it's weird to say I mean like I'm from Portland Oregon you know it's pretty green part of the world up there in the Pacific Northwest and so you're not even just the the food component but an art there's nothing alive out there there's no animals on the coast there are but like in the interior I didn't see any animals I'd see a bird I didn't see you know nothing right and so not only I think as humans were kind of wired to see things living I mean even here in LA bit of a concrete jungle but like you see trees on this tree you see the ocean yeah whatever yeah I sort of not see anything alive for 54 days it was like wow I want to like smell trees fresh air and the trees I want to eat a salad I don't know like that's where like my mind got to is kind of coming back to reality in that way man so when they're constructing these bars for you and this is all based on your body and like what burns well with you how do they like in terms of like how many cat what's the best food in terms of weight versus calories and is there some foods that are heavier but don't have as many calories yeah so I think I'm gonna get the numbers pretty close to right here but I think per our fat of course of the macronutrients we got protein fat and carbs right right fat is the most calorie dense of them all you have to make sure these things don't freeze solid right that was one of the check it was minus 25 in my sled every single day so it had to actually be edible while frozen essentially because it would be too hard to rewarm them because this was a food I was eating outside sled so was actually frozen - frozen - but actually where we where the workaround happened were they kind of they're mastermind was they were like you actually need this macronutrient blend to be about 40 or 45 percent that's because I needed high-fat food you know to stay alive out there and so they basically pumped it full of coconut oil which ultimately you know does you know you see coconut oil on the Shelf it's not a liquid it's actually a solid but it doesn't freeze like rock solid so having that much coconut oil and it allowed it to we actually had to get it shipped down frozen because if it didn't freeze it got it actually kind of got like flat and so they put it in these freeze-dried packs shipped it down to Chile how to do this whole customs thing the import it was like a whole like crazy logistical mess but got that done and it actually held up so that it was enough fat in there that I could actually bite off chunks of this rather than you know there's plenty of stories the guys in these cold places breaking teeth on Clif bars and things like that so the column bars were or at good-good wall frozen so it's mostly like a lot of fats and seeds and these and nuts and then the other thing is that they like I said that they're their bread and butter at this company standard process is there a you know supplement company so but it's all whole food derivative so organic farm basically vitamins and so they actually intermix like probiotics and magnesium and like beet extract and all these sort of plant derivatives as well to give me the phytonutrients I need that's not giving me the calories but that's giving me that and I stayed healthy the whole time and I got super worn down I got super skinny you know all that kind of stuff but I actually stayed you know I'd never got sick you know that was healthy that was my other question like what was the plan if you did get sick was just waited out in the tent waited out in the tent you know there there's there is I'm in contact with anything though right so I said I had a couple of things one is I had my GPS which has pain in satellite every time but I mean is life forms oh no no bugs no no yes and I know yeah sorry yeah so that part of it there's nothing out there so basically if you get a bacteria you've brought it out there so the actual idea was more or less to get out there healthy rather than you can stay pretty healthy in terms of bacteria and stuff of course you can get pretty worn down and sick in the cold or flu-like symptoms and any virus that you have is something you had when you land exactly because there's I mean there's nothing out there and are you were you concerned about that because like I would imagine like the anticipation leading up to it is a little stressful sometimes your immune system can get run down Oh a hundred percent you know of course it it's fun to recount the the epic parts of these journeys or my other you know world records climbing Everest or this summit day or this push or whatever but anything that's this long duration this was fifty four days the world record in two thousand six 139 days like the boring answer is like how did you do it it's like well like I washed my hands really good when I went to the airport and I did meet this like food off the street and I you know staying healthy yeah you can't get that right you know it doesn't matter you know imagine you're on the flight headed out there and some dude next you sneezing yeah oh yeah motherfuck there was a couple of times when I raced triathlon many years ago I think I raced in something like 25 countries all over all different places and there are three or four times I can remember like remember one time I flew to the Philippines this place called Subic Bay gearing up for this big race and sure enough the night before the race just like diarrhea like crazy puking my brains out so I I jump into I jump into the swim swim in the ocean you know it's a mile so I'm feeling like shit but I'm like I'm gonna try through all the Philippines like I got to do this race you know sure enough on the bike I get on my bike and my bike the bike course went right next to my hotel and I just had no power and I was like yep I'm turning up in the Filipino guys like no no you're going the wrong way the course and I was like nope I'm going to my hotel room to shit tomorrow so yeah one one bad burrito one bad this can ruin you know any other performance I mean yes I read what you're pulling a 300 seat and five pounds sledding in alright okay oh my god it's not a pretty moment that is not a pretty but place with the one pair of underwear that make it's even more so yes get staying healthy was was super key to all of this but you know all things considered me my body of course got banged up some but like I came out you know relatively healthy and I think the food nutrition was a key part of that oh it has to be what what sounds like you really did it wisely like you I mean that's so cool that you have that company behind you that organized the preparation in the ocean yeah yeah good lord man now were you trying to put fat on before you laugh as well as muscle yeah so with Mike you know the goal was to put you know I put about 10 to 15 pounds of muscle on and then another five pounds of fat on top of that just knowing that I've that I've got total was 20 pounds total but you know between fad and the last the last few weeks I was you know basically I be lifted I you know I gotten strong and all this didn't want to wear myself out too much you know stressing my muscles because I was about to go undergo this and it was where I was just putting calories and so I'd you know eat dinner and then but Jen and my wife would be like what are you gonna head out and I bake she'll be sitting there eating like a pint of you know coconut bliss ice cream whatever it was you know putting calories into just to put some fat on there cuz I just burned off me immediately I mean it was gone so yeah so you must have been shredded by the time I was over yeah I I was pre that there's actually out of go pulled up but there's a photo of my Instagram that Scott shows a little bit of the before and after body shot but I yeah I was I was very lean but it was honestly it was all so scary like in the end I think I held up pretty well but you're out there by yourself you've got no context and so I started looking down at my legs halfway through this journey yeah there I am so before and after not that much of a difference yeah it's a little bit lighter you definitely look a lot more lean yeah more I wouldn't even say a lot more lean yeah so it's about 20 pounds different but my mind's play tricks on me more than anything I look down at my waist about half way through and I was like holy shit like I'm falling apart here and I actually started getting in my own head about am i losing too much weight am I not but when I when I actually weighed myself afterwards like 20 pounds like we thought it could have been as much as 40 pounds so you know only losing 20 pounds all things considered like you said I don't look that other than that really cool beard that I grew so you were ready to get gaunt yeah I mean we have planned for that we have planned for that like I said I started out I started out about 165 I put myself up to 185 to leave and I finished at 165 so actually finished way more near my sort of natural fairly lean weight for my height so a perfect plan but there's there's plaything fit wrong but I kind of planned out four things going wrong yeah I mean I'm probably this this was a in one in one way as a solo effort I mean I was out there by myself walking across this but this was a massive team effort from these guys getting behind me all these doctors you know all the different people I have supporting me my you know my wife and then what she does with all the media and our nonprofit and it's abenney things a lot of pieces go into making this thing happen so I was a team effort for sure big time that is so amazing now at the end you get there you're done but there's no one there so what do you do you make a phone call yeah yo I'm done come get me do they know where you are cuz they're tracking you right yeah so what was kind of crazy was that crazy last push right it's this 32 hour non-stop push till the end and so what happened is it's Christmas Day when I start this push and so my whole family I'm actually the I five older sisters big family you know I'm the baby of the bunch and they're all together in Hood River Oregon at my sister's house and they're thinking cool Collins like getting close to end of his project we'll track him and every day they track me on my GPS at ping the satellites every 10 minutes so people all my Instagram followers anyone could actually follow the progress in real time and they were used to seeing me stop at about twelve twelve hours into the day so twelve hours under the day happens and they're like okay maybe he's going another route with 13 hours 14 hours 15 hours they're like what's going on 16 hours my whole family's not normally together but they're all together because it's Christmas Day finally 18 hours into this push I finally stop and head up a waypoint because what happened was I ran out of water even though I said I'm not stopping I was like I don't have three liters of water after 18 hours I need more water so I at least have to put my tent up to boil water inside so what I do it's now midnight I started 6:00 a.m. it's now midnight I've gone in 18 hours it's a midnight in Antarctica is what the times when I was staying on was 7 p.m. on the west coast so it's Christmas dinner I finally Colin it's my mom my sister my wife like everyone's on the phone they're like oh my god you did 47 miles today that's your best buy like 15 miles incredible and I was like no no I'm not stopping I'm actually just boiling water for an hour to continue back out for another like 14 hours to finish this thing they're like what the weather must be really good wow you're feeling so good and I was like I was like actually it's the worst weather of the entire trip because there's a massive ground blizzard blue like like hour 16 of this bush it was nice just this ground blizzard which is it's not actually snowing but it feels like it's snowing cuz it's so windy that the snow is blowing around everywhere but I was locked in such a deep flow state in my mind that even setting my tent up in this crazy storm even getting inside 18 hour push I was just like nope I've got this and it felt like for me when I reflect on that moment Jenna even says this you know she talked to me every night and the there's clips of me crying there's clips of me having doubts you know there was ups and downs for this whole thing but she was like you sounded the most lucid I've ever heard you and she's watching me high performing her things she was like you were locked in and so instead of her going like maybe you should sleep and like get some rest she was like I trust you like I believe you like go for it she could just hear it in my voice and it was a crazy thing and I ate for me you know I'm 33 years old now and it really felt like a culmination of my entire life in a lot of ways like from the swim practices as a little kid to you know I got burned in this crazy fire that I overcame in time like that if you want I you know race triathlon professionally all of these moments life the meditation practice the the family the support likes like all of these things were stacking on each other to kind of lead to this final culminating moment and I had to pull on lessons from each phase of my life to be that locked in but I found myself just you know kind of in that moment in that flow state being able to get up out of that hour 18 and say to them actually I'm going back out this crazy ground blizzard I got another 14 hours to go to finish this thing and so that was you know 32 hours and 77 miles later that the final push to the end now what did you wear in terms of like a base layer and we was you're concerned about you sweating while you're pulling all that weight especially initially when I was 375 pounds yeah so you know one of the the famous lines that you know people who have been in the polar environments will say is if you sweat you die and you know it's maybe a little bit of hyperbole but it's not far from the truth which is you start sweating and you stop for even 30 seconds your clothes are literally freezing to your body and so it was this crazy kind of kind of balance of being able to pull this sled get your heart rate elevated enough to keep your body warm but not too warm that you were sweating and so any second I would start sweating I would strip layers off so there was times especially when there was no wind it still be ambient temperature - 20 - 25 but I would just have like a thin gore-tex jacket on and one base layer that's it I mean we wearing merino my merino actually itches my skin although it's really good I'm a little bit allergic to it so I work synthetic fabric do they have a synthetic that completely mimics merino in terms of the way when it's moist you still stay warm yeah so Mirena honestly Marino is amazing fabric for that reason unfortunately for me like I said it just irritates it is so funny that you could suffer but sorry is synthetic but what company are you using like what what I was using Mountain Hardwear base layers and then actually my outer layer so this norwegian company called bergens of norway they don't sponsor me but they actually believe it or not the Norwegians know a thing or two about being in the polar environment and so they've designed a really good jacket and pant that's actually really breathable and really good and then I suit sewed a fur rough on to the edge so a wolf a wolf fur a rough on the outer side of the hood I think is wolf yeah wool fur wolf fur I thought you were saying wool when I was like it sounds like wolf you know more about this than me I'm not the alpha dog know your audience I have nothing I am not a big hunter myself I've never had never had done that a lot of that but yeah so wolf fur well they know how to survive in the cold yeah exactly so the base layer is a synthetic what is the material that it's made out of the base layer is yeah it's a it's a synthetic like a poly polypropylene and so it when it sweats it dries quickly yeah it's what sweats it dries quickly but the idea was just to not get it wet so basically stripped down as much as possible but like literally I'd go from that and then of course I needed to eat and drink every whatever 30 minutes or whatever actually more like every hour so I'd stop so I'd stop in the front of my sled I had a huge puffy down Jack like a massive like Michelin Man huge Buffy down jacket so even if you're stopping for a minute to drink water before even trying to do that boom put the big jacket on because that's no cold or how cold you can get immediately from stopping I mean it's just so much colder than when pulling the sled your heart rate stays up and keeps you pretty warm I would imagine like your your hands and your feet too that would be a real issue right the small digits yeah I mean you know frost bites real for sure hands outside of gloves that's why some of the stuff I was doing in the training of get my hands with the dexterity you know you have to tie all these knots with big gloves mittens on you can't take your gloves off for any sizable period of time if you look back on a lot of my photos I've actually got tape on my face over crossed my nose and there and that's because I started getting tiny little bits of frostbite on the bottoms of my nose and on my cheeks because I'd wear a full-face mask buff everything but even you know tiny little you know one you know needle prick of wind on your face throughout the day and that cold is gonna turn into a cold injury and so I started getting a few cold injuries on my face nothing you know too bad you're looking to grease your face up or anything like mostly the the tape and then I had a little bit of like Vaseline or like chapstick type of stuff on some of the bad areas the one thing actually that I did that I'd never done before would actually worked well was a tip that I got which was my finger started cracking really really bad from the cold and so they were like really painful and I actually was pouring putting superglue into all of those basically little micro cuts on my fingers which when someone told me that as a trick I was like really but turns out it's actually a really good trick so it's kind of super gluing these cuts on my fingers back together and that actually worked reasonably well all things considered it's the operative word but it yeah yeah wow so you're wearing the what about your eyes so I'm wearing I'm wearing a goggles but you know funny enough you know I had a couple of you know fancier nicer ski goggles with me but yeah there's the tape on my face right there but but yeah it's like that's actually just like the normal katieb tape like a physio tape that you can see like athletes wearing and I just had it in my repair kit it wasn't meant for this purpose but I was like what do I have that I could put on my face to block it a little bit better but I had those goggles on some of the time but actually the goggle that I wore the most was one that you'd might use for motocross because it has like a plastic face mask over the front of it hmm because the wind when it was blowing it would just kind of blow around so sometimes I had this fleece draped over my face but it blow too much and so I had this more plastic face mask yeah so that that's the that's one you can see look how frozen it's frozen it is on the inside that is so oh my god there and then like this neoprene mask underneath so I had like double facemask double tape like anything to just you know keep me keep me warm no I suspected that it was so high above sea level there yeah yeah so you've got whatever it is nine thousand three hundred feet at the South Pole so it's basically just like elevated ground but it seems flat right but yeah I started at sea level so yeah I'm not only Ameren like I'm actually going uphill all the way to the South forty some days I pulled that sled uphill completely so it was thanking me out nothing freaks me out yeah like when you were freaking out an hour in and you hadn't even actually hit land yet yeah what at what thoughts were going through your head what were you thinking man I need to get someone to fucking rescue me I mean it definitely you know that was moments of doubt this is on Everest no we get to this yeah the you know what's going through my head was was these moments of doubt for sure but one of the things for me you know to be honest with these projects that I've created I love I love pushing my own limits I love I love finding the edges of my own potential all that kind of stuff but I also now really enjoy building these projects that I can share with other people I do this I just nonprofit work where there's no thirty thousand school kids tuning into this project and using this as curriculum in their classrooms to learn about climate change to learn about weather atmospheric pressure that's a really cool project like that and then just sharing it with the world at large people going like this is impossible I mean how many guys do you know that it's like one day I'm gonna do this cool thing but they like never do it right and so actually going after that and sharing it away it's like you might not want to walk across Antarctica but like you probably have some hope or some dream or some goal that you want to accomplish in your life like fucking go and do it like get after it and so for me doing this it's funny I've started to think of myself less as an athlete and actually more of as an artist and my canvas really is just endurance sports but creating these art projects in the world that I can create and share with people through storytelling to hopefully inspire them do it so what was I thinking in that first hour was you know I don't I don't want my art project to blow up right in my face but more so there was this was bigger than myself and that's really what kept me going forward just like I can't let these kids in these public school think that I could after the first hour like these other people that are there driving inspiration from this hopefully like I want to do this for this larger purpose and honestly that's that's what really kept me going forward through the really hard times is that the connection to a larger purpose of what I want to put out in the world and that ripple effect the positivity that's awesome and then of course you have a giant team that prepared in yeah you know it's it's it's a lot lot goes into it so get get into that get into that starting line of having that doubt but I think I mean on one level it's also it's a human element it's easy for me to come in here and tell this story like you know what Joe like I'm the biggest badass in the world no one's walked across Antarctica and like I did it even though these people died trying whatever like those are the facts of the situation but like the truth is man like I'm human like I have the wave of human emotions I figured out how to tap into my mind and a way to do these things but like I still experience fear I steer experience doubt I still experience the ups and downs but I have a way of actually being able to repurpose or refocus that energy into positive forward momentum I think that's what the difference is but I believe all of us all of us humans have the capacity to do this like you're looking at me I'm like a pretty like regular like sighs a regular looking guy but I think you know the muscle between my ears is what separates the difference and they allowed me to do this more than anything you don't seem to have the darkness that I usually see in people that do things like this do you know I'm saying this I've met a bunch of people that have done some fucked up things and they all have some weird darkness yeah you know I hear what you say and I think for me there's a lot of this strength comes from a dark moment in my life you know right after college I was traveling around the world at you know I had no money as a kid growing up you know working working-class background painted houses every summer but always dreamed of traveling the world so I was like one day I'm gonna travel the world so I finished college buddies of mine are getting like real jobs and whatever Wall Street and things like that and I was like you know what I saved up ten thousand dollars over the past six years I'm gonna take a surfboard in a backpack and like go see the world with my life savings and so you know I wouldn't do that I'm 21 years old you know go to Fiji I surf through Australia hitchhike through New Zealand I end up in Thailand and Europe in a time yeah yeah of course and you say you're familiar with how much fire and fired dancing and various crazy to bhaturas things that happen over there so I'm on a beach in rural Thailand and I decided to jump this flaming jump rope and unfortunately it goes terribly wrong for me the Rope wraps around my legs and ignites my entire body on fire to my neck and you know in an instant my life changed you know fortunately for me the water's edge the ocean was ten steps away so kind of instinct takes over and I dive into the ocean which extinguished the flames my body is on fire to my neck but not before about twenty-five percent of my body is severely severely burned so my clothes were on fire but mostly we got severely burned was my legs and feet and so I'm in a place I want a beach there's there's no hospital on this and I'm on an island there's no hospital instead of an ambulance ride I'm on the back of a moped driving down a dirt path you know I'm in a one-room nursing station literally like the size of the room we're sitting in there like this is our sort of hospital it's like one bed and I'm just completely devastated and so that they put me under eight surgeries over the next week in the middle of nowhere rural Thailand I hate surgeries in a tiny little shack yeah and basically there's a cat running around my bed every time I come out of there you know quote-unquote ICU there's a cat running around my bed and across my chest and the doctors are literally saying to me you know and they're in the broken you know English is they're saying hey you'll probably never walk again normally like you're never gonna walk again normally yeah there's a photo of that I think if you click over on that to the second one it actually shows you know there's what the local so you know I was an after that that photo there with those legs that's actually eight weeks after I was burned so that believe it or not that's like the it's starting to look a little bit better all things considered there so as you can probably imagine I mean just the darkest time in my life I've been you know a Nath you know I swam through college and I thought of myself as a physically active person and Here I am like doctor saying hey you know 22 year old kid like you'll never walk again normally and to me there's their hero in this story which is maybe why you don't see the darkness in my eyes and it's more the light but you know my mother is really the the heroine of this tale which is she she arrived to my bedside around day five you know flies all the way over to Thailand finds me are you are you a parent I don't know do you have kids yeah I don't have kids yet but I can imagine as a parent what it's like to walk into a hook you know hospital room and see your kid halfway around the world in this state nothing you can do and she admits now that she was crying in the hallways you know pleading with the doctors for good news like he's gonna be alright right he's gonna walk she's crying but every time she walked into my hospital room she walked in with a smile on her face and this is the era of positivity of being like okay call him like this is bad like what do you want to do when you get out of here like let's set a goal like let's get out of here and do something positive and I'm like mom are you crazy like the doctors say I'm never gonna walk again normally like my life as I know it it's over you know just in this really dark place in my mind but she just kept at me day after day with this positivity there's that and I finally like closed my eyes and I just pictured like what what am I gonna be and I closed my eyes and I had this visualization of myself crossing a triathlon finish line which is not something I'd ever done before I got swam in college but never bike to run competitively nothing but I was like you know what the able-bodied me sometime in the future is going to be not only walking again but doing a triathlon race and so I said it too I said my goal was to race a triathlon one day and instead of her looking at me going like well I said set a goal but maybe something Mario it stick but it doesn't require you to be running she was like great let's learn about it polls out her computer and just literally starts reading me like triathlon races or this they're this far they're this distance is like I didn't know I knew nothing about the sport other than just like popped into my mind is something I thought I maybe wanted to do and so that's what I focused on I literally have this photo of me with the tie doctor I'm you know my legs are bandaged to my waist and the tie doctor is like looking at me like crazy but I'm lifting these like 10-pound barbells in my head going I'm training for a triathlon now that guy's like you're in Thailand in a hospital and I'm telling you you're never gonna walk again normally and so you know flash forward you know two or three months I finally get released from this Thai hospital for three months yeah yeah and when I got released I still hadn't walked you know I mean I'm in a wheelchair I got carried on and off the flight back to Portland Oregon land back home and you know still still bandaged up and my mom you know says may I wake up the first morning back at my parents house my mother's kitchen the house I grew up in and she looks at me and she goes all right Colin now I know you've got this big triathlon goal but today your goal is to take your very first step and so she actually grabs a chair from our kitchen table and place it one step in front of my wheelchair and she says today you need to somehow figure out how to get out of that wheelchair take one step and step into the chair in front of you and I'm looking at it like I don't know if this is possible but three hours later four is later I'm still staring at this chair and I finally work up the courage and strength to get out of this wheelchair take the one step and get into that chair in front of me and is the problem the because of the burnt skin it's not flexible you can't move it and bend it now it's a good question so basically what happened with the burn is it burned me so deep that two things happen one is there is ligament damage so ligament damage to my ankles and knee joints and then the way that this the heat the scarring in the skin is healing essentially over these mobile joints they don't think I'm going to regain full flexibility at full range of motion essentially in my leg so they're not saying you'll never walk as and you won't be able to stand up at all although that was like extremely painful but they just didn't think you know be imagine walking around without being able to bend your knees or your ankles when looking for mobility so it just was like you're not gonna be able to have that back basically so sure enough I take that first step get in that chair the next day my mom doesn't take it easy on me she just move this chair five steps away the next day ten steps away you know everyday a few more steps of not to go on and on but basically 18 months after you know getting released from that hospital I find myself in Chicago I finally you know took a job in finance just trying to get out of my parents basement like get all of my life at 23 years old like yeah I got to get like a real job my parents basement you know move to Chicago take a job in finance and try to get my shit together basically and I honored that court said you know what I'm gonna sign up for the Chicago triathlon I live here now join a local gym knew nothing about the sport still I'm like asking random guys at the gym like anybody here race a triathlon like I'm in a spin class like how do you like like how do you like take your shoes off and like run afterwards how do you like like how does it even work I ask these questions and sure enough through that process I like train at this gym sign up for the Chicago triathlon ended up racing the race across the finish line and to my complete another surprise I didn't just finish the race but I actually won the entire Chicago triathlon beating 4,000 other people coming first place what so first try whatever Wow and how what kind of training did you do to prepare yourself for that I mean like I said I you know I had been a collegiate swimmer so I was a division swimmer I swam at Yale University but then you know the biking and running was completely new to me have anybody show you how to do it or just start running and biking yeah I literally walked into this spin class like I Spit not like like I didn't actually ride a bike like that so I went to the spin class and like start like met a guy and he was like oh I've done one triathlon before and he was like I can do so he took me out on a couple like rides with his buddies I had this like steel frame bike I didn't know all these like carbon wheels and Aero helmet you know all these fancy like triathlon type of things like didn't know much about it and literally for a summer just kind of like asked people some questions this and what's funny about triathlon I don't know how familiar with this sport but in a race like the Chicago triathlon there's you know for more than 4,000 participants and so unlike a marathon where everyone just starts at the same time you actually have to start in waves like a hundred people every five minutes and I was the 39th wave of 53 and so I dive into Lake Michigan and there's people that already started like two hours before me and there's people starting two hours after me and so when I finished the race you know I swam my bike I run was Olympic distance travel and so I was a mile swim 25 miles biked 6.2 mile run I crossed the finish line I don't still know I won the race because like people started before me people started after me and they take the cumulative time at the end and so I like my grandma's there cuz she lives in Chicago like gives me a big hug I'm so proud of you you weren't able to walk again and here you are finishing triathlon let's go get lunch and so I you know grab my wetsuit and my bike my grandma and I sit down to have lunch and as we're walking back to the car she's like do you want to see like what place you came in your age group and I was like sure like that would be cool like let's go see how I did and we wander over like the scorer's table and the guys like I'm like oh you know I'm trying to figure out a place out what's your name was like oh I'm calling a Brady like we've been calling your name over the loudspeaker for the last 20 minutes like oh why did I like do something wrong and they're like you won like like my age group and they're like no you won like the whole race was just this surreal surreal moment of my life I mean it was it was wild but it um you know for me well in that moment what I thought back I was like it was cool to pat myself on the back like holy shit like I just did this crazy thing but it was more so going back to your initial question about the darkness versus the light at least in my journey was I was like wow like this is a sliding doors moment like what had happened had my mom not you know come in with this air of positivity and forced me to set this tangible goal like I'm certain my life would be nowhere where it was today but then it's not I wasn't like oh wow I'm some superhuman freak that can do these things I was like wow humans all of us we all have these reservoirs of untapped potential inside of us and can achieve extraordinary things when we set our minds to it and so what it did for me is just spark this curiosity like well what else can I do if I set my mind to it so sure enough it was a Sunday when I raced a Chicago triathlon coincidentally met who became a huge mentor and influenced my life that afternoon a guy named Brian Gelber who ended up being my first sponsor and he said to me you won the Chicago triathlon today do you think you should maybe do something about that and I was like yeah but I've got a job and I don't have any money like I would need a sponsor he's like he's like I'll be your first sponsor if it's something you want to take seriously and so literally that was on a Sunday Monday morning I walk in two weeks later I'm living in Australia Trading triathlon full-time and ended up racing triathlon professionally for the u.s. national team you know all over the world for the next six years so it was stories a moment but what happened ultimately with the injuries that you sustained from the fire you know all things considered that was so that was January 14 2008 so it's just over eleven years ago now and I you know I ultimately have been pretty alright I mean I've got some scars but it's pretty faint I was able to gain back most of the full flexibility in my legs if you look at my left foot it's where the worst worst burns but where that rope really just like sat on my foot for a long time most of that's still pretty thick with scar tissue you know when I'm in the mountains when I'm in places you know like climbing Mount Everest like I did like pulling across Antarctica all the things I have to be really aware because my skin regulates heat not in the best way he and cold it's still just like no not like normal skin because the scar tissue the scar tissue just is it just carries the heat a little bit different for some reason I guess I don't know exactly why I'm not as porous because it's nice pour over it over exactly and the actually in the early days for the first five years I don't get this so often anymore but in the first literally five years of this if I bumped my legs into like a table or someone just you know bumped a chair and I mean oh nothing like lightly I would usually get a little cut there so it was just super fragile it's almost like you know glass skin kind of with not the same sort of flexibility that you'd normally have but you know ten eleven years on now I would say it's pretty much a hundred percent I mean the things I've done with my legs and body in the last ten years I think proof at least that my body's doing all right so I feel extremely extremely fortunate to have recover it as well as I did and you know more than anything I that to of course the the physical ability for my body to recover in the way it did but I think that at least for me started with the mind start with that positivity of my mother and and the duration of the many different things I've done done since then and you said you sustained ligament damage to your joints and your knees yeah yeah so there's basically again I'm not my Anatomy I have other skills with my full Anatomy is not a lot of doctor let's put it that way but yeah basically the link it means particular in the backs of my knees so I don't know exactly what that ligament is that goes through through there but that was really jammed up with with the scar tissue so I was enabled for a long time to fully bend my knees and flex them in the full way and the same thing in the ankles whatever that ligament is that goes sort of basically turned not not your Achilles with the other side of your foot basically that part was just so much scar tissue had formed away the skin was healing around that and from the damage to the ligaments it wasn't sort of being able to fluidly flex in the way that you normally would see a foot so a full that imagine point not to not be able to point your foot basically if you're you know putting your leg forward out you know back like yeah like that so yeah for a long time and it's kind of so is kind of like dragging my feet around in that first year Wow and so did you have to just push through the scar tissue and break it up like yeah I mean there was a lot of a lot of obviously PT a lot of songs massage I tell you funny starts but I haven't thought of the story at a long time enough ever told the story actually but so when I got burned I've been traveling by myself entirely or around the world but I actually met up not with my childhood best friend named David Boyer who actually married my sister and they have two kids so my childhood best friend turned into my brother-in-law which is it's pretty fun but anyways he had been he had actually been with me when I got burned so those first five days in the hospital before my mom got there he was with me and was a saint you know we're both he's scared little 22 year old kids and he's like trying to do his best to like look after me he's freaked out but when I get back to Portland his mother who was kind of a second mother for me growing up my name's Kate Boyer she obviously was like wow this could have been my son just as he said had been you know her son you know it kind of felt like protective of me so she comes over to my house one day and she goes you know I've been doing some untraditional healing work would you be open to that and I at this point was like I'll take anything what do you got in mind and she was like well I've been working with this pranic healing shaman do you want to want to check that out and I literally was like I was like saying yes to everything at this point like I'm looking for any way to recover and I was like well what is it she was like well I don't even touch you it's just light healing and so I go to this basement in Portland and I meet this this guy and he's sitting there with a bucket of salt in front of him and he starts he doesn't touch me at all he's just like waving his hands in front of like my body in my heart and then he's like looking really intensely at my foot and I sit there for like an hour guy never touches me nothing he's just like looking at me waving his hand and this and and he's like okay I'm done now and I'm like okay what did you do and he was you know telling opened up this shocker I opened up that I did this but what I mostly did was I put this force field of white light or a foot and I'm like I mean I'm pretty up down with some untraditional stuff but I was kinda like uh-huh cool like thanks I appreciate it he's doing and I was like what's this bucket and he was like this is the salt bucket that takes the negative energy away from your foot and your leg and puts the negative energy in there as I'm bringing in this light and such as pranic healing he's like so you have this light blue force field over your left foot right now which was the worst burn part of my body I he goes I would recommend not showering for the next couple of days as you might wash up the force field so what jails are so I tell this story with the total smile cheeky smile on my face because that's funny I ever thought of the story a long time but I will say this the next day I walked further than I had the rest of the time so you want to call that placebo you want to call whatever i emotionally wasn't full bonden on the pranic healing I like I said I am into very a lot of alternative modalities how I wish it was true yeah sure I met a lady at the corner store once told me she does Reiki healing yeah she like kind of rubbed her hands together and and waved him in front of me I'm like what are you doing she's like do you feel that um I don't feel shit so that that part I don't know if it worked or did it work but the the combination of the amount of people with you know in the hospital with the physical therapist with my mother at home with Kate Boyer taking me the pranic healing a culmination of all of those things somehow did unlock the the scar tissue and allow me to make a full recovery of I mean it was a lot of hard work for you know the gear plus to get back on my feet but I got there well I'm sure there's something to be said for believing or at least having positive thoughts about your healing and making sure that you look at it in terms of like this can be done but ya know I mean very skeptical assault man like I said that the salt man take it for what it is like I said I'm telling that story not as an advocate for pranic healing necessary but I will say agreeing with what you just said there is something about that there's something about being wrapped in the positivity that it was with my mother in that moment of just being like hey like let's get through this let's figure this out together like let's focus our mind on something and a lot of you know even as I go through Antarctica you know how did you do that like you know people ask me this question like are you a superhuman and I'm like yeah I'm a superhuman and so are you like that's how I feel like we all have this capacity in our minds to unlock all sorts of things I don't get mean if you wanna paint pictures compose music start a business you know sit sit in a warehouse and do a podcast whatever it is you want to do you can fucking do amazing things like and you know having that belief does does you know add up to that I mean that's step one in my opinion is visualizing that I'm believing it and are on the flip side having a negative self-worth or a negative opinion of what you're about to do or a negative thought about the future can also manifest all sorts of terrible results absolutely absolutely gotta think policy bo effect is a real thing we know that right we know that if you really do believe that you're going to get better because of some sugar pill they give you yeah there's a tangible result 100% if you really believe yeah so if that salt guy if the thing about all that stupid shit is if you believe it it actually has an effect yeah there's there's a lot of healers out there that at least on paper or totally full of shit but if you believe in these assholes yeah thank you yeah it's very slippery the human mind is such a slippery thing I mean and I'll go back to my own experience and again I don't know how ephemeral are out there you want to get but I'm out there in Antarctica 54 days alone like I'm telling you I'm doing this for this bigger purpose I feel like I'm tapped into that and like legitimately there were moments at least for me whether I'm manifesting that in my mind whatever you want to call it that I am actually feeling energetically uplifted by the people pushing me on like there were days that were incredibly hard where I would sit there and I'd be like oh my god I don't know if I can do this and I'm done like boom like I would get over I would hit with this sort of larger purpose this larger outcome and again like I'm not I'm not super religious person I was actually raised on a hippie commune like I come from a pretty traditional background but like the energetic field whatever you want to call that or if that's just the belief in something you know the power of that like I felt the strength from those moments there was moments when my body switched from kind of being negative oh my god another hard day out here oh my god it's - 25 - tapping into those flow states so yeah again I don't I don't have perfect words for that you know I'm starting to try to build my vocabulary around that but that energy I think it is derived from what you're saying if you start to believe it if you can believe like hey there's a larger purpose in this or hey there's blue forcefields get one foot there is something that if you can originate that positivity in your mind that I think can give us incredible amounts of strength and then we can tap into something greater well I think there's definitely something to what you were saying about the untapped limits of the human potential and that there's most people barely scratch the surface of that and if you really firmly get into that zone and believe you can do things that people just they really don't have any idea what they can do if they have to because people are rarely pushed to their actual limits yeah I mean you know it's been said many times before I say it but that idea that growth happens outside the comfort zone you know and one of the things that I've personally thought about a lot in this space is you know I got severely burn in this fire I didn't well I chose to jump the rope so I was chose to be a knucklehead 22 year old kid on a beach in Thailand but like I wasn't like God I want to get severely burned today like that happened to me right which forced me through this intense tragic moment but from that I was able to learn of this sort of untapped potential inside of me because of the outcome because of winning this triathlon yeah but what I realize is that it's hard to choose that path often it's hard to push yourself outside of those boundaries but things that are you know quote-unquote forced on you I mean let's look at something that half this population essentially does give birth like childbirth natural childbirth right as been happening since the beginning of time and that's an incredibly intense physical manifestation of the power of the human body I mean I mean I can't even imagine obviously what that would look like nor will ever be able to experience that but that's incredibly powerful more times when people you know are forced to go through a cancer diagnosis and have to go through radiation and chemo and you know facing the mortality and all the sort of stuff people get through those but often times these tragedies have to be forced upon us for us to do them and so my exploration now with my what you know creative artwork I call it with these you know expeditions these world record projects that push my body in mind it's me choosing to step into those moments it's me choosing to put my body and mind in these intense moments because of a deep curiosity of like what are the limits of human potential you know what are my limits what are our limits collectively and can my physical expression of this inspire other people to innovate create and do amazing things in the world and other modalities and canvases well that's one of the weird things about people doing extraordinary things like what you did is that you absolutely will give other people fuel to accomplish things in their life inspiration is so critical for human beings I mean I draw upon it from so many different sources from David Goggins and a bunch of my other friends that my friend Cameron Haines and a lot of other people that are endurance athletes and different people that have been interviewed on this podcast but there's something that happens when you realize that people can do extraordinary things it makes you believe in the potential not just in that person but also in yourself absolutely I mean you know Gaga's great example that I've know I met him but you know I've personally derived inspiration from that guy I mean he gets out there you know you can't run 100 miles like I'll show you I can run 100 miles you know and he's pushing his body to extreme ways or you know I love what he says about the 40% you know I think about a little bit different in my mind but like what are those limits I don't know if it's 40 percent or 40 percent people quit you know people quit that I can't voice comes up and you know he's proven it so as many other people of actually when you say I can actually when you don't stop you get stronger and for me in my own story in my own journey I think that final day that finding final 32 hour push proves it three days before that you know I'm videotaping all this I'm trying to capture as much content to be able to share with people of this crazy weird place that's an article by yourself and like day 49 day 40 50 like I'm literally crying into my GoPro being like I'm running out of food I'm exhausted I don't know if I can keep doing this I'm just like worked right but sure enough I don't say I can't you know it's that for it was that 40% was that 50% that's that moment when I wanted to quit or I should have quit but then the strongest most amazing moment of my entire athletic career that spans decades happens three days later because I kept pushing it's not like I rested for three days and pulled that off like I never took a rest day in 54 days I pulled my sled 12 to 13 hours every single day and on the last day it was the strongest as possible so I think it proves if we can push through that I can't moment no it's not gonna work that you can get there and unfortunately you know we talked about 40% with Goggins I actually think a lot of people quit at 1% they're sitting behind their office they're like you know one day I want to travel overseas or you know I hate this job you know I've got this great at business idea but I mean it they're like but I can't like I've got no money to start this business I've gotta know this like when I first set off my first world record in 2016 2014 i sat with Jenna in my house one-bedroom apartment with a white board and we're like I'm gonna see if I can set the world record for the explorers Grand Slam something fewer than 50 people in the world I've ever done and I'm gonna be the fastest climb Everest come to know like climb Kilimanjaro North Pole South Pole back to back I hadn't climbed a bunch of mountains it'd be pretty easy to say I can't oh and by the way we have no money to do this we have no platform I have like 200 Instagram followers like I'm nothing but we just sat there were like no instead of saying I can't let's say I can what's the first step to that we literally get out our laptops and I'm like going it like we're like we want to build this big media champagne were lots of people follow and get pressed like we know nothing about we have no background this week Google what's the difference between marketing and PR I mean we are literally asking Google like the most basic basic questions but you know we continue to say like let's get coffee with our one friend who knows something about this we should probably get a website how does one build a website and it goes on and on like this how long ago did you start this journey so that that was 24 when we 2014 when we dreamed that up this or the world record was C 5 years ago yeah so to see if I could set the world record for something called the explorers Grand Slam so it's coming tallest mountain on each of the seven continents seven summits and before that had you done anything like that or it just been athletics so I grew up in Portland so I grew up like in the outdoors but like I mean to go climb Everest at Denali so I think no like the short answer is I mean I climbed a few mountains you know it's not like I've never been in the snow before I'd word crampons ice it's like I had not experienced but like not even close to the experience that you would think one would need to do that and to just break world record right doing not just do is to be the fastest person to ever complete it you know like I said it ended up being a hundred and thirty nine days straight through to climb all those mountains didn't know I think we had a clip up a second ago of something on Everest but but yeah I mean to do to do all of that it started from this place of not of believing I can and then you know it's again it's fun to talk about the epic adventure but we for me it's actually fun to talk about what happened behind the scenes of that because what actually happened like people you know applauded our success now this is me this is you in Everest walking across a ladder that's the oh about 300 foot hole a crevasse on the other side of it that you have to go through to on your way up the the Mount Everest climbing route and so you crampons are clicking on the and you're looking them on the ladder as you walk across and if you fall you die yes watch this again this is so awful it's so awful look at because you're basically just walking this tightrope on let me hear it listen that click folks I implore you to go to the Instagram page so you get the full freaked out crab the photos they're tied together to the ladders yeah rickety it could be that 300-foot cavern over there oh fuck all this Jesus uh and you're looking down because you ever go pro and we cut the sound off at the end there but I go at the very because like there's fifty of those lives lost cheering every fuckin time I got across I was like yep one more down in the kumoi so I should go through that section a couple of times it's a very dangerous section of the mountain but yeah one about 50 of those ladders so when you went through Everest did you see the bodies so I fortunately didn't see any bodies up there fortunately or unfortunately fortunately I mean I mean I'm not like trying to see that behind you know but they're they're more prevalent on the climbing route on the north side the day that I did summit three people died on the day that I summit is when I when I so to set that I mean to talk about Everest I mean for me is major setbacks it was the eighth of nine expeditions in this sequence so I'd done a hundred days of other expeditions leading up to Everest to do this explores Grand Slam World Record I'm trying to climb Everest I'm exhausted from a hundred days I just come from the North Pole before that Kilimanjaro before that you know Albert's all these other mountains and then I make my summit push on Everest I'm I'm not climbing with a guide or anything it's just myself and one Sherpa who I met climbing in Nepal to your previous when I was training for this and so it's just the two of us and we climb up into camp for so ever says you know four camps there's base camp and then there's camps progressively higher in the mountain so you can get your body acclimatize and we get up into camp for have you read the book into thin air by Jon Krakauer or anything about it I say okay there's a famous book that's written about it where eleven people die and right in this moment it's called the Death Zone where you enter above 26,000 feet the human body basically can't survive for long even with supplemental oxygen and this massive snowstorm and wind storm blows in like kind of out of nowhere and we're trying to push for the summit it takes us two and a half hours just to set up our tent and get inside and we know like it's over like we're not we're not going to summit at first like in this storm there's no way so we just survived the night wake up the next morning still getting pounded by this weather and actually have to climb back down the mountain so climb back down the mountain all the way to Camp two and they're like and they're like well that's probably it like you don't usually like spend a night out in the Death Zone and like make a second attempt and you've already tried all these other mountains you're a hundred plus days in this journey and I was like man I want to see if I can get back up they're like and this other guy who I met on another team had some supplemental oxygen so I had to use some my supplement auction so my put supply stores are limited now as well and so he he says to me hey I'm not gonna go up I'm sick but if you get back up to camp four there's a couple bottles of oxygen that you could use of mine if you if you somehow get back up there so sure enough pasang bhote is name is shir palace climbing with amazing climber himself we get back up to camp four in the Death Zone and we decide we're gonna go for the summit we call back down to base camp what's the weather forecast and they're like well it's the exact same forecast we told you before it might hold in which case you'll be fine or it might turn into what you guys just survived and if you're not near your tent and you're up on the summit ridge of Everest like it's gonna get like pretty bad and so we kind of go back and forth should we go for it shouldn't we go for it we decide to go for it but this crazy thing happens which is you may have read about this or heard of this if you know much about Everest but basically no one climbed Everest in 2014 or 15 because a huge avalanche killed 16 sharpers in 2014 the mountain was closed and in 2015 there's a huge earthquake in Nepal that shut the climbing season down so no one's even climbed the mountain in two years but all of a sudden because of these weather delays I end up there and there's a hundred people going for the summit on the exact same day so basically traffic jam on the worst choice to feed a traffic jam possible so pasang Bodi and I we go okay let's figure out how to climb this thing we leave camp you know there's a photo that took the leaving camp there's all these lights going up the side of the mountain and it's because there's one rope that everyone works to put in so everyone's using the same rope and all of a sudden we're behind a hundred people and if you stand there windchill minus 40 degrees like we're gonna get frostbite like we're gonna not be able to make it and so pasang Bodi and I look at a term ago let's unclip from the rope and so we actually decided to we actually decided to unclip from the rope climb up all the way to the balcony from the the South call the death stone area was mentioning before up to about 28,000 feet on rope because we actually think it's more dangerous to climb roped next to all the behind all the people than it is to risk a fall you don't know those people right now what they're like and people are coming you're on Everest at 28,000 feet if people are walking I mean one step per minute some times I mean it's it is brutal and so I mean I'm walking maybe two steps every 30 seconds but I'm like Usain Bolt like flying people yeah this is an example of like so you're in it like the world the worst place in the world to be you know in a in a traffic jam as you could see here from this photo I posted that day but anyways I get up to this edge and it finally it's too steep it's too dangerous for us to be unclipped from the rope any longer we're like we're just gonna have to clip in and settle in behind you know we'd passed like 50 or 60 people so we're in a much better place than ever I still have this one big puffy coat that's actually the same puffy coat I used in Antarctica the big like Michelin Man coat and I'm like we're gonna slow down I better put this big jacket on and so I take my jacket off I undo my gloves real quick to put this big jacket on over me to warm myself up and I look down and my right hand is black like just black is black can be and I'm like holy shit like telltale sign of frostbite like oh my god like the same thing we've got school kids following along we got family fun the whole thing and I'm like oh my god like I'm gonna root lose my right hand it's Jenna still gonna love me you know what's my family gonna think and then I don't say anything to purr saying bode I Jam my hand back in these big gloves and I go okay and I don't I don't recommend this thought process but I go well if I'm gonna lose my hand anyways wouldn't it be cooler to lose my hand but also have summited Everest so how black was it I mean it was black like black black yes like me was black did you take a picture of it so so the Sun had was just still the Sun was just below the horizon so it's like dusk and I look down at this point and then the Sun comes up so I Jam my hand back in this club and I don't say anything to pasang podium like let's keep pushing for the summit so we go for the next three hours and the whole time I mind I'm like oh my god I'm such an idiot like I'm gonna lose my hand my hands frostbit and this and that and so we get up and we're about 30 minutes below Mount Everest summit and should be a beautiful moment for me like since a little kid I dream like summiting Everest would be like the greatest accomplishment of my life oh my god and I'm thinking like just in this dark place but I also haven't taken a single photo basically and I'm like well I gotta get like a photo or a video of you know the famous Mount Everest summit so I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video I shoot this short little video which kind of shows this crazy exposure that I'm on like one side 5,000 feet down into China on one side 5,000 feet in Nepal in this tiny little knife-edged Ridge and of course I have to adjust my gloves again yeah this is from the summit and I pull my I pull my GoPro out I have to mess with my gloves put it back in and I look at my hand I start going away from my arms in the air go pasang Bodi my hands back my heads back and he's like what are you doing it just so happened that the the glove warmers in my glove the chemical hand warmers had broken open and the charcoal and the copper filings of the chemical hand warmers had tied my hand Lac oh my hand was completely fine oh good so yeah this clip here if you play from the top is me reaching the summit that's passaic Bodi right there but so when so yeah what did you experience any discomfort in your hands before so your again we're talking about a lot of this podcasts been about mindset which is one of my favorite topics and like just like we said you could convince yourself at the salt man is fixing your foot like I'm on Everest I'm at 28,000 feet my brains not working very well I know that the weather's coming in bad that people are going to get maybe frostbite based on the forecast and I look down and I see my hands black where does my mind go it's like it's not like oh let me think about this my hand warmer must have broken open and this I'm like my hand and it was weird cuz I was like I didn't feel my hand getting cold my hand like feels fine but I'm on Everest my hands black that means you know in my brain I'm like I have frostbite so it's just like it's a weird thing where you can take your mind like this a lot of this that the positivity this my mom went to the negative immediately like your hands gone it's frozen off like the end so happened to the people that died were they on the rope yeah so unfortunately that day the weather actually did get pretty bad later in the day so fortunately I was able to get down before the weather got too bad but the people that died that day one slipped and fell down these ropes over on load C which is the adjacent mountain but somewhat sharing some of the same ropes on the same route and then two people died from altitude sickness so basically either running out of oxygen they're not be able to get back down in their tents I think those people actually did get carried back down to their tents that night and then died in the tent that night some it's called cerebral edema which is basically your brain fills with fluid from being at the high altitude and not getting enough oxygen and it's a it's a killer up there and you know one of the crazy things about being up there is you know you read about it but you really can't rescue somebody very easily up there I mean to carry a human body down and to rescue them is is nearly impossible and I kind of always thought in my mind you know if I saw somebody lying on the ground like I would you know summon the energy to pick them up and I was actually coming back from the summit and I was on the South Summit so just below the Everest summit you know at 28,000 800 feet or something like that and this Brazilian woman who I'd met in base camp named theis who I've become friends with you're in Nepal for a couple months you start talking to people getting friends with other climbers whatever and I see her lying on the ground with her head like lean back in her oxygen mask off to the side and I'm like oh my god like this is the moment that I'm most feared like somebody who I know it was lying here on the side of the mountain and I think to myself I've got to pick her up I've got to pick her up and somehow like carry her down this mountain and I leaned over to grab her and I try with all my might to do anything and I realized I can't move her six inches like I'm completely exhausted muscles aren't working brains not working so I do the only thing I can think to do is I just wrap her in my arms and I say Tice like if you can hear me it's Colin you need to get up you need to get your oxygen mask on you need to start moving like please get up please get up no response she was climbing with a Sherpa another guide right next to her and they were like look like we're having trouble with her oxygen mask but we're gonna fix it like it's coming all right and I was like just kind of going through this intense moment like what do i do how can I help and it's as weirdest you know I'm not proud of it necessary to say but like there was nothing I could do like it's just the most helpless feeling in the world where you want to help the common person you afferent mean this person might be a friend but if any human being is lying on the ground in the snow you're like I want to help this person get down this mountain and I was just I'm so close to on my limit up there the summit there was nothing I could do fortunately she was not one of the people that passed away that day her team did get her oxygen mask on her and she actually made it to the summit back down safely Wow so she went up going up from there which to me is like another whole crazy part of that story but it was an interesting lesson for me in like you know you hear these stories you can't move bodies up there there's nothing you can do the rescue and people have been criticized for not you know doing these crazy rescues when things have gone wrong up there but it really hit home for me like how how hard it would be to move somebody down that mountain from that altitude and so when you're up there you know unlike you know Antarctica I was actually alone in Everest like I said it was pretty crowded day like you're essentially alone up there like if you can't keep putting one foot in front of the other up in the Death Zone there's not not a whole lot that you can do so the three people that died up did they leave them there I'm not sure with those specific people because sometimes they what you can get like a large team of people to slowly lower people down and you know in a weird way it's actually easier to lower a dead body than it is to lower a live person because a dead body you don't have to worry about breaking bones and things like that if you're lowing someone over rocks and things like that yeah so I actually believe those bodies are no longer there but there are quite a few bodies you know still on the mountain and particularly the north side the Chinese so you can climb it from two sides the Nepal side which is more commonly climb where I climb by the Tibet side the Tibet side is known for having a lot more the body still actually on the climbing route for sure so but for me on that I mean that day in a crazy way continues on because I got back down to camp four and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep for the night rest and come back down the mountain usually takes a few days to get back down the mountain at this point you know I've only got one more mountain to climb that can finish my world record the explorers Grand Slam and I was about 2 months ahead of schedule so if I had climbed Denali in the next two months North America's tallest mountain up in Alaska I was going to set this world this world record that I was and so I called back home to Jenna and I was like I made it like I made it and earlier in the day when my hands had gotten frozen I had actually had a heated boot warmers and so I turned the heat and my boot warmers up as hot as possible so I'm like if my hand is prosper and what my feet look like so I cranked those up as hot as possible and so Jenna's like hey like how you doing like you all right we've heard some you know reports over social media that's been a really hard day up there like I'm like yeah I'm alright like no frostbite no injuries like I'm good and like well actually um I earned my feet and she's like Oh frostbite like how bad is it now it's like no not frostbite I actually burned to like silver dollar circles in the bottom to book through my feet from turning my boot warmers up too much and she's like wait let me get this straight like you climb Everest you don't get frostbite but you burn yourself she was like you your feet fire like this is a bad situation but dead she goes on and she was like she literally said the next thing you said to me I will literally never forget in my life but she goes so you're in your tent right you took your boots off and everything and curled up in there I'm like yeah and she's like well I actually need you to put your boots back on I'm like excuse me like I just what like she was like yeah so we've been doing some calculating back home and it just so happens that if you can get to the summit of Denali in the next a week you can set not one but two world records and I was like well that sounds nice but like I'm on the summit of below the summit of Everest how the hell is that gonna work she's like okay put your boots back on down now climb all the way back to base camp there's no time for you to sleep but a helicopter is gonna take you to Kathmandu no time for a hotel no time for a shower but an evening flight it's gonna take you to Dubai to Seattle to Anchorage and instead of having three weeks to climb Denali you'll have three days but if you can do all of that you'll set another world record like ready go so I was disbelief but knowing better than to disobey not only my amazing wife but the planner and logistics expert and running the back and all this I sure enough put my boots back on wipe the slate clean and found myself you know just a hundred hours after standing on the summit of Everest I found myself over in Alaska trying to push up to the summit to to try to set the two world records and not just the one now what kind of recovery does your body need when you exert yourself like that like yeah climbing Everest I would think that your body's most you had to be in some kind of state of shock or I think completely there's there's some clips of me on Denali in those next few days where I'm just absolutely trashed like I'm like like barely eyes open I'm gonna try to push them and I'm this the one benefit I would say there is what most of its not a benefit but I'll people in the positive the one benefit is usually in the high-altitude mountaineering you need to acclimatize so your body creates more red blood cells when you go up into the thinner air to allow you to breathe oxygen better at the higher altitudes a mountain like Denali normally takes three weeks to climb because you're coming from sea level and to get up to 20,000 feet you can't just get dropped off there if you were i right now got dropped off on the summit of Denali we would pass out in a matter of minutes right but because I'm coming from Everest at 29,000 feet it puts Denali into perspective not from a technical mountaineering standpoint is still very dangerous and very challenging mountain in a lot of ways a harder mountain to climb than Everest technically but 20,000 feet my body can handle the rapid ascent a little bit better if I can muster the energy to do it the physiology of my body is actually in a better place to climb higher faster if that makes sense no it does make sense but man so you're when you're done with this what how long did it take you to just feel like a normal person again yeah so I was on Denali I ended up some budding in three days and setting so the explorers grants and was the Seven Summits plus the North and South Pole but the second world record was just the Seven Summits by themselves so even though I went to the poles I still set the speed record for the Seven Summits as well so Seven Summits 131 days and the explorers grants I'm a hunter and 39 and then I returned to Alaska and then home to Portland and honestly it was a good six months until I felt normal again at least and I'm definitely like I said I'm only about five weeks out from Antarctica right now and I I haven't really taken a lot of rest of recovery been on the road still doing various things and you know I'm nowhere near recovered it's gonna take a long time to get back so these these exertions I love them I love pushing my body but you know the the cycle of high performance is also knowing how to recover recover well good nutrition all that and it takes a long time that one took six months and I would imagine this Antarctica recovery is gonna take a long time as well now when you say took six months are you monitoring your physiological levels what are you monitoring and how do you find out like where you're at yeah so I started to do a lot of blood work actually early on in my triathlon career I you know actually early on in my professional triathlon care I mentioned I moved to Australia not long after you know turning pro and coming out of the gate with this win and I had the opportunity to go train with some of the best triathletes in the world is actually an couple world champion is a group of fifteen of us couple of world champions so a female Ironman world champion a couple Olympic medallist made some the top people in the world numbness like up-and-coming professional triathlete and I think it's so cool that I'm like training with the best guys I mean you know it'd be like you know a guy that just gets into the UFC and all the sudden he's training with you know that the top contenders the title guys and like I wanted to really roll hard with them and so I was training super hard to try to keep up with the guys the best guys and I had an amazing month and then I completely fell apart because their level of training were true world-class level and I'm starting out was just too much for me and so we mashed my entire system my testosterone dropped to that level of a 90 year old man I mean I was like had no testosterone in my body and you know went through some serious overtraining which as you know like it that's no joke learn that lesson the hard way and that was one of the you know darkest moments of my athletic career but it's also been a net benefit for me as I've gone you know that was back in 2011 or whatever and these parties world record projects have been in the last couple of years and so I learned from that you know taking it way too much and not learning how to recover to implementing things am I so your question about what did I monitor you know resting heart rate is one that I monitored a lot heart rate variability as well as well as certain blood levels of course around the whole endocrine system the the testosterone levels the you know different hormone levels and things like that so coming back I do blood work ahead of time then come back just it was standard process with the nutrition company they did all his blood work on me so when I left Antarctica before flying home before you know next place I had to go actually was to New York to do the Today Show which was a whole weird thing after being alone in Antarctica to have this type of TV cameras your face that's all other like weird Twilight's in a moment but before I even did that I floated Charlotte where their nutrition Innovation Center is and did all my blood work and so we can have basically this longitudinal study of my blood work to understand it and so I monitor all that and figure out what I'm deficient in what I need where my heart rates at and you know basically a lot of inflammation in my body and needing to kind of rid my body of that and fully recover so when you're coming back from all these summits and all these this time at altitude what has actually happened to your body that causes you to be really depleted for six months like what what's what's happening other than the fact that you were at high altitude low oxygen like what's taking place so one of the things that happens at high altitude that you don't really think about too much which is your body's not getting so the air actually has just as much oxygen in it as it does at sea level but the air is less dense so that means as you breathe in the air you're literally getting less oxygen into your blood it's less dense it's less nitrogen the pressure changes right so the high altitude is actually the pressure that's changing it's not less oxygen there's just as much oxygen but in a less dense form so in the same volume of breath you're getting less actual Oh two into your blood what are you getting our altitude I guess carbon dioxide alright yeah I'm not a doctor like I said you're getting less oxygen your body so what ends up happening is your muscles of course need oxygen to perform so normally if I'm in you know when I'm in my most elite physical shape you know I've resting heart rate during a professional travel and career of like 35 getting out of bed you know 38 low enough that if you weren't a professional athlete you went to a doctor with a heart rate of 35 they'd be like oh my god like you're gonna die there's something wrong with you like it's also a you know a key marker of elite performance you know that of course but what happens is your body can't provides getting so little oxygen even as your blood is acclimatizing you're sleeping with a resting heart rate at altitude on Everest it like ninety hundred beats per minute so you know that's pretty elevated heart rate 24 hours a day and for in my case for a hundred and thirty nine days straight so essentially you're just your heart it's just like Coco Coco Coco cup and coming even at rest and so what that does to your body in terms of you know it throws your hormones around it obviously you lose body weight body fat body composition changes all of those things really shift and happen in a pretty intense way so coming back like actually just getting your heart rate back down getting your you know a pair of simple Norva system to just relax and and stress-free and all that kind of it takes a while for sure so what do you do to help yourself recover when you come back because there's specific kinds of food that you eat or supplements that you take um you know I'll start the few different things that I find to work well one sleep I mean I think that sleep in our culture in general is really underrated I think you know if you go in the corporate world and everyone's like pulled this all night or I work in 120 hours a week I this I that or whatever like you know I'm telling you a story about pushing through the night and going 32 hours straight there's a time and a place for big pushes without sleep but like we are not built to do that sustainably in any way shape or form so in my training when I'm training for these things I prioritize sleep i prioritize taking a nap the same thing when I'm recovering so really making sure I get that sleep its most for me the most natural way to recover on top of that soft tissue work I'm a huge believer in massage as well as chiropractor I've been going to a chiropractor since I was a little kid and to me that makes a big difference just to have everything in alignment everything kind of you know working well efficiently in my body and then yeah supplements you know definitely reducing inflammation so for miguel this' huge so getting those probiotics getting the right stuff in you know it's easy to have you know that leaky gut or things where you're not getting nutrition absorb absorb properly and i think we all in in various states you know you deal with that you know the standard american diet for sure leads to that for a lot of people so getting that nutrition clean and right so yeah sleep rest recovery nutrition and then you know I've definitely been taking a lot of supplements through my life I err more towards the whole food supplements these days but I find you know things like tumeric that really reduce inflammation and you know magnesium definitely helps a lot so there's a few things that I that I take daily but really I think sleep in a clean diet will goes a long way I've you know messed with some cryo before I find that to be pretty good I didn't do that a lot but I've done that in the last couple years a bit so various things but yeah for me sleep diet nutrition is the key to recovery and what kind of foods do you need I'm gonna say eaten clean yeah particular way of eating I'm uh I'm recently doing more of a pescetarian diet so I've mostly cut out meat although that's very I was raised that way my parents have been vegetarians forever Blastoise a pescetarian so they they some fish but no you know no chicken no beef none of that for me I've actually even in Antarctica there was some in my freeze-dried meals there was you know beef and chicken and stuff like that so it's not something I've brought freeze-dried meals as well as bringing those to column bars was the main thing but every dinner I had one freeze-dried meal at the end of the day that was exactly I was a company was alpine area but same thing as a mountain house basically so it's rice noodles mixed with you know chicken or beef but when I say you clean I mostly mean just like eating whole food stuff like not eating not eating processed crap refined sugars that kind of stuff I mean I'm I'm a normal human being so I'm guilty of that as anyone from time to time just grabbing the easiest closest thing but like I said my dad my dad's an organic farmer my mom my stepdad started a chain of natural foods grocery stores when I was a kid so I was really raised around you know you know in the in a sort of hippie co-op days of the natural foods movement which of course now with you know amazona holding Whole Foods is too bored of the mainstream but you know that was what I was raised around and you know eating you know quinoa rice kale you know that those kinds of things being you know whole food nutrition is gone a long way for me protect Lee when I need to recover now do you mess with CBD at all um it's not something I've I've done a lot of I hear amazing things I've definitely not opposed to it at all but I haven't haven't tried what what's your experience been with that I've been experimenting with it for the last couple years it has a pretty profound effect on alleviating soreness especially joint soreness yeah and it also makes you feel good like though the word is that it alleviates anxiety which I don't suffer a lot of but yeah just it makes me feel relaxed did you do you take it orally or do use it exactly I take a like a dropper looks like a dropper I take like whatever they say to take it take like five times more than that yeah did you take it at night like take it during the morning and I take it at night as well okay I just always feel like I'm running my body at redline yeah I'm running my brain at redline so much so whatever they say you need I just double it yeah yeah for almost everything and do you feel like obviously doesn't have the THC effects of it but do you feel like you no no nothing no you're headed clear mind yeah and my THC tolerance is so high it doesn't really right but some forms of it have a small amount of tea and I think there may be some sort of synergistic effect that that happens with the THC combined the CBD that helps people even more because a lot of people that pain is particularly chronic pain they experience a lot of relief from THC from just smoking or vaporizing it or using edibles so I think that the the CBD with a little bit of THC might have a better effect my fighters say that sure no I'm interested in trying the CBD for sure something I should definitely try do you find that it gives you like a sustain like is it relief when it's in your body like am asking relief or do you feel like it actually is like curing the root cause of that inflammation or anxiety I don't think it's masking at all I think it's alleviating the inflammation it's just it's a very healthy thing for your body to eat it's well you know obviously there's a bunch of different oils that will alleviate inflammation or different essential fatty acids and fish oils are very good form information I think anything that you can take that helps your body mitigate inflammation inflammation seems to be a gigantic problem without with just not with pain just with pain but I think also with anxiety I think it's it's entirely possible that feelings of discomfort you know like like when you when you see people that are anxious do you know they often look bloated to me they look like that I think it's just an overall sense of unwellness you know and I think that a poor diet exacerbates that and a good diet can alleviate some of those symptoms and I think that CBD is a big part of that 100% I mean yeah I'm interested to try that first sure I've definitely that inflammation even for me coming back from Antarctica in this court of recovery phase what's weird is like you saw how lean I got then but my body I think because it was so depleted of food source is now actually almost trying to put fat back on my body of like of kind of storing that so actually my body composition feels weird to me right now because my body's like just like trying to figure out where the hell I'm at and I think a lot of that comes from that chronic inflammation and certainly just those elevated cortisol levels of just being so jacked up and redlined like you said just like so wired so finding ways to kind of you know mitigate that I think is crucial I should try it what what form would you recommend trying to drop or for me I like to draw I like it because like there's gel tabs are fine but I think it's unnecessary about is absorbing that the color the cover just got the stuff I'll just go right to the oil and I just think it's the best way to do it but I'm a big fan of Kirk you and to America well I think those are really good try it ashwagandha or any of the last room no tea that I have right here that just wasn't a plant Lyons million mushroom elixir I love this stuff yeah yeah I take this all the time I make a tea out of this yeah I messed with like the cordyceps and the ashwagandha is moving to reduce some of the cortisol like emotional or hormonal balance is type of stuff cordyceps is fantastic too for endurance yes ninety percent yeah we have a prawn it we have a Nanak product called shroom tech sport that has cordyceps B vitamins and a bunch of adaptogens it really gold really has a big impact on me in terms of like how hard I can push in the gym I take it about an hour so before yeah yeah yeah let your body absorb it and it just it just really has a real effect and doesn't give me a jittery thing either yeah it just gives me more energy just kind of take it an hour before kind of knocks your body for that more oxygen uptake is that kind of the idea behind cordyceps that's what I've been told and yeah it came out of high altitude herders they noticed that yeah when they're the cattle were eating certain mushrooms they had more energy huh and so then they that's that's how they started experimenting with this stuff they actually grow it on caterpillars what yeah strange man see if you can find it cordyceps mushrooms grown on Caterpie picturing like this room of caterpillars with like carrying around mushrooms on their back it's real freaky but apparently the way they farm it that's the way they form it they actually grow it on caterpillars huh that's fascinating yeah it's expensive shit but like there it is oh wow look how fucking strange so those at the bottom there that's the caterpillars and there's a mushroom growing out of their head so feeling like thank you I'll take that and they snip that shit off the caterpillars crazy fucking weird man yeah well apparently it works well it does yeah it's you know there's so many Bennet mean Paul Stamets who's been on the podcast before and I can't wait to get him back on again but he's a mycologist and it was one of the best podcasts that i've ever done in terms of like really explaining the benefits of different fungi different mushrooms and different nutritional benefits you can derive from them I mean I I can't agree more just the the the whole food nutrition from many different levels one of its mushrooms that you know tumeric this simple plant derivatives I mean to me they go they go a long way in their pure form for sure yeah what about what do you drink do you drink a lot of water do you drink fruit juices vegetable juices um mostly mostly water to be perfectly honest I do usually start the day with a smoothie of some kind so if we usually just got got fruit in it obviously fruit another thing I put in there is I've been using this stuff that it's actually the company standard process is just coming out with it but they let me try it ahead of time as scarbacks this slow release glucose so it's a protein powder but instead of giving that glucose spike like you would from a refined sugar or something like that it's kind of a long burn long-chain glucose I don't know the full chemistry of that but I find it makes a big difference rather than kind of just getting that sugar spike early in the day it actually kind of gives a slow release of energy and I was using that was actually in the column bars as well and I really like that particularly for endurance because you know if you start like taking the the goop packets or something like that you get that spike of a hundred calories you get that like quick like boom burst of energy reply's replenishes your glucose stores but this I feel like this is a much slower cleaner burn and it lasts a longer for technically you know for for anaerobic stuff I mean maybe you need kind of that more explosive power or whatever you know different things for that but for some of like low heart rate zone 1 zone 2 like long grinding type of stuff that I do in the mountains are pulling this sled or whatever I find it's really good for stuff like that now what scares me about people like you is how old do you know 33 okay you're very young I'll take that this is this is what I'm worried I'm worried that you've already done so much crazy shit that you have to push past the crazy shit you've already done and you've already been on Everest it sounds like you were kind of like you weren't on death's door but you opened the front gate yeah you open the front gate you were on the lawn yeah yeah I'm on death's lawn sure you know absolutely I mean I said that people were literally died that day you know it's what you try to do next this is this is the question like yeah do you some crazy shit in your head right now you're like okay now I'm going to the moon with a fucking balloon you know it's funny it's twofold it's an interesting intersection I appreciate that that you call me call me young I'll take that all day long but 51 so you are yes sir to me well I guess in terms of an athlete terms right you know you're in the you're in the the peak yeah the peak for endurance athletes and it's fun to be here but I also think it's a moment in time where a little bit of a little bit I'll say I won't give myself too much credit but a little bit of wisdom meets also athletic performance a moment in time where I've had enough experience enough setbacks ups and downs and success of course with the world records and things I have but to really take stock of what's important to me and what I've realized more and more is I'm super curious about pushing a limit to my own potential 100% we've talked about that I love that but I actually don't think of myself so much as a risk taker or an adrenaline junkie I really what I think about it like these things are really methodical yes I know you know they're practice they're there and not to say there's not risk you saw me trying to set up my tent that tent flies away like I'm screwed like I'm in a bad way what would you do would you run after it I mean you that thing is gone yeah you know you hit that you hit the ejector button on the call the plane I hope they can find you type of thing and even that's like their storm like that unlikely they're gonna get there but for me what I'm honestly most excited about next yes I have some other projects that I'm marinating in my mind do I have other expeditions sure I haven't haven't they're not fully crystallized enough to announce right here Oh for stability but you know I've got some ideas but more so like I'm excited about you know sharing what I've learned like I said that wisdom meets high-performance of actually having an ability now like I said when I started this I had you know my friends following me on Instagram and I'm starting have ability to share this story people are asking for me to you know take interviews I'm writing a book right now lots of my learnings going into that kind of stuff of really really having an ability to pass this on because for me as fun as it is for me to push my own limits like I what really inspires me what really fires me up is when when I get emails or notes from people like hey man I watched you cross the nordica I haven't been to the gym in five years and like I've gone every single day since that or I'm trail running now or like I started that business I never said I was going to star or whatever so having an ability to have a moment in time when I can share some of my learnings you know with the world and meaningful different contents that that really excites me you know I love the opportunity to do that but man like for sure there's some other there's some other events on the horizon as well but but yeah it's not just about one upping the next thing I think that that's a losing proposition in the long run of always trying to do the bigger badder craziest thing because when the stakes are like you said the razor's line between life and death you keep one-upping yourself enough you know you don't you don't make it to the end of a long life unfortunately and I'm not trying to have that be the end well it sounds like you've already broken world records you very you you you're in this weird place where you've accomplished so much that in order to accomplish other things they if you're gonna take it to the next level it really has to be truly life-threatening you have any recommendations do you want to come now say I'm moving to the next stage of life that doesn't involve risking your life I don't know you seem like a nice guy don't anything to happen to you okay give me give me some wisdom you've got a couple almost a couple decades on me if you if you are whispering in the ear of your 33 year old self how about this you know you've you've had an interesting path if you're whispering into the air of your 33 self what would be some advice that you would give yourself that you'd be happy that you lived out over the next 20 years well I mean obviously life experience when you have life experience learn those lessons become a better person be better at communicating be better at everything you do mm-hmm but the problem with what you're doing and it's not a problem but in in this context is that you're pushing these incredible endurance records in nature and particularly in cold weather and this is what's stunning about these things is that you're risking your life it's not that it's just difficult like running in ultramarathon is incredibly difficult right sure but what you're doing is not just incredibly difficult you're doing it in these incredibly harsh environments and particularly in Antarctica you don't have any relief there's nothing no one's gonna help you like you said your tent flows away like you might very well be fucked yes right Oh much I know you are yeah right I don't know what you could do that would one-up that this is the problem is like your your one up margin of error is you're in this very strange sort of stratosphere yeah of one up ax tude maybe maybe it's um you know we take a page out of the Bruce Springsteen glory day song and just you know kick might kick my feet up and talk about the glory days for the rest of the time you don't have to do that but the thing is I mean don't listen to me man do whatever you want to do obviously you're going to you're not going to listen to me but you could do you would apply this sort of mental fortitude that you've demonstrated and this ability to push it things you could apply it to anything yeah it doesn't have to be these physical feats of risking death and in frigid cold temperatures in the middle of the fucking nowhere or literally at the bottom of the planet Earth ya know and and that's to me that's actually that's why it's exciting because for me yes are there some other physical expressions that I want to have in the world for sure and I have some ideas like I said but and it's not necessarily trying to one-up the next thing but it's also why it's exciting to me the lessons that I try to learn that I try to share with other people like you said are universal lessons but they also if I revert them back to my own self are also universal lessons in my own life so like you said it's like hey like what's the next thing I'm super passionate about if you I have the confidence to sit with a whiteboard with no money no resources no background an incredibly supportive fiancee at the time now wife who's like down to like ride or die with me and go into this with me like and we created what we did we did something that people literally wrote about and said this is impossible people have died trying this you can't do it and we've achieved it it gives me confidence not that I can do some other crazy physical thing but it gives me confidence like cool like I want to start I want to start a business that makes millions of dollars like cool like let's figure out how to do that let's let's do the equivalent of writing into Google what's the difference between PR and market you know like let's do that so you know as I as I you know do a ton of public speaking now write this book the things are things I'm doing that's super fun to share those with the world so I'm having a lot of fun doing that and actually sharing the universal truths and the wisdom that I've learned that I think can it be applied different ways but it also goes to now I get to have the fun of applying those in all of those other different ways of my life and so you know for me I think that the the future is bright particularly if I don't I don't really think of myself as this endemic core outdoor athlete it's very easy to put me in that box it's very easy to say like cool so you climb mountains you're a mountain climbers like but four years ago I'd never really climb mountains but I happen to do something about it so well I've never been in the polar region that's why this British guy was looking at me like oh ha ha ha young boy I've spent all this time in Antarctica you'll never survive this and like I wanted to survive it but like I finished first like I beat him but on today's did you beat him by two and half days but like I'm not sitting here going like you know I'm fascinated by Antarctica what I like to go back someday absolutely but I'm not like calling O'Brady the polar explorer only you know it's like what else can I explore that actually presses me I mean I love to learn I love to learn about the mind explore that there's so many different ways to express that that I'm just excited of what the future holds and lots of different verticals well listen I think you could fucking do anything I think it's very clear what you've already accomplished you could literally do anything you want but I want to I want to see you live yeah me too what about how about this how about you break some crazy endurance running feats how about that some ultra marathon feels a little bit safer yes worst things gonna happen Eve you're really fucking tired maybe maybe the next thing is I mean me I'm not the funniest guy in the world what do you think about comedy I mean I know a big piece you know should I get back out there on the stage listen if you can communicate and you can make people laugh you can make a group of people laugh you could do stand-up comedy it's just a matter of taking steps and figuring it out and writing stuff out and I mean you've got a lot of fucking stories for sure no I mean just how about getting on stage in front of people and telling people that you're the first person to cross an article i foot fifty two days like what in the fuck I do a lot of that I'd enjoy that I love public speaking I do a lot of that corporations kids everything that's well trust me I do it know you could do that it's fun no I have to say I gotta give a shout out if you definitely don't remember this but I actually have met you once before about seven years ago in a tiny little comedy club you did a bit out in Portland a small little venom sure you do way bigger fish yes great and at the time was funny I was thinking about it I was driving over I was like wow it's this bit and you were doing this bit up out hey there to love it but the reason I was there actually was when I first started training for triathlon professionally I started training with this guy named Phil Claude who was training a couple of UFC fighters at time remember this guy named Mike Pierce who fought yes yeah locally as well and so I didn't know a lot about MMA I still certainly am NOT as well-versed as you are but I got in this gym my coach was like hey you're gonna start training with these MMA guys and I was like you know what like I'm a skinny little triathlete these guys like you know brawlers but I was man was i impressed like talk about a multi sport true multi sport right and all the different disciplines I don't have to tell you this obviously but I was blown away about how strong they were became good buddies and Mike said to me he was like hey man I'm going to this comedy show this guy named Joe Rogan's gonna be doing his comedy come listen to him so I you know you made me laugh back then so mad respect and yeah it was a fun fun to see into that world a little bit well thanks man I guarantee you could do that but if you still want to do endurance things like please do something where you're not gonna die that's all that's just yeah I've made it back here safe and salad so you had the goal I mean like I said the goal is not to keep one up in myself right I mean I think that it is that part of the danger of this kind of endeavor it means you you really have one-upped I mean you've done some crazy one up and man for sure like I said I think that it if if I only thought of myself as a professional athlete and that was my identity was tied up in that I think we see that across the spectrum of professional athletes in general of people just going hey I'm a pro athlete and the second I'm not even if they banked millions of dollars as an NBA player or something like that their whole identity disappears with that feat of athleticism I read a really interesting article today that I was really compelled by actually which was a story about Kevin Durant that was on espn.com this morning and it's about him and his business manager and a couple other guys it has kind of gotten around him and like dude you're like one of the best you know basketball players in the world MVP but he's already thinking about all the various things that he's doing you know in his life and what I loved about that article is there like you know Sports Center back in the day used to be guys you know hitting homeruns dunking basketballs which of course it still is that but they'll intersperse that with like Kevin Durant just made a you know venture investment in this company or like there this watermelon you know water brain or their this or that and so I think sports particularly with the growth of social media with storytime with media with content with all the other ways we can share the insights which isn't just the game which isn't just me in the arena pulling the sled but it's actually a way to connect with people whether that's in the sense of Kevin Durant making incredible venture investments in companies or that's with storytelling that actually reaches you know universal truth with people you know I've got you know a single mother from Nebraska reaching out to me and saying like hey I don't care about mountains or the outdoors but like I'm going through some hard stuff like in the middle of the country being a single mother and your story connects with me thank you for giving me the inspiration to keep pushing forward so for me it extends beyond just this athlete in this arena because we have all these other ways to story tell to create content to you know and be involved in businesses and things like that so that's where my mind's at next it hasn't fully crystallized into the most concrete of plans but the ability to explore all these different mediums and just having sort of this sports be the catalyst for growth in that way is what I'm really passionate about that's awesome man and whatever your plans are I have a hundred percent confidence in you you're an inspiration man thank you very much thanks brother really appreciate it man and tell everybody your
