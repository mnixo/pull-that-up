all right CT we live what's up hey finally finally across the table from Joe Rogan my pleasure man I watch your Netflix documentary too it's great man it's intense thank you very much you know when I first saw it I was like was this gonna be about but you get into it you're like whoa there's a lot going on in this documentary there's big guys there's more than fuck it's not just that it's like they just went they went deep into your life and to everything the struggles the heart condition the whole deal man yeah cheffy they did a pretty good job yeah so where you stand now like health-wise oh okay yeah I fought my way back and just recently this tune had another setback had another major setback and a heart attack out of the blue and I thought I was a goner again Joe but I'm still here so you had a heart attack they fixed your heart they put in an artificial valve and then what happened with the second okay that lasted for 12 years I had Oh 5 I had two surgeries open-heart surgery actually passed away or flatline three times during that surgery and then this past June how did the blue I'm thinking wow this is not really out of the blue I kind of had a few signs but I thought like you know I didn't think it was that serious I'm gonna had another heart attack sitting on the couch at home and I thought I was done for sure me well what's confusing to a lot of people is you're obviously this like intense healthy guy and you're you're fit and you're lifting weights and you look at jacked like is it a condition that you were born with a genetic condition it is most definitely hereditary my mother and all nine of her siblings all passed away from heart related problems and my mom had the CHF and lungs and you know so none of them lived past a 72 you know my mom died at 63 all passed away how old you know I'm pa and so you've gotten through two of them so far yeah so far and what did they do after the second heart attack well they the next thing I had a pacemaker installed and I got two already had metal valve and I think they've done just about all we can do to this oh just one I got with me now so they tell me the next step is a transplant man yeah but you know what it's not so intense for me I think I have a van and bandaged to somebody else who might be give me news and that advantage is I've been through so much already man until you know it's just and when you flatline three times there ain't too much else Kim you know throw you for too many loops I got a lot of faith yeah now um so you are you in line for transplant now how that works yeah well it's a really long process to even get on the list so I'm going you know through that process now mom I'm almost through the end but it's a really long process they presented my case to the doctors who perform the actual transplant and they said that I'm a good candidate and everything's looking up right now except I may have a little throwback I had a cancer biopsy yesterday and if that's positive then that's gonna hold me up a little bit Jesus Christ yeah fuck yeah it's just crazy because when you look at a guy like you and you know you look at you when you especially when you're in your prime you think there's nothing's gonna stop this guy shit I didn't think so I mean I feel like your muscles are strong your heart's a muscle shit his heart's got to be ridiculous yeah I thought it was indestructible Joe but obviously I was wrong well you pretty much mean correct me if I'm wrong but you pretty much became famous from the internet right no launched you right definitely now I mean nobody knew who I was so I got when I was 53 and I was 53 years or when I was world champion nobody new or gay fuck about whoo that's pretty much when I found out about ya and you like when you first started making YouTube videos that's when I found out about you I think someone on Twitter sent me a you know like people send me cool shit on Twitter all the time you know I can retweet it or I'll find out about it and send it to other people and someone sent me some well I've seen a bunch of your videos but one of them was you working out with tyron woodley you have been welterweight champion alright Jesus Christ he's gonna break them all these crazy super sets and all this different shit and so if you worked with a lot of MMA fighters not a lot but a few and oh man so we are we gonna talk about the fake feud that no that wasn't it yeah we could talk about it but it didn't it wasn't a fake fight yeah oh man really your light is killing me keeps lighting your way so we gotta talk about it and gotta talk about people thought that we were really upset at each other yeah I I was the debate was and this is a constant debate in MMA whether big muscles in enhance you or hurt you and my my take on it is they do both my take on it is the bigger the muscle the more power you haven't I think Tyron is a perfect example of a guy who's figured out how to use them perfectly like what he does is he conserves his energy and when he Sprint's you can't stop him so like when he's in there in the cage and he has these moments of explosion the amount of horsepower that he can generate in a short period of time is just above and beyond everybody else in the division and it's a terrifying thing for everybody in the division but he can't operate at the same pace constantly like some of the guys can some of the guys who have less muscle decaying around less mass they have less oxygen requirements they they can go longer but they just can't generate the same kind of power but what tyrants figured out how to do pretty brilliantly is how to conserve his energy into these bursts and and then now like his big criticism earlier in his career was that he would gas out as he got into the later rounds but now he's able to fight five rounds no problem he just fights it at his pace exactly but that's not exactly I want to start it quits too okay now for all the people all the people who said I will never be able to sit down across the table from Gerald I want to take a special moment to say fuck y'all right now I'm here and and I attacked Joe Rogan on the internet I attacked him and I want to expect got the opportunity to explain to you it's true I dared attack Joe Rogan and I want I have the opportunity explain to you why exactly I did that okay and I want to do that because I don't want you think I'm just an asshole no I didn't think you're an asshole at all it didn't bother me at all okay didn't change my feelings I never attacked you back no you sure did you but you know what you did to toe but then I couldn't get you to do before that was you actually talk to me to talk to you know that I had people you know cuz I'm really cool with a lot of UFC fighters and I said I even know but I had people that was especially set out to keep tagging you until you we're gonna get you on the podcast see people get on the podcast is to get a bunch of people to try to get you a job hey Julie won't tell our CTO and I you know my response is always you know Joe he probably don't even know who the fuck I am man just you know quit tag you don't even know who the fuck I am just quit tagging don't bother the man that was my you know response to them all the time all the times I said look don't behind the job he's busy you don't know the fuck I am I'm not you know not in that league so don't even bother them then then I said well you know what I got these fighters I know all these fighters and they friendly with ya maybe Joe do know who I am just don't like my so when the tyron woodley pain came up until talkin like the muscular guy I said well you know here's my options a Joe you don't know what the fuck you're talkin as soon as I could I said that my fuckin oh the fuck you talkin about baby responded to I responded because I liked you oh I responded really it didn't that's why I didn't attack you back yeah I get why people here's a thing I get what people would think that I don't respond cuz I don't like you I just can't keep up no man I miss being hella good so I found out I have 1.6 million fake followers though if apparently that's not a real good measurement you know the Twitter audit it's just people don't use their account to tweet maybe these check Twitter I don't know I don't know whether or not but I've never paid for any of the fake ones we don't know there might be Russian bots I don't know what it is but there's too many people look at my mentions and and then at least one percent of them are asshole so you read one assholes things like fuck this phone down so it's it's not a matter of like me not liking people it's a matter of me being in an impossible situation there's no way I can keep up you're only one guy I am the only one guy I don't let anybody fuck with my Twitter nobody's nobody's doing that that's all me yeah so this if you get a tweet from me it's from me well I don't I just no way I can keep up with all of them so people that try to talk to me and get a hold of me if you think I'm ignoring you it's just I'm ignoring everything yeah well I wanted to get your attention I was trying to get that that's what so that's why I came out with the attack and that worked I was trying to be nice for my asshole oh man I said okay Joe you're absolutely right I jumped oh yeah I shoulda jumped on you like that but we do we do possess a little difference of opinion on the muscle guys tell me what you think okay I was trying to explain that yeah I know you have to have known guys like this that are naturally naturally just more muscular yes more built and they look like they lift weights and work but they don't write guys like you know I know this guy Herschel Walker sure outstanding athlete you know and both Jackson for example these guys fantastic athletes muscular very muscle guys but I think if you were born born must good there's a difference in a guy that goes into gym and works out three four hours a day and adds muscle and he started out you know normal guy but these guys if you were born with that muscle then you were born with the cardiovascular system the lungs and whatnot to support that muscle and it's yeah take it way way back to guys like Jim Thorpe okay head and shoulders above all the other athletes of his era because he was born that way so he was born the good Lord give us the cardio pastors in the lungs and everything too you know to go along with that extra muscle that we were born with in some cases in some cases now I thought that you were making a blanket statement and it covered a lot of you know the all muscular guys are gonna tire out because of the extra muscle and I disagree because I think if they were born with that muscle then they were born with the support system to support them us I think there's a lot of logic to that I think it makes sense but I do think that if you have a certain amount of muscle like there's just no way you are going to be you're gonna have the the same cardiovascular capabilities to someone that's bit like a marathon runner you're not gonna have the marathon runner has there's advantages and disadvantages I think to all sorts of body types especially when it comes to fighting there's a big advantage to being powerful scary look at you look at a guy like would leave gosh shit you know like you know you can't stop him like the only thing that's gonna stop him is him getting tired or you got to catch him when he's coming in right he's just faster than you stronger than you so there's there's benefits to that but I think that when it comes to like there's no never gonna see a marathon runner that's built like Woodley they just don't exist so even though he has the the cardiovascular system and the support system that's designed for that build that he's born with he's still never going to be able to compete with like an elite triathlete cuz then your body has to be smaller you have to have less oxygen requirements less weight that you're carrying around there's just no there's no way but there's benefits there's certain it's a real it's a real like balancing act I think at MMA because you have to have some muscle you have to be able to get guys off you you have to be able to get up from the bottom you have to be able to explode you have to be able to close the distance quickly there's a lot of like real benefits to being powerful but then there's you know it's it's like a it's a balancing act you know yeah you right but here we go it's not just muscle you don't see marathon runners that are you know 250 pounds either they can be fat smooth butterball and and still you know not it's not because of the musculature that they think you know just bigger guy period would have a hard time being a marathon for sure so the the musculature that's what we have a little I don't think it's the musculature because that muscles here if you're born if you're just born more muscular and then little kids in grade school and you see some of the kids are gonna have a six-pack they're gonna just be built better than the other kids yeah and then if they're too if you're at that muscle you were born with that muscle in my opinion it's just my opinion joke if you were born with that muscle in that musculature it's not you know it's not gonna be detrimental in your system is made for you know it's a good little major system able and it's a bit but you're right you won't see anybody built like Chiron will be running in the New York Marathon or when in the New York and running for hours and 20 minutes really yeah yeah you want you right but I think that that's just a bigger person period yeah you know how they defined or the definition in a musculature you know I I know boss root and I talked to boss routing a little bit about it and I say man boss you a bit like a fucking statue and shit and he you know he was quick but I don't live way to and I said you prove it my point right if you were born that way you didn't go in the gym and lift weight he proved my point that's right you don't you know you didn't get that muscle from going in the gym and pumping iron and get you were born that way and so well he was born that way but boss also does a tremendous amount of plyos like a lot of explosive stuff like all of his bad work you ever see boss hit the bag yes and everything he does he does like with a thousand percent effort so you know his workouts like he would tell me that the way he would work out was when he would prepare for a five minute round when he would start to get in shape he would go as hard as he could for like a minute and then like be exhausted and then he would work himself up to a minute and a half then work himself up to two minutes and then by the end of his training camp he'd go five minutes full clip I'm like that's fucking crazy method but in you know against that his boss's body started to deteriorate because he's so goddamn tough like he has no cartilage in his knees his needs a completely shot he kept shooting cortisone on all of his joints like whenever he'd have injuries so his joints are all fucked up it has got tendinitis everywhere just his mind was too strong for like the vehicle that it was carrying his mind around Wow yeah yeah the best of all time yeah what do you think about Matt Hughes I love my OK house he built he's feel like a tank you ever seen him gas out well no no but you know Matt Hughes in his day I mean I see how to put this like first of all he's not built like a tank like maybe the way woodleigh's bill is a little bit it's more slight than Woodley but still pretty goddamn thick but also like what he was able to do to was he was such a good wrestler he was able to dictate where the fight takes place and a good wrestler can control situations take guys down and then you know once you're on top like you get a break you know you can you could rest and then you know he'd use his ground and pound and submit guys he was one of the first guys ever to there was a high-level wrestler that started submitting dudes yeah submitted George st. Pierre good friend of mine to also built really well shit he was pretty damn good yeah you make you make my point it's just I just think there's a there's requirements right yeah and if you if you can get into a physical shape where you can use those muscles the way you need to do you know the way you need to do inside the Octagon I mean there's a there's obviously great benefit to be muscular well I think that guys that were naturally born like that and I said I think st. Pierre mhm and he was both or I mean it wasn't matter farm boy oh yeah yeah I think those guys were born sure it's just like yeah yeah and if you're born if you're born like that then I think you know but the guys are going the gym and put on muscle they add the muscles or what they call built I can't built muscle so they're super hands smaller frame yeah you got that built muscle that built muscle tires out real fast and I agree with you a hundred percent on a guy that has built more so that went into the gym pumped on and got his muscles that way I agree 100% Joey absolutely correct he's gonna tire out those added all muscles ox is gonna suck the win he's gonna be tired he's fuckin no time are you aware of Francis in Ghana oh yeah he's fighting this weekend and Francis in Ghana just broke the world record for the most power ever shown in a punch they have this machine that they use worldwide it's widely accepted that is like one of the best ways to measure a punching system there's large pad and you hit it with full power and it generates in Francis and Ghana beat the second place by some some insane amount of power I mean he's a ridiculously powerful dude oh my god he's he scares the shit out of everybody here he is ready so they they show this is this thing it shows what the original world record was and then in in Ghana broke it by like 3,000 pounds oh he's terrifying you know they found this dude he was a homeless guy if he was home he was homeless living in France and he made his way into a gym I believe he wanted a box and when they brought him in so I guess his see one hundred and twenty nine thousand one hundred and sixty one units the previous one was 114 thousand like Wow and Tyrone Spong who's a beast yeah and so Francis and Ghana who's fighting this weekend who is fighting so fantastic for any predicts chaos yeah I mean I don't we were talking I was talking about this on my anime podcast that Elster's been stopped I think in ma MMA he's been stopped at least 11 times and I think he's been stopped three or four times in kickboxing as well it's like 14 Kos plus knocked out in his career either TKO to knocked out like that's the guy that's got to be worried about getting hit by the guy who's got the world-record punch yeah it's gonna be a youth and exuberance versus experienced craftiness that's what it's going to be oh yeah the consequences of Alistar getting hit Thor so brave and Ghana is so terrifying yeah yeah it's you think I mean yeah he's very pretty good yeah it's very interesting I mean Ghana was supposed to fight Junior dos Santos at one point which is also a really interesting fight but I think the Alistair Overeem fight is more dangerous for him but also it's gonna let everybody know because allister's at the top of the heap in the heavyweight division right and Ghana can get by ouster most likely he'll get a shot at the title right so what do you think his ground game well we don't know too much about whether then he submitted one guy in the Octagon and you know we know that he does have submission skills he was one fight by submission I think Anthony Hamilton but I think you know he's first of all every fight starts standing up you know yeah you guys drew hell to get that guy to go good luck you know and he's been taken down before and survived and came back to knock the guy out so and he's also you know still learning and growing yeah pretty much yeah he's only been doing it for a few years he's terrifying yeah yeah well you know what I think he represents I think he represents a real world-class athlete that's fighting in MMA whereas like maybe that guy would have gone to football or somewhere else in another era yeah yeah for sure now that MMA is you know it's like I said think the same thing about John Jones like John Jones I think could have done anything but John Jones got into MMA and you see what happens when you see a real world-class athlete oh man I like time and I got to meet him a few times and he told me that he listens to me before he goes out and you know before it goes out and fight and I thought I was a real honor for him to say today he likes this I am the one speech that I did and you know he's a saint along with me sleeping standing there yelling in his phone and kills people does yeah I hope he I hope he sorts all his problems out I don't know what's what the fuck's going on with this recent you know positive drug test so we'll see it seems like the only guy that can beat John Jones well that's what he used to say about Tyson yeah you won all of your world records drug-free yeah a hundred percent drug-free I jug free for 37 38 years but I did trying I did try ruins in 1980 or 81 I believe it was well before we came in league I tried but you try I tried I went to a doctor and I don't know if I should say this fuckers name because it might still be bitter still I was saying doctor did Arnold and all the guys were in the magazines you know I thought everybody was drug-free I didn't think you know right I didn't think nobody talks it's a weird thing about those magazines right yeah chain amino acid yeah oh fucking man I couldn't wait before I'll get someone to meet so they got me for sure I want a couple little contests and a guy the guy who's promoting the contest came to me and said he was what are you taking CT and I had 20 inch arms you know then I thought everybody I thought every fucking buying I've seen those magazines are on red files what's drug free he goes what are you taking and I told him to me no assets in shit and and he goes oh man what what kind of steroids are you taking I said what's that and he said you don't know [Laughter] doctor and and gave me an address and everything and I said I don't know if I'd say the doctor's name but I still remember and I went to the doctor guy looked in my nose and ears and shit and listened to my lungs and gave me a prescription for deca yeah gave me four scripts for some decade arrival and I took it right the Kaiser pharmacy and pharmacist I said you know what this is and I said yes fucking steroids up thinking he said yeah that's bad you don't need this shit look I want to give me try I wanna be a professional bodybuilder they tell me if I want to be a professional and be like Arnold Franklin the rest guy I gotta take this shit so I want to take it any gave it to me we grudgingly fill the prescription I take it home and I take my decade and then went back the doctor mm-hmm and gave me office for tests started taking testosterone and did you notice a difference fuck yes yeah fuck yes I know the difference I think you got off of it yeah I got off of it but I had I have reasons I had reasons and we won't show you what those words sure okay if it worked the definitely work I got fucking hard as you know just tight as fuck and but I'd also I don't know if it does it and deserts to everyone to people when I told telling about their surprise I know you you must have been an asshole before him and that's quite quite possibly true because I was a pretty much an asshole because of the way I was raised you know I had a bad attitude going in so when I got on saying it amped it seemed to amplify my bad attitude hmmmm I had a short fuse like was a fighter yes he fighting short fuse determined yeah yeah well I should had that nickname way before head fat fucking short fuse big time and everything everything pissed me off so I had a really bad attitude I was married at the time you know I had a real bad attitude with my wife and she couldn't do shit wrong so I mean nothing in it and but okay that that was part of it and another big big fucking thing with me is what I love more than muscles and lifting weights and fast cars and I love all that shit it is sex and a big giant big old giant why I rolled over to have sex and nothing was happening I say fuck these steroids take this this anything rather be 110 pounds soaking wet and still be able to you know give him a boner yeah fuck that you know so it must have affected you lifting to because what comes is a giant dip in your natural testosterone once you get off of it it was you know I decided yeah I don't fuck this shit fuck what you want for a total of six months but what they do is they totes back then you do two months on and two months off so it took longer so I do two months on it take two months off two months on tomorrow that was the protocol yeah that's what they told sigh that's what doctor man whatever his name is talk talk dude so I was told six months but it took you no longer nigga that two months off in between to my song and that stuff it fucked you definitely definitely what when what they don't tell you is when you stop taking this shit we just stopped taking a cold turkey like that every fucking thing that you gained during that time and I came you know I was ready for I had one like little small body burn counters I thought I was ready for fucking mr. America after this shit you know my old fuck I'm I just got so much tighter and had more veins and shit than ever and I'm like oh man this is great shit but when we get off that shit everything that you came you lose it and then some I lost are any strength gains that I might have my tag aunt got from her any harm except me I had to start from lower than where I was before I started taking it because you just yeah they say you do gain something and you keep something once your body normalizes you know you do have some sort of gains it's one of the arguments that they say about people that have taken steroids and guy off of them that if you can normalize your testosterone you're still gonna have an advantage over people that have never taken it before but I don't know general I don't know how true that is I felt like that every single thing game that I possibly I think I I mean I felt like I lost ground actually because I just stopped you know cold turkey and I think I actually lost ground it's supposed to wean yourself off so but you know but I'm telling you when I roll over you know I'm fucking 21 years old and I thought that sex every day was the normal right I mean you just that's what you get married that's one of the benefits and if I don't if I can't have sex every day then you know it something's wrong I just that was my normal normal thing and I'm proud preciate it my wife at the time probably didn't think that but she had a break when the steroid things we got a little break for the first time ever egos like no no no no anything that's gonna fuck with that fuck that's what gets people back on it a lot of yeah get psychologically addicted of course I mean who I mean you you you Jack and I talked about it you know and I was I was interviewing magazine articles and stuff a few times when I was growing being back lianna I brought it up in the articles I never thought it was anything to hide you know or anything like that I said yeah you know I I wish that I had never done it I wish I could say now that I look back wish I could say I had I have a perfectly clean record like my training partner Richard Sherman for twenty we've trained together for 20 years and this guy perfect record never even tried it he was stronger than me his his mind was stronger than mine I peer pressure and wanting to be in the magazines and wanting to make a living doing something that I love instead of punching a clock every fucking day that that appeal was too great for me as a young guy for me to pass it up I wanted to do something that I loved and make money at it way back then but now I'm not working at the post office for 28 years well it makes sense I mean it definitely makes sense that the appeal would be so strong and so it's a very it works I mean that's the big reason why people want to take it out of sports and I don't know if you ever watched that documentary that's on Netflix called Icarus have you seen that no I have Icarus is all about the Russian anti-doping state-sponsored program the Russian well I should say Pro doping gave steroids to every single one of their athletes make s'mores it's a crazy documentary man because the guy Brian Fogle who's the director is also he's in it because he was an amateur cyclists and what he wanted to do is an experiment so he ran or he cycled this race one year totally clean and then the next year he went to this Russian doctor and said just fucking juice me up to the gills let's do this and they just shot him up with everything and in the process of him getting to know this doctor the scandal broke out about the Sochi Olympics about the Russians cheated during the Sochi Olympics and it's all documented in this film as the news is breaking and then the guy who's the Russian doctor has to flee Russia he leaves his family behind they take his family's house in there they take all their money and they're basically making his family homeless to try to get him to come back to Russia he's in protective custody in America right now and he detailed the entire program everyone was hot everyone was on something they 113 it's hilarious they just took some of the medals away and the medals they took with the most bullshit medals like they took like for bullshit medals away but they kept the real shit it's bullshit indeed I I did see big strong fast yeah yeah right because they're Pro steroids right right yeah that is interesting yeah approach there and a lot of people are yeah well the argument is I mean see I see it for in terms of fair competition I see the argument against it for fair competition that makes sense but like I also see the argument in terms of like if you're gonna be taking amino acids and creatine and all these different things that do give you some sort of a benefit why not take the shit that gives you the real benefit well I you know Joe I I don't find fault with people who decide to take roids because like I said I'm 21 year old kid and I took them so how the fuck can I write talk shit about anybody who decides to make the same decision and then I did that many years ago you know I'd be a hypocrite asshole right if I was you know to do that as long as everybody in the competition that you're in whatever that competition might be if you fuckin flippin pies or whatever whatever the fuck it is cut and grab whatever fuck it is if everybody else in there is doing it then then it's a level playing field but when you got guys that are trying to compete naturally right against guys they're not then it becomes unfair so if they if they have a division and they do it a lot in these weightlifting contests and things now they have divisions that are called natural divisions and they actually test for steroids and stuff like that and maybe they should do something like that for the fighters today we don't actually guys if you want fuckers you just come on in here and whatever you bring with break they're kind of doing that in Japan really yeah Japan has an organization called Rison where it's essentially an offshoot of pride or at least some of the people are involved it that we're involved in pride and pride like I had ensign anyway on the podcast he was talking about his pride contract he said it specifically stated we will not test you for steroids and shit like some fuckin animals ride was in a lot of ways in a lot of people's eyes that was the Golden Age of MMA in terms of just sheer performance oh man but you gotta wonder like all those guys like phaidor and cro cop and all those guys in their prime like how much shit were they on were they on things I mean nobody wants to talk about it that's in the game yeah in the contract I don't suspect that you know maybe they possibly were perhaps and you know and people want to say it like fate or who most people think is like the greatest heavyweight of all time or at least it's an argument right he he was real good friends with Putin who is at the head of the Russian doping state-sponsored doping program like what are the odds that they just let him compete clean like what are the odds I didn't juice him up yeah they're not testing you know I don't know he goes well you say that but in the early days he sure as fuck did really and you pull up that picture of phaidor with the kettlebells was a famous picture of him you know he was a big proponent of hidden lift weights per se well I did like kettlebell exercises which are wait yeah yeah not like you know benchpress rank that shed curls he did a lot of plyos and a lot of explosive strength training exercises and things like that but this when you look at this picture like he was pretty fucking jacked anyone definitely Mac you fucking yeah yeah yeah exactly he was built and in his early fights he was very built and then later in his career there's a lot of things going on later in his career but it seems like when he came to America one of the first things he did if I if he was ever on anything before he wasn't on it when he came to America it looks like you also stopped weight training and only concentrating on sports specific exercises which a lot of people disagree with some people say that you have to have some kind of weight training you have to have some sort of strength and conditioning program I would you know of course I'm from that good background I would say yes yeah I would agree with that I think so too I think you need both and I think you certainly need a skill that's the but in order to really highlight that skill you got to have that body up to full potential you got to be peaking you got to be ready to rock and roll my boy Matt Mitrione Mitrione yeah that's a huge feather in his cap my buddy yeah I love that guy he's hilarious Oh funny funny super cool yeah yeah funny doing that lunch together and I have to know I'm even better and we have been talking and shit and I get to talk to a lot of a lot of fighters man I really uh well you're an inspirational dude you know people like you yeah you know I'm just blessed man ak I tell you what though I have no idea why that you know the first video I did for you to the Strongs me never heard I don't know why people watched it I'll tell you why because it's fuel everybody who wants to do something in their life has ups and downs and we need fuel like I'll tell you I got some fuel today when you were in front of those kids in Compton and you were talking them about obsession being a good thing if you want to be great at anything I wanted to shut that fucking TV off and go run the hills and the fuel like that is important for people like you've seen someone like you get fired up and talk about things it energizes the people that are watching like every time he put out one of those YouTube videos and a million people watch it how many of those million people engaged in an activity that maybe they weren't gonna do that day how many of them went to the gym when they weren't gonna go to the gym how many of them just decided to get their fucking career in order get their life in order to get their shit together when they maybe weren't like we need each other people need each other yeah in a weird way you know people need people like you you know what what's the reason why I surprised jokes because I told him right in the video if you don't like what I'm saying turn to my fuck off perfect look I didn't even I didn't know that they paid you you know the YouTube was I broke his fuck anyway I was walking back and forth to the gym to train people I didn't happen I was a horrible personal trainer people would come you know first of all I went to try to get job as a personal trainer a lot of different gyms and they would ask me if I had my certificate and I said look I'm a six-time world champion I don't need a fucking certificate I know either lift weights and they go oh yes you do motherfucker certificate get on I would leave with my little my little plaques and shit under my arm you know I got I got turned down a bunch of time and then finally I went to a hardcore gym that's eight UCT foot J ya know I had to go to it but I went to these change in so when they turned me down breaking those oh my god come in they say hey at one session one session they paid me for a month but they trade one time with me and they're like hey no hey if you know pussy fuck pussy out that fucking fast take your fucking ass back on here's your money take your fucking money go and I needed that fucking money - Joe I needed it bad man like I said I was walking because when I had my got harkened I used up all my sick leave and stuff I working at the post off all the sick leave and they let me go they let me go from it anything is you can't get let go from a government job it's bullshit the king so they let you go because yes sir well I used up all my sick leave and everything then I had a rough recovery the recovery was rough so I I stayed out too long they gave me so much I stayed out too long my son Max it exactly was all worn out and they actually let me go but before they let me go they granted me full you know health health related they gave it to me for the for a year and yeah everything for a year and then unexplainably the same doctor who granted didn't which was their doctor took it away a year later so a year later broke his fuck I don't got no time and I got no pain if it's after working for 28 years there I don't got no kind of retirement no no so I'm walking around this one I'm trying to get a personal training job and walk around tiny person training I mean they finally gave me one at a hardcore gym and gave me a personal training job I mean like I said I didn't have very many clients at all the guys that I called original iron addicts or the guys that stuck with me and you know you've not put them through hell they liked it they come back for more they think those are guys that I call that reason why iron eggs yeah there's some people that are just not gonna have the mental fortitude for that but your your that's like for someone starting out it's kind of crazy to you know I mean what you were saying to those kids is very important like there's a difference between the kind of effort and focus that you want to put in in order to get yourself fit I just want to be in good shape I just want to be able to do 10 push-ups and 10 chin ups and normal shit there's a difference between that person and the type of person that's gonna seek out excellence some persons gonna go to a guy like you and go I just want every day to give 100% I want to drain myself on that bench I want to drain myself at that squat rack I want to have nothing left when I leave here can you do that no like three weeks ago joints are a kid and your body's falling apart I don't know fuck you CPM keep the money man sometimes I mean it we show it once and I didn't see them no more no explanation no didn't even say one first time you going to the bathroom I never seen normal did you get a lot of injuries when you were training um no I was lucky in in that you know my first career as a power lifter I didn't get injured I never had any injuries and I didn't you know wrap up or really really that's crazy and quick bones my bones were really strong and tendons no shoulder problems no shoulder problems wow that's not even Dorian the Dorian Yates all fucked up now I had him on the podcast and one of his arms is just jacked he can't do push-ups anymore as shoulders all fucked up and all the connective tissues torn off the bone and just wow yeah it's amazing that you don't you must have excellent genetics in that's that's the that's what I created - exactly it's just the genetics I mean as much as my dad and I hated him growing up I got a credit buddy flirted for that man now I hated to do growing up that was a big part of your documentary man that was intense you know when you would tell that story about getting it done because you were supposed to go and apologize to the teacher because you had said some of the teacher you were disagreeing about evolution and your father got mad at you and said you're gonna go apologize to the teacher but the teacher was sick yeah and you didn't even get a chance to say no she was sick you just said no and he broke her nose yeah like that that's a heart-wrenching story as a father yeah yeah that's uh that's buddy fuckers rule right there man I mean he tell you to do something goddamn too bad to do yeah so when I when I went after you know growing up like that I was I grew up in fear you know I was afraid of my dad all the time and but growing up with in the Buddy fletcher's household when I went into military was piece of cake I was used to it I was already you know used to yes sir no sir standing at attention and saluting and sitting and doing impossible shit or whatever you asked me to fucking do I was already used to it so Wow the army was you know shit already been doing of guys crying he doing this my whole fucking life no problem how did you get on YouTube Oh a guy came into the gym in into the gym and he said his name was a Raj Babu I gave Raj credit for that he was a strength project and he had a big file already on YouTube me said hey can I interview you for you to know what the fuck is you too and he said well it's this social media thing and I might add one question can I say whatever fucker I want to say and he said yeah you can say whatever fuck you when I said connect us to say yes cuz all you want to I said fuck it is all think about how that works so like one thing leads to all these other things like that guy coming in and talking to you led to you inspiring countless millions of people that's crazy it is absolutely crazy I never thought I never thought in a million years you know that something like that would happen I never did you know I always worn it as a kid it's funny I wanted to inspire people that my dad was a preacher you know he's a Korean War vet and a preacher so I grew up soup in a super religious household super religious everything was the same every fucking thing was the same when he didn't do shit you know dating girls i was a-sayin going to the movies ever seen listen to whatever kind of music that was for one guys for music it was a sin listen I'm telling you everything is a fucking saying so but you know buddy Fletcher is you know I recently since this last heart attack I recently went to him I was waiting for 58 years to hear an apology from him that was never gonna come and it was eating me up jokes it telling me the fucking pieces man because I was you know being an old dude I would wake up at night punching and kicking and shit and I'm still fighting buddy Fletcher 56 57 you know years old I'm still fighting this too because I'm still carrying around this hate I hated them but it was okay because the hate was neutral I don't think I just hated anything hate me he told me he got what he got up in church and he made an announcement he said hey look I know what it is between that sign which was mean and pointed me at that sign right there he I get along with the rest of you know my other brothers no no problem buddy he hated me and he says because he's so much like me that's why I hate him they want you to know that that's why we can't get along I hate you because you're so much like yeah so I was like hey no problem I hate us too she has never worked it out oh yes we did we did but it was uh have you seen a movie I hadn't it wasn't worked out during the movie I still didn't like him during the movie they asked him uh they asked him I didn't have any good recollections of when you see T growing up it's time do you have me find recollections of you and see T you know as a kid and Out Boy I was looking at him Charles wait now where I really I really wanted to hear if he was gonna fabricate something right because I didn't have none and I'm like I was with this motherfucker girl say this question and he and I was like okay cool you know long but I was ready to stop the fucking movie and just make an ass out of myself like no yes bullshit we ain't met you name one fucking time we ever did anything pleasurable together motherfucker and I was ready to go off but he didn't have any so won't even have any files okay now that's the same recollection and I had been but I really didn't forgive him until his last heart attack in June and what happened then when I had the heart attack in June and it seemed like a revelation came to me and was like I'm it's not hurting him it's not hurting him at all my dad is 86 years old he's fine man he's but I don't he's like you know I don't think he thinks that he has anything to be sorry for I think he thinks he's he's done a fantastic job of raising me and I was just waiting on apology was never gonna come but but it was still the hate that I have for him what's eating me up I had to get that burden off me and I think having that last harder I didn't want to die carrying that burden with me of hate so I went to my dad and I asked him to forgive me whoa yeah damn yeah how did you say that I say you know look dad I have brain - I told that I recently had a heart attack and I have blamed you my entire life for a whole lot of things that went bad or went wrong you know that I always you know blames you first and I'm and I'm sorry you know I don't you know I don't want to blame me for that anymore and would you please forgive me for carrying this against you for me you know my whole life I don't wanna die you know letting you think that you know I love you man yeah I can't I don't wake up punching and shit anymore I probably be out of breath if I did anyway but I don't wake up with those night when I haven't had that nightmare since then he was a fully accepting of my party he graced me he was graciously accepted my apology so so do you communicate regularly no no no still don't communicate regularly I just really wanted to you know get that off my chest release the breath yeah I just really wanted to get that off my chest and get the release that burden and you know I'll probably try to communicate more after I get this new heart you know it's it's kind of fucked up but in a way and I don't know why this is but sometimes people that have gone through terrible childhoods they recognize what it means to be a good father oh I see you with your kids I see it in the documentary and I see how you kids around you here yeah yeah I think they can't wait well except they wanted me to Rogen - but yeah we have a super super time you know I want to make sure that was if somebody asked my kid you know 20 years a man what do you have any fine memories of your dad in your childhood how you go I want to make sure that they got plenty of fucking fine memories well if they can say you know my dad was my dad we did this together my dad was he was love me to death I never had one doubt in my mind my dad loved the shit out of me I don't want my kids are cool you know like I guess why I put four for extra effort to make sure that you know that's not gonna happen so in some sort of a way it turned out to be positive because you're such a doting father you're so you're so into it I mean so obvious that it's like you the the negative consequences of how your dad treated you like it came out of you the opposite way yeah I made it I made it a fucking point man cuz it's miserable on that kid but but also John you know what good came out of that the childhood that the kind of childhood that I went through I get it I'm sure what I get is just 1/10 of what you get but there's so many thousand thousands of people that contact me telling me hey man my dad you know I had a fucked-up childhood and I see how you were able to come out of that or some kids kids contact me now that I'm going through a fucked-up childhood 16 and and because you made it cuz you ain't so dad when I look back and I actually think why did I have to go through this well how did I have to have such a far a fucked-up childhood it's because of that because I can talk about my childhood and it helps so many other people so many other kids alone although I look back on it now and I say it was so worth it that wasn't even funny man it's so worth it everything that I had to go through I wanted to hide every time I heard my dad's keys in the door wanting to just you know run away from fucking homework I hate you know hated my childhood but it was so worth it everything was so worth just being able to help one kid who might be going through the same thing is so fucking worth it I counted as a blessing it's just a place seeing that right there that attitude this is reason why people are attracted to you because you really do like helping people like you really do you're happy that you suffered so that you could help other people that is one of the reasons why people are so attracted to you Wow yeah I guess hey let's turn me to fuck off but you're just trying to weed out the weak I mean and weed out the famous not even the weak it's the people that aren't willing to take the leap well you can't have any excuse it's like the excuses are a real problem with people oh my god real problem because you give yourself a way out like you can fail at things you could try and not be able to do it but the excuses for why you can't do it or while you're going to fail while you don't feel up to it today or while you're tired or why you have other things on your mind while you have other things you have to deal with first before you can start working out that's all bullshit oh yeah and I told they needed to hear it I need to hear that shit because they create their own boundaries they create their own borders to create their own obstacles to create their own things that cannot be surpassed and so all those things are just products of the mind and it's just the ego protecting you from failure from protecting you from that horrible feeling that you need to experience in order to move forward if you want to move forward you got to experience some falls you got it slip you got to fall down you got to get back up you got to you got to try and fail cuz if you don't fail that means you weren't trying hard enough because nobody's just fucking excellent at everything all the time good person that means at one point in your life you fucked up there's no other way around it there's no no one's just great from the womb no one unless you're the Dalai Lama or Buddha or some shit no one is great from the womb at anything that's correct being a human being an athlete being a whatever a doctor or whatever the fuck you are trying to do you're gonna if it's difficult to do you're gonna fuck up along the way and some people can't handle the fuck up they can't handle it absolutely don't even try you don't even try the candle oh it's my thyroid so it's you know I just I have a problem with my metabolism or oh you know I chronic fatigue syndrome just fucking get up and go just one foot in front of the other keep moving move it yeah tomorrow do more good night good morning alarm clock that means you get up you know get the fuck up no press that button get the fuck up and go and if you don't have it an out if it's impossible to not get the fuck up and go then you just do it you just don't allow that other part don't allow that I'm gonna hit the snooze button fucking snooze button is the worst shit that's ever do you really feel better after 9 minutes get your fucking ass about the goddamn baby that's one thing here's a business for you you should do ring tones ringing tones and alarms we can alarm a Ct Fletcher alarm every morning we're go instead of beep beep beep beep just you saying get your fucking ass why don't we have no excuses you know what this I do something similar to that yeah yeah people out my whole life for nothing and I got this doing a book cameo iron addicts book camo calm you can fire me on any people are paid 25 bucks I think I'm 34 35 one of them for me to cut some out for two minutes two minutes straight on custom I'm telling you call them all kind of motherfuckers for nothing yeah and now you know people pay me to do it man and it is wonderful it is wonderful you know one guy told me and once you touch my ex-wife yeah yeah yeah sorry fights so I had to let head to let her know right up front hey this is not me singing no no I not me saying it this is Gregory and Greg he said he stole Eve him the fuck alone and he is not interested in your ugly ass no more stop stalking a bitch but this shooting make sure was Gregory in that way yeah well I really think that those videos that you do are very important I really do you know I just I think that inspiration this like a people for some reason there's there's a bunch of people that like to mock that stuff they like to and most of those people are out of shape yeah yeah they like to mock that and they like to make fun of it and and I'm not talking about comedians I'm talking to you know which is they could be really funny doing that but I'm talking about there's a lot of people that sincerity like for whatever reason bothers them and sincerity when it comes to inspiration and motivation and those kind of things like some and for some people some people overdo it let go to some people's pages and their Instagram page is all bunch of quotes yeah other people saying shit it's fine every now and then every now and yeah it's like it's like your diet yeah you know it's okay to eat a piece of cake every now and then don't eat cake all day but minor pate and cake and if you see just nothing but inspirational memes all day long you like this is not working anymore they don't they don't get in right no too much but a real person a real person like you who's already accomplished a shitload of things who understands the benefits of real hard work and intensity and focus when you do those videos man I get fired up I get fired the fuck up I see those videos and I just want to go to the gym right away and see I didn't even know who the fuck out when you get mad yeah we don't even know who the fuck I am no people know who the fuck you are man I mean how many millions of people have seen your videos oh maybe one or two yeah yeah you know I've seen it and wait way more than I ever thought would that's for sure cuz I mean you go on YouTube you tell people they turn me to fuck up all right how many people gonna keep watching it more fucking says turn me the fuck I don't give a fuck if you watch me or not you don't like what the fuck I'm saying turn it off motherfucker the ones you want oh my god the ones you want are gonna keep watching yeah rush I've been able to travel the world man and due to this due to arrive by food coming in to measure him yeah going all over the world an army base up in the Russia Australia Germany I've been all over the fucking place fuck you CT so many people at the airport in Russia they all had beers they all have fake beards at the women men everything about 120 people met me at the airport and here's this poor kid from Compton you know and that who a lot of times I didn't think I was gonna make it out of my childhood to go to Russia and have all these people with these beards on your honesty your motherfucking said man you know it's like sometime I think I actually did die on the operating table and now I'm in heaven man I'm just this is my heaven yeah I mean sighs Wow it's just fantastic it is unbelievable and I'm sitting across the fucking tape from Joe roll I'm sitting across the table from Ct Fletcher after always one fucking said oh yeah there's this big giant food between Joe he'll never you'll never be on everybody who said I'd never be on this show fuck yeah it didn't bother me for a second I was never upset at you at all and I could see your point of view and I could see why you would be upset at my point of view I get it it didn't bother me at all I don't take things very personally no you know and immediately when you responded me I said hey girl you're absolutely 100% right you know it was III just want I really wanted to get through attention man more than anything I thought I did feel you know I felt we had a little difference it's a slight difference because I agree with about 90% of what you say it's just a slight difference that we don't agree on and as soon as you say hey maybe we can be attacked me like a fucking wild man yes yep IBO you're absolutely right apologize right I shoulda came at you that way yeah that was that was indeed a few right now maybe I can I be on your fucking show yeah we're doing this patreon campaign which I'm gonna be honest with you until I hate to ask anybody for anything I hate that I I've been in kind I've had a job I mean I'm working job since I was 12 years old and 12 years old I've worked in a gas station pumping gas and it was during fucking gas crisis when the gas lines are super long but I've always worked for I hate this patreon campaign is like asking people to help me you know now that I'm not able to travel the world I'm not able to get out there and promote things like I used to patreon is a way that they can support me and it's called defying death I wanted to call it my last will and testament because if if I don't if I'm not successful in my fighting and and if I don't get a hard transfer I do get a heart transplant and rejects with and I'm dead I have a record like there's a wreck you know and I thought last one tells me the best thing to call it because if I lose the fight then people can go back and see and hopefully get something they can see how I faced you know you hear a lot of people I have so many people telling me Oh City don't worry about with we're praying for you we got your back you know but hey none of that matters when you're in that operating room man I appreciate the good wishes and the goodwill and all that but in him you gotta face it's it's a solo experience you have to face death your everybody will you have to face death on your own and nobody else can step in and die for you or it's how you deal with it so this is a permanent record of how I deal with you know being in a situation where I could possibly die and I want people to be able to look at it just in case I make it don't make it whatever they can look back I think what this is how CT built with this is he's he's facing a transplant he didn't make it but he went in with a shit ton of faith and he believed he was gonna make it he was believed it was gonna make it and if I don't make it fucking I'm gonna run about it anyway you guys all this shit they won't do but I went in with a very positive attitude I want to be able to see that now when they do a heart transplant Auk to anybody that's had a heart transplant yes I have yeah yeah and you know that those are the people that I really really want to hear from yeah because they can he and I appreciate it I get a shit shit ton of well wishes and support and I think from iron eggs all across the planet I mean they all behind me and I really really appreciate but I actually it's easy for me so hey Joe be tough you're going through you I know you're going through this thing Joe but I want you to be tough on to the hang tough and I want you that you know I'm roof but have I actually gone through when I'm asked the circumstance that you're facing the difficulty to facing right now have I actually had any experience with it cuz it's hard for me to listen to you to tell me to you'll be strong and be tough about getting into heart transplant and you know ain't everything but a fucking hangnail if you've actually been through something then I can listen to you a lot better it's like a fighter a guy who's never been in a fight trying to tell the fighter what to do right in his next cage right and you're getting there I want you to put this on put them right that fight yeah I'm not gonna be listening too hard to a muhfucka don't have no experience right experiences to me still the best teacher especially something like a hard trip yeah an outfit what percentage of people have ever even had mean how many people have successful heart transplants a year do you know you know I've tried to look it up but they don't give you too many numbers on I think that the survival rate is 75 for the first no I think it's higher 80% for the first year now it was lower you know years ago but now it's up to 80% survive for the first year and you grow some pretty intense drugs just to keep your body from rejecting the organ right definitely but I'm taking a shitload of drugs right now what do you have to take now I have 15 different people 15 different drugs and I take every day just just to survive what are they all for to kick water off my bones a little my precious kid all kind of fucking different pills and just they supposedly help me function and sometimes I honestly think they fucked me up someone fucking nervous it's hard for me to you know function properly on a daily basis just a day of feeling normal if I can feel normal for the whole day oh that's fantastic me not good or you know great I feel great today like there's no such thing as me getting up saying I had I had a fucking great day today but if I can just feel normal for that day then that's fantastic and this is since June yeah so before June you were fun even with the artificial heart valve I wouldn't say I was I was yes for for 11 and a half of those years but six months prior to the heart attack I had signs so you started feeling it coming yeah yeah Hanson do you do any cardio or were you doing any cardio before not really I can you know the way I workout is kind of Carter you'd be sweating you know a big puddle of sweat on the floor like Kali muscle I remember I put him through a workout I trained a lot of pro wrestlers and stuff too when I put them through the workout and Kali Muslim I had the best he's achieved williger's that was the best way you said damn CT fucking crazy man but that was the best anyway Griffin Show yeah right exactly Callie was a fear factor yeah was he yeah I didn't know yeah yeah dude he fell off of a car what didn't work they haven't suspended over a success but see we can find that giant it was a one of those stunts where you had to carry your own weight like climbing over things oh no he's like close to 305 yeah he's always doing that it's just is the wrong stuff yeah no he's I adopted big guy he's got an interesting story himself oh my god YouTube story yeah yeah hell of a story he's real real good and and getting invited me the same way on and off youtube yeah he was a very friendly guy when I met him I enjoyed talking to him a lot he's jacked his fuck oh yeah definitely definitely yeah yeah I've interviewed the more my favorite interviews was Royce Gracie really yeah I got the interview always crazy and it was incredibly we had some incredible similarities in our train of thought and how we think you know he took yeah he told me that on the day of a fight he made no plans for after the fight no plans no we're going out to dinner we're gonna celebrate none of that he was he said I was completely 100% prepared to die in that octagon in a way that that resonated with me so hard because I remember my last contest you know they told me about my heart valve in the 90s in 95 on my last Congress greatest bench press in America they say you know mr. fuck you can go out there and in front of all those people and and you valve could break burst and you could die right there on the bench press in front of all those people are you gonna go and I Joe I looked at him I said fuck yeah I'm going are you I took my doctor look at me like I'm crazy I'm looking at him like he crazy what a glorious way what a glorious way to go out doing what I fucking love to do what I trained to do my whole fucking life in front of all these people oh man I couldn't ask if I was writing a movie script we couldn't be any better Wow fucking guy right there on state in front of every fucking body bitch bridge so I felt the same way I felt the same way before he's crazy it just really made me feel good but I wasn't the only crazy motherfucker on the planet he's definitely crazy he's the most important figure in the history of martial arts I think so his UFC one in 1993 changed the world yeah change the world because people thought that you had to be like the bigger guy and then all sudden he showed that no there's this thing called Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and it's dude coming out wearing pajamas just gonna fuck all yeah changed the world of martial arts everybody started trained jiu-jitsu oh my god you know what it was I had no idea what it was no idea yeah as soon as it came out I was like I'm enrolled I went to Carlton I went to Hicks and Gracie's first then the Carlson Gracie is yeah yeah and I think that is why I'm finna blow some smoke up but the Joe I think that's why you're such a fantastic analyst I think that's why you're the best at what you do because you get your ass in there and actually experiencing you know when you say a hold or you see I own a plot or whatever it you know what the fuck you're talking about and I think that helps but I think I'm very very fortunate that I have a series of jobs that help each other yeah and that like being a comedian be able to talk on stage in front of all those people I'm comfortable again I'm comfortable in front of a microphone doing a podcast I'm gonna kind I'm comfortable and I love MMA obviously a man of martial arts so this get it's my chance to express myself about something I really enjoy and I don't I don't feel burdened down by the moment of like the camera on me right oh yeah performing in front of the live audience and you'd be a comedian or or what you do for the us way way easier is I wouldn't say it's easy because you have to have you have to understand what you're talking about you have to have a lot of information in your head and you have to really care again it's my job just to represent the experience that these guys are going through when I when I think about commentary I'm thinking about these guys been through months of training camp they've dieted they've you know cut weight just to get down to their weight class they've rehydrated there's only so much emotions and intensity it's just my job to honor their experience and to do my best to make it fun for the fans at home and make it dramatic that's all my job there they have the hard job my job is just to not fuck up and to try to describe it in the best way that I can it's way easier than stand-up I the live art of shit I know I'm just being well I can imagine going around the world giving speeches and said and in seminars in front of live audiences it's much easier for me and I'm this is a big-ass thing but as much easier from you said cross-table joerger talked to him and he used to do those people you know shooting all kind of questions that means yes right it's gonna be odd for you to experiences late in life - if I was 21 I couldn't do it I had to sit across the table from Georgia 21 years I'd be too fucking petrified to do it I think you would talking I think you would loosen up and they need to be yourself it's happy choked up for a while maybe tight on that we just people people relax no I don't think so I was too too wound up emotionally as a 21 year - who is it oh man you know I could imagine I was talking with a buddy of mine because I started stand-up at 21 and I was like what the fuck that I have to talk about when I was 21 I didn't know shit yeah I started 21 Wow I don't know a fucking thing so he's now 35 what if I can fit you all best I started in August 27 1988 Wow I dyed my beard for Joe Rogan looks good it's fucking all Anders fucked man what's it like when you don't die it's why it is fuck is it yeah give me Santa Claus a run for it yeah I know I know just for me I better start paying me for this fucking shit man I've been advertised for them fucker for years they should yeah get in there with that comb yeah work it out making that shit black so how often do you do your YouTube videos no uh we release a new one every Saturday and they have changed so much your last week I had a cooking show oh yeah yeah yeah you're doing all vegan diet now huh well you know I can't call myself vegan I called myself plant-based I started out saying I was digging a dinner and I realized how crazy and vegan folks is and I say you know I'm not vegan because I'm not doing it because I'm thinking about the animals and you know being a fuck guys up about that shit super serious my god I'm I'm not doing it because of that I'm doing it for there's a lot of people that are vegan that are vegan for the right reasons they're vegan because of conscientious because they want to do it for health because they want to have the least amount of impact on the environment because they want didn't want animals to die but then there's a lot of people that are vegan that really just belong to something they could have been in Scientology Oh in a Mooney they could have been anything they found that and they ran with it and now they are fucking ruthless against people that aren't in that group and they generally give like good-hearted kind-hearted vegans a bad name oh it's a small percentage but a lot of these motherfuckers they have like vegan in their online name and they're you know and they attack like you look at their comments they're all attacking oh yeah they're just angry people that found a reason to be aggressive personal you can found a green light oh this person is not vegan I can attack them and you're the reason why the world your the response Aleutian no the crime did you know that if you were vegan that this would be less suffering there's me oh my god and they do the worst job of promoting veganism because people see those crazy assholes and then they go fuck these people yeah I'm gonna go eat a steak just shoot this fucking cow yeah I didn't want to be associated with them that radical part of at all so I stop saying I'm being I just don't eat meat I would like to get you connected to some real nutrition experts that could break down why that might not be the best idea and what what is important in your diet in terms of like essential fatty acids and healthy fats in terms of like like a lot of people think that refined carbohydrates are the big problem with heart disease refined carbohydrates and sugar is what contributes to heart disease do you know the whole thing that came out pretty recently in the New York Times did an expose about the sugar industry having paid off scientists in the 1950s to put the blame on saturated fats and and cholesterol instead of sugar and then yeah is a complete total fabricated conspiracy by the sugar industry because they were they were doing these tests and they were realizing like holy shit like sugar fucks people up it's terrible for you and so what they did is they literally bribed scientists and not that much money which is kind of crazy in the 1950s they paid them something around fifty thousand dollars and I don't even know if it's fifty thousand dollars today I think it was the equivalent of fifty thousand and these people just fabricated these reports and got everybody convinced that saturated fat which is an essential part of the human diet and cholesterol which is the literally the substrate for hormone production like cholesterol is important for your body right and that these things are responsible for heart disease and not sugar refined sugar and refined carbohydrates they're completely unnatural in the human body you're not supposed to be able to just scoop up a fucking tablespoon full of sugar and dump it in your mouth it's not real in the world like if you get sugar in the world it's attached to an apple you know as you can carbohydrates it's in plants its fiber you're eating thin your body knows how to process that your body doesn't know what the fuck to do with bread especially the bread that we eat today you sprayed down with fucking all sorts of shit to prevent pesticide all these pesticides and it's they change the wheat and made it more more complex gluten so your body is a hard time processing it there's a lot of bad food it's safe to say you're not a vegan no I'm not a vegan but I respect the people that are doing it because they're doing it because they don't want to cause harm and I respect the people that are doing it think they're doing it for their health but I've talked to a lot of vegans that were formerly Ving especially Chris Kresser who is an actual scientist and is one of the leading experts on the real issue with the vegan dye and how it does work for some people some people with their biological requirements and their their physical requirements in terms of like what their activity is they function fine on a vegan diet as long as they're careful they make sure they get enough b12 they make sure they get their fatty acids make sure they get their essential fatty acids from coconuts and flaxseed oil and all there's a little you know avocado there's a lot of different ways you can get oils for your body but your body needs that shit it's essential there's like a lot of essential things I would love to connect you with these guys and I'm open to yeah I'm very open to it I changed my outlook you know after his last heart attack I change my outlook completely that's that's what made me even try the plant-based diet you know I had a have a supplement company that's an explain it's a hardcore hardcore sports it's billed as for the hardest core motherfuckers on this kind of shit yeah you know pre workouts and pumps and stuff but after I asked her I started another brand Odyssey nutriceuticals it's completely different I named it Odyssey because that's what I consider my life is is it in front of difference I got one hell of a Odyssey going on but anyway it's a plant-based protein you know it's very health conscious it's a very health counting instance I'm a fan of plant-based protein I think protein is really good I love hemp protein that's my favorite I think hemp protein is very easy for you to body to digest the real problem with a lot of plant proteins is I mean if you just eat just plants especially eating Whole Foods you're not necessary or body's not breaking it down the same way your body would break down a steak say or a grass-fed beef I'm gonna send you a sample my love to get and you tell me what you think and I can see nutraceuticals Odyssey nutraceuticals calm and go check it out get that sitting before you kick me off you know when we were going back and forth I remember one of the questions that I had to ask you I said what is is why m FS what the fuck is that because it's something under your thing all the time and when you told me I was laughing motherfuck it's exactly what it stands for joke I love that but if you it's really based on my mom and my mom's reason wrong I'm not completely retarded I mean I think I'm saying my retarded but I'm completely all retarded is that's not a guy shouldn't say I still allow it okay thank you it doesn't mean disease right dummy yeah completely you know retarded believer in intent I think your words should just be noises that you make that convey intent I don't think there should be magic noises oh that was deep you said people are too sensitive and then on top of that people are looking to tell you to not say certain words that the are bored is the wrong word now it's problematic today oh my god yeah so it came from my mom my mom was I tell you her now all the siblings died from heart-related problem so she was sick most of her adult life most I swear I remember mostly I'm in very early when I'm very young my mom being healthy but she was sick most of her adult life most of my memories of mom when she was sick but everyday everyday and I mean she was really sick in and out of Mercy rooms and said if you ask my mom hey mrs. Fletcher horn she would say I'm blessed her standard answer was always I'm blessed yeah and the reason she told me reason why she would say that is because I'm still alive I'm not dead so if I'm still alive I you know I still have life I still can go on I still could make it change I still could make it different so it's I got it from her no matter what the situation how bad it may seem people complain when you're still alive motherfucker so you said is your life and you're still alive you still have a chance to make it different you're still going what's the worst thing that happened I could die okay well if you ain't dead mother fucking keep going yeah so she was blessed and that's why I always you know people how you doing see to come past no matter what the folks born I'm still alive so I'm blessed that's awesome that people need to hear that they do need to hear that and they need to hear your attitude about excuses because both of those things are very important it's very important for people to process cuz a lot of people have like bad patterns in their mind these bad patterns are just the way they've interacted with the world the way they've approached all sorts of different problems they have these patterns and they fall right into these patterns and maybe they learn these patterns from their family member that maybe they learn these patterns from their environment maybe these patterns are like defense mechanisms to keep them from challenging themselves but you got to recognize what those are it's not you like you're not a lazy fuck but you've been behaving like a lazy fuck okay well you are as a human right you could be anything you could just decide to me you know the story of David Goggins David Goggin maybe see I just recently licked the money was super fast yep fully out of shape like like literally like on death's door health-wise but decided yeah enough is enough just literally in his own mind decided he was gonna win the world record for chin-ups dear decided he's gonna be like this incredible endurance athlete did it just did it just does it just forces his mind and he has this thing that he says that I think about whenever I'm tired he said most people quit at 40% yeah you know but you couldn't go further you can't go further yeah man yeah I just recently read on and watched a video of him somebody to me I love those guys those people are important you gotta know that those people are out there and him in particular he's really important because he was super out of shape yeah it's not like he was always his ripped super athlete like he was like fat and terrible diet and poor health and poor depression the whole deal yeah just yeah tighten it up fucking beside yes decided to yeah yeah that's you and anybody can do that all the people out there that think they're lazy know you've been behaving like a lazy person you've been following lazy patterns if you just decide tomorrow first of all if you decide tomorrow you're gonna be a disciplined focused person don't expect to have the kind of energy that someone who's been disciplined and focused for years has cuz you're not going to guess we're not gonna you're body's not gonna be conditioned for it your mind is not going to be accustomed to this train but you can still do it right you just you just get tired quicker and then hopefully by next week you'll have more endurance and then by the week after that you'll have more and if you keep building six months from now you'll be unrecognizable that's right if you stay clear you definitely everything's gonna start from right that's why you're important that's why your videos are so important because your videos I guaran-fucking-tee it I don't know the number but I want to say a hundred thousand people probably watch your videos and change their life I guarantee you I don't really live more than I I bet you've changed people's entire outlook on things that's that's everything in this life this is a little because you can get information books are wonderful documentaries one for what's really great is inspiration though the fuel the little push just a little push just to get you moving sometimes that's all it needs man next thing you know it you and people like you because you've had a lifetime of this discipline and dedication and obsession that that reinforces it in people's heads like I want to do what CT does I want to be like that I want to have that kind of energy and focus Joe Weber started I thought about getting in the Octagon yourself I'm too old now I almost did at one point in time but not at this point no you know what earlier yeah well when I was kickboxing man I got a lot of fucking headaches and I was really worried I came from a real meathead gym and we did like hard sparring and I did a lot of heart spawn this one kid in particular who is a really good boxer and we beat the fuck out of each other oh and the problem is like I would go home and you know this was going on over a few years I would go home in my head would be pounding just boom boom boom lying in bed and I was thinking what am i doing myself am I gonna be stupid when I get older am I gonna not know where I am I gonna be stumbling on my words I was terrified of brain damage yeah cuz I I've always been I've always been a very curious person and I've always been fascinated by the way you can change the way you think about things and by beings that's why I'm so excited about talking to you like inspiration and and motivation and even information like having these things in your mind you can forge these things together to to make your mind go in a certain direction so the quality of my thoughts has always been very very important to me because I know that that's what made me successful in all the different areas that I've chosen to pursue it's like the quality of your thinking and being able to recognize what's good and what's bad but the mind itself if the mind itself is compromised then you're not gonna be able to do all those things you want to do be able to appreciate life if you don't remember where you are and you don't know how to talk anymore and I was around people that I was watching their ability to talk and their their cognitive function decay so fighting is its glorious but you've got to know when to stop you got to know when to stop and for me when I was when I stopped is 1989 there was no UFC there was no money there was no money in kickboxing like I think I got offered a fight for 500 bucks and that that was I was doing amateur fights and I got offered a pro fighter like mad been 400 bucks I don't remember how much it was but I was like what yeah I was like that's crazy look at my train for months and maybe get my ass kicked and maybe get head kicked for like 400 bucks yeah and I was getting these headaches and the headaches were bad man and so I just decided early on if the UFC was around back then I'm most certain I would have pursued it but glad it wasn't you did Wooper fans asked one time didn't you don't you a fan well not a fan a guy talking shit oh the guy on fear factor no I just grabbed him he I thought he was gonna hit me I didn't hurt him no no I just tied him up yeah Mike Lynch I was thinking of choking him but I was like I better not choke him cuz if I choke him you know maybe they could sue me so I just decided I decided if I grab ahold of them and grab them by the back of the head he'll probably realize once I lock onto him and he's pretty helpless yeah he'll probably stop and he kind of did he kind of just flail around a little bit like when someone grabs your neck there's something about controlling someone's neck it's a very it just it does not feel good no well being a me you you feel powerless that was a guy that and he had attacked a counselor before on another television show and he thrown his girlfriend to the ground or his wife on another television show and they had told me about him before he did the show they're like this guy's a serious hothead we're thinking about not having him on the show at all but we thought it'd be good drama just but be careful and so he punched some guy or she punched some guy on the show and I said the wife punched a guy who was those heckling them and I said you can't hit someone ago just cuz you hit your husband doesn't mean you can hit other people and then the guy got my face and there's a lot of it that wasn't on film that they didn't put on TV but I pushed him out of my face he goes don't touch me and I said or what bitch and he got in my face again and I pushed him again and then I said this is just to 2/10 I go I'm just gonna grab this guy I'm like I'm not getting punched in the face cuz sucker punches happen yeah especially if you're not if you're not ready to get punched and you get punched you can get fucked up oh especially if you don't think something's gonna punch you and then they do you know so I'm always thinking when someone raises their voice they're ready to punch me right I'm just gonna clamp down on this dude's neck get a hold of them so I just grabbed him I didn't hurt him yeah I was fuckin that made me uh I always like to where I was a fucking Joe Rogan fan he called the police on me though police had to go over the claim to hit him he claimed a bunch of shit the police had to go over the videotape they had to show all the footage all the different cameras yeah I never really had them I was a fucking fan after fuck you yeah yeah you have guys challenging social media no no idiots maybe yeah yeah nobody in real life and people make me I'm always friendly yeah there's so many idiots on social media tab yeah some biochar kicker well that's see that the idiots are the reason why I never was getting your information in the first place when you reached out because I'm not paying attention anything right right if I dip my toes in the water occasionally like see what the fuck's going on in the world I've seen too many people it starts their their day off in a bad way and they get obsessed with it and they started going battling back and forth with people in the comments guilty are you doing that after you and I had Joe Rogan has got some fucking fans man they wanted to fucking string my ass or how dare you talk to Joe like the motherfucking is between me and Joe the fuck you gotta jump in tell me if they want to make you feel bad it's what they really want to do they want to figure out a way they can point out that you're wrong or make you feel stupid or yeah they just it's almost all of it almost all of it is unhealthy people unhappy right you know maybe not bad people who are doing this but it's an unhealthy practice to just lash out there's not even people that are really in your life it's won a debate about things and I think this is where we as human beings have to learn how to use social media better because there's nothing wrong having discussions about things but you got to figure out a way to do it where you're not just trying to hurt someone's feelings around and lashing out because that's what a lot of it is just bitter very small minded squabbling even if you're using big words the intent behind it is very small minded exactly I people send me videos of their work they've been working out all the time and you know some of them are not doing it correctly right but I don't criticize people I I never you know because really most important thing to me is they're trying they actually in they're trying they're trying to do something but man the people other people don't look at it like that oh you're fucked up you're doing that fucking wrong you fucking why you know what the fuck did they jump on them immediately you know then try to discourage them people that are at least trying to do something they'll try to discourage them and it's got you so many fucking experts out there no you're not doing this correctly a forum is fucked up yeah man if you really want to do that then direct message to people well if you really trying to help them direct message why put it out there so everybody can see it you know you're just trying to draw attention to yourself there's a lot of that just want people look at me I'm gonna fuck them guys I don't like ya and it's what's interesting too about exercises is not there's some things that are debatable in terms of lieutenants a way to do it in a way not to do it that's not necessarily always a consensus about how someone's doing something right whether it's like you know like there's just a lot of people online that are just making a lot of noise yeah it's hard to figure out who's right and who's wrong yeah well I I think it's only right and wrong for you I mean you try until Rogen tells me to do something a certain way and I try it and it works for me then I'm fucking I'm gonna do it right I if it works for me it works for me cuz we all are so goddamn different yeah we're not nobody exactly the same so when somebody somebody says they they if now somebody says they got the perfect routine it's gonna work for every fucking by then that guy you got to be leery he's gonna shit yeah there's nobody as one routine is gonna work for every fucker by it's just impossible is not gonna happen yeah I agree and I think especially it's really interesting with MMA because the fact that hoist Gracie burst on the scene in 1993 thousand aught that long ago right I mean that's really 24 years is not a lot of time it's just too similar or it's too close and so there's all these different methods that have been sort of devised along the way and and nobody really until someone comes along they're really you know someone's like an Anderson Silva that's like super successful doing it one way and then you go well how the fuck is he doing it we got to do it his way yeah but you're not him right like maybe you started out as a wrestler whereas he's a Muay Thai guy maybe it works good for him but maybe you need a different approach and nobody really knows how to do it for you you have to kind of figure out your own way exactly you gotta hone it and tweak it along the way while you're competing so yeah yeah it's hard yeah well the real innovators are the real guys that and you know they I'm sure that they did that they they're not trying to copy yeah yeah it's so important to be an original at damming anything I mean if there's set out to try to be Joe Rogan you're gonna fail my fucking cousin able one Joe Rogan and so try I tell you've got a lot of time hey CT I want to be just like you don't be just like be your damn self yeah you know be yourself man be don't try to be just like Joe Rogan because you can't be do it's hard to tell people that though if you if you see someone who inspires you and you admire them and you do what they're doing it's it's hard but everybody starts out in the beginning like especially when you're a young person when you admire someone you kind of copy a lot of their mannerisms and the way they do it but eventually you got to find yourself oh yeah definitely I used to go around I felt like a butterfly like Muhammad Ali I was when I read when I was a kid man I wanted to you know I want to be him and then I wanted to be Bruce Lee and sure I got in the fucking turn point karate you know point time tournament oh he did know that no I didn't know it was a point fighter and I came very close goddamn tie bow tie bow Billy Blanks daily blanks came very close to fine Billy Blanks in Long Beach arena at Parker's Kempo karate put on the Internet's cry-baby yeah and I was very close to fighting Billy Blanks and I every time I see Billy now is like Billy I thank you so much the guy when I seen the finals Billy fucked that guy up it was supposed to be a point and he knocked him out Oh Billy you know fought even in point like they would hit each other hard oh you know Billy was knocked out before - yeah and they made them fight after they got knocked out yeah nobody knew any better ground yourself back yeah revive yourself and keep fighting man yeah that's pretty good I love I love Marshall but my favorite sport I think born in a ball not over weightlifting and MMA is getting really close really close by things boxing you love boxing more oh man that's that's really hard as a role model I guess Muhammad Ali would be my favorite as a role model but not because of what he did in the ring it's more so because of what he did outside the ring is why I hold him in such high regard but Roy Jones jr. oh of course Mike Tyson Roy Jones Oh Mike in his prime there was nobody like Roy on a completely different level he wasn't even Javon he was and he was muscular - oh yeah it was weird shape his biceps were small yeah went all the way up to heavyweight remember that and Wow beat John Ruiz for the heavyweight title do I remember you don't talk about boxing yeah yeah I'm off fucking box yeah really fan of boxing - you know even though well I like MMA better because anything can happen you can get head kicked you get cake down strangled there's too many there's so many possibilities that it's more complicated what I call MMA is I call it high-level problem solving with dire physical consequences you got all these tools you have all these tools he has all these tools you go in there and you try to figure out who's got the best approach and who's gonna be able to use their body who's gonna be use their talent their skill their dedication who's gonna be able to figure out a way to solve your problem Wow well you think about neat bees it's a bad motherfucker I love and I met him at a at a fight and you'll see fight and he was the humblest it was so nice I'm not fucking Jack like you but I do my big fucking you a fucking killer man he's a great guy he's another he's another guy who is a perfect example of how you can't make everyone train the same way he's incredibly successful but a lot of his training is not weightlifting he does triathlons yeah yeah does Jiu Jitsu in his kickboxing and all the other stuff but on top of that like he does crazy endurance work yeah and Nick and Nick Annie I love Destin brothers man and I met King mo he was real cool a lot of guys at fights the most famous referee dick John McCarthy John McCarthy excellent guy he was really friendly it's a very good guy I'm trying to think I didn't I couldn't really figure out why he got liked me so much - oh st. Pierre he said I want you make a special video for me before his up on his big fights sorry I'm spitting all over the mic and shit not liking fucking hardcore and then he made a video back for me and he gave I had his fucking fuck Joe st. Pierre had his fucking phone um and he caused me to CT I want can you do a one-arm pull-up I said no I can't do when he said I can't either let's see if who could be the first one to do a one-arm pull-up say your own George wow I don't know I couldn't really understand why fighters like me so much I can't understand why are you so because fighters need motivation yeah it's that's a big part of it well because you're real you're a hundred percent real you are who you are you don't put on any false airs but also inspiration is critical for fighters because they're always tired they're always trying to find the energy to keep going they're always trying to find that that push to get up and and and keep going when you are two months in a camp and every day is a grind and you're just exhausted you know and it's repetitive you're constantly drilling constantly sparring strength and conditioning you're swimming you're running you're doing this you're doing that and then the the the impending moment of that fight is constantly looming in the background of your life there's no escape from it and like you need like sometimes you need like a Ct Fletcher video to get you over the hump Wow I guess I mean I cuz I have the utmost respect for fighters their boxers and him MMA guys especially I mean anybody is this I'm gonna the the guy who gets knocked out every time he steps in like I respect the fuck out of him because he had to testicular fortitude just step through the fucking gate man and getting in and actually do deal Joe I know you know but people don't understand how much it takes to just take that trip down and actually get in that cage and face another man who's trying to take your fucking head off yeah that that takes a tremendous I remember how much it took fighting at the Long Beach arena and just the crowd there and I'm there's nothing compared main crops and they have people that crowd makes a big fucking difference oh yeah it makes it I got so fucking nervous everything that I had learned I fucking forgot so that guy kicked me upside the head I forgot every fucking every powder all that shit went right out of the wind and I went to try to kill I went straight to Compton this I forgot all my cards and everything you know it's it takes a tremendous and that's why I respect the guys so much because I have an inkling of an idea I have a real idea cuz I never done this but I have an inkling of an idea of what it takes to actually get him in octagon and before all those thousands of people and put winning millions of people wanting onto and perform and rise and rise some guys actually literally fight better than they train you better inside the cage and then there's a rare human being that when the chips are down when it's difficult when the situation is intense pressure they shine more at their best do you have a problem do you think you would have a problem in your youth if you got a guy in trouble to pound on that guy it's hard if you've been hurt before and you know what you're doing in the guy you know I think a lot of guys get very upset when a referee doesn't stop the fight in time and I think for good reason like they'll look at the referee and go what the fuck how many times you want me to hit this dude he's barely defending himself yeah obviously he's out but you know in the moment the heat of the battle and you catch someone you're smashing them you know it's like I think it also depends on what how you feel about that person like the recent fight between TJ Dillashaw and cody gar brands yeah this intense intense feud and then finally TJ catches him hurt some drops of and then puts him out you can tell when he's smashing him when he's out you know he's not he's not thinking good thing I'm thinking about letting off the game no he's trying to kill him and then when Cody got up and he was just still dazed and TJ's in his face screaming and these days the Dean there's nothing like fighting I know it's nothing like I don't like any other sport I'm I talked to a UFC fighter I'm not I'm not gonna mention his name because I think I don't know if he wants me to or not so I'm not gonna do it but he told me that he goes into some fights not all of them having a real fear of hurting his opponent hmm and I think it's really hard to do your absolute best when you have that fear of you know yeah doing real damage see your point I think it's one more element I think this guy I think he would be a champion if you completely get rid of that it's very hard but when you're calling in the ring hoping I mean you're it's your job right to stop this guy to stock up on and if you're going at hoping that you don't hurt them mm then I don't think you can perform to your utmost capabilities if that's you know really foremost in your mind I don't want to hurt this guy yeah I think fighters only have a certain amount of time they can compete as well you're the overwhelming reality of what they're doing sets in I mean the beginning when they're 19 20 21 they're just fucking full of piss and vinegar and shit and lightning and kicking people in their head and just yeah every day it's just chaos and then as time goes on you deal with your own injuries you you start to see people just suffer the repercussions of a career in combat sports and then as you get older you just realize like what this is really that you're doing so you think Rumble Johnson was really smart I think rumble Rumble is the scariest fucking guy - I was terrifying right and then decides after a world title fight like I wanna do this I wanna hug dudes get hit in the head he goes I'm not really a fighter he goes I was a really good athlete I'm real good at it take it easy everybody man you know and I talked to Ron on social media back and forth really cool kid value and I respect the fuck out of his decision yeah and I respect but he's talked about coming back now yeah yeah well I mean it's I'm sure they someone is gonna make him an offer that he can't refuse well he's very marketable tell you that hey he can do the people destroy man just fucking destroy he's a good examples also if someone who cut weight when they shouldn't have yeah I hate weight cutting I think it's the worst thing that fighters do to themselves I think it's even worse than fighting well those guys who get organ failure a woman just died in Australia was cutting weight for an amateur kickboxing fine oh my it's just a terrible terrible practice that people do but he was one of the biggest weight cutters ever well over 200 pounds getting down to 170 and when he was at 170 was smashing people but as long as it was quick right dehydrated himself so bad that when he get into the third fourth and fifth round he just had nothing left this was so drained at heavyweight he will be fucking terrible yeah yeah if he really wants to do it maybe he just needed a break yeah sometimes guys just need take some time off I think he's gonna offer them because he's very marketable think he's in the weed business now yeah yeah he's involved in some businesses and you know he's obviously not damaged like when you talked right he's a totally fan yeah it's totally there he's not suffered the damage that a lot of fighters have suffered so if he doesn't decide to get out now he's out a good place in his life where he's you know he's accomplished a lot and he's also he's gonna walk away unscathed yeah as long as he you know I can make money doing that shit I don't see he would just touch people yeah you would
