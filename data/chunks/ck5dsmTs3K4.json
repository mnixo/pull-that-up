you definitely shouldn't make those noises to start off a podcast Tom Papa that what are you doing you freaking be blocked if do you know what what is it good speedy SMR do you know what that is yeah like when you like you like certain sounds yeah I find them soothing I don't think that's one of them this is what I use to drive my kids crazy I say it's Mack and it's a spoon and mac and cheese professionally my younger by younger one who's like comedian funny this is her things this shit so she doesn't care about parents or what we're doing or she's just out for herself whenever I make a joke around the house she that I think is funny she just goes huh jokes how old is she 14 that's hilarious comic yes yeah she will be wow she definitely could be do you have a healthy household it is healthy that doesn't seem like a good recipe for comedy right yeah well you know it takes all kinds it does take all kind you know have you met anybody that came from a good childhood that's really funny me you yeah really I'm pretty funny you're very funny you came from no problems at all I think every kid did you move around a lot I moved once one town over and it traumatized me mmm in third grade yeah I still can't I'm still not over it but I think that everybody has I think I think as a child even if it's not real heavy stuff it feels heavy to you you know what I mean like my father was super strict and like yeah you know spanked us and stuff and I was like this nervous you know what I mean and so so I think you can grow up pretty normal and be pretty funny you know it's like a there's a line with kids it's like you don't want to be mad at them but you can't let them get away with too much yeah so you have to go hey hey seriously stop screaming at me stop this yeah like you can't do this like because every now and then though they'll test it totally cuz they fight amongst each other like I've dark two years apart they'll fight amongst each other that's what I'm happy now and then they'll turn it on you I'm not wearing your pants yeah I'm a good guy no it is it is a weird thing especially when you know how you were as a kid oh yeah and you know we've got daughters and I'm probably they're probably similar that where they're not as nutso as we were when we were little but you still have to bring the hammer down even though you think it's kind of funny or you think it's not that big a deal you have to lay down the law even if you don't feel it you have to enforce some guidelines and then you have to communicate about why those guidelines exist yeah I didn't get enough of I think when I was a kid its communication about why those guidelines exists because in the moment the kids not gonna internalize it they're gonna be mad I wanted to do this I wanted to do that and they just have it in their head I want to play one more game why can't I just play why Margot so just get freaked out because what we heard was because I said so yes exactly there was no reason there was nothing behind you just go to bed why at seven o'clock because I said so alright yeah well we don't put parameters on play though like as much we put parameters on you only have a certain amount of television time certain amount of video game time mmm but but as far as like play play like doing stuff like playing in the pool or doing all this like I don't feel like there's any you could play in the pool all day all day yeah I'm happy for all right it's interesting right yo ya know cuz it's and it's probably they're learning more from that than anything else that they would but it's purely play right all play is not considered equal like play when you're sedentary in front of a video screen and you're right playing some silly video game right and you're just sitting there and you're just your brain to be physical but to be out to be doing something but they do have this one game that I'll let them play for a long time it's this crazy dance game okay Dance Revolution I don't know what it's called but they dance um it's a thing they dance what's-her-face crazy what's crazy face oops I did it again Britney Spears dancer you better work bitch you want a Maserati you better work that's your work bitch in there it's hilarious but that's exercise like have you done it with them yes what it's fun you have to I've only done honestly a couple times they probably played it a million times but you have to coordinate your movements to mirror the person on the screen right but my instincts are to like to not mirror but to do what he's doing if his right arms going up my right going up right cuz like that's he get taught in martial arts uh-huh I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be doing that or if I'm supposed to be just mirroring him when he lifts up his right arm am I supposed to live up my left arm because that's that's the one that faces me is that how you know you you do whatever you see yeah but you then you have to track you have to switch it over in your head when I just that arm okay well go with you well it seems like well you shouldn't do this with your children it seems like though that it would be easier for all involved if you just had the mirror it's not do the same exact side of their body as your body I don't know I've not I've never gotten that deep because I've done it and then quickly became exhausted and just pretended I thought it was stupid so I could lay down well it's critical in martial arts that you like if you're learning something if you prefer a especially kickboxing for most fighters most fighters have one good side and one one side that they're not so good at right and like the really great fighters like one of the best in the world today is Terence Crawford and one of the things about him is he can fight equally well from southpaw or from ortho really yes what just dance oh yeah he'll do whatever he wants wow he just fucks everyone he fights really top-shelf competition too and he's just he's so technical and so so clever at figuring people out but I think he has a giant advantage and that he literally as as good a southpaw as he is Orthodox like he can box the best boxers in the world Orthodox right and then just switch up southpaw on them and there's you know he might be like a little better as a southpaw but god damn it's so close my in my dogs will be just he's fucking their head up they bought him one way and then he switched his dancing he starts fucking them up the other way is he born that way no no it's a learn thing my point would be if you had a sow pas instructor and he was teaching you and you were mirroring him it would be weird right right right you know right if someone's telling you something you want to see how their body's doing it and and mimic their movements right I see it and mimic their movements right you don't want to mirror it it would be too confusing yeah which is interesting because it seems like the mirin worked better if it was the stupid video game you know I think any martial arts star yeah no it's messed you up you can't be a good dance revolutionary someone's got to walk you through it to dance dance revolutionary I'm probably doing everything wrong probably risking all these joints like there's certain you know who could dance like really dance for him for him do you know if he he Manoir no you don't know him from the store he's coming on Zenon tomorrow he's under morrow he's Hilaire yeah really funny guy this Instagram is filled with him dancing oh really yeah me but he dances really good yeah and I was watching this and I got um I got a little self-conscious watching this I was like I don't think I could do any of this and if I had to do this like watch watch him dance I was like if I had to do this I was so self-conscious that I was doing this like look he's really good yeah there's I made a new year's resolution this year that I was going to dance more and I haven't done it because of the same thing I come I I always feel like someone Carolee for once said to me you look like a guy who's never danced in his life what do you mean I've got some flow Carolee fools she's fucking away yeah she's in Venice I'm Sam sir damn but that first thing I just showed you for tonight took a video from his that was six years old on his YouTube channel and let's just put it in the game this like last past week whoa and are charging people money for it Wow anybody without making any money most likely now this happened over and over to people with their dances great that's really young too I can't really funny guy well super cool guy he's filled with joy obviously you know you're not like an asshole if you dance like that good point right that's a happy fella that's a happy family he's super nice guy super smart guy out cool he had some sort of technical job didn't he wouldn't he like on we'll figure out so much someone told me he had some very intellectually strenuous job and then decided to bail on that to be a community and she makes sense that's interesting I hope that's true story ya never know with people man I know you know I know I I I think that we probably could take a dance class together dude I don't want to learn how to dance like that I'm worried about my wife can really move have a meniscus issue oh yeah what's that a tour or something - my meniscus what's the meniscus in your padding in between your knee and in between your bones you tore it yeah not that bad like it's a little tear and I've been trying to deal with it without surgery with stem cells you're really gonna favorite things I'm making things it's hard for me to not kick things for a long time and when I when I don't kick things see I just don't feels good we all have our things some people dance some people kick things I feel good when I hit that fight I like to smoke weed I smoked like two or three hits uh-huh I get to stay to mind where I'm just I just feel like my tendons I feel my muscles and my bones and then I just like the fucking throwing out I'll put on some LEDs I'll just just going off on the bad papa and it becomes like you feel like you're like you're just riding like a wave of movement right you're not even thinking about it you're not thinking about anything other than making sure that you don't do anything stupid in terms of like launching a strike when the bags in the wrong place where you could jam yourself or hurt yourself so it's like you just flown around the bag and it's just like you don't even have to really kid it your hardest yeah it's more like you're in there like a dance mm-hmm yes with the movements quit is there an age where that becomes like I'm gonna start tearing stuff a lot but just turn 52 I think it's about 51 yeah it might be tired sure this definitely trade on yoga yeah I love the yoga - yeah it was good but it probably doesn't give you the same rush - it's a different rush you're all booked they're both great rushes though yeah it's a great rush yoga's great there's a thing about the hitting things though that it like leaves nothing no violence in you I don't know if that's real or if that's just I've been doing it so long mm-hmm but it's just a normal part of my life when I don't do it I'm like a baby and I want I want no no aggression juice left of my body I want to pound it all out yeah nothing pounds it all out like hitting the bag right you just shaytans your brain out yeah it's more of a mellow thing it's but it straightens you out more without like indulging you you know I'm saying like if you were it's it's like food right it's like if you were addicted to something if you were doing it so often that you just you just needed to gorge that's all you did yeah you just kept getting fat because of that yeah you'd have to stop mm-hmm and you would realize you'd have this urge to gorge right so I always wonder like what I want to do it is that like my urge to gorge I do I just want a car go fucking crazy and be self indulgent is that what it is or is it is is it that I'm really recognizing that there's a need that people have to have some explosive movements and then if you get rid of though that need whether for me it's running up hills as a big once one of the reasons why I like it challenging and it leaves me completely spent and I feel like I'm a nicer person I feel like I feel nicer I feel my nicer to people so that's not an aggressive hitting thing though but it's it's explosive it's just why because you're going up this fucking Hill yeah it's um they're heavy hills out here would you feel the same way getting off of a treadmill or or like when you do the elliptical yeah that's great I mean that feels great right but dude there's something about an actual physical hill that's outside in nature you feel like what if something was chasing me right away how long can I do this yeah what if I have to catch somebody how could I get them yeah like what if you know what if you know horrible things happen if I don't reach the top of this hill yeah when I always loved running through the woods whose carry its but it's exciting there's something primal about it there's something more there's more at play than just where I'm just running down the street yeah but I think that I they have to write something down or I'm gonna forget it I think I have this thing about the woods that I keep forgetting to do it I think that uh it's what you're describing and like having the kick is I equate it to stand up it's like I'm no longer the same person when I'm not doing standing for several days right that and I think it's because I learned it I created this addiction I created this thing that I no longer am the same person without it you became a junkie yeah yeah we're all for sure laughs junkies I think we are so lucky that regular people don't know what it feels like to get a big laugh yeah or they would do it do any other job like fuck these are the jobs I want to kill yeah I think about that every time I walk through Vegas and you see all these people like drinking and at the tables and they're trying to get a rush they're trying to get something something and you walk around with this secret in your mind that like I'm getting something so much more potent than you're gonna get out here just from being on stage Joey Diaz did this bit the other night in the in the original room and it was so hilarious it was really fresh and you could talk cuz it was making him laugh and he was laugh and he was you know Joy's fucking dying laughing and I'm the back of the room I'm like you can't get any happier than that yes happy as a person can get all I can in that those bursts of moments I like the love of your children that is as happy as you can ever get yeah a new line and it's working the love family love yeah people you care about that's the only thing that Clips is it yeah no you're right but everybody can get that everybody get the family love so everybody can get the best kind of love yes but it all takes work oh fuck but I think that I think when you have I mean it could be so small - it could be like one line that you added to an old joke that works oh your whole night is different yep your whole Drive home is like yes yeah where if you don't try something and you just kind of go through it mm-hmm and it's not as satisfying so you constantly have to keep pushing - because you need that more potent brush but the other side of it is if I have a set and everything's amazing except one new line that I tried that ate shit I say it that way yeah yeah you're managing this weird thing you know if your axe is this weird thing that you're producing and managing it and yeah Oh constantly console console in your head constantly tweaking constantly trying to express trying to trying to have something that you think oh this is it's almost like the cockier you are it's so rare when you feel like this is gonna be a great one and you bring it up and it works like it you know what I mean like it it never matches expectation but if you think like maybe this will work those are the those I love because they surprise you it's like this is funnier than even I thought yes those are interesting right yeah the setup is actually the funniest part of the joke Diane laughing it's something to set up you're like oh yeah okay I see oh my god why didn't I see that yeah and then you're like yeah that's funnier that's the funnier part of it yeah but that's one of the weird things about having to do it in front of people like you have to do it in front of people there's no other way you can't like really practice to end up in a vacuum now I know that's a so cool back to the premise thing Chris Rock said that to me once he said that's what that's the greatest secretin comedy he goes it's the it's the setup that's the real joke he said the the punchline you know that's kind of icing but you really you're nailing the joke in the setup mm-hmm yeah and if you fuck up a setup Oh even if the rest of joke is good you always remember that fucked up or the set up yeah why do you say it like that so did such a weird little dance you play with your head yeah I'm trying to put it all in line and get all the bits together correctly how big was that crowd you played I'd saw an Instagram this weekend that was in Portland Portland Oregon it was big it looked huge it has like 10,000 people now what is that what is that doing to your act in your performance you have to slow down a little bit because it's so loud mm like you have to give them more a little bit more time because I went to see Louis black once I didn't even realize this and I had actually done theaters already and I was even doing the very theater that he was in uh-huh and Joey Diaz and I were sitting in the back of this this big theater that Louis black was playing in and we watched him right and he would hit a punch line and all these people around us would be laughing really loud and then he hit the tag and I couldn't hear the tag there were so many people laughing at the punch line I was like oh really like cemented in my hand I was like oh this is a whole different feeling for the audience member than a club right one of the crazy things about like the original room right or some small room like that when you when you hit a punch line when everybody's laughing you can hit a tag and they're gonna hear it perfectly clearly yeah because there's not enough people's laughter to overwhelm the sound of the speaker you have you on the microphone when there's ten thousand fucking people yeah you got to give that one a little bit of air let it come back yeah you go give those bits a little more air right you're just quickly but but do you feel are you happy doing it like do you feel like it's as because I the only thing close is when I worked with Seinfeld and we did when the Fox theatres and that was a little over 5,000 yeah and the Detroit Fox that started it was no it was Atlanta oh and that started to feel a little out of my control how many Fox theaters are there by the way there's the a million of them there's Fox ain't Lois company yeah it was the same cow it was just a bunch of people naming their theater the Fox no no no no it was like 20th Century Fox it was like if you decide I'm the salmon theatre do you own the salmon theatre yeah that's how can you own salmon you can know it's right now fuck off come on if you have a ban you call your banned salmon you can't you can't name your band after shit that everybody knows the words to our nose nose the like what it is right but part of now it just seems weird it's got to be like salmon work boot you can't Nick could you name your like if you named your beef or if you had a you had a band you named it beef mm-hmm you don't own beef beef you can't say you could trademark beef you could be for the name of a band it's just such a common name it's like you can't own it with anything but you know what I like cents yeah but I looked up yesterday I was online I was writing and first I looked up fun just the just the word fun so he owns huh and there's a band fun okay everything that came up was fun the band fuck off you can't have that name at war war yeah but that was a long time ago that was when they were first making bands dude you know we were at that Shoreline Amphitheatre and they have all these posters on the wall of different shows and one of them was it was Jimi Hendrix and fuck who was the other band never heard some other insane band Oh Jimi Hendrix fuck was it the birds was the birds in another band but it was so crazy like looking at this thing like wow like this was a real show that you could have caught back that yeah you gonna walked into this theater and seen him great to watch Hendrix it's crazy that it was right there I'm like wow that and that night he was there so they were all in front like laughing Joe really someone snapped this picture she's Louise sometimes a photo and you go oh yeah that's a photo from 1973 yeah no big deal and sometimes one hits you when you go whoa yeah that's Ronnie Vanzant exactly yeah like to be around that guy that's Miles Davis talking to Mick Jagger Jesus Christ yeah like someone was there with a flat and a camera when that went down I know it's crazy so I think that so when I back to the Fox thing how big was it five I was like a little over 5,000 and that started to seem like something different yeah from like even like 4,000 seem like you're still in that Club kind of you know theater back and forth at five it started to feel like this is this is bigger than I can control right do you feel like you can control it and 10,000 have a good time yeah but do you feel like you know what I mean like we did 25,000 in Tacoma did you really Dave and I did yeah that's crazy that's crazy it's a lot of people Phil Phil's insane that has two feelings oh my god so fucking roar of humans it's fun you know it's like everybody was there to have a good time like everybody's there for the same reason and people keep it together remarkably well yeah if you really stop and think about live events like how well people in like we don't get enough credit I know every nutty person who does something crazy yeah there's so many people that can keep it together I know that's I it's really unfortunate that we view people the way we do sometimes because we concentrate on every single bad thing that happens in the news and yeah there's a lot of bad things that happen in the news but at scale if you just have the scale of people I think we're looking at it completely skewed I think most people are really fine most people are cool they are nice but that's why terrorism works right because it's so spectacular that it scares the daylights out of everybody but I think the same thing it's like okay so this horrible thing happened on this night but think about how many people were out that night right think about how many people were filling amphitheaters and arenas and small shops and small clubs I mean in a Mac just in America yeah millions and everybody's cool everyone's getting along everybody's doing the right thing you're there is definitely a lot of cool people but it's the spectacular it's like a plane crash mm-hmm right there's been play there hasn't been a major plane crash in the US and a long time but when it happens it's it's so mind-blowing because it's something fall from the sky it's a big deal yeah it's a bigger deal than a train a train crash that kills the same amount of people doesn't shock us as much no it's on the ground you know what I mean it's like that thing fell from the sky what happened we've all fantasized about how horrible that would be it has a big impact you know it has a real big impact no but that's amazing I mean to be there with 25,000 strange like-minded people just out there just coming to laughs didn't want to have a good time that's amazed that the cool thing about even when you're at the improv you know or the Comedy Store yeah you know there's a group of people that comes to have a good time yeah there's always you know occasionally someone who's drunked and doesn't get it and they want to yell out and be on things but most of the clubs in town now are good at getting rid of those people ya know they're really good but the vast majority of people are cool yes but vast majority yeah no it's great but it's when you someone isn't cool it's so disturbing so I we think about people in that regard yeah you know we think about people like cuz know um the worst possible scenario like did you see once upon time in Hollywood I did so those flower kids right yeah the murderous flower the Manson's hit those that's like worst case in era yeah sometimes we think about people just on you know just cuz that's a possibility it's such a glaring one but it gets a disproportionate amount of energy and interest for the most part most people yeah are super fine the animals people are great most people are friendly most people just want to have a good time in this life ya assholes right exactly and even the Manson kids there's probably a couple of them that were fun I bet there was the girl who took off the girl who was like hey I'll be right back oh yeah you know she's take off know who was in real life who do you watch stranger things yes she's the she's Ethan Hawke and uma thurman's daughter why yeah yes Wow yes she was the one in the the two worked in the ice-cream shop oh that's crazy yeah that's what I thought you were gonna say the actual Manson kid would take off one in real life oh and real life you confuse around when we were talking about the other day that story with the Bruce Lee that was loosely based in reality yeah I had to do with gene LeBell oh Jesus clearly as a stunt man unlike the Green Hornet okay well let me tell you this thing because talking from gene gene it was always I've known gene for years he's always super respectful about Bruce Lee but he's also he's okay let me put it this way if that actually did happen that way if Bruce Lee fought gene LeBell gene LeBell would grab ahold of him and obliterate his brain on the concrete 100 out of 100 times over is let me just say that for so I'm not talking about the movie there was a thing in the movie where I felt like they made Bruce Lee seem like a buffoon and I'm like oh I don't think he was ever really like that uh-huh this is like kind of an important historical figure for martial arts and I get it's just a crazy Quentin Tarantino movie I get it the the end of the movie did not I mean in spoiler alert I don't want to say what happened but they make take some liberties for entertainments sake with a lot of different things yeah but with that one I was like ooh I'm just gonna have some random dude that that you know is a stuntman and Bruce Lee's a buffoon to him and he kicks his ass on the set but with that said yeah that got if that was a real life event with gene LeBell and Bruce Lee gene LeBell would crush him so gene LeBell he sort of got real uh that would have been him in that scene oh yeah it would have been quick right it would have been a different thing man he's a gorilla right I mean he's like a judo champion with a severe arsenal of neck cranks and joint locks and he is strong like a fucking bear I mean dude in his prime he was a tank of a man really far bigger than Bruce Lee know it and obviously was small right he was a small guy but Bruce Lee was an innovator in martial arts and one of my personal heroes yeah he's like the important early innovator because he was the first guy to think that you should combine the best elements of all these different styles huh when I was coming up man I was doing Taekwondo and you were brainwashed to think that Taekwondo was the best martial art everything else was bullshit and you shouldn't even practice it so if I was practicing other stuff like I was doing some boxing I was doing like I'd get some frowns from some people and it was like a thing and if you were in some schools that were less open-minded than mine you know my school was a little more practical than some of them but some of them they would say kung fu or death like all they wanted to do is fucking confer they're doing the shit in the party okay and you couldn't say hey man a wrestler is gonna grab a hold of you and he's gonna just pound you into a fucking tree and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about there's jr. there's gene LeBell who was he was uh in a bunch of different movies as a stunt man oh yeah that looks like greenhorn ten friends so that's there were very good friends and he had nothing but good things to say about Bruce Lee and he said he taught Bruce Lee a lot like some of the moves that Bruce Lee Bruce Lee used an armbar and one of the early scenes in Game of Death that was from gene LeBell no I guarantee you helped him here but look at this like if gene LeBell really wanted to grab a hold of Bruce Lee Bruce Lee would be unconscious as would I as with many many many other trained martial artists not Jame Bruce Lee was a fuck I mean Bruce Lee was a fantastic martial artist and like I said one of the most innovative guys ever we don't even realize how much his style had a gigantic effect on making untold millions of people sign up for martial arts classes including men right because he was a movie star right he had the looks and the and the charisma yes that allowed him to bring it on the film and show everybody he had everything he had a philosophy he had a deep understanding of all these different martial arts and he had the courage to try to combine them which is unheard of at the time where they've got an exercise from a lot of these kung-fu like circles where did he learn it he learned it from a bunch of different places I mean he learned in the u.s. he learned in China he learned different things from different people I know he did he worked with a lot of different martial artists including gene LeBell of course was a what's gene LeBell judo credentials and I guarantee was a national champion I think he was a world champion but he was whatever he was he's a fucking gorilla I feel like kung-fu is more popular earlier well the UFC changed all that shit yeah yeah Dan what is this zone you know but what is is competition accomplishments Blue Bell yellow belt he's but if that that makes sense that they kind of base it on him because he really was a legendary stuntman as well wouldn't that be cool though if Tarantino had the inside scoop on that story maybe that but Bruce Lee in him with friends I guarantee you like that didn't go down like that didn't write fight write write write if they did have a fight Jesus Christ her if ik yeah that guy's a fucking gorilla judo people is a different man they have a different their their core judo is yeah their course so goddamn strong there's only a few judo guys that ever rolled with it a lack of consequence of Karo Parisyan was one of them anything when I was a blue belt I've rolled with him and he was like rollin with the chimpanzee they just threw me around so I was really Christ it's so disheartening when you grapple with like our like a really good wrestler or a really good judo person they just have this insane ability to manipulate body so it's crazy okay it says he won the national heavyweight judo championship and the u.s. USA overall judo championship title so he won the national heavyweight title and he went on to win both the heavyweight and overall champion in 1955 as well so that's that's a National Amateur Athletic Union I think that's a I think that's that stands for so that's a that's a big-time judo title especially for back then in 1954 that probably wasn't that many Judo Championships it was probably a fairly recent thing where judo come from Japan Japan Japan Jiu Jitsu even Brazilian Jiu Jitsu really came from Japan because count my ADA who was this traveling judo master he taught people in Brazil he taught the Gracie's so the Gracie family in Brazil they took that jiu-jitsu and they refined it and maybe made it much more much more emphasis on submission because of Carlos Gracie and ilio Gracie and Carlson Gracie and like the early masters right really amazing amazing story of one really one family that kind of revolutionized the way people fight on the ground they just all focused right I remember yeah they just were they just were badasses yeah they would just fight each other all the time they were trying to figure out what works best well they just got it down to a fucking science is the story about from Jean the Bella Bella care either because LaBelle said when you go on the set Dobbins will put Lee in a headlock or something so as Lebel went up and grabbed Lee he started making all those noises and they became famous for LaBelle said but he didn't try to counter me so I think he was more surprised than anything else so he probably just grabbed him got him in a headlock right then the Bell lifted Lee unto his back once called the fireman's carry I ran around the set with him and said put me down or I'll kill you Lee screams he said I can't put you down or you'll kill me LaBelle said holding Lee there as long as he dared before putting him down saying hey Bruce don't kill me just kidding champ back on his feet again lead it and kill the balance Dudley recognized his lack of grappling was deficiency in Jeet Kune Do style of martial arts that he was developing see so it wasn't really a fight but this is what I'm telling you the battle was so fucking powerful and such an amazing judo guard that if it was a fight it would have been right really quick right so if that's who he was supposed to be portraying and look if that's you showed that the brad pitt character was some judo champion that became a martial artist later okay maybe this guy was like a roofer this was a fun part of me it was great fucking like movie man I love that line and it's so it's so it's like split camps on it like just in my circle of friends and I run into whatever people even loved it and feel like they could have hung with it for two more hours or people were like what's the point what was the story I don't get it those I don't get it guys keep a real close on [Music] them like the Jeffrey Epstein you're trying to keep him alive those people don't understand they're thinking I don't either it was so generic oh my god my last movie like were you not entertained like there was a lot of times in that movie I was like fuck yeah haha right move I could have just hung with it forever and especially being out here in LA who's just like that cool Musso and Frank's yes they didn't even have to do anything to make it look different I know that's like it's from 1969 are we supposed to go yeah we're supposed to go yeah you and me and Joey we've been talking about forever we got to do it well I'm in town this week there's a UFC in Anaheim this weekend oh really LA yeah I'm in LA - this is the first two weekends in a row that I've been home I think in a year and a half pull up Tom Pappas Instagram and take a look at that sweet alchemy did you put it up on your now I didn't didn't here I'll send it to you or I'll send it to Jamie all right you send it to Jamie uh oh my god that was so good dude that's just ridiculous that's why I'm here today cuz I run out of ELQ you kept it so well I'm in the food porn obviously yeah I was gonna bring you bread of course there's an annoying thing about Apple this was us you want to take a photograph from a text message you can't search that person's name because otherwise you can't get the photo you know I'm saying like if I search your name I have to actually send you a text unless I'm doing something totally wrong swipe down when you open up the messages at swipe down yeah look at that sweet sweet bread search but no no that does look sweet okay but it was uh it was just I couldn't I couldn't give it to you it was just a little too stale and I'm like I don't want to get ya next time you had stale bread how is it how many days is an actual real bread go before it's Dale about four days wow that's so crazy so I make two at a time so it depends how how much the ladies are eating Wow yeah Jamie I just sent you I just sent it to you again a photo of the meat this was so good I just can't believe you cook that put that perfect ass grill grill that's amazing gas grill on high and I do it four times what um cut was that was that a roast that was the tri-tip oh wow that looks good oh so good damn that looks good I know dude you're a really good cook thank you you nailed that yeah tri-tips a tricky one because there's not a lot of fat I tried tip no it's not doing you know there was there was I I remarked at that that there were in a lot of flames coming up it wasn't like dripping fat into the thing it's a different coming but I just did it by feel and I was like you you know you don't want it to be too you know I'm stiff and then you just pulled it off and it's still nice dude that's still have it waiting for me in the fridge that's a plus right there well it's good stuff so did you you got another one you send does that mean you hunt it again or does that I got a deer you got a deer yeah I got a deer Illinois I'm gonna give you some access to your - oh really yeah oh boy boy was that is that with the taste difference um it's it's it's different it's definitely different there but it's really delicious yeah they're one of the fastest deer species on earth it's crazy fast how bigger they about a hundred and thirty hundred and fifty pounds like Jamie sighs no Jamie is bigger than that yeah like 20 huge clip size right oh really that's little I'm here for meat ligaments and wiseass attitude to put it in perspective you get about 400 pounds from an elk and you get about 40 pounds from a deer oh my god yeah definitely very different that elk is so good it's great I don't you know last time you gave it I can give me a bunch and it's just been in the freezer to go and like buy like a steak at Gelson's or whatever a Ralph's it's not happening well I'm glad you enjoy it man so good it's so cool to see that you like it it's so good for you you feel good yes right crazy right that's not yeah it's not just a placebo effect I don't think so no I was I was I didn't get in the game to feel good I just wasn't because it was delicious so many hunters say that yeah so many hunters say that like you eat do you eat it and you like gives you like this boost event you feel like energon yeah because it's so nutrient dense and so dark and I mean it's an animal that like their main foa's wolves dry mountain lions I mean they're out there hustling yeah if you can get it get a hold of that meat that's that's a meat of Champions it's good stuff it's just they scream they screening each other like boy you're eating like a mystical beast yeah that's what it feels like I respect it but when you get it in the store a lot of times it's from farms it's from a farm in New Zealand most likely mm-hmm I think they probably can do it at some places in the United States but some places in Canada where they've commercially farm elk but most now that you get you actually get from New Zealand wow this is really interesting new zealand's a weird place man yeah I've never been a lot of the Lambs you get it's from New Zealand oh yeah yeah the to New Zealand is really kind of crazy because they don't have any predators everything was brought over by a bunch of rich European guys they're like wouldn't it be great if we had sheep over here and so they brought over stags I see an antelope have you ever seen a red stag no beautiful beautiful animal oh yeah yeah they're all over the place in New Zealand they brought them over there there's literally no large mammals in New Zealand and they brought all of them over there jeez see if you could get a photograph of a red stat New Zealand Red Stag they're beautiful animals it's kind of like an elk in a lot of ways and it looks like it's like the cousin of an elk but they have these gorgeous gorgeous antlers and they're just these big crazy beautiful animals you have another trip coming up I've never been in New Zealand are you going for elk again yeah I'll be going in the fall I was going to fall oh that's nice yeah okay that's a Scottish one don't they have an easy known red stag okay well that's the dark side click on that photo click on oh no the one okay that's good - and the one below it let me see the one below that huge we want that's okay this is the dark side see okay now what this is jeez this is a New Zealand elk that's grown in a place where they they grow them like this so it's probably a high fence operation and probably feed these things so they probably have like big bundles of food right and the more food an animal like that gets the more impressive Iraq though that rank is insane yeah there's actually a really amazing podcast about Oh see that looks like it's caught up in ropes or something the hell is happening there it's like in a tree or something what the fuck is going on it looks like a valley I must I got caught on something it looks like a vine a mousetrap that's so weird I really don't understand what that is it's very amps so it looks like the antlers are wrapped up in vines and then they shot it and left the vines on the head they could have taken the vines off just out of respect out of respect that does happen though like sometimes deer will get like barbed wire and shit stuck in their antlers Oh your bail wire they'll get that shit stuck in their antlers so let's still get it wrapped around their legs and shit sorry and that's awful people always catch um deer or find deer rather that have been caught in fences so like they they're jumping through a fence it gets twisted around and their leg gets stuck eh yeah it's terrible that's not cool oh it's a drag it's a drag they find them there or coyotes find them and they just eat them along you know it's really good - is the sausage oh yeah that sausage is fantastic anyway so that's why those antlers are so crazy they're not just because they're in the wild that's not happening you wouldn't get enough food right there's uh I was gonna say that there's a great podcast called a meat eater with my friend Steve Rinella there's an episode that there they're talking about that that's out right now to find out which one of those it's so much better be interesting you I just emotionally mentally feel so much better eating it than I do knowing that something came from like a big factory farm it's just like it's called episode 1 80 teeth horns and claws and he sits down with a wildlife biologist and they're they're talking about why animals grow things why they grow you know antlers and why they why they let go of their antlers and how you could take animals from one area where it looks like they have poor genetics is their antlers are small and they move to another place is more food than tobik so this seems to be a direct correlation between their diet right how much their antlers grow so what they do with these these animals most likely and I don't know how all of them do it probably probably vary but I know in the United States like when they have deer farms they feed them like a super high protein diet out of these feeders and so these animals eat this crazy high protein diet in their antlers just filled with minerals and like antler bone is a weird thing it grows faster than any known bone on earth um so when you see a deer's antlers and they're gigantic yeah that deer might have just grown those over the last three months really yes jeez it's crazy especially easy elk antler in particular because they let go their antlers very late like antlers fall off once they get done having sex they don't need the antlers anymore because the antlers are mostly to like show do that's what I was gonna ask like a bird like it yes it's floral it's to attract but it also helps them in fights with each other right because like the male's will fight and they they want it for the lady yeah they kill each other all the time specially elk you'll find Elks with like puncture wounds and their sides where they just jab each other yeah one of the whole trip and the other one will run his fucking antlers through its body cavity so when these people are feeding them this high-protein stuff is it for the antlers or it's just just tubes for the antlers it is yes it's so they develop these freakish antlers because then it's a trophy yes but it's there's two schools of thought on this yeah people that think that's great look at the antlers mhm and then there's people who are the purest people that would be in a Steve Rinella camp that where I find it grotesque and rarely find it a direct evidence of a person meddling with it like almost like yeah that's what it kind of feels like right like almost akin in a way to like an animal that's wearing a collar mm-hmm like why is so obviously manipulated by a person like in wild they don't have like squirrely crazy shit that grows all over the place yeah if you find one in the wild that has anything remotely like that it's a freak of all freaks yeah they do exist right in places that have like amazing food and it would be more special because it's out there it just happened right these all take place inside a fence it's kind of sketch yeah it's a little sketch yeah but a little meddlesome it's troublesome because they also have to hunt them right so what so one of the problems is they will do these purges where they fly over in helicopters with certain species uh-huh and they just got him down and they ride them to rock why because they took they have too many of them they're devastating to the local flora all the different plants and they'll just eat through every there's no predators right you don't want to import wolves and start some crazy gang war sounds fun there's a coyote coyotes in my neighborhood are going nuts right now they ripped apart a cat three of them on one cat and somebody else lost one with two coyotes they ganging up together and they go after these my cat is staying inside a lot cats have a terrible life in the in the Hollywood area yeah it's good yeah cats are there's real trouble with these coyotes around where I know they smell your cat yeah well your cat is right they know when you count they're they know when your cat's not there you don't even have to see him really oh yeah the wind's coming down like say if your cat if your cat's in your backyard and there's a coyote a mile away on the street and the wind hits that cat and blows towards that coyote that coyote might be able to smell it she's they they can smell some insane amount of distance Wow and you know if if the wind is blowing right so it's blowing towards them they can pick up these little things and next thing you know they're there knowing that you got something in your yard jeez Louise you know what the effective distance with the way was related to me was like you should consider the way a coyote could smell or a bloodhound or any kind of crazy dawn some out the way you smell a skunk you smell skunk like a skunk could be like rocks away yeah but you fucking smell it's so strong you can smell it like almost a mile away maybe yeah maybe half mile yeah really a little bit that's how dogs are with everything with everything with your feet it's a little smell your feet or gas or puppy imagine they could smell another dog taking a walk away like what yeah motherfucker is it funny when you're hanging with your dog and officer their head goes up on my guns just purely out of smelling something in the distance yeah I was taking my dog out today and it was amazing the stuff he stops for yeah what fuckin going on with this Bush I just freaked out yeah he smelled many smell of it like I have zero idea what he's dude there was a possum here five hours ago that's what they say about bears that bears can not only smell you yeah they can smell you hours later and know how long it was that you pass through so know whether or not it's worth going after you jeez bears are the best they just have they have a multiple I think I want to say your bears nose is nine times stronger than a bloodhounds what yes I think that's the case really yeah I think it's like nine times that's amazing yeah so think about insane a bloodhounds nose yeah see if that's true that's what does it say Jess why they're so manic I was looking at smaller ranges and I typed in bear smaller range it says it can smell a carcass from up to 20 miles away Jesus Wow 20 miles yeah let's let's bring those back what a good idea fucking assholes you know California's to have a lot of them Oh Grizzlies Emma really oh yeah we killed them all or not us but people in 1800s wait that's our state flag bro and push them up up north not push them off they murdered them there's no pushing they killed them all geez yeah the last time a guy died at the hands of a grizzly bear that was documented in California was a guy I think his name is Steven Levesque and there's a town up on the way to Bakersfield if you ever gonna go do a gig up and bake the Bakersfield yeah it's great out there it is nice out fun people it's got that cool desert vibe you don't you're in the countries yeah but anyway on the way up there there's a town called Levesque and Levesque was named after the last man to get killed by a grizzly bear oh really yeah and they they gue they exhumed him many years later to see if the story was true and yet his body was destroyed like something bit through his side a bone had mauled through that yes you get tore apart by a bear there's a new jersey right now they're having a in North Jersey they're having a black bear problem yeah you know why because the government stopped the hunting on bears the governor decided to stop the bear hunt it was a part of him being elected these people you're gonna come face-to-face with the consequences of not managing dangerous wildlife black bears are dangerous wildlife they're beer all over yes their problem yeah beautiful they're amazing it's definitely good to have them around but you cannot let them overpopulate without a management plan right and that's what I think was the difference between the way this guy was approaching it in the way wildlife biologists were approaching it they're approaching it from an emotional issue they don't want people to kill bears right but you have to take if the bear becomes something that kills you which it could at one point in time I mean there was a kid from Rutgers that got killed by a bear rare years back it's very rare yeah very rare that a person gets killed by a bear but that shit can happen more often and that very rare it's not gonna do you any comfort it's if your kid turns up missing right you know your kid can't be in the backyard because bears might get your kid that's real right you guys out of your fucking mind right like bears are giant wild dogs that again like Jamie said can smell a carcass 20 miles away get the fuck out of here kill them all yeah got them down don't let him don't let him overtake your neighborhood I'm not saying they shouldn't be in the woods so that they should but they should say they'll fuck out of like suburbs suburb neighborhoods what the problem also is that it's just growing there's so many humans every year more and more humans more and more developments there's really not much land for these animals that's an interesting argument not that good though but later this year like but it hasn't expanded that much what's what's happened is the populations of the animals has risen but isn't it the but there is sprawl there's more developments and certainly sprawl in comparison like the fifties sixties seventies eighties and nineties yeah what is happening now with these over populations of animals is there's no one doing anything about if you have bears right they don't have a fucking there's no predators for bears right they occasionally eat each other we're gonna do it all the time actually they kill and eat each other all the time especially Cubs oh yeah males eat Cubs females are eat their own Cubs why did they get do that for what we were in Alberta and one of the guys that I was with my friend John his son saw a bear kill a cub and then the mother of the cub ate it geez yeah it's with these guys this is the life they live man there's a movie character right there wild predators and they're enormous yeah several hundred pounds and if you think it's cute to have millions of them in a state you know that New Jersey has the densest population of black bears in all of North America really yeah New Jersey right bananas that is it's also the most densely populated for humans is it really yeah really is the most populated state because any populated state yeah but as I mean there's a lot of people there's a lot of wood still a lot of woods there's a lot of places for these things to live yeah you have bears and there's nothing there's no wolves and there's no there's no mountain lions there's nothing taking the Bears out there's just bears there's a crazy man was deer - yeah a crazy amount I was just there with my family there and we were just driving around this summer it's like they were just popping up everywhere I mean the Bears probably eating the shit out of them - it responsible for the death of 50% of all deer fawns bear stairs yeah they just go around and eat the half of the deer fawns good eaten by bears Wow yeah they did do the study like where the where deer fawns getting jacked it's like mostly bears well I mean mountain lions get him to lawns hanging out at the mall but in a chick-fil-a but there's no mountain lions in New Jersey so there's no bears right the fawns there they're all getting jacked by bears well that was the big debate I believe when I was there was they were thinking about allowing bear hunting well what was a big legal it was a big kerfuffle whether an angle it's been leaked it was like then it was this new governor made it illegal right right but the people that live there think it's terrible idea to make it illegal to make it illegal I get it I get people don't want bears to die but you just have to understand management you have to make wildlife numbers when you're around people I mean this idea that you shouldn't do that because they should they should be here because they were here first and we're taking over their land you're right you're right about all those things you're right but we're team people right but that's Tony we're dealing with right exactly can't let many many bears move in your area it's like in disaster they can eat your garbage you're gonna get scared someone's gonna get bit someone could die yeah I mean and and it accelerates with the population increase right whatever it is I mean there's a wild video from fuck what Far Rockaway which is oh really yeah and these two bears that's an innings that's like New York these two bears get in that they'd start duking it out she's okay no that's not the Far Rockaway one um there's a is that Far Rockaway is that what it says okay Far Rockaway New Jersey okay this is a different one but it's the same this is brand-new grizzly these are big bears I always picture them smaller these are more than 200 pounds whoa that's what it looks like to me I'm looking at them easy 200 plus pound bears it's like Jamie times two well there's another one where these these bears fight worth I'm not bullshitting the Bears look like 400-pound bears they're fucking enormous and they not know this they knock over this mailbox and they crash into some garbage they're so big dude and they spill out on the street while cars are there oh my god bars or watches and you get a real perspective sense yeah big they are with the cars right right I'm guessing 300 pounds-plus maybe 400 pound they gotta be fast people's y'all got another one with two giant bears in the same area oh my god from earlier this year I'm talking I know the ones different we're out up a few times so this is another one yeah my sister had a whole family just walking down her street dude this this is gonna be a problem yeah and they're gonna have to hire people to go and kill these things all it will take is one person getting eaten well at the Taco Bell it could be a lot of different things could be people's dogs yeah this was the original video that I saw so these do their fighting right outside these people's house and then they Duke it out they Duke it out they eventually crash into the mailbox let's shake the camera work yeah well this is terrifying this the Duke also though this is like a good sign that these were old-ass fucking cameras this is like before they really had stabilization on cell phone camera right yes eyes these fucks yeas and they're just fighting it's on the streets on all these pedia yeah no man this is what happens when you don't let people hunt them Wow oh this is what happens if you don't hunt them enough you got a man approached yes dude it's fucking dangerous man these are wild animals and these people that live there are soft ass domesticated people oh yeah they're not like us they don't know how to fight back that is massive these are big big those are big bears that's not what I pictured like you ever go to the black bear diner be able say I'm out here looking tape like all these wooden bears it's really cool look at this they make them look so adorable they were hats they've got vests on I didn't see them crashing anything maybe I was wrong about that maybe it's another one wow there's so many of these videos bears fighting again you know Alaska takes it one step further though one of my favorite videos is oh yeah we say they did knock into something oh it's no Wells invasive Jim in Alaska say you can shoot them in their den now I don't think wasn't that the thing oh oh thanks yeah that's what I heard once they're trying to get rid of certain number of them mm-hmm what I was going to talk about was moose in people's driveways there's this a crazy fight where this guy sitting in front of his car yeah in the morning sitting in his car in front of his house in the morning and he's filming these gigantic moose duking it out on the front lawn yes they are fucking in normal shoes and they're smashing antlers right on this guy's there it is look at this look at this man whoa this is fucking crazy they're so big they crash into that car okay fuck that car up but imagine this is your house and you're watching two huge moose she is like this this would like to live in a place like that well you can move to Anchorage last it would be fun you'd move right next to Sarah Palin micash we live the cat's fucked my cat wouldn't make it cap comes an indoor cat locker in the house when you open the door don't let her out everything yeah look at these things man they don't bro oh we got him on his back takedown they're so big man these are so so you this guy's running it on the cameras this is like this how you put in perspective right a deer is like maybe like a access to yours like maybe 150 pounds right and elk a big one is like closing in a thousand pounds yeah 800 900 pounds a moose is twice that big twice that big I said big 1,800 2,000 pounds sometimes Oh Mike a big male moose like those moose right there easily have been six hundred sixteen hundred pounds 76 pounds they're so big and those are big ones man they had giant antlers yeah see how wide their antlers on yeah yeah you see what that's like a fully mature moose oh man they're fucking enormous I came around a bend on my motorcycle in Maine once there was just a moose just standing there in the middle like it was like a wall it was like I think there's a wall in the middle of the road and it was a gigantic moose Greg Fitzsimmons did this gig in New Hampshire and they told you told him they couldn't swear so Greg when he was young as he is today it was a smartass but yeah today's professional changed he was just kind of learning the smartass crap so he immediately opened up with hey what's going on fuckers like of course doesn't doesn't clean up his act at all and they sent him home but what was crazy was on the way up there they were telling him do not drive at night because of the moose rise you could hit a moose but he goes after the my show they were so mad at me they're like fuck you go drive in the dark in New Hampshire with the moose out I just loved the picture of a young Fitzsimmons I'm such a smartass such a smartass I've known Greg since we literally started out like within a week of each other oh really you an open mic no no I got him early in New York do we did so many shitty gigs together he was he was a he was he was mean Greg is cutting girl I mean I always got a little nice but no but he had that you know he had Fitzsimmons attitude where he's if he locks it on you you're toast oh yeah yeah and you know I help ya suppose of you know if you're not if you're cocky ya know I'm you don't know me motherfucker it's in here that joke yeah it's a hilarious but I just got a lot of hilarious I tell them every time I see him it's the best it's the best bit of the year yeah I think Greg and I probably we I don't know how many gigs we did together but for like the first few years of our comedy when we're really starting to get like road gigs yeah yeah we did a shit ton of them together including open mic nights man we just drive all the way down to Rhode Island we drive to Providence Rhode Island to work they'll do like 10 minutes for free yeah of course yeah we're so excited I've been five minutes who would drive whoever whoever's fuckin car worked right me and Greg and this other dude were in a car and the the other dude starts talking about vibrators in his ass and about how much is his girlfriend likes to put vibrators in his ass and we're and we're saying this another comment uh-huh this comic is telling us this crazy store I mean we're trapped this guy all the way to Maine driving and he's in the backseat talking about taking in the ass with vibrators like what we didn't get that close like this is it's a weird time to bring up the subject conversation it's like I'm not averse to that subject I'm not averse to you discussing I don't think but play first of all I don't think it's anything wrong with being gay and I don't think but play makes you gay so let's let's just like it's just it's intimate it's an intimate oh runner let's soothe all those worries right there okay I'm fine like whatever here no problem with you getting your butt touched and I've no problem with you being gay this is just not what I'm talking about this is like why you're driving this is slow yeah my girl she loved it but vibrators in my asshole like what hello how do you do nice to meet you my girlfriend I mean we knew this guy but we didn't know this guy like know this guy him as much as I knew Greg and if Greg was telling me that with in a car with somebody else I'd like why he told me what this other dude is here this is something you don't want everybody to know yeah ixnay on the ass play yes it doesn't see much would want to broadcast out to just random strangers it's in this learning wanted us to know that his girl like to put vibrators in his asshole and we were in a we were trapped with this guy and sadly he wasn't that good of a comedian either boy yeah neither were any of us back then but we were a little better than him right he was on this he was in this range there's a range that happens with early comedy young con which coming up with you're like oh I don't know if you're ever gonna get out of this yeah no you can see pretty quickly sometimes some of us you suck in the beginning but you have a hint yeah there's something there something that ya know exactly Kyle Dunnigan and I did it show early on for a high school in New Jersey and we drove out there and they'd same thing just be really clean make sure it's really clean it's got to be clean and Kyle went up I went up and I you're bombing because it's high school kids you don't have a great act to begin with and it's all high school children and you have nothing to relate to them and they don't want to listen to a man talking and probably thirty to something like that I don't know thirty five and I'm just bombing and just trying to get through it and then and then Kyle comes out and he's whole time backstage she's like do I do the my songs do I do my songs I'm like you know I don't know whatever it works you know just try and keep it clean he comes down he sings this song it was about the Irish parade the st. Patrick's Day parade song like in an Irish brogue and one life list if it was about though with that they were allowing they were debating whether or not homosexuals could march in the parade that was a big thing in New Yorker V for like a decade Andy Kyle had a funny song about it and the line was if your ass if your if if my cock is if my cock is the ladle your ass be the stew like song is like an iron if your cock let me ask me this too and I just hear him like starting to get to it he goes into it it's the first thing that the audience loves the kids are so excited by fast-forward the show's over we're gonna get paid and a high school principal is livid he's got he has a Winnie the Pooh tada and there's two girls there's T's got a Winnie the Pooh - hi he's purpley so angry and he's yelling at us what are these our children your ass your cock is the ladle and there's and there's food girls they made us cupcakes and had construction paper saying thank you for performing at our school as stars and oh my god they don't know whether they should give us the treats or not because the principal is just yelling at it but these are high school oh so funny these are high school kids though we got the check yes high school kids Darren knew those things that's where they laughed oh of course of course but he couldn't sanction it but Kyle just you know you're dying and you have you have no you have no material so what else is he gonna do he had to break out the song yeah there's nothing else you can do right you just trying to survive and get paid get out of there yeah you got to survive you got to take it on the chin hey you gotta come on my radio show I got oh yeah didn't you say you do it at 7:00 in the morning 7:00 to 9:00 why do you got to do that well I don't know you should do it when you're awake I know he wants to be good it's really early does it stream live or something yeah it's unserious okay it's Netflix as a joke radio you know they have they run them on I was so confused on the network's radio I was thinking that Netflix was going to have its own radio channel well you have a Netflix channel that at their own radio channel that's what I was thinking like oh you like it was gonna get a comedy yeah like a like a new thing that they're doing it's like raw dog on Sirius XM or comedy great series to listen to now yeah that's what's thinking that you could listen to it on the Netflix app because you know so many people listen to Netflix on their phones now oh really yeah so many people watch specials I think they said they're like 50% of people to watch my Netflix special watched on phone Wow yeah they're actually even many people are formatting their specials to make them better to watch on phones Wow interesting yeah I like them the way they're shooting it in terms of like with how they zoom in on the shot what shots they choose real yeah they're doing it so you could look at it on you know fucking Samsung Galaxy that's an s10 plus or something you know so to have all these specials from all these people so they started their own channel and I have the first radio show on it uh-huh and it runs seven to nine out here and then and then two to four so it's drive time here in the morning and drive time in New York in the afternoon mmm and you and fortune fortune fortune themed stir yeah she's so fun she's verified love her some very cool person yeah they were like who do you want you know to do this with you and I and she was on the short list I was like oh done she always seems very friendly she's really funny she's just merged too few murders murders on stage she's so funny she's very very funny her instagrams really funny is that she dances she does ice cream dance it's quick she always gets an ice cream cone and dances along with it we need to get her and for him together yeah work out but it's cool cuz it's all comedy it's all comedians coming in talking about their specialist talking about comedy and yeah it's pretty fun but it's early it's why they make you do that I know I'm not sure if it's really necessary yeah you got to put your foot down you could do it the night before and have it run in the morning because we're not like doing hard news you could just bypass that system and do a podcast I do have a podcast I know you do but do it like do it in the podcast form yeah just do a successful podcast you have a specific contract for a certain amount of time I'm not trying to get you out of here yeah we're gonna do it for a year and then it is fun I am enjoying it but it's good buddy you know what it's gonna mess with my spots during the week oh yeah yeah that's what we're saying I was saying if you wanted to do the Improv tomorrow night you said you really can't cuz you got to get up early in the morning I could do an early show I can't do late shows tensho starts at 10:30 I don't know what to tell you I'm gonna move everything back for you why I thought we were friends you shouldn't have a job like that preposterous job you're up at 7:00 in the morning talking it's crazy yeah it's doing morning radio all the time if I'm up at 7:00 in the morning I'm exercising I'm not I want to get things done first I don't want to just wake up and talk Hey hold I can't remember names my memories 50% is good when I first wake up really yeah 50% starts sorry she's terrible you hit me with a pop quiz how long does it take you to dust off the cobwebs I don't know I often thought about that right now I often thought about like how dumb I am during the day if there's like a meter yeah you could like see like now he's getting smarter getting stream in the afternoon I'll feel pretty fucking good you know but somewhere around late at night and everything starts to fall apart in early the morning everything falls apart what's late at night for you like one ish 1:30 I don't work out at 1:30 in the morning yeah I really don't have the energy to work out it means physically work yeah like sometimes I'll be writing at 1:30 in the morning and I can write at 1:30 in the morning but if I had to go through one of my workout routine like a physical activity like a real work yeah I can't do it that's retired well you shouldn't it's 1 o'clock in the morning right but that's that's letting you know that there's a cycle to where you have energy right and where you don't have energy we wake when you're not awake yeah yeah but some people they perform way better late in the afternoon like I used to feel that way about jiu-jitsu class like early-morning jiu-jitsu class that was terrible I just couldn't get my body warmed up that's oh really yeah I didn't like them but the evening was like an 8:30 class I was peeking no interesting yeah I'm better working out early yeah yeah it's like after lunch was a typical Tom pop a day like how do you start your day radio day or no radio day regularly off parts well I guess we're fast forwarding to noon okay give me a read up on a non radio day okay non right non radio day I get up at 7:00 damn I get up at 7:00 I go upstairs a soldier I make coffee I get one cup of coffee do you play classical music softly once in a while yeah usually I picture you OCD butter in your toast no I don't I don't eat straight away it's a straight black coffee into the office of an office and I try and write I sit at the desk I call going into the shop and I sit there and I write and I make sure that there's no appointments until noon anything I'm going to do I don't do until noon except if I'm gonna go for a run or workout I'll put in a couple hours and then when I start to fade I'll uh I'll go for a run and then come back and continue hmm I skip something sorry before the coffee if I'm up early enough and the house isn't up I'll meditate first 20 minutes before even right before I coffee before I write really yeah wake up water in the face maybe brush teeth up into the office and then take 20 right away mmm because it's more restful than sleep so even if you had like a bad night's sleep you're tossing or whatever was going on you're now ready to to go through the day what kind of meditation you doing TM hmm until meditation but Transcendental Meditation there there's a weird thing about that right some people think it's kind of cult II it's not cult it's not called it there's no there's no leaders right but it wasn't there wasn't there some controversy with TM a while back you think so no my misconstruing it was something else yeah no to it that's why I like I don't I'm very into it I'm doing it for a long time it's great I but I don't I like yoga I like all that kind of stuff unless you can hit a little hippie dippie with it and a little too preachy and then I'm out yeah me too and this is totally basic simple when I was taught it there was nothing you know hippie dippie flaky about know what's man that hippie dippie flaky shit it's only it only feels shitty if the person's not really living that life and you can kind of feel it mmm not bullshit yes there was this guy used to take classes from Saint Peters from South Africa mm-hmm oh it took his classes a few times but he was like one of those genuinely spiritual people right and he would say these things and you could tell he wasn't trying to manipulate you or namaste you or Satnam or he wasn't trying to bullshit you that's yeah and then there was another guy that needs to take classes with it it felt like he was always bullshitting ready always it was so a night now and he wound up banging this other dudes wife of course him a giant disaster he's that guy with the good acoustic guitar making eye contact was so funny too that he would sing sing in classes of course of course now there's you can you can smell it and that's why I had a hard time with yoga until I found this one teacher and she was just great it's the same thing with the contribution here it is cult controversy or something yeah while ago yeah okay yeah with TM can we make them a little larger I can barely read that shit yeah that's really small but say the organ organization have been the subject of controversy labeled a cult by several parliamentary enquiries or anti-cult movements of the world some also suggest that TM its movement are not a cult TM movement has been characterized in a variety of ways has been called a spiritual movement a new religious movement a millennia in any area mmm world affirming world affirming movement social movement a Grusin terd movement how a new book exposes the dark side of Transcendental Meditation I don't even understand where you would have liked where it would happen like there's no place to go honestly in ignorant of it so explain it to us yeah there's nothing it's very you know I tried meditating in all these different ways and this was this kind of made it very simple it doesn't just Seinfeld do this - yes yeah he's actually the one that that got me into it and for a long time I was thinking well I meditate I humph breath side kind of do it then I wasn't really feeling maybe I was I was always had in my head that maybe TM is different maybe maybe going and learning that would kind of dial it in to classes on it so I took four classes you went to saw this guy here in California and just go for an hour for four days in a row and he teaches you what to do it and the analogy is that there's this the reality is just in this tumultuous ocean waves we're on the top we're on the surface that's where we live and this is just a way through a mantra to get you down below the waves to sit for 20 minutes and it's very freeing because there's no there's no controlling your mind there's no forcing it to come back and count breaths as know you're never you're not you're not thinking about what you have to do you just do the mantra do the mantra and then let it go and if your brain starts thinking about work and thinks about work if it starts thinking about your wife inside just let it be let it be let it be and 20 minutes you pop out of it and you feel not right away I don't feel changed immediately like I'll feel you know I have an Apple watch and my heart rate is low I think it's 40 to 50 all the time or when you do now when I'm doing that how much is it normally probably like 80 what's it right now mmm how long does it take to find that out it's gonna take a while hey Siri it's at 80 80 yeah and you get down to 40 when you yeah yeah yeah oh yeah it's very calming and it just kind of like gives your nervous system a respite that's pretty heavy it's pretty great it gives me a lot of energy activate Siri by saying hey Siri something oh yeah my series I didn't catch that series uh paint now people right now screaming at me because their cars what would you like me to do yeah but I don't feel it like right away but but like I'll notice it hours later that I have more energy like I'm still going what is the price how do you do it I just sit and what's the mantra everyone has an individual mantra tell us you much I can't come on bro what if someone's a gigantic Tom Papa fan they want you to want to do everything that you do well that's true it's jellybeans that's what you say no it's just the noise we might be weird if you just kept saying Jerry Seinfeld [Laughter] sourdough sourdough sourdough would be cool it's our it's a delicious food so no but it wouldn't be nearly as weird right so I'm tout so I do it first thing in the morning 20 minutes and then sometime in the late afternoon so can you explain all you do is you sit and just chant your mantra in my mind and you don't say it out loud don't say no okay so as you're just repeating the mantra in your mind you just try to stay on path of just keeping I just keep saying it and when I don't try and stay on a path I don't force anything I just keep saying it but if your brain rig you got a great idea for a new bit do you let it happen let it go okay to write the bit down or you know no oh you're risk you know I'm not that great of a comedian suppose I fucking been laying in bed and I was too tired to get up and I would wait I'd say I'm gonna run our yeah it definitely didn't know and and yeah 20 minutes and I'm telling you it my one friend described it is it's adds another four hours to your day Wow and it's really true when I when you call me today last minute to come in I took 20 before I came because I was dragging I went for a run this morning I meditated this morning but then I went for a run I came back I was writing and you called and you're like can you come on over I was like yeah that's cool but let me drop 450 minutes before I get in the club we did you meditated for 15 minutes yeah Wow do you do that before sets if I'm tired yeah if like it's towards the end of the day and I've got something that you know at night that's a little later does it help you make decisions yes how did you still make the decision to do a radio show at 7:00 in the morning because I'm not afraid of it because I know that I can meditate and I'll have energy how many days a week I don't have to worry about getting a good night's sleep ever no that's great I can meditate and then I'll be okay for the show that's crazy I can't do that yes you can you should go you should go okay really yeah I'd love to I'll hook you up with the guy can I just watch a YouTube video is that good enough now I've learned so much from YouTube though have you yes it's true [Laughter] you know what there is this mystery about it and I would research it and I was like maybe like why can't I just learn it mister the only difference is having this man explain it to you it kind of dials it in and I went back once since I learned it initially just to kind of tune up tune up hmm there's not that much but it's just you know they give you a little bit you know it's like playing tennis or something they're like now just hold it like this alright okay we're like in yoga they like you think you're doing this but your elbows are out just yeah I'm fighting them in that's big in yoga like sometimes the instructor will give you one thing she'll say one thing about your with the way you're standing or the way you keep your weight you're like oh yeah and then you just change it just slightly yeah right my god it's so much harder I know which you never would have learned at home yeah it's kind of a similar thing and it just an overtime so that's what it is on a daily basis but overtime it it makes you more chill things don't bother me the way they used to bother me just day-to-day aggravations normal bullshit there's it's there's it's um you slowly transform without realizing it do you know who Dan Harris is Sam Harris dan Harris dan Harris from no from what is this show Nightline is that wheeze on anyway he'd been on the podcast for a really nice guy he's got out is it night hland he's got an app called 10% happier mm-hmm and it's just a meditation app honey and just he wants people to know that it's been super beneficial to him so he talks about it often talked about on my podcast and he actually used the tank he's oh yeah yeah he's the only guy other than me that's ever used that tank I want to use the tank okay this was a weird thing afraid to fucking everybody but Dan Harris the only one who said I'm in let's do it when you called me today I was online looking at tanks do you have room in your house for one no that thing's big big it's big it's hotter than I thought well you know wanna be cold in there no it's true it's 94 degrees 94 yeah that's what you want that's about this about the temperature of the surface of your skin somewhere in that range how did he like it how long do I stay in there for an hour you could say as long as you want the most I ever do those two hours I've done more on edibles oh really I couldn't move stay put you ate edibles and went in there Oh many times really oh for sure yeah yeah that sounds kinda crazy it's crazy edibles have a unique visual quality when you're in a sensory deprivation tank because the tank enhances any sort of any sort of sensory experience many psychedelic experience is enhanced by the tank right because the tank removes the environment it removes the world right and it puts you in this place where you don't see anything or hear anything or feel anything you're just flying through space with the ear things and I don't I just let saltwater get in my ears that's what I saw online they put a little I just rinsed my ears out after it's over and seems to be fun right and just float you have to keep your head up I like my ears in the water it doesn't bother me I put my ears in the water when I swim too it's like yeah I mean not you're wearing earplugs when I swim in the ocean why am i wearing earplugs when I play in this tank I thought it was an audio thing that you're trying to shut out noise can you can't do it but I'm always aware of the plugs they kind of fuck with the bow of your head yeah I go that yeah there's an but if you had something over the ear well anyway you can you you can do it but some people like it that way some people use the one you don't have to no you don't have to some people actually get them form fitted to their ear so they slide in really easily you barely even notice that they're there and my understanding is that you lay like you're floating you don't have to support yourself you don't you shit your neck your head and open nothing just yeah you have to do it I can't believe you've never done it before and ya know I'm really super easy it's right here and you tell me one alright we'll open it up that'd be great so there's a shower in that room it's so it's real easy you just have to lay there and just slow down and just concentrate on your breathing and if you already have your TM routine know that I'm sure you could do it in there yeah just doing they're probably amazing right you'd want to buy a house with a extra garage bay hey yeah guy had one like actually I knew a guy who had one in a I didn't know him but I knew the guy who installed it the guy installed a shed in his backyard just so we could have the tank freely yeah so he bought like you know I got tool shed that you could buy and build when he built the shed had electricity plumbed out to it got like you know must have got some sort of a building permit and then plugged this fucking tank into the shed and that's where you know cuz he wanted one so bad in his house and he didn't have any room ins actual house how often do you do it and what does it give you well I do whatever I can it's what I like is once a week if I get once a weekend they'll be awesome wow that's a lot lately I haven't been lately it's been more like once a month right but when I do get in it I just I just can have a better perspective it makes it calms me down right it puts me into this place where things I'm not connected to the world anymore so I feel like I can look at the world from an outside perspective and you can do to carry that with you when you leave you mean you carry something I mean all these things are accumulative yeah you know all the books you read the documentaries you you watch all the conversations you have with insightful people all those things have in a accumulation effect right like you as you become exposed to more things talk to more cool people and listen to more cool ideas and have these cool conversations with people your your perspective enhances yeah it just does now it does it's like it seeps in yeah yeah no I totally buy it I think we should think of your perception the same way think we think about other skills that like some people are really good at running with a football right super hard to take them down just they're so good anticipating your moves and getting out of the way and and and they have they have everything down right yeah I think that's the same way with everything and everything including your own perceptions of life and your own the way you view and the way you manage your own life I think you can get really good at it where things coming your way you just whoop not today motherfucker no shit not me again me yeah yeah and then or you could be that person who's like you know super uncoordinated unathletic kid all reaction yeah who is trying to tackle a super athlete you know no a hundred percent I think we're seeing about it that because the the one way is thoughtful the other way is thoughtless yes that's the think that seems to be like kind of the key for just paying attention to that aspect of your life that definitely has an effect on it yeah what I'm saying is also that that is definitely true but what I'm saying is also that I think the way you interface with life is a skill and I think we don't think of it as a skill yeah we don't think of it as something you get better at or that we even try to get better at and right this includes the way you communicate with people yeah that includes like the friendships that you have and the making sure your friends know that you love them making sure your friends know you care about them like all these things are this is a part of the way you live life like and yeah you get better at this as a skill you only think of skills as things that we've decided to do right I want to play piano oh my god you skill at playing piano I'm a really good golfer oh you have golfing skill right you don't think of like the way you interface with people and the way you don't think of that as a skill no I know which is we should yes absolutely that's what I always think of that in terms of like the interpersonal stuff just in basic manners like there used to be real guidelines for how you said hello to somebody and when you took your hat off and yes how you said goodbye and all those little all those what we're perceived as stuffy mannerly things that people had to do stuck-up people had to do they're helpful they're really like how to act at a funeral how to act at a birthday party all those that will rule etiquette exactly and if there's to teach Clark courses and etiquette yes and without it it's kind of like it's stupid not to play with it because we all we need a bit of all the stuff we're talking about is creating your own little guidebook to get through life do you think they still teach etiquette in any high schools is Addison a focus of study we have known we have such little money for schools they're getting rid of art they're getting rid of gym there's probably there's probably not a lot of etiquette that seems like a critical life skill though it is it really it really is because how you so one of the things that's true is how people how much people enjoy being around you that makes your life more enjoyable and people don't think of it that way they oftentimes think I want to be the one that's enjoying life like especially selfish people right they think of what they want uh-huh right right but if people enjoy being around you right you'll enjoy everything more this is what they don't understand like the the solo effort that's right of going through life like with a narcissistic perspective yeah one of the major problems with that is there's no one to share it with cuz you're all out for yourself that's right even if you get there you're gonna be filled with sadness and despair that's right it's not what you want what you want us to be happy right well I know you think that you have to be all about yourself to be happy but in fact that is a way to ensure unhappiness regardless of success that's right that's the mindfuck yeah exactly that's the mindfuck well you think that these small things wouldn't have a big effect on you right you think that well like having a sense of community going to the same shops all the time you would think that's just me doing errands no you're now connected to the woman that works at that pharmacy you're connected to that at the grocery store you're connected to that person at the church whatever it is in your little world and you think you're just going about your day but you're not you're getting enriched by these by these interactions with you dealing with the other human beings in a in a nice manner is rewarding and it gives you a sense of place it gives you a sense of belonging a sense of love all of those things so you have to learn that yourself that's the problems trip but that's yet nobody guides you along that path it's an important perspective I mean it really is it's it's an important angle on life they look at it this way and you'll benefit greatly and you also bring up those around you yeah that's and also bring up those around you benefits you greatly that's everybody yeah and when you're in a position where you can help your friends in that way and you support each other and you build each other up when that person has success you get great joy like great satisfaction from seeing your friends succeed Yeah right people have a hard time especially I mean I don't know how it was when you were starting out comedian but I had a hard time with other people's success when I first started out and I think resulted because nothing was happening for me right I was like god damn it how did he get that show oh my god how did he get there right it's a dumb way to look at it and I had to recognize that it was dumb I had to learn me too just by paying attention to myself going why don't what is wrong with you like I will occasionally talk to myself as if I'm me outside of me huh what the fuck is this it's like something it's the only way to really look at yourself right it's hard to do but if you just how would I feel if I wasn't me if I was outside of me watching me right I'd be like what do you what are you bitching about that guy's a fucking idiot you're not even working on yourself you sitting here complaining about stuff yeah but that's default for so many people well that's envy right right and it's very easy to have when you're discovering yourself and trying to make your way and yeah as a comedian and you're like well I'm doing all the right things people laugh at me why did that guy just show up and he's on MTV and I'm not sure I mean and that also exists in in haters right like when you see someone especially when it comes to kourt's teams you see some of the guys that are like sports haters or they'll call this guy a pussy and this guy fucking sucks and he's a bum and he's this and he's yeah how much effort are you putting into your own life right how much are you putting into shitting on this guy well it's easier to do that Yeah right there instant gratitude yeah gratification rather I remembered I had I had the same thing that you did I was in New York I was working at the Comedy Cellar and I was just getting angry and frustrated I couldn't get on Conan I wanted to get on I just wanted to get on it and it wasn't until I stopped paying attention to what everyone else was doing consciously like told myself don't even go in the room don't even don't read about other people just blinders put blinders on this is just you and your little path enjoy yourself and go about it try and really shut it out yeah and that's when everything got correct and when it got correct that's when I got Conan that's when all these things started happening cuz I was only worried about myself and then later on now you have perspective you can watch other people and actually have joy that these people are doing these things Conan is the nerd Seal of Approval and I mean that in a good way like you're smart comedian and you get Conan that's like damn you nailed that you got the smart show that's the smart show yeah it was always I did it yeah isn't the first one was in New York yeah oh when when he was in New York might one of my friends was writing for him in the early early early early early days yeah well he was so creative like he had such a yeah he was a real funny writer and they everything came from that you know so you wanted to be a part like if you couldn't be hacky and get on the show so like you had to be working you had to try and be unique like it was a seal of approval that you were comedic ly unique yeah and that was important I knew a couple guys who work for him Brian Kylie I think yeah he's still there yeah he's still there yeah yeah Brian I mean Laurie Gil Martin oh I don't know Laurie but I knew another guy amir amir go long mm-hmm he is a stage name was stage name was James lemur funny dude you know yeah but he worked for him and when he and I were friends and I went to one of the early tapings it was weird to see because they they had scripted conversations now eventually the he went on to become so comfortable on stage where he just would ask questions and then play off and riff and write but in the early days they had their conversation scripted what do you mean the cover so like him and a guess and no and what's-his-face the guy his sidekick Andy Ricky yeah him and Andy Richter would have would be reading off cue cards oh really yeah so they they would know what they were going to say well basically doing like a sketch that's a rye toast right yeah it's like they had written out the jokes right but it was like of course the network wanted that because they wanted to make sure it was funny how do you know it's not funny write it right take a chance you guys are gonna be funny it's just so funny because they seem like such naturally funny yeah like but it's hard when you have all these people on your back to free yourself up to like to fail well the early days of any kind of a new talk show are so risky yeah it's like who the fuck knows where this is gonna go he was one of the only guys that like figured out a way to break into that system right like George Lopez did for a little while yeah but that late-night system it's a fucking hard thing to do it's a grind it's a joy because it's everybody does a version of the same show that Jack Paar did in like nineteen yes hero and yes and yet like trying to do something completely different mm-hmm fails a lot of the time yeah but they all have a desk yeah there's a desk to get desk sits next to them a desk which is a fucking holy weird way you'd have a conversation if he came over a guy's house yeah and he's above you in a desk it's an elevated desk lifter elevated no elevators but you know what's weird is like when James Corden does it like just they're all on chairs and there's no desk it's just like leading into each other that's weirder we're yeah yeah I don't see your legs I watched it once it was like three people on the couch together I'm like what the fuck is happy we're going on strange yeah it's it's weird well I'm so spoiled by podcasts yes so spoiled by no time constraints yeah I'm so spoiled alright by all of it but you know it's uh it's kind of yeah you spoiled is when Bernie was on last week I listened to your Bernie episode it was so good because I never got to hear him just breathe yes to just hear him talk yes he's super reasonable anybody just to hear them just go for a length of time you really get to know who they are when you're trying even in these late-night shows it's just boom boom pop pop pop pop pop sound bites and bites sound bite you don't really get a sense of who these people are it's impossible I'm sure some people listening right now wish this was Thomas a sound tight but no but you think like if you were on a show right now like one of those panel shows was five people on they come to you real quick and you have like 15 seconds of talk and you're worried that someone else is gonna jump in and try to stomp on your punchline right which does happen if you're trying to do a show and it was like just us and our friends right the fight goes like Chris D'Elia was in the air and Bryan Callen was in here we were all talking like men you you you better get something out quick many other people in the room yeah this is what those debates are like it's a condensed version that's right of a conversation and you also have an actual physical time limit like you have seconds to respond and then and then they start talking over you I know time is up mr. senator mr. senator your time's up mr. senator okay I know you fuck it's no weights it's no way to really understand people and you have to be a forceful moderator but then when you are a forceful moderator you're like injecting yourself into this conversation yeah America doesn't want that's good way to people to hate you it's why people hate you it's gonna fucking hate you everyone's gonna hate your guts yeah it's it's one of those weird ancient holdovers from the past is wholly and completely unnecessary and and in fact probably kind of fucking dangerous because your your you don't ever get a chance to see what a person's actually like you just give us a chance to see their show will you listen Donald Trump show like Donald Trump a show I'd lock you up you'd be in jail like that kind of shit right everybody cheers roars that's a show it's who's best at television right right right and he's a fucking television guy he's a television star than those clowns a star yes it was like wall TV when he came through and was debating against the Republicans in the in that run-up to in in all those debates he got up there like a comedian he was like I'm gonna talk about I'm in the moment yes I'm gonna call everything out I'm not gonna play this BS of all your little etiquette that you've got going on and he it he was a star he was a story knows how to work it so till does this Biden thing that he's doing now he's constantly making friend a Biden called him sleepy Joe Biden and he shows like some misquote that Biden said does anybody something about what we're here for the facts not the truth or something like that what is the crazy Biden quote that he had that everybody's been making fun of listen this I say stupid shit all the time everybody does who talks a lot but they talk a lot you're gonna jumble your words together I do it all the time of course but if you're running for president man they find something like that a jumble here a jumble there you better be ready to defend yourself that's right but that's the thing you someone has to act the way he acts exam you've got to be in the moment you got to call things I could be honest here comma you got to be a comic yeah trumped when he was running he reminded me of like the comics from Long Island big loud insult comics Biden tells other words we choose truth over facts what was I mean I wrote that truth over fat I'd like to see what he said how he said it how did he say yeah cuz he might have been like we truth suit truth choose truth over facts and that's not good time to get up everybody knows who Donald Trump is even as supporters know who he is we got to let it know who we are we choose unity our division we choose science over fiction we choose truth over facts and so folks if you're interested join me look we all mess up a line here in the seems like a remote control with a shitty battery it's kinda getting the volume but not quite a high change the channels that you gotta move it around bro he's got so little juice left in the tank I know Donald Trump will chew him up unless he gets a good doctor you need a good doctor he's get on steroids immediately don't you think trying to take something for sure yeah you can't be that age and not be able you got to take something oh he's got billions of dollars why wouldn't he take some course he's supposedly he has been on some sort of form of and feta mean prescribed by a doctor in the past I was like this that gives me the sniffles that's why stifling me all the time but that Lee he also have a cold I mean he's fucking eight years old he's the president United States I'm sure fairly stressful job yeah but he there was a journalist that was claiming that he had some sort of diet pill prescription I've been brought up the very pharmacy where you got it fulfilled right who know if it's true who knows if it's true and right but so many people are on adderall today so so have you ever taken it no I have not I'm scared Jamie kami-sama threw it away allegedly I was not a criminal and I don't have a prescription no I would like to I imagine it's probably pretty fun to write with I would imagine it would it would kill a lot of your creativity you think so yeah because I think it would be great to organize with that's how the great late great Robert Schimmel that's how he described it to me he I loved him I loved him too um he gave me my first Starbucks ever did you really mm-hmm Wow you guys are on the road together or something yeah we were in New Jersey I'm like now you know I stopped drinking milk and stuff he's like come on come on come he's always a sweet guy I miss him really bad yeah so funny he was a great person too I'm so sweet yeah super not fucking hilarious so funny you ever hear is Siegfried and Roy joke yes yes this shit ends tonight oh my god but he had a heart condition right you know that yeah and the accidentally took an adderall once uh-huh um he he thought he was taking some other medication forgot what and accidentally took the adderall and he goes I fucking freaked out I call my doctor I'm like hey I'm talking he's tell me what the milligrams is how much to take so I took one of these he said don't worry about it but you're gonna be wide awake for like the next 12 hours well I was it's not gonna kill you it's not that bad you're not dying and he goes I went over all my notes he goes I started organizing things that's what I've heard from people when they take adderall it makes him like want to organize yeah which is weird but not create necessarily if you give me speed I'm gonna want to go run up a hill or something I'm gonna go I want to do something to City you're not going to want to organize if I'm on some kind of speed I'm gonna want to do something stupid yeah you know I always yeah you want to be physical yeah if I drink coffee if I drink too much coffee I just start jumping up and down fuck yeah I've been drinking on duty tonne aid with coffee with caffeine in it I forget it makes it it's like this little drink um one of the ketone companies that sends me shit oh yeah bunch of keto companies nope they'll send you send you stuff you try stuff yeah yeah I apologize to the company but they make this shit that has caffeine and ketones together and fucking wonderful before exercise just talking about you want to go crazy yeah real good weight lifting exercise right good no caffeine is good to work out on Pacquiao yeah it's great for lifting it opens yep yeah opens up the vessels yeah shit your brains out though you gotta be careful well that's not fun correctly there's nothing worse than when I go for a run and a half mile in you're like I don't get to Nate probably yet banking feel I think oh is that it is it his company look I mean he's probably just saying I looked up uninvolved with him no that's not the same stuff there no it looks different okay but I think he's giving me some of that too I think it's very similar does that have caffeine in it you still eat that way predominantly no no no really no it's too rigid and it wasn't enjoying it as much but I do eat a very low carb high protein high fat diet that's your balance yeah but I fuck off I'll have a brand and jelly sandwich if I want one we're gonna have so much fun at Musso and Frank's join it but I will eat like cream of corn stuff like that oh yeah but I it's like for me I try to think of it as an 80/20 thing I eat 80% super healthy uh-huh and 20% I allow myself questionable choices that's good yeah not not like sugar yeah yeah it's not the process yeah but not like 20% dessert you know I mean right there's not 20% of my diets on ice cream or candy or some of theirs I might have spaghetti with clams right right you know I mean red yeah which is not the good food right vegetables meat that's what I vegetables meat no free yeah I fruit sure in the morning mornings yeah usually before a first workout I like I like fruit it hydrates you yeah it's easy too it's easy on your body and you can work out on fruit with no problems at all right I could run like hills with like a couple peaches in me right it's not gonna office sick how greater peaches right now right now peaches are oh how did Georgia get so connected with peaches think about that shit right if you think about peaches you think about Georgia yeah goddamn this maybe Hawaii and coconuts but no yeah right is Georgia and Georgia and peanuts oh that's a Jimmy Carter right yeah but what other Florida oranges I guess Florida oranges but I think Georgia Wisconsin cheese oh yeah for sure yeah yeah but that's like dairy yeah that's a process it's that food you're making I've been a prett that grows in Jersey tomatoes yeah that's like if you were playing family feud be like New Jersey tomato let me see somebody says [Applause] survey says I'm still doing the voice from the Hogan's Heroes guy as Family Feud off you just notice 200 the dawson richard dawson he is the original i stick with him he made me don't go steve harvey know what there was a guy in between him and steve harvey Louie Anderson know there was a guy who killed him so oh yeah that's right yeah that guy yes yeah dead on the feud yeah what did he do did he die while he was hosting it or did he quit and then kill himself I don't remember he hung himself alright yeah I think so he was the host of family feud right yeah yeah but I think he I think it was you see the second host I think it was over ray combs ray combs homes he was the second host correct probably couldn't live up the shadow of Richard Dawkins just yeah yeah that's the guy man he's happy tell me that couldn't be a great movie right like there's something yeah gig that smile go back to that first picture with his hands up in the air I could I could see I could play that role I could I could see you playing that role I was gonna go with Steve Carell but yes he's not available trying to mix it the crazy movie about a guy like to remember what we did about the Hogan's Heroes guy about the this the lead of Hogan's Heroes now the guy who was with Richard Dawkins on Hogan's Heroes one of the guys who's with it what the fuck was his name the there was a movie called gang shot the gang know if he's got autofocus autofocus right Willem Dafoe yes we'll the thought was one guy but then there was another guy who played the Hogan's Heroes guy what the fuck's his name Bob oh yes yeah crane crane thank you Bob cranes was that Greg Kinnear yes yes yeah it was excellent yeah and it was it a real porn habit right he would make porn and he would make it with Willem Dafoe apparently there would be filming girls and then they think the Willem Dafoe character killed him but I don't think they ever solved the crime oh really I think was one of those murders when they never totally solved the crime I'm not true I'm mashing two movies up because Greg Kinnear also played Chuck Barris from the gong show who did he was in the CIA yeah yeah yeah that was you know actions of a dangerous mind was that it something like that wasn't him though God wasn't that him who the fuck remembers anything too much stupid head with Sam Rockwell Sam Rockwell's I wasn't canary oh right right right no it's an amazing Sam Rockwell movie the moon oh yeah oh he's the whole move it's so good I'm telling you folks like this is all I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna tell you is it's only Sam Rockwell for a whole hour and a half and it's fucking amazing I saw that in the theater in New York oh good yeah is there even another actor there one other actor in the movie maybe I think I think you're right halfway through your something someone anymore it's good fucking great it's a fucking great movie he's such a good actor do you watch Fosse Burton he played Bob Fosse it was a no on FX no it was a TV show yeah about Bob Fosse you know the choreographer uh-huh and his wife okay did that burden it's like Chicago you did a version of jazz hands yeah it's really good he played he's yeah he's really good in it he's a great actor man yeah he's really good he was dating Leslie Bibb when Leslie Bibb I did a movie with Kevin James and Leslie Bibb was playing Kevin James's girlfriend and my ex-girlfriend and we were like competing for her love and I got to meet Rach what was the movie was called zookeeper oh yeah cute kids movie yeah yeah I loved everything Kevin James does yeah this makes me laugh it's a great guy too yeah mall cops come on yeah he's uh I mean are there modern pratfall type super physical comedians and movies today I know who is he might be the last yeah he was very athletic he was very light on his feet oh he a martial artist is he he's very talented oh really he's very good I heard he was really good at basketball really yeah I believe that I mean he eats a lot for sure he would not be denying that but his martial arts technique is excellent really he's got serious power he's got really good punch is really good kicks yeah he had a bunch of different different styles of martial arts that he trained when he was coming up now in just some of it I think some of it was kung fu some of it was karate but it was but he's he knows what he's doing knows he's played uh um he played a mixed martial artist in that movie here comes the boom right right yeah he played a guy who was like a high school coach that was trying to raise money for school so he had some UFC fights he's physically just funny he's fine I remember you like in the comic strip early on watching him he I think he was he was famous already but he had a bit about picking out greeting cards being in front of the greeting card aisle yes yes right picked them all out and yeah just physically yeah without a word at times just looking at the cards so damn funny he had a one of my favorite bits ever about it was back in the day when you had automatic locks on a car and when someone would try to open the door while you were hitting unlock they would cancel each other out so he had this super frustrated bit about his girlfriend reaching for the door and you know and it won't and it keeps canceling out he's getting more and more frustrated it's no I mean there's so many moments of that and Kings king a queen oh yeah yeah all of his like physical just frustration never like physical guy like if you really stop and think about they're so few a Chris Farley of course there's a giant physical yeah he was very Ralph Kramden yeah Jackie Gleason a big guy but very very graceful yeah but like um he was he was like an accelerated version right yeah yeah of like John Belushi like a larger bigger more spastic more crazy yeah I mean he would fucking get sweaty and scream and right whereas Belushi was like really physical too but they didn't get to that no no he's wrong like Farley is more in that Kevin James kind of lightness you know what Belushi had Belushi had like this weird hilarious feeling of danger yeah like he was dangerous it was funny like an Animal House right he was dangerous it was reckless it was rock and roll it was like off-kilter yes yeah when he smashed that guy's guitar when he was playing songs yeah yeah there's the danger from him and like yeah blues brother yes yes that was dangerous right yeah that off-kilter kind of thing mm-hmm no Kevin James Farley they had a sweetness yeah it wasn't danger it was it was energetic but always you you weren't in danger but there's a question like I'm sure someone could do that Belushi thing mm-hmm without drugs oh yeah I'm sure no one has so sure that someone can do it yeah is that beat just being cocky I don't like you don't need vitamins just eat bread and lift weights yeah no you need vitamins but what was that was fueled by yeah that was cocaine right that was okay probably yeah out of it but I think he was doing speed balls right so he's doing cocaine and heroin oh man not how he died yeah that's how rochette told I do Marmont oh yeah I don't know I don't know that's one of the things about like great wild people who's it who's who's really wild now like that nobody really right nobody that we want to throw into the bus yeah like cocaine wildness doesn't know like or just like that reckless like danger I guess what's his name has a little of it in his acting hope Tom Tom Hardy yeah yeah he's pretty rugged he's got that kind of thing like I mean he did two movies he did the Dunkirk mmm-hmm Batman with his face completely covered and he still was able to emote danger yes and like he was just able to express so much with half of his face yeah it guys pretty serious he's he's a bad motherfucker yeah for sure and good in that movie warrior good that movie warrior is that when he played two characters no he played a fighter him and his brother they wanna it was an MMA movie mm-hmm they went up fighting and seen Nick Nolte's in it he has this incredible performance Nick Nolte oh yeah completely steals the movie as this guy's alcoholic father who was a formally trained both of them that's a while man it's it's he's so good you forget how goddamn good and good Nick Nolte is like whether or not it's drug fueled or not there is something to actors who have some manic part to their personality that the camera that they can harness yeah but still so it's not it's not bullshit when they when they film it you know what I mean who's that doesn't come off as fake and like salty phantom Mickey Rourke oh it's him from different movies over same token I'm Moyer and then Bronson I think yeah Bronson was like his first big break have you seen what the pictures of him playing Capone but the warrior one look at the one in the middle that's what's on dude he got fucking Jack yeah when you see him in the movie I mean he looks like a professional fighter yeah I mean there's no if ands or buts no I mean he really does he looks like a guy who fight in the UFC physically he got his body into that form that's hard to do man didn't it didn't Hanks get uh diabetes from going up and down so much who Tom Hanks Tom Hanks went up and down and wait yeah how dare you compared Tom Hanks at Tom Hardy first of all to do his fucking body Tom Hanks night on that now he didn't there's not a fucking show he did the other thing he got real big and fat you know who else did that like castaway he was really scrawny and then he was like a regular dude maybe he fucked his body over starving himself to death Jaime is there a picture of Hardy is alkapone that's coming out yeah it's not a great shot yeah do you know who else did that for a movie who got super jacked they're like kind of a crazy way Jake Gyllenhaal oh wow look at that look at fucking score Robert or Al Pacino rather Dick Tracy villain yeah Wow oh they're saying he looks like it looks like they're making fun of them they're making that yeah Al Capone and that's a better shot Dick Tracy that's Al Pacino playing a Dick Tracy character right yeah he's my uncle pawn and victories oh that's what it was seemed care okay Goom you know Jake Gyllenhaal it's pronounced ha ha Google that guy from the movie southpaw the movie southpaw he was fucking jacked bro he played a boxer I mean fucking shoe look dude look at that I mean he looks like well Andre Ward in his prime I mean that's how shredded he is oh my god it looks like Roy Jones jr. almost he doesn't look like him at all bro he's so shredded but how much of that is 3d animations oh yeah yes you just take steroids and muck yeah I mean maybe they 3d animated him it's possible but he looks so good well I mean well maybe we should Google that okay look why don't you go back go back to the fifties go back to the picture you just had why how did Jake Gyllenhaal get so ripped okay the man man block click on that shit yeah I think he probably took some Mexican supplements and worked out like a motherfucker but either way there's no way you get that ripped without insane work insane because just do it all the time right all steroids are doing is helping you recover makes you recover you'll develop more muscle quicker because but you have to break down the muscle for the muscle to grow so you have to go through the workout so it doesn't it stimulate the growth of it yes but you can't be lazy and have that body right fucking impasse of all right so it's four five months long you've been working out twice a day even on Sundays his workout regime was about four to six hours a day he started training as a fighter sparring with real opponents and taking in some real punches his boxing workout consisted of all the things that a boxer would do shadow boxing heavy bag speed ball sparring focused pads double end rounds he says I was sparring and really getting hit it helped me understand the sacrifice it takes to be a fighter you can't play a boxer and just look like a boxer you have to believe that you can exist in that world well it's a good actor he's amazing actor but he is always I think it is he's always been an amazing I know he's really great and everything I know there was something other recently I just saw he was in I forget Brokeback Mountain playing games that's what you were watching all right he's that's a rare person that can do that I don't care what he was taking yeah I don't care if you're working out six hours a day there is not a fucking drug in the world that gets you that discipline right you have to do that right you have to do that yourself you have to force yourself it's mostly willpower well I'm pals with with Jason Bourne and he Jason Bourne is not a real person it's not I'm sorry what who do you think Jason Bourne is he's a character in a movie no he said he works for the government wait how do you say I'm pals with a from Bourne Identity yeah what'd you say I'm pals with Superman makes just as much sense Jason Bourne's on a real person wait what who he's saying you're friends with Jason Bourne he's if you see Matt Damon Damon oh yeah okay Matt Damon was at the in probably than that he was yeah I didn't get a chance to say yeah if he hears us hi Matt Damon yeah I love that guy I'm very impressed with him he's great he seems like a really interesting person tools like his very very wise person he is he's very smart anyway but watching him for the last Bourne movie he knows how to fight yeah he's got a great trainer Matt may amante Oh who like his name Angelo Dundee and I really yeah he's legit he's a great guy and but watching the two of them train all the time and it was like when he dials in it's like that's their life well you can tell when you watch someone doing something in a movie whether or not they put the time in right Keanu Reeves in John wick write that motherfucker put in the time I'm buying everything yeah and sinker right buying him kicking people's asses and finding people he shoots guns like a guy who's been tactically trained as a real assassin I buy every fucking second oh yeah even though it's cartoonish and over-the-top and key are you sure what you can tell when he flips him on their head breaks her arm and stomps their head and then shoots him when they're down I'm I'm in yeah yeah he did it he did it right legit that's why I do more comedic roles move dude pounding on the joints that's fuckin when you like my friend Tate Tate Fletcher yeah he just got a concussion from doing a scene in a movie where he was doing some stunt work his Tate does a lot of acting but he also does lost that work - uh-huh and he hit his head and heard it real bad you know and like he's real light-sensitive right now in his time and VD and yeah and Tate you know Tate had a career as a fighter as well ya know so he fought in the UFC he you know had a quite a few professional fights and a lot of sparring yeah I mean the professional fights not sparring rounds you know so he's kind of sensitive to getting hit in the head anyway he doesn't wanna get hit in the head any more for him to fall like on the set ooh like that that world of like a stunt man like we're talking about gene LeBell yeah Brad Pitt character those are the toughest fucking people oh man come on toughest animals it's a hard way to make a living man you're always falling out the back of trucks and wreck and motorcycles on purpose and yeah exactly I wonder if the numbers the number of stuntmen has gone down since animation 3d stuff has started that's interesting is improved I bet there's a lot less of it I bet you're right right but for some things you need a stunt person yeah you need someone also to tell you what those guys are so wild though like we had stunt guys that developed a lot of the events on fear factor they developed a lot if I'm like a lot of times what would happen was like the producers would come to the stunt man and the stunt man and they would say hey this is what we're gonna do we're gonna take a helicopter and throw someone off on a fuckin bungee cord between these two mountains like can we do this without killing me yeah and then the stunt guys has to look at it and say okay let me see how we can make this so that no one died right but they are willing to take so much more risky a regular person like their idea of like you getting hurt right they're not worried about getting hurt like a normal person right now Alex Honnold right the guy doesn't he really doesn't have fear no no no no he's that's different is it yeah yeah that's different because the stunt man if that would be if Alex Honnold was telling you you can climb that wall right because he's doing it himself yeah who knows he's really good at it the thing about the stunt guys is the stunt guys look they're not trying to get anybody hurt but they're not worried about getting hurt themselves like you know their idea of getting hurt is slightly different than a regular person right because they're just so fucking tough yeah and they're used to doing it yeah used to jump it off fucking horses and shit and yeah so we had this one event where they were they were making the contestants ride bulls and it was there's only two times in the history that show us like don't do this right don't do this and that was a big one and I was like you guys are crazy these are bulls and this is this is really what he said to me it stunk I said he goes out don't worry about it boo these are stunt Bulls I know their stunt Bulls he was yeah it's they're less aggressive I go devil no he's a stunt doll I bet he thinks he's a bull I bet he thinks he's a bull and I bet he's not gonna like the fact of all these fucking people riding him is you're having like eight people ride them or it wasn't a stunt stunt ball I'd be so pissed right now would he that bull launched these people through the fucking air launched them the way you would shake a tennis ball off your hand if you had a tennis ball in your hand he would just do like that yeah flying that's what those people did with these that's the bull did with these shoes literally anyone get hurt the ball and just underhanded it people would fly did anyone get really hurt in the taping of that show it no not one just that's that is come on seven that's what that was right there's a lot of that for sure with the the bolt one because the boat one that the bolt kicked in the air is just barely missing people's heads sued I was watching I was like this is fucking told everyone did not do it was like that the people like well I want to get that 50 grand go man I get I get we were saying but this is not the time for you there's another way to get this money it just seems like a way to get injured for the rest of your life what about the Mark Wahlberg you see all his videos how he gets up at 2:30 and goes into the gym you ever see his Instagram I have not I did see a thing with him and James Corden though oh yeah well James tried to do the workouts with him oh really yeah he brought they went over to Marky Mark's basement yeah it worked out together he keeps posting like he gets up at 2:30 there in the gym is a gym inaudible and they heels to bed at 7 o'clock and but because he's up at 2:00 and he's it's obviously working for him super disciplined guy yeah then he's in great shape but James Corden tried to do the workout where them was pretty funny let's gather he's got a gym in his house that's like a hall like a gym gym oh yeah went to the gym that's his whole house so like his this section of his house was Jimmy's his epic so you know they had all these crazy workout so we're doing well I guess if those are the roles that you're always gonna do it badasses yeah yes always doing like you played Micky Ward and that movie the fighter remember that yeah yeah he's got it so he's doing those action roles yeah but you know you could sleep in to still work out at 10:00 why be at 2:30 in the morning no I'm not that's not healthy for only things that's big about that is that you know that you are getting up early you know like my friend Jocko gets up every day at 4:30 in the morning in his entire Instagram his photos of his watch 4:30 in the morning and crazy workouts that he's doing uh-huh or shooting his bow or you know he's when do you wake up Jitsu I usually wake up around 7 or 8 yeah that's how I like to do different things early in the morning I like to take yoga some mornings I like to lift weights some mornings I don't generally like to do jujitsu at 8:00 in the morning I like to do jujitsu around noon right wake up right I like to eat something too because it's so ruthless yeah I don't want to be hungry right class I want to be like if that right hydrated and fueled like two hours after work or after a meal right I want to go into something like that but like something where I could just push myself and I don't worry about being strangled mmm yeah kettle bells or somebody I'll do a brutal kettlebell workout first thing in the morning I'll just have like a caffeine drink and right they need a couple pieces of fruit and just go yeah it's good 90 you you do spots late at night so you shut it down at some point during the day do nap no no no you never nap no no I don't just I need it interesting I don't feel it ever helps right yeah I'd rather power through right and I get it if you need it if I felt like I needed it like it definitely took a bunch of naps when I got back from Italy cuz I was wacked out because I was teaching house rocked me up man I would sleep for like three hours and then I would wake up and I'd be like why am i wide awake right 2:00 in the morning this is so stupid and then I would be up and then I get really sleepy around 6:00 I try to sleep for an hour how to wake up then I woke up again and that would take a nap in the afternoon it took like a good four or five days before that lever out and I started sleeping on a normal schedule ma'am but you work out so much you don't you're burning energy like usually when you're really in shape you don't need naps you shouldn't use TM for your your brain yeah that sounds like I should do it well just give me a mantra once you come up with a mantra for me you don't want you become my instructor you've been doing it long enough I want to go to some other dude Diaz just Diaz yeah which one Nick or Joey how about Nate me Nate Diaz now Joey Joey Joey Diaz just think Joey Diaz Joey's going ideas you could just do it you could just create it just use ohm I don't understand why yeah why do you have a mantra yeah what tell us your mantra can't I can't I'm not allowed they'll come and get me that's also not true huh that's so not true no they won't come again me but it's kind of a personal thing because it has no meaning if I say it then you're gonna say something back now there's something attached to it that's why you don't say it oh okay you know what I mean your word it's just a pure sound that has no mental attachments to it in the earliest days of religion wasn't it a problem if you said God's name aren't there like certain sects of religion that don't think that you should say God's name mmm whatever God's name is whatever it's Todd Yeshua or whatever it is whatever the name of God is mm-hmm isn't fine I'm trying to remember this sounds like a Jordan Peterson thing no yeah he would know you would know the answer to it yeah well obviously well obviously like the way says obviously that's pretty good that's very Canadian you might be a Canadian spy well obviously you can't you can't how you say you can't talk about the name without it coming back at you obviously it's pretty good right he's one of the most misinterpreted guys I think I've ever met not just willfully misinterpreted where people take the words and the things that he's saying yeah willfully misconstrue them mm-hmm they they purposefully change what he's saying to make it more offensive more unreasonable people are angry why well it's hard to say I think part of it has to do with the way he initially came onto the scene because of the transgender that was yes was he was very concerned that they were forcing people to use certain language right new pronouns and we're saying like why do you have a problem with people's pronouns he's saying that's not what I'm saying right I the problem is not whether or not I would have a problem with someone's pronouns the problems being legally compelled to use these new words as someone's inventing like I am NOT doing this right the government telling me how I can speak exactly not just that the government also being influenced by people who want you to be legally compelled to say their their pronouns right it's a slippery slope of control more than it is a thing of culture or of morals or compassion or being progressive he's not saying that he's saying it based on his very deep understanding of history and of some communist dictatorships that have gone horribly wrong yeah some Marxist philosophies that he's aware of that he thinks write horribly damn it damaging and dangerous if implemented on a large scale like if you allow large groups of people to control language and to to legally compel people to say these new words you're inventing right this is not good this is a bad path for humans right just historically it's a bad path right and so that's how he broke on the scene and in that time period all these people who opposed what he was saying they were labeling him as transphobic they were labeling him as homophobic all these different things that are not true right then he gets connected to this Pepe the Frog thing right because he thinks it's kind of hilarious that the Internet is taken on Pepe the Frog as like this meme the feels good man frog and now gets you didn't know the whole thing that I didn't know any of this I didn't know you know I'm happy the Frog is racist no okay this is serious okay you have to know this because if somebody wants you to take a picture with this fucking Pepe the Frog thing there are a certain group of people out there will decide Tom Papa some sort of all white white nationalist white supremacist Nazi person one no bullshit a fucking frog a frog yeah you know why why because some people have used that frog in a negative way some people most people use that frog as a joke like rails bad man and the frogs like mmm and it's an animated thing just a frog a cartoon of a frog okay but the alt-right or I should even say the alt right people on internet forums uh-huh would constantly and consistently use that frog as a joke everything like they had a they had Donald Trump's hair on that frog right but it's more humor and mocking and making fun of things and as the British would say taking the piss he's taking the piss with the Frog huh huh but there were a few that would have the Frog with like a swastika armband and a fucking Nazi hat on sure why because they because they're internet people right like you leave something on the internet eventually yeah it doesn't mean that it's a symbol of Nazis and it's a symbol of white supremacy because that's not what it was right so he dared logically argue this and people were very very upset is that I thought he was defending yes he's defending white national yeah I can say no no no there's a fucking cartoon frog guys and it's not only that it's a cartoon frog written by a guy who specifically sued people to get them to stop using the cartoon flag even Alex Jones how to pay out a lawsuit because Infowars used an image of that cartoon flat can you see if that's true I'm pretty sure that's true but it was a nominal amount it was only like he lost it in Corbett it's like a very small fifteen thousand dollars really pay for Alex that's not a lot of money settlement it's a 70 so I'm sure he paid way more in legal fees right deal with something like that I'm sure if they had to put together some sort of a defense for fifteen thousand dollars I'm sure that probably cost a shitload of money but the point is that this frog has like all these different meanings mm-hmm so as soon as it gets connected though to an awful thing yeah then immediately like you got to go okay we can never use that frog again right let's rocks corrupted now given what we know and here's where it gets really weird given what we know about the Internet and specifically foreign influence on memes sure like Russia yeah there are some factories that we're making funny memes about Hillary Clinton right funny memes about all kinds of things yeah and doing so in order to get people upset or to laugh or to mock mark certain ideas and and push the narrative one way or another through humor and they made some really funny ones there's a woman named Renee to rest if she came on the podcast was explaining she had for a project she had to go through hundreds of thousands of these things oh she's like some of them were really funny right and these were ones that they know were made by Russians well I need to try to get people upset about certain things she's how many of those Pepe the Frog things came from came from that right how many right if you if you had a frog that was mocking everybody and the Frog like was a really good symbol to make someone think that you're a fool so like you say something ridiculous and you're trying to push for something right and then that frog is a meme with you what you're saying but he looks like an idiot bring all sudden you look like an idiot right the frogs mocking you if you can't beat the Frog yeah right but you can turn the frog into a Nazi right then when you turn the Frog not say anybody uses the Frog oh yeah yeah so he got caught up in this yeah he took a photo with these guys and he's talked about Pepe the Frog mm-hmm on my podcast I talked about I explained the whole thing to me right depth and yet I've seen articles connecting him to white nationalists because there's a photo of him with the Frog she's Louise pull-up photo of Jordan Peterson with Pepe the Frog because he took a photo with these guys where they had like a frog flag and he thought it as what weirdest saying these guys that are taking the piss it's like a Flat Stanley or something right it's like thinking innocent a man's Internet version of Flat Stanley that's right primarily a 4chan thing really Jamie knows this shit more honestly there he is so see he's standing there with these guys two fellas are holding up this Pepe the Frog flag Jordans laughing and smiling with them and one of them has a I think it's a make America great again hat on look these kids are human trolls they're alive on the Internet yeah and then think of one that thinks it's hilarious to be out there in public trolling with Pepe the Frog flag and a make America great again hat oh my god he's fucking with people right this is what this is yes obviously it's a lot of what internet culture wrapped yeah he Jordan understands this and talks about it and discusses it in length and he makes it make sense right so that's one other reason why people are upset at him yeah yeah yeah and it's it's just very easy to label people in certain ways today it's very easy to label someone as a misogynist right no I know but if you listen to the breath of his work yeah this is not a bad person he's a very good person very enlightening like there's a lot of like real practical ways to you know as he says clean up your room and live right witness a personal friend of mine I like him very much well obviously good uuuuuhhh how do you how do you say you you you think about these things that's what you were trying to you're trying to - ah you know what he's trying to have a conversation it shows how actually articulate he is because you can't come up with things that he would say that makes sense well it's alright there's no catchphrase for him yeah well obviously clean up your damn room clean up your damn room let's see huh he's got a lot of great advice he's off yeah a very very insightful person what about all of this is on a bad guy at all no these people have this horrible thing than they do today we're in when they want to dismiss someone instead of instead of listening to them instead of listening to them and debating the points that they have or analyzing them in an objective kind way they try to attack everybody's attacking everything everything sucks everybody sucks everybody's stupid everybody's racist everybody's dumb everybody's ridiculous everybody's a liar everybody yes you're not on my team you're on someone else's team it's just so much of that today there's so much necessarily enjoy listening to him I enjoy all those those biblical speeches that he gives about trying to interpret the Old Testament and stuff like that it's it's it's very very interesting it's very I've never heard somebody connect our practical trying to find our way through the woods to those writings like he always just heard of it is growing up as a Catholic kid you just kind of heard them as like their stories in there obviously you know their metaphors and whatever but I never heard somebody really say no it's big it's how you treat your father another way you you're trying to figure out your way through life that's what these things meet like you know yeah he is a it's a very fascinating listen yeah he's got a very unusual way of interpreting biblical verses and stories from the Bible yes stories from you know other religions as well where's yeah explain like what and how it sort of interfaces with man's search for meaning right you know yeah exactly it's like you like a practical way to kind of you know approach the world to do in a time when we have nothing to hang on to it's kind of interesting stuff to think about yeah and that's one of the reasons why some people think that it survived as long as it has that there's some merit and using it as a like a framework in your life yeah you know there's like some practical we were saying earlier of having some kind of a guidebook mm you know to get you through life like even just in the etiquette manner stuff it's also the big stuff it's like you know I had a friend who's whose father passed away and it's like it's a hard thing when you don't have a framework a guide willing to help you deal with that and get through the woods and you're just kind of out there on your own right it is very difficult not in heaven right you know and I'm watching my watchin my grandparents when my two grandmothers who went to church all the time and they didn't muddy themselves with whether or not this was you know the the answer but it gave them structure and it gave them okay so the neighbor died and we go to the church and we go to the wait can we go to the thing and then we have cake and then we sit and and pay visit of to his widower to the widow you know the next week like these things these roots these pathways made them very happy people mmm yeah it wasn't like kind of over thinking well is the church bullshit they didn't care about that they didn't get into maybe it is maybe it's not is it out is it all the answers they didn't get that far they just got this is how you deal with this funeral love your neighbor yeah you know what I mean there's like that practical little guidebook stuff that we kind of lack right now like Wild West Christianity right one of the things about Wild West films maybe it's accurate maybe it's not but one of things that I always enjoyed is simplistic way they interface with the world the way they discussed the way things are well I guess we're just gonna have to go do that everybody just got stuff done yeah when they had that sort of pioneer mentality right like they were rough folks right so if they were talking about Jesus and what Jesus would a good god-fearing Christian would do they had a very clear and distinct framework for right where they would operate you know and like I played by those winds yeah I'm Christian so this is how I feel and like you'd be like wow the simplicity and ruggedness of this guy's vision yeah yeah and then you know is it corrupted by people yeah is it you know going did he use that to go attack some Native Americans what's hotter you know a pioneer woman who's hot ooh I got pioneer type woman who's actually hot who can like do chores and shit hey yeah I'm gonna mean like she's surviving like you're out there both of your clone and scratching yeah hot as fuck Oh hot as fuck but yet a Pioneer Woman something sexy it's fuck about that right it's a good one yeah that's a good one and they had those big fluffy things they were on their legs under the dresses yeah like fucking robbers are trying to take over the wagons just shooting at them yeah like that girl ha that's right that girl from Westboro hot as fuck yeah I'm so hot there she is god damn dude that's the perfect world that's the perfect woman really really hot badass western chick what does that woman's name again she's really good too I don't think that she'd whatever her name is as an actress what's her name as an actress gender would she like a an L a comedian though um what's that would she like in LA comedian I want some only a bald one who makes bread Evan Rachel Wood she's hot she's not just hot she's a really good actor yeah really good like you believe she's a struggling robot trying to figure out if she's real or not and trying to figure out what these memories that she has are but she's also hot as the Sun is baby she's beautiful she's a very specific kind of beautiful right like an uncorrupted beauty right yeah like a ho right she's not out there with likes yeah yes ass sticking out like washing a car she's hot he's dignity yeah well she's a robot she's a robot but don't show that one that's not a good picture relationships were that close to people yeah like if you could actually make love to a robot then that Westworld concept the freakiest part of that is is that they fuck these things and kill these things right enough of these things become sentient they realize it they try to escape the parks bar do they feel like they've got skin like an ocean you can't distinguish they don't even know sometimes if they're robots how about that that's how good it is that's pretty great I think that I'd have sex with a robot fuck yeah you would yeah you'd probably have sex with a balloon I was gonna say there's not much I wouldn't it's just a matter of like what if someone said and you don't have sex with this thing your whole family dies you'd have sex with it when someone says oh I would never fuck a pineapple yes you would your life depended on it someone had a gun your fucking head so yeah you fucked that pineapple or I'm gonna kill your dog fine you'll fuck the pineapple you have to just reach a breaking point please yeah I'd do it again so have you been have you pay attention is Jeffrey Epstein stuff yeah a little bit way things going on I think I think he yeah I guess I think the too many very powerful people he had stuff on too many very powerful people likely right probably yeah yeah they took the guy off suicide watch even though he's one of the most important witnesses yeah weird a really creepy high-profile case that might have connected a bunch of really powerful people yeah this I don't I'm guy I don't I don't necessarily believe that it's you know the people from like its Trump or its the Democrat I think there's other very powerful people that would have wanted this guy to go oh for sure you know had no idea how many very powerful people want to go away he could sing right he could sing for his freedom my question is is there it didn't they give it like a whole bunch of evidence and stuff from him that like these power people would have oh yeah yeah whereas all that stuff yeah yeah you said you didn't know that he had a cellmate cellmate well what former cop Jeffrey Epstein reported wasn't checked on for hours before his apparent suicide that that guy found him they're like how do we think that that guy didn't kill him they left a rope in there that guy could definitely kill without leaving that guy looks like he knew some damp look at the guy's arms that guy could just wrap Jeffrey Epstein up in a bear hug and hanging himself maybe he just choked him yeah I mean he could put that noose around Epstein's neck and then squeeze his arms together and just pull on it until the guy hangs to death I think oh my god her phone rang how did Jack huge imagine you go to jail on a high-profile case and they throw you in there with a giant bald guy that's like grossberger picture him stir-crazy but look at this this is like caricature of the guy you don't want exactly yeah in the bad movie that's the guy you waiting for you in the cell yeah he looks like his his name would he go to jail for tart yeah look at his name right Westchester County charge to lose stark taglio the deaths of four men stemming from a alleged cocaine drug conspiracy and bro he's that big and he's 51 how many cops are smuggling steroids in their asshole to get to this guy he how is he staying that baby so how he hung himself so good so they had like a belt or a rope left in there with him this guy probably said listen if you keep getting me the juice I'll keep this fucking guy on ice all right they didn't they said this is the one conspiracy is the one conspiracy where nobody believes the true story that I've talked to no no except Michael Shermer who Michael Shermer the guy who runs skeptics magazines friend of Mines nice guy uh-huh I couldn't just agree with him more he thinks that things just happen and people kill themselves oh he that's his take this guy's and he likes a lot of conspiracies no no silences conspiracies no conspiracy he likes oh-oh doesn't like any conspiracy okay and this one is almost predictable he's right and he's still like now he's right away and I think his concept is pull up his tweets so everybody say I mean you're not in a good place you can see wanting to kill yourself oh yeah for sure you know make that a larger place I don't know where that key started but just be just make it larger it just seems just like no scroll scroll down a little bit there okay a new conspiracy theory developed by MEMS team regarding suicide they made it happen on purpose first letter here it is here it is scroll down it's some no-name pedophile die by suicide in prison awaiting trial anyone would anyone bother concocting conspiracy theories about him being married murdered by clandestine outside forces of course not as with JFK Diana Maryland at all Fame warps perspective and fuels unwarranted speculation first of all mmm-hmm this is not unwarranted second well if you don't think that powerful people have people killed you're hilarious like that is carefully naive yeah they do do it says remember the adage regarding conspiracy theories never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence or chance true surely you shouldn't do that it is possible but what what are the odds there's something this this is our game stinks so bad because he's in so many circles and touched so many super-powerful people it's different for powerful people it's he's not just a pedophile like he's saying gave him a seventy million dollar house in New York City gave him one of his clients gave him he signed he was the power of attorney at the time so he signed over to himself the guy let him do that that's the question is whether or not he wouldn't new us happening oh come on like you just stole the house from the guy who's in control of a lot of stuff that's worth a million Wow so that's what's coming out but how would the guy who he signed it off on how would the guy not know this guy stole his house and not sue him he was in control of all of his finances right but the guy was he was living in the house who the guy wexner know I've seen Abbate he bought the house for him basically that's what I'm saying Blair the guy bought it for Epstein right right yeah but he who fucking buys you a seventy million dollar hey I don't know no one's bought me nuttin there's there's so many questions yeah ask guys about where his wealth was and then the the color of his house didn't he own didn't eat the eyeballs on the entrance and set the shit about the house is crazy well there's like oh yeah MERS inside the house and shit but the other thing was the houses on the island that is the same color it's painted in the same way these Rayleigh flag is uh-huh and this there was an idea people are wondering like how far this guy's influence goes and where it comes from and look at this house bro that was his house as his house on this fucking Island the island was like a building there it's a tent we hear that on his Island brother that's a dope temple by the way everything looks awesome geez I love that house my house come on in how'd he get so much money exactly no one really knows didn't have something to do with Victoria's Secret yeah he um he managed some military secrets god yeah correct the guy who gave him the house oh yeah you know Bill Clinton flew on his private jet no less than 26 times Wow whatever no big deal he was hung out of Mara Lago yeah but I mean I flew with him 26 times I've never flown with it would it be have to be my very best friends at I tour with all the time have I flown with you 26 times maybe four or five I mean I really ever and maybe if we flew together it might be a little more than four or five it might be 10 and be tended mean I've known you for years yeah has not been 26 times so Bill Clinton flood with his one guy why he's the president United States I think was he still president then and it was afterwards Jerry probably 20 times I'm making money I like fly which every enough to pay I mean that's a lot of times be partying with the dude you would think that you would find out about how that guy fucks who said that when he inside on the plane was sort of when he fucked up because he was that's when he stopped flying under the radar who did Jeffrey Doohan that went that day and he's been like hiding ever since wasn't that was like two thousand three or four oh really when he got busted was shortly after that and he's been on the run since then do it wasn't wasn't Trump talking about it with Howard Howard Stern what was he talking about about that he like some LEDs yeah like why were they talking about him I don't know because he was uh guess he was arrested or something no he's just in the news the arrest was later and that was part of the problem was that with the arrest the arrest was for some sexual thing with underage girls and he got a really light sentence right he was like so we're freaking out about then one woman pursued this pretty heavily she was a journalist and she pursues pursue this story right yeah I find out the Miami Herald but yeah that book I was telling you I just read about James Patterson he said everything that kind of came out in that story they already wrote about about 2016 and for some reason the media didn't really pick up on it he said he wrote letters to everyone well yeah that was when that was when this guy got that really light sentence was around there but this one woman kept writing about it and this is one of the things pull up the name of this woman that because this one woman really dogged lee pursued this story and i was because of her and i think a lot of it had to do with her recognition that this guy had gotten his creepy lights on yeah not to be confused with downtown Julie brown Julie Cable she was great like Michael B Jordan not not the world's greatest melon what's her name is even close to this story hello James Brown the fucking sportscaster well that guy nice guy James Brown sportscaster yeah how the fuck do you call yourself James Brown like he owns that right Michael Jackson if you're Michael Jackson your singer yeah you're who oh great right yeah don't you have anyone in your camp telling you this is a bad idea isn't there two of those cuts like a knife guys what's that guy's name the guy from Canada Ryan Ryan again Ryan's your fucking name right you've got trouble - how about Ricky Adams be Ricky Adams Ricky Adams what ever happened to Brian Adams man that cuts like a knife yeah like a knife like that was awesome summer of 69 yeah he had some great jams I think he's still playing casinos I really they shall go to see him we should make a road trip eighth-best yeah I'm sure it's a good show we really have to start doing stuff like that yeah road trips just go to see ridiculous shows ya out there journeys out there to journey with the japonais yeah that's what that guy she's a badass Steve Perry ever did in his prime I know some amazing Steve Perry still out there I don't think he's performing but he's still around what are you playing Brian abs giant crowd Wow look at that yeah that was a star postmenopausal chicks at the summer of 69 what does he look like these days I stretch in here let me see he's working about that he's ribs fit it stretch that back he says Brian abs him yeah it's a weird black-and-white photos yeah get some snapchat filter on him too he's obviously spiritually sound it looks health working out well listen man that guy was a he was a rock star when I was in high school that's right and if he looks that good today that's incredible taking care of himself must be yeah he's doing something right he's not running around after teenage girl's hands living a good life floozies flying over Bill Clinton so obvious later absolutely what we doing today yeah it's yeah for conspiracy theorists right now like for Sam Tripoli no Sam sharply yeah tinfoil hat podcast he's he's taking it to another level he thinks he's not really dead that they faked his death ah of course she's Louise for conspirators when a conspiracy theory is obvious they look for the non-obvious possum because they do the exact opposite of what Michael Sherman was talking about here is he theorists never tribute to Mouse everything right everything is malice if it looks obvious is something it's so creepy God well got good who cares how what it's good he's gone maybe not man maybe no he's gone maybe not maybe if he stayed alive he could have told us some stuff about some terrible people that are still alive doing things yeah he's the worst one I don't know about that he's a creeper how do we know that we know he's a creep most likely well we definitely don't know if he's the worst out of all those people that he was creeping with yeah the thing is if the guy really did film a bunch of people that are super powerful people doing crazy shit yeah there's got to be some stuff right um if I was leading the investigation I'd go after the hard drive son ton that's where they keep it all the hard drive they did find hard drives filled with stuff that he had they did yeah that he had with very young girls and suggestive poses and no there was pornography but they were talking about how many different photos of young ladies around on his computer all right enough with this guy but I don't know if they were young like you legal or young like 18 you know there's something weird about when you watch some porn where they're pretend to be schoolgirls mmm-hmm you know yeah you know the girls 30 but she's pretending to put them in an outfit yeah that's though there's something weird about those porns like what is happening no exactly one guy's a milkman the other guy you know just comes over what must you bring up my fetish milkman porn he knocks on the door girl answers she's got pigtails yeah my dad's on home right now umm I guess I guess you can come inside no you know how about watching the baseball game you know another thing that's weird about porn there's a lot of step sister stepmother porn stepmother stepmother and stepsister dude with his stepmother yeah we're dude with his stepsister exactly like dad married some new floozy dad's off at work and the Sun Suns like 19 he wakes up and he's got a boner next thing you know his stepmom sucking his dick now those are fun well there's that you know that's human sexuality there's you know everybody has something they're into so I guess they make a movie for all of it yes but also they're always looking for a new forbidden thing so it's right there porn is not forbidden enough it's not just two people that are hot that are getting it on right no no no it's got to be something that shouldn't be doing oh my god shouldn't be doing this right that's a thrill for a lot of people right they feel sexually suppressed so when they watch porn like oh my god - stepmom she gonna do it you got to take a picture of her so it's gone right so it's like forbidden yeah yeah yeah yeah like you at the west-world thing yeah yeah I mean that's the thing with people right they like especially when people get told what to do too much when they're young and then they develop this desire to do forbidden things right right yeah I mean yeah but it's all porn thing the envelope thing - right you get bored people if people like outrageous things and those outrageous things are not outrageous enough anymore then they get more outrageous somehow or another right if that's right that's why you shouldn't go down the path right you should start that's why you're healthier working out like crazy or being obsessed with cars or being obsessed with sports it's like it's you want to get more and more extreme with it what you're dealing with tires you're not with human beings that are being trafficked through Florida with the idea that they might have some fame you know and I mean you gotta be Florida that's where it all happens right really all bad things where was that Epstein guy Florida yeah Maura Lago Florida here receiver Sheeta Jones his documentary on porn no it's pretty devastating who's rashida Jones okay she was Quincy Jones daughter she was on the very funny talented she was in Parks and Rec in the office and the office and she made a documentary on just like all these young girls that especially now with social media and wanting to be liked and wanting to having all these promises of Fame and that what you think is amateur porn and is harmless there's really a very high percentage of these people are being exploited mmm-hmm and I yeah it'll make it look at porn very differently I'm sure I recommend it but is there any kind of acceptable porn yeah like what if it's like 35 year old ladies that are just freaks or not good freaks just fuck on camera they get they get a thrill out of people watching them fuck it's impossible I don't know if it's possible what's that question right yeah yeah question is you always worry if but do you what happened to them right put them in that mind space cuz we don't have a fear about men look are you worried about men who are 35 years old who are having sex with women on camera do those trouble you know I mean I don't think about them and I'm not concerned about them right so we're concerned about the women is that right wait for it because we're sexist are we are we putting standards on the females that we don't put on the males because we don't think that women can handle it or that you don't we don't think they can make that choice we don't think that they should be allowed to make that choice or if they do make that choice we think there has to be something wrong with them and they need to be protected or as we don't have those feelings about a man I just know that so I I think that when you're thinking about what leads you to that place there's a high probability that some man did something awful to that girl while she was young and we don't have that such a high percentage of people that have had all women have had to deal with some Creepo at some point in their life for sure and so I think it's built on that it's like well mmm you know I'd rather help her in some other way than watch these porn so is that something we inherently know and how do we know that yeah yeah because men are big and aggressive and can do no no that's not what I'm saying when you see someone that's in porn do we inherently know that they've been molested do we just know or do I mean we don't don't but I think but have we investigated that like there is a high percentage of women that do porn this is a fact that have been sexually molested what I'm saying is your distaste for it is it based on the knowledge of that or is this an inherent perception that a woman who would do that must be damaged so something must be have must have had happened to her when she was younger that was awful otherwise she wouldn't be doing this well it's like going to a strip club and you know probably 80% of the guys are just seeing somebody dancing and 20% of the guys are thinking wait you shouldn't be doing this mmm you know what I mean I don't think 20% at strip clubs I don't know maybe higher I just feel like you know what it's like we I think we're able to I'm sorry to cut you off I think we're I think human beings are able to not see everything that they want to see because they're enjoying what's before them I think you're right for sure we definitely make rationalizations right but I'm wondering like why if it's a man we don't have any I guess it's because we don't think of a man of being you know if a guy is an object of sexual desire for women we don't think of him as a victim ever I know which is unfortunate because there are a lot of things happen to young boys you know well did you hear about this guy that sue and Katy Perry you about the song no no she says he maybe she he's not suing her but he's accusing her of sexual assault what he's calling sexual assault she pulled down in sweat pants and exposed his dick to some people Yeah right right and then the knee-jerk reaction is well your dude you would love Katy Perry pulling your pants off that's right and but maybe he was really hurt he's a grow up heir I love kitty purry yeah the fuck's the problem she pulls your pants down yeah yeah even when I was a young boy it wasn't like I was a it sounds to me like Katy Perry's trying to fuck you leave Katy Perry is that we think she was doing now sounds like she pantsed him mmm for fun yeah it's what sounds like Lucy sweatpants now if that was a guy doing it to a girl I would say that is sexual assault yeah think of it very differently I would too if a guy was there and a girl bent over in front of a bunch of guys to pick up her keys and someone pantsed her and her vagina was exposed to all these strangers I would say that guy's a piece of shit mm-hmm like imagine if that was your daughter or your wife right so some guy pulls your wife's fucking sweat pant in front of a crew of people because I think we see the men as a threat as a physical threat right but if Katy Perry does it to a guy I'm like huh yeah I know yeah and you guys the judge I get the fuck out without explaining it or coming up for reasons why that is the knee-jerk reaction a woman got arrested in New Jersey she blew a 14 year-old boy they gave her a 10-year I got suspended sentence ten years on 10 year probation no jail time and she keeps her teaching certificate really she was okay stop blowing kids you crazy yeah she probably blew the cop blew the judge oh god that's my thought on that always is if a woman's willing to blow a 14 year old she'll blow you to that girl's fucking crazy she just loves sucking dick oh my god you could talk her into it it's all she's got standards I mean I think every cop that arrests of 40 a lady blows 14 year olds every cop thinks she'll suck his dick too right don't you think they're crazy Oh easy woman yeah well you don't think so do I think she's crazy yes for sure but it's not it I think every crazy doesn't scare me now there's something you know look we all there's a lot of different ways to be damaged right and that's her damage but what I'm saying is like that's not hurt and what is she doing she's a grown adult see how even you're looking at that there's a lot of different ways to be damaged but if that was a grown man having sex with a 14 year old girl you wouldn't worry about what fucking damage he has you'd be worrying about what damage he's doing see even in that situation you're worried about her being damaged I'm not worried about her but you know but that's what you said right right you're you're what you were thinking about was her being damaged right not her victimizing the boy right cuz we don't think of it that way no I know I know like right I mean when these these stories started coming out when we were younger I know but it and it was I always like you know with your buddies it was like oh I wish my Spanish teacher did that hey you know there's been freaks throughout history yeah crazy women that blow boys from as long as time Memorial yeah there was word time Memorial you know time when time In Memoriam memoriam yeah sexuality is such a weird bizarre thing that's why they have to make all these laws about it mm-hmm you know to keep some again back to the guidebook mmm right I was reading about a country I think fuck there was one is it is a Kashmir Google this mm-hmm that 20% of all marriages start with kidnapping yes 20 percent of marriages in this country in that there is a country where 20% of all marriages start in today kidnap today and that's not not in the 1200s not during the Genghis Khan administration is it like prom it's like no they just kidnap women and then they're forced to marry their kidnappers so they don't get shamed Oh ma'am Google 20% of all marriages begin with kidnapping just Google that that that's not the weirdest thing that's ever been googled that's a fucking crazy statistic if I remember correctly our karma is crazy I think I wrote it down somewhere I'll pull out my laptop find it headline one in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage and Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan here's what I think was catch one in five where is Kashmir Kashmir Pakistan inside the Led Zeppelin song is it so it's only Kyrgyzstan yeah that spot but see bride napping also occurs in places like Armenia Ethiopia Kazakh stay in South Africa and particularly common rural parts of Central Asian country kidnapping just grabbing people while they're sleeping people making them marry you she's they're still doing that in 2019 but just stop and think about one out of five and that's with them trying to keep it on the down-low so what was it a hundred years ago percent nobody ever got married yes raped there's a thing called groom nap kidnapping that also happens where the eligible bachelors are abducted by a bride's family and forced to marry oh my god people living like movie characters so weird this is happening today yeah we are so fortunate god yeah here well not just like there's some people in the Western world what what do you say two thousand nine in this place has been via Bihar bi H AR twelve hundred and twenty four kidnappings for marriage were reported in one year twelve hundred kidnappings from marriage can people live there 1259 getting kidnapped you know we say we don't that's horrible dude imagine that that is fucking horrible men are damaged in that part of the world you know I mean they have a long tradition of doing creepy shit with women that is one of the weird things about history the further you go back in history the worst women are treated right you know universally you know we say that again the further you go back in history the worst women the worst worst women worse women are treated ride worse the further you go back in history yeah yeah I mean of course what's the original image that we always got of cavemen and cavewomen right over the head draggin her hair right exactly how do we know that archetype yeah why do we know that archetype that's a weird one yeah he in the head and dragging her by her hair wait where are we getting that from right just taking cuz it's how I went down why do you and I know that same image you watch the same cartoons Oh what it was yeah mine's a cartoon image of it right but why did that cartoon image it buy that become so prevalent that we both like where'd you grow up New Jersey I lived there too so maybe we both got it from the same part yeah we both watch zoom San Francisco but yeah the thing you thought of when you thought of caveman you thought of the man clubbing the lady over the head and dragging her by her hair yeah crazy men have a long way to go sure a long way to go the hang-ups that men have over women that turn into violence is it still at this late date in our human development is still batshit crazy wait there is such a violent they don't understand how to even like be around women they don't understand when they're rejected by women and it always culminates still in such a violent nature it's bizarre wasn't that what happened to the guy who owned the stand I don't know what happened I know what I didn't hear Stan yeah what it's been explained to me that the ex ex-husband right of his old pair of the brain to kill her and he was there and wound up killing him too so he was just coming to find out that's true I don't know what the whole story was but apparently I didn't know him well but apparently was super awful like I know he was a nice guy I met him a couple times terrible Maplewood New Jersey it's a you know a man but man again men I'm not crazy if that is the case if that's the story a man trying to kill his ex-wife or killing his ex-wife it's just like man talk about lack of guidebook nobody teaches young men frustrated men that's the story so I was correct I was accurate that's um says dad of to kill Zach artist and owner David Kimmel it's 40 year old married dad of 2 and the family's Columbian all pair Karen Bermudez Rodriguez 26 yeah Wow so there was nothing going on between the nanny and him mmm men man stabbed an au pair in her boss horrible yeah hey man nobody teaches these men like how to how to be a man I've had of her those appetites and deal with it and put your violence towards something else you know it's it's still a big hole this is also they were saying Colombian she was Colombian yeah I don't know if she's from Colombian if he was from Colombia too I mean look there's every culture all around the world but extreme violence and a lot of parts of South America in certain places you know yeah a lot here I mean it's everywhere anywhere there's dudes they get frustrated in the yeah but more so more so in in a lot of places in South America mm-hmm you know in some areas that are like you know I had this guy on who's an expert in Mexico he worked in the IDI kaldur'ahm he worked dealing with cartels uh-huh and for the Mexican government and you know the stories this guy tell you about the violence that's happening in Mexico right fucking terrifying really and how many kids grow up like sort of enamored with this cartel life get drawn into it sucked into it and just wanted to these people wind up taking people to kill people and showing them how to cut people up and getting them accustomed to doing it oh my god yeah and that they seemed so normal when you meet them and then you realize that they're literally training kids to murder people and chop them up like what yeah yeah dark out there so if you fucked that guy's Opare or rather if you live with that guys or if she just decided to leave him yeah I mean I don't think he was I don't think anybody's saying that he was having an affair but if the guy thought he was because the guy was you know if you're a man your ex-wife is living in a house there's a man in the house you assume like you're a piece of shit you assume that they're having an affair even if they aren't Yeah right and you would just if you were trying to kill her you'd probably try to kill him too or maybe he was trying to kill her and the other guy just happened to be there and he killed him either way that guy went to the house with the idea I'm gonna kill my point was like if you could if you have a dangerous person like that and that manger aspersion is trying to go and get his ex-wife and kill her and you have to be you happen to get caught in the crosshairs with a knife right yeah that's terrible awful harm so terrible horrible be careful out there kids being kind to each other I know but nice that's the other thing about the way the world really works yeah I have to recognize there are really people like that out there time that's a real thing yes yes yes yeah it is a you have to be aware you can't be naive that there's that this stuff doesn't exist you can't pretend that it's not around now yeah but how do you how do you defend against something like that right if you don't know how to fight mm-hmm and even if you do if you do the knife yeah your back is turned yeah you know yeah who knows right a lot of it's left to chance fuck it such a horrible way to leave this world someone's stabbing draining out just I mean normal someone's trying to get back at his ex-wife stabbing you yeah you're sitting there in your nice little house you're running a comedy club just having a nice time people laughing you're managing some other comedians you you're making your way you've got that your wife and your kids you're providing for them and then just you have no idea that morning when you wake up and making coffee what's headed your way mmm horrible if you had someone close to you get murder before no not close to me close to me was Phil Hartman his wife shot and then shot herself right it's terrible yeah do you think there's ever gonna be a time there's no violence nobody we evolved past this to some new thing I don't know if we evolved because there's so many people I think it would have evolved not to that I don't it would take eons we're still like you think so many yeah there's so many parts of the globe are still you know way behind I think it would have to be like put in the water or something like we'd have to medicate it out of us that's a real interesting perspective right because amongst us amongst the people that we know what are the odds that we could get through this life with no violence let me say if we all all the people that we knew we all lived together I could I would bet a lot of money nobody would murder anybody mm-hmm so what happens when you get from that to large groups of people and then you get to large groups of people like you're talking about Kyrgyzstan or one out of all right women gets fucking kidnap yeah that's how marriages get started yeah they're Wilding out there to live and crazy yeah or karate karate but what is that one city that in there's one city in Pakistan is it Karachi what is that city why can't I remember the name that uh is that it so that was one of the cities that Shane Smith from vice was saying was one of the most terrifying places on earth oh yeah because the the the sheer cheapness of murder no cheap it is get someone murdered oh really how much murder and crime goes on over there look God just a totally different metric yeah for how you view the world totally different perception of what life is worth and what life is like yeah and what kind of violence you have to deal with on a daily was gone I know there's a lot of very dark places that's why I don't like to travel you don't like to travel at all I do like to travel but I don't I'm starting to cross off a bunch of places yeah you know between getting parasites that make you have to poop in a bag and send to your doctor or ending up in like real violent places that don't you know have the same kind of rules that we do it's you know my friend Justin Wren who runs fight for the Forgotten charity I was just wearing his shirt at the beaches Oh were you yeah an awesome best guy ever yeah he has a new no parasite that's draining him he doesn't know what no yeah yeah he's got something that he caught when he was over there no that's what I'm afraid of he's really sick is he really yeah he's really it's gonna be okay I don't know they're gonna have to hopefully identify it yeah they'd have to figure out what it is figure out how he got it figure out what's going on that's no joke what happened in the dominican republic didn't they people died because they were drinking from the minibar to hear that story yes yes sketch yeah they were saying that people were putting stuff in the minibar that wasn't actually alcohol yeah the story that I had heard was that they would put cheap substitutes for whatever the alcohol was supposed to be so that people would pay for it and then you know they would steal the actual liquor place it with something else and then people would drink in it was like poisonous and they were dying yeah people really died yeah yeah that's terrible I hope you don't know what the actual story was but somebody else described it saying like one thing is you concentrate on statistics and I don't know if this is true mm-hmm we should find out but that if you concentrate on statistics and it seems like a lot of people die in the Dominican Republic when they were over there but the reality is that it's just the way we're looking at it because we've chosen to start focusing on people who died over there but in fact it's like commensurate with people that died over here when they're on vacation right but that is wheatley only a certain number go to that resort you know I didn't mean any one resort of believe it was yeah I think so well a lot of people go to the Dominican room now but a lot of people work I was there last year what are you yeah so would you go back after all this no first of all I saw a story about a couple that went there and got hookworm and their feet oh you can from the beach that I was already I like maybe I'm not going back and now that you can't even drink from the minibar I'm like you know what there's a nice place isn't Laguna Beach yeah that's what I'm talking about Laguna did you know that hookworm is response is mow beach hookworms responsible for the stereotype of the southern dummy no yeah what do you mean people walking around the south barefoot we're getting hookworm and mass and hookworm has a detrimental effect your ability to think oh really compromises your mental ability it makes you dumber so like the trope of like a hillbilly was exactly yup yeah weird up yep we find out about that from Peter Hotez is that who told us that and a beard how a worm gave the South a bad name oh my god hookworms once sap the American South of its health and if you realize that they continue to afflict millions gee you look so creepy it fucks with the way you think makes you tired fatigued yeah exhaustion listen weeks later victims to come to an insatiable exhaustion and impenetrable haziness of the mind that some called stupidity adults neglected their fields and children grew pale and listless victims develop grossly distended bellies and angel wings emaciated shoulder blades accentuated by hunching all gazed out dully from sunken sockets with a telltale fisheye stare that is the stereotype of people from the south we just always thought they're just living in hot weather and they're just stupid yeah it really was was worm was fucking hookworm oh and then amazing this podcast started off we were having about we were talking about though the culprit behind the germ of laziness as the South's affliction was sometimes called was neck cat or americanus the American murderer better known as the hookworm it's called the American murder are they still out there millions of those blood sucking parasites live fed yeah for sure and died within the guts of up to 40 percent of the population stretching from southeastern Texas to West Virginia can you imagine 40 percent of the population of the south in these places from Texas to West Virginia was infected 40 percent of the population with a fucking worm that makes you dumb I'm never going anywhere ever again I'm incredible that's this that's insane but that's what the stereotype came from Wow how wild fucking crazy that's insane you know how many people are getting right now getting Lyme disease and Lyme disease all that doesn't make you lazy its wrecks your health for years Yeah right years happening right now in the East Coast it's all it's all over these because my kids we're back there working on a farm over the over the summer and my daughter had a tick on her we freaked out mmm should freak out yeah you got to get it off is okay for 24 hours yeah and you know but you also if you do get infected you have to get on antibiotics really quickly super fast there's a woman who wrote a book about Lyme disease possibly being a military biological weapon that accidentally was released really yeah apparently this is a popular thought that there's something about Lyme disease that Lyme disease doesn't necessarily make sense how quickly came from this one area like this Lyme Connecticut area and how rapidly it spread and how devastating its impact was and there is apparently there's has been some research that's been not some quite a bit of research that's done on various biological weapons and various distribution methods and one of the thoughts of a lot of these distribution methods is infecting bugs and infecting bugs with some designer disease and then infecting the population like if you release the bugs on this area that you wanted to attack like at a certain point in time and you infected giants chunks of the population right then you would be able to go back there ten years later and everybody'd be fucked Wow yeah but this this is something that biological diseases whether it's anthrax like things along those lines yeah terrifying but they've made those yeah forever you know they've had that and people been aware of that forever yeah but the idea of it being something that's in a bug and that can infect geez Louise that's terrifying yeah are you trying to make are you trying to make that I don't go out of my house traffic jam now it's weird that it's I mean the I don't remember being around when we was around Coast it was not around and I think it took a while for anybody to figure out what the fuck it was how about the new mosquitos that we have yes well there's also I never had these mosquitos before there's a recent case of a horrible disease breaking out in the East Coast I think somewhere in Massachusetts there's some horrible mosquito-borne disease what is that what is that a thing say about the ticks about Lyme disease what is the book it's called bitten yes that's a bitten Chris newbie K with kr I asked Chris is that a man or a woman it's a woman yeah she discovered circumstantial evidence linking the outbreak of Lyme disease in the 1962 u.s. military some people say this is bullshit but some people say it's just conspiracy theory who's some people put up the article so we could see it give me a see it spread it out so I can see it scroll down okay the deal go back up stop the DoD takes extreme care evolved its research programs to ensure the protection of our personnel and the community what is that when Smith announced his amendment okay this is was too much there so there's just too much evidence for a reasonable man or woman to just turn the page and say put on your tinfoil hat this is just a conspiracy theory Smith said and yet people with credentials will say that which begs the question why would they even say that Chris Newby wrote the book Benton said she discovered circumstantial evidence linking the outbreak of Lyme disease the 1960s that's what you said from the US military as proof newbee cites an interview that she had stopped right there with will Bergdahl fir the American scientists who discovered what causes Lyme disease who told her shortly before his death that he had been instructed to keep his research any possible cause for Lyme disease a secret my hypothesis was is that the biological weapon they were trying to cover up that oh my hypothesis is that was the biological weapon they were trying to cover up said new be a science writer at the Stanford School of Medicine in California I don't believe it hmm seems like a lot of malarkey she said I can't connect the dots right now says who survived Lyme disease my theory is that it was a genetically engineered Rickettsia bacteria but as a journalist I can't prove that so what is she saying then she's just pulling stuff out she wrote a book yeah ain't buying it but that's not to say that does worry me more than anything I think she's a hoser I don't know where personally but if you had yes probably but I think that your bread yeah I would never give her my brain that scares me more than anything though she's laid a plague of some sort I always feel like we should be keeping some medicine in the house plague medicine yeah like what kind I don't know tetracycline Doug good for plague what the hell could be good for play depends what the plague is really if it's a flu there's certain things you can take if it's knives crazy war bugs probably nothing but there's so many people and it's so gross and you can see how people just coughing in the airports without covering their mouths that's gonna happen there's a story I was reading this morning Jamie about mosquito-borne illness in Massachusetts some knew some like Legionnaires disease type oh jeez we have these nasty mosquitoes here in Los Angeles we're supposed to have these mosquitoes around your neighborhood yeah I've never near my house I know sometimes neighbors don't take care of their pool I know that's bad it is bad they were saying I read an article about it they said even like a crumpled-up chip bag yeah that gets water from a sprinkler that's enough crazy and there are these black and white little guys and they just seem fume and they go from your knee down they're nasty we never had screens before in my house when I first moved to LA I rented a house that someone had a pool in the backyard that they didn't take care of really like really bad and when I got there the pool was green the water was green and there was things swimming in it I was like what the fuck is that it was mosquito larvae oh my god yeah yeah see so I had a contact well here it is Massachusetts confirmed human case of mosquito-borne virus first human case since 2013 of EEE what is that see scroll I scroll down so he does equine encephalitis that's horse that's horse stuff the first human case since 2013 at least nine towns are a critical risk of exposure to a rare but potentially fatal virus that can cause brain swelling how come on according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health fuck dude I remember when I was a kid yeah me and this check made out in the woods mm-hmm and you know what I've taken our pants off and stuff yeah and I got fucking lit up by mosquitos so bad we had a stop fooling around like this is crazy I mean I had welts all over my leg that was crazy I was like Jesus is what happens if you try to fool around the woods you've got something me that's terrible cold areas the mosquitoes are way more aggressive the ass I know the whole East Coast Maine forget it Oh Maine is lost Canada's worse rudl I've never seen mosquitoes like Alaska though Alaska mosquitoes are fucking bonkers are they big they're huge and they're super aggressive they don't have any time they come in they move in quick they just swarm oh yeah this is what happens this is why I'm so aggravated in LA we were we didn't have this did not exist until a year ago I think it's your neighbor you got a neighbor with them you don't have them by your house oh really I saw a bobcat fight with a rattlesnake though see that I could have my buddy sent me a video would you in the middle of the street yeah with the rattlesnake it's on Twitter Oh was it on Twitter who put it on Twitter got it from his neighbor who saw it happen oh wow yeah pulled the one up the maybe a mob is

Coyotes you're eating cats yeah they'll just take whatever they can get I know everyone's hungry it's hot you gotta get through this month but the thing about coyotes and cats and I think we can relay
