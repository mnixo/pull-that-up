the girag and experience I don't know I think Obama is about to give a speech today about this nonsense yeah even CNN the front of it is like Obama's challenge convincing you on Syria it's a zero percent of the public thinks we should do it I haven't said one person argue that we should attack Syria literally my mom even said I did she didn't want to go to war and she was always backing up all the other words I think people are just learning it's just we've been horse fucked for so many years now we've been horse fuck since 2001 I mean that's really hard to believe it's really hard to believe that it's been twelve years of horse fucking the whole world's been horse fucked and at this point time especially with this second term of this supposedly liberal and ordering drone strikes like crazy threatening military action for this one ambiguous struck I mean I don't know who the fuck caused that strike but I know Ron Paul says that it was a false flag his ron paul right what the fuck do i know but if somebody wanted us to go to syria for some other reason and they decided to orchestrate an attack that would force the united states hand into going into syria shit dude that's possible if you don't pay attention to history you might think it's not possible but if you do pay attention to history it's it's happened it happened with the gulf of tonkin it and then that was even baker it was even faker than this well look from the POV of some some revolutionary fundamentalist islamic a person who's planning these attacks we know that a lot of people uh people who are fundamentalist islamic well what we call terrorists they don't have a problem putting dynamite in their body and blowing themselves up so it's not beyond the pale to think that in the scheme of things once they realize if they do a sarin attack it could possibly cause the United States to attack and unleash hell on Assad well yeah that's a logical decision to make and why would Assad knowing that if he did a chemical attack it could cause all the gains he's made in his shitty goddamn civil war to go away why would he do that doesn't make any sense exactly see I don't he seems I think he's a vicious piece of shit from what I've read but he doesn't seem stupid and apparently he was already kind of winning that war as or making great advances you know so I don't know why suddenly he's like yeah release the gas the gas that will make it so that we get in a super power to stop bomb start bombing us and who was he fighting against isn't he fighting against the Taliban uh well I Timothy fighting against al-qaeda it's not just al-qaeda it's a mixture from what I saw there was this I can't remember it was on it wasn't on scene and it was on one of these weird news channels was just a conference with analysts talking about what Syria what the revolution or the civil war is comprised of and it's not all al Qaeda and it's not all Taliban and it's not all it's different it's different groups just in the same way if there was a revolution in the United States it wouldn't just be one group it wouldn't just be the Tea Party right it would be anarchists it would be I you occupy wall streeters it would be environmentalist it would be fundamentalist Christians that that's what a civil war really is is just this shattering of people into groups with one initial main goal which is get Assad out of power and then the next that's where a revolution can really sucker a civil war can really suck because then the thing collapses on itself and they all start attacking each other did you see that John Kerry used a fake photo to fuel a Syrian war I heard a mr. photo of the bodies yeah this is this is the photo it's a photo from 2003 from the Iraq war of a little boy jumping over these lines of bodies and he used that in a speech I try to beat the war drums how the fuck did he know or how could he not know rather that that's a bad photo to use yeah no shit man of course he knew right how about McCain playing fucking video poker yeah when they were talking about Boggs these are fucking thugs man there's they're talking about evaporating human beings and the guy's so comfortable he's fucking playing video poker the only thing he thinks we should go doesn't mean he's yeah he loves war McCain's a big way he's a big fan of war I think he's supporting it right he supported like seven wars Oh oh hell yeah here he comes this is the live look at him he has to walk a red carpet how dramatic my fellow American president tonight I want to talk to you about Syria boy why it matters and where we go from here over the past two years what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-assad has turned into a brutal civil war over a hundred thousand people had been killed millions have fled the country in that time America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support to help the moderate opposition and to shape a political settlement but I have resisted calls for military action because we cannot resolve someone else's Civil War through force particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan the situation profoundly changed though on August 21st when Assad's government gassed to death over a thousand people including hundreds of children the images from this Massacre are sickening men women children lying in rows killed by poison gas others foaming at the mouth gasping for breath a father clutching his head challan imploring them to get up it's better to set them on fire like I table my fish the Wolves saw in gruesome detail the termite nature of chemical work is how crazy why the same I'm giving these images a father clutching his children like what do you do are you what are you an actor like what's with the dramatic narrative a father clutching his children okay babies could be your baby dead the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe in World War two the Nazis use gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust we must use fire not gas fire whose weapons can kill a man scare what the distinction between children and mass chil no distinction between soldier and offense since like drones don't mean like drones what about Hiroshi 1997 what about the 98% civilian rate your drones have killed international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons we set him on fire emanating on government's channel isn't is there any international agreement that we shouldn't use drones because I would think that that would be a bad thing needs to these basic rules were violated oh man along with our sense of common humanity of murder yeah no one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria the world saw thousands of videos cell phone pictures and social media accounts from the attack and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas moreover we know the Assad regime was responsible in the days leading up to August 21st we know that Assad's chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas could you imagine a distributed gas mass to their true paranoid these two gets and they fired rockets from a regime area fucking all the kids he's killed tap dance on his head all the kids wiped clear about not that's just one part of it but just imagine all the conflict he's engaged in a mortal death Kylie all over the globe it's really gross man if you have to like work on your speech to tell people to go to war kill it you don't to hear what he says only here with a sheet what he says you want to keep going I just want to know if what if we're gonna start buying is guilty we're start bombing he's gonna start doing something I think you might say we're gonna cut I don't know maybe you're right listen to what he's saying there's commit atrocities they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory what about us man but these things happened we burn we did the facts cannot be denied the question now is what the United States of America and the international community is prepared to do about it oh you mean France and Saudi air is what happened to those people to those children no is not only a violation of international law it's also a danger to our security well it's cool that the bombs he's going to drop aren't gonna count let me explain water they don't kill any kids that's like two magnets coming together they'll see a pumpkin me to stop using they actually tells innocent baby bomb is the ban against these weapons roads other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using them cheese ice how overtime orders would again face the prospect honestly we don't attack Syria I'm gonna get some poison gas it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain look it's a free baby you fucking liberal pussy fighting spills beyond seas well a new poison gas pistol that is how someone who was a tea party Manchurian Candidate would react their blood you know bomber wants to be such a fucking pussy how to teach this country lesson on my own cuz none of those terrorists have the balls to fucking go after Americans keep America strong I went after America keep America strong dude I can't listen to it man I'm sure that shit's going to take a long-ass time and then it's going to freak everybody out and it's going to be the subject gasps cushon tomorrow I think it's very unfortunate that we live in this world and to listen to that to think that he could be so free in talking about this sort of moralization is that a word of warfare when we've killed so many fucking people it's just really hard to believe and those numbers that we read off about deaths those are just drones that's just drone deaths the ninety eight versus just droned us it doesn't even factor in how many innocent people were killed in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but yeah and again yeah it is the hypocrisy that it's okay to kill people with fire it's not okay to kill be with gas and this being coming out of the mouths of man who regularly kills people with fire have you seen the video of the the guys the rebels on the street get hit by a missile now pull that shit up Brian they start screaming allahuakbar walk by are not guys we should search for madness um how about Syrian rebels hit with bomb maybe let's say Syrian rebels hip with bomb let me find out it's fucking madness it's a video let's say yeah Syrian rebels umm-hmm people are all listening to this speech right now man we should just be with Syrian rebels almost hit by bomb let them listen man the so this is being recorded it would go on forever now that's not it there's one there's one recent one of these guys in the street and this bomb that's not it our troops are coming home from Afghanistan Afghan Americans want all of us in Washington especially me to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home but I have to kill people back to work educating our kids o our kids now God man's blood Molech Molech demands sacrifice I don't feed the owl God he comes to me in my dreams and if I don't participate in the sacrifice I won't get the mansion they have reserved a mansion for me on a hundred acres I will constantly have okay yeah this is the one throne of diamonds a throne of diamonds wait for me at the end of the black tunnel I must feed the ow God oh yeah what the fuck man really is that what we've come to yeah that's is it man no what now hmm the beaked lord what desires blood if you've is so beautiful his words how do you spell Allah ou akbah uh look at my tattoo was worth 90% of your butthole joke Rob oh I was good you just you just you just gained great ground I can't find this fucking thing these guys yell there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike him prick oh no pal I never end up in one of his pinprick strikes okay the United States military doesn't do pin pricks we're just gonna go down there and pinch be even a limited struggle Assad even no other nation can deliver and nowadays I think we should remove another dictator with force we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next dude but a targeted strike can make Assad or any other dictator think twice before using chemical any dictators are thinking about using chemical weapons right now other questions involve the dangers of retaliation we don't dismiss any threats but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military any other any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day so we're basically saying there we there Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise and our ally Israel can defend itself with overwhelming force we just want to kill these capable unconscious kind of fact the United States of America yeah what is what the fuck is that many of you have asked about well I should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated yeah where as one person wrote to me those who come after Assad maybe enemies of human rights you can write to bottom it's true that some of the sods you listen are extremists he'll listen he'll change but al-qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death we burn them we don't gas a majority of the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition we work with just want to live in peace sleep dignity bro and freedom and the day after any military action we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism Joe Biden beat me at poker he's run Raytheon they sell how Hellfire missiles but I mean listen to what he just said like what we're trying to stomp out is exactly what we're doing I mean the massive amount of hypocrisy we should not be the world's policemen we should be the worst dragon and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions Ryan pull up this video Syrian soldiers my administer hit Syrian rebels by Street crossing we met that's not the one I'm trying to find the right one oh here it is oh damn it it doesn't have a it has a crazy Arab name to it President Putin the Russian this is the video if you could find it in pushing Assad to give up his chemical well give this video the Assad regime is not what these guys are shooting in the street and they get jacked by a missile this is what they're dealing with you got these guys who have guns and like da-da-da-da-da they pull up in a pickup truck Wow and then like we haven't even bigger gun in the pickup truck that they're gonna kick some ass and hmm watch how the shit hits the fan here man siding siding day everyone's about to have these are whose side are we on here I guess we're on the side of the guys are about to get jacked I who knows me watch this shit so they back the guy backs up his truck and they don't even have a chance to respond what watch look at this they're trying to move Christ boom and the guys just screaming Allah Akbar Allah Akbar watch that again back that up again you you're actually controlling it oh sorry Christ how do I do that I don't want to go to another fucking war man one more time we did a good job of filling screen there buddy yeah that's actually really good all right watch this one more time look they sort of realize it's happening like look at them their body language like like they're like oh shit oh shit watch this there you go they're running boom are you fucking kidding man that's an ethical way to blow people up it's way better than camera that was a beautiful thing those guys are lucky that was like being killed by an American Eagle that's like getting killed by gourmet chef double split and so precision the United States doesn't know American men for nearly seven decades I have seven let's he's about to wrap it up yeah doing more than 400 international agreements it has meant enforcing them the burdens of leadership are often heavy I can't get it up unless I'm Caroline Lee's because we have borne them and so to my friends on the right I asked you to reconcile your commitment to America's military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just-okay this stop so he's probably though is he's you is he the worst president we've ever had he's the most disappointing for sure the point is Bush was scary from the jump and he was scary when he was going to war you're scary when who's mispelling words yeah he was always scary but Obama was promising and now he's terrible that was awful that was awful and it was so corny it was so it was like watching that show what was that old show that used to be on jag remember jag was a military show on like NBC or CBS CBS CBS it was like you know it wasn't fucking real clear the good guys bad guys good guys always won yeah everything was it was a webisode of Walker Texas Ranger that's what that was and he we just gave us I look at what I really love is they try to give the illusion that there's such thing as a safe war that's what's really funny is like I'm just gonna stick this stick in the hornet's nest the Hornets can't fly over here you're gonna be fine there'll be no retaliation they can't even retaliate and it still need to work and it's the same kind of retaliation that's Jay ah but how crazy is that how did the idea that you could just retell you could do that and not not face retaliate what if he what if we attack Syria and and Russia decides to put missile shields up now what does oh now we have Obama leading us into fucking World War 3 against that crocodile Putin that's scary that's scary to think about man I don't know man I just I'm so disappointed in the whole way this is laid out or the whole way this is taking place don't do that brah you're gonna get flagged flag for changing its color yeah we get flag terrorist activities yeah we're not flag we're not doing anything wrong goddamn it I pay my taxes you are doing something wrong if you protest against war I can't believe you support a man who would use chemicals to kill children good well let's smoke them out yeah that's been that funny you support the other guy if you don't think that you should ah fire missiles oh now he's leaving the same way came in oh my god nice and dramatic that just that alone all of this really a trickle shit was orchestrated folks I guarantee you there are some people that are involved in this there's some producers there's some there's an artistic director they want that that was a well planned out scene he walks up he walks back the fact that they do in this ancient stupid house where he supposedly lives meanwhile you know he's in some fucking seven mile thick bunker down you know deep into the ground the bowels of the earth where Dick Cheney was hiding all throughout the Iraq war there's just a metal slide he jumps in a chute like a laundry chute he jumps in and slides through and lands and the towels and just dust himself off and surrounded by lizards you were like excellent work yeah spats Batman's lair is Batman's lair son you're right unas oh shit iTunes recording to server get the
