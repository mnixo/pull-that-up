hello freak bitches when we're chipping away at this thing like we know that politicians are doing an act know that they're when you know I've always mocked the way they communicate like the way they give speeches with long pauses and this very distinct pattern of behavior that's completely alien to anything other than a political speech like the only way this country survives you know like that kind of yeah strange thing that they do but when we're always like chipping away at that we're always trying to like get to like be real get we got get we gotta find out what's real and then we get this guy who realer than anyone's ever been yeah and well I will fuck this this is create and it scares us that's the point of that documentary we like to be lied to it makes us all feel calm and comfortable to be given a stable lie than to be shown the real truth of how fucked up and unstable everything you know I mean the trailer has this text over over just like stark footage it's just and it's so scary it's the words are politicians lie to us we know they lie they know we know they lie they just don't care and I thought this always like sent chills down my spine because it's so true and everybody knows it and yet we're all engaged in this willful suspension of disbelief like no no everything's good you know no ever both America is both the greatest country on Earth and it needs to be made great again it's like we're all in this weird like we're unclear on what we're even arguing for guys like to do crazy insane cardio so yes yeah this being some insane cardio ideas no other 78 audio yeah um nick has swam back from alcatraz five times whoa five times as I said twice once he corrected me online he said five now well they can play race ever they compete in triathlons all the time yeah you know my you know my you know my dad actually he was in a plane crash in his early 20s and his off San Francisco I need to swim a couple miles in that water really live yeah holy crashed into the water yeah yeah most people don't know that it's so oh it's pretty crazy heat and I'm going to I'm going to butcher the details but you know from grown tech news exactly but what happened was he was in the army and it was right around the time the Korean War was starting and he was there flying there doing a routine flight or something and they had to crash-land in the ocean whoa and it was getting night and I I believed I believe the pilot died and I could be wrong on that the pilot died but is the other guy he was with survived so him and him and this other guy they were swimming to shore and they got split up it was getting dark at night and so the now they're swimming alone and anyone who knows you know San Francisco it's cold yeah yeah definitely definitely jazz water dump dump dump dump dump that's what they breed yeah early yeah great whites breed in Northern California there's like a nesting ground up there yeah fucking now where you want to crash a plane there now when you want to swim from Alcatraz five times either in your underwear I know that's correct yeah I guess I've heard of that race yeah but yeah that's crazy done oh yeah Wow so dude Anna swim two miles yeah some like that name or I could have been more I mean fuck but it was a long I'm good for a couple hundred yards yes it means that I started looking for a log to hang on to I and what is the difference in the results from someone who does that because I know quite a few people have done it that way they've had injuries treated where they suck the fat out there isn't any any research to differentiate like one of these treatments versus another yet which is not available so it's all anecdotal in terms of like talking to patients it's happening I mean people are collecting the data but it was not you know it's not at the mature stage where you know where it's available and we have you know published stuff to look at and you personally know of anybody has had really good results using the fat method yes actually a physician friend of mine in Memphis Tennessee her name's dr. Laurel Enderman she has utilized that quite a bit and she's been very happy with the patients that she's treated and naturally some people do better than others right you know the real the rigorous study of this though is still yet to come hmm it's that's really fascinating like be have you considered trying that are you just definitely yeah but you don't so far you just do the UM so having had anybody specifically request it and maybe want to lose a little fat and fix their knees yeah I mean that's that's probably taking things in a direction I don't want to be going but but plastic surgery there are we know you know there are a number of different options in terms of where these sources of the cells can come from bone marrow is certainly had a lot of use and Kenyan Columbia has that done that's a he told me yeah he had it pulled out of his hip and he said it was brutally painful then he was walking with a limp for like two weeks it's obviously it's a procedure there's pain and there's you know morbidity there's a consequence to you know putting a sharp object into the bone and drawing more bitterly yeah so I mean is a bad thing I don't like that word now it's we don't like it either in medicine morbid as we have outward we have conferences called morbidity and mortality and that's where you basically own up to things that you've done a terrible job with or explain you know why somebody has died as a result of your care who and it's a awful thing to go through and it's critically important to be able to evaluate yourself and understand what things happen when they don't go the way that we want them to so it's an important exercise that physicians go through to you know review cases so I can only imagine yeah you know I mean especially if you're dealing with people that are broken apart I mean essentially as an orthopedic surgeon you're dealing with people whose bodies have failed right your limbs have failed ligaments have torn off the bone knees have exploded I mean you've told me some gnarly stuff in terms of the kind of injuries that you had to treat and I could only imagine some of that things yeah yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
